1/ The US Dollar/Rupee exchange rate is subject to change. Conversions
in this report have been made at US$1.00 to Rs 10.80, which represents
the projected exchange rate over the disbursement period.
2/ The metric system has been used in most cases. However, India is still
in the process of transition to the metric system; non-metric units are
still widely used and have been used in this report where a conversion
to the metric system may confuse the reader.

risk to the existing irrigated areas; (b) modernize
the distribution system serving about 43,000 ha with
lined channels down to and including watercourses; (c)
construct augmentation ttibevells on the lined
distributaries to supplement surface water supplies;
(d) undertake a reconnaissance drainage study for the
UGC command area and a 1etailed drainage study and
pilot works program within the distributary blocks to
be modernized; (e) initiate construction of a modern
canal communication system; (f) construct one small
hydro-electric station on the main canal and initiate
the civil works of another station; (g) set up a water

program; train project staff, provide study tours,
visits and technical assistance; and Ci) provide
vehicles, plant and equipment for the construction
and managment of the project.
The project would alleviate risks to the existing
irrigated area and increase agricultural production
and the standard of living of farmers in UP. Possible

INDIA
UPPER GANGA IRRIGATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Staff Appraisal Report
I. BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01    The State of Uttar Pradesh (UP), located in the northern central part
of India, is well endowed with water resources (Map IBRD 17646R). However,
only about two-fifths of the cropped area is irrigated in spite of large
public investments in surface water and tubewell irrigation as well as rapid
private groundwater development. Consequently, the Government of Uttar
Pradesh (GOUP) has placed great emphasis on the acceleration of irrigation in
recent Five-Year Plans. In western UP, available surface water resources
have been fully committed. Groundwater development has been carried out
aggressively by both the private and public sectors and this resource is now
fairly highly exploited.  Further expansion of agricultural production tbere-
fore will depend mainly on improved efficiency and performance of existing
irrigation systems. The proposed Upper Ganga Irrigation Modernization
Project would focus on this requirement.
Agriculture and IrriRation in India
1.02    India has a population of about 700 M (mid-1982) which is growing
at an annual rate of about 2.0. Since 1960, per capita income grew at an
annual rate of 1.4Z and reached US$240 in 1979/80. Although the average per
capita income has increased and access to public services has improved,
growth has been too slow to bring about more than a gradual reduction in the
incidence of poverty. Accordingly, GOI's development plans give priority to
alleviating poverty and creating employment, especially in rural areas.
1.03    Agriculture is the dominant sector of the Indian economy and con-
tributes about 40% of GNP.  It engages about 70Z of the labor force and
provides the base for about 55% of India's exports. During the last decade,
GOI has devoted considerable attention to agriculture in its development
plans. To support agricultural growth, GOI has: (i) accelerated irrigation
development through modernization of existing schemes and construction of new
schemes; and (ii) improved agricultural supporting services to optimize the
use of land and water resources.
1.04    Irrigation was given the highest priority from the beginning of the
planning era in 1950.  Some 52.6 M ha of irrigated command were developed
by 1979/80, about 58% of which is from surface water sources and 422 from
groundwater. Irrigated areas are almost four times as productive as rainfed
areas and they account for about 60% of all agricultural output in India.
More significantly, the expansion of irrigation facilities and the increased
productivity on irrigated lands have together accounted for at least
three-quarters of the agricultural growth since 1960. The potential area
developed for irrigation is expected to reach 66.2 M ha by the end of
1985/86, of which 56% will be from surface water sources and 44% from
groundwater. With little idle land left, only limited increase is expected
I                                               't                 I

in the net sown area in the future. The main increase in agricultural
production will have to come from full utilization of potential area
developed for irrigation (from double cropping, improvemenLs in agricultural
practices, water management and the use of fertilizers and pesticides). In
most completed projects, actual irrigated areas are less than planned and
yields have been much lower than originally forecast. GOI and the State
Governments are aware of the challenge and are seeking solutions to the dual
problem of low irrigation intensities and poor crop yields.
1.05    Irrigation projects of the 1950s and 60s typically involved a storage
or diversion dam and only the main conveyance system, leaving the farmers
to construct the distribution system from project outlets to individual
fields. In most projects, farmers were unable to finance or organize con-
struction of the minor channels without outside assistance and this was
rarely available. This resulted in considerable delays in the utilization of
water from the irrigation potential created.
1.06    In the early 1970s, the concept of the Command Area Development
Authority (CADA) evolved. Its objectives were to coordinate the State
irrigation and agriculture activities and to assist farmers in obtaining
institutional credit for the construction of the minor irrigation systems and
for land development. The results of this approach have been below expeota-
tions. Coordination was not entirely effective, and the attempt to finance
on-farm development through institutional credit was generally unsuccessful.
Farmers had no confidence in the reliability of water supply and were there-
fore reluctant to undertake loan obligations, since no facility or framework
for effective group action had been developed. This experience indicates
that (i) more emphasis is needed on improving the efficiency and reliability
of the conveyance system from the water source to the irrigation outlets;
and (ii) Government should assume responsibility for conveying water much
closer to the farmgate. There are clear indications that when individual
farmers are fully confident of their water supply, increased cooperation
results and they will undertake investments in other agricultural inputs and
make full use of the water supplied. These concepts have been used in the
design of the proposed project.
The State of Uttar Pradesh
1.07    Salient Features.  The State of Uttar Pradesh (UP) has a population
of about 111 M (1981). This makes it the most populous State in India
accounting 5or 16% of total population, whereas its geographical area
(298,000 km ) covers 9% of the country. The population density is extremely
high at 377 persons per km2.  About two thirds of all farm holdings in UP are
below 1.0 ha as compared to about 50% for the nation.
1.08    By most traditional indicators, UP is one of the least advanced
States in India. The literacy rate (27.4%; 1981) is lower than the national
average of 36.0%. The number of doctors and health centers per 1,000 persons
is among the lowest in India. Although the State is well connected to the
rest of India through national highways, railways and airways, the
intra-State communication system is inadequate. The provision of potable
water has been slow. At present, water supply schemes are being implemented



-3-
in about 202 of the villages which lack an adequate source of drinking water.
The Bank Group is supporting GOUP in water supply schemes through the
on-going Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Cr. 585-IN;
US$40 M).
1.09    The Economy.  The economy of UP is predominantly agrarian with
agriculture contributing about 56% of the State income and employing about
782 of the work force. Between 1960/61 and 1976/77, the rate of growth of
the primary sector, including agriculture, forestry and mining was only 1.7Z
per annum (p.a.) compared to an all-India average of 2.02. Similarly, the
secondary sector, including manufacturing, construction, electricity, gas and
water supply (152 of the State income), only grew at 22 p.a., which was half
the national rate of 4%. The performance of the tertiary sector, including
transport, trade, finance and services (30Z of the State income), fared
bette-r at 42 growth p.a. However, since tertiary sector activities started
from a relatively small base and were concentrated mostly in the urban areas,
their rapid growth contributed only marginally to majority of population
(822) living in the rural areas. As a result of poor performance of the
primary and secondary sectors, State income grew at an annual rate of 2.2Z
p.a., well below the national rate of 3.12.   Per capita income only
increased by 0.52 p.a. and was one of the lowest in India (Rs. 981 in
1979/80), compared to the national average of Rs. 1,267. Since agriculture
is the main activity in the State and it has close links to other sectors,
economic progress is largely dependent on the removal of constraints to
further agricultural growth, particularly through the expansion of irriga-
tion.
1.10    Employment and Rural Poverty.  The labor force constitutes about 312
of the population of UP. Its participation rate is significantly higher in
rural areas (31.42) than in urban areas (27.72). Cultivators and agricul-
tural laborers account for 652 and 22.82 of the rural labor force, respec-
tively. Because of the slow growth of agriculture and manufacturing, produc-
tive employment has failed to keep pace with population growth. The poor
performance of the agricultural sector also resulted in a sharp rise in the
proportion of rural population living below the poverty line (currently about
US$90 per capita per annum) from 41.62 in 1960161 to 63.62 in 1970/71.
According to the National Sample Survey in 1973/74, about two-thirds of the
rural population in UP lived below the poverty level and an estimated 90Z of
agricultural laborers are witbin this group. A series of programs have been
created to raise standards of living of rural poor, including measures to
secure tenants' rights, land redistribution and public works programs. These
programs have had limited success due to the intrinsic difficulties of the
problem, faulty planning and poor implementation.
1.11    ARricultural Performance (Table T-1).  From the comencement of the
First Five-Year Plan (1950/51 to 1977/78), foodgrain production grew only at
about 22 p.a., barely keeping pace with population growth. Rice and wheat
production accounted for most of this growth while coarse grains stagnated
and pulse production declined. The performance of non-foodgrain crops such
as oilseeds, sugarcane and potato fared better at 3.1Z, 3.5% and 5.5% growth
p.a., respectively. However, since these are minor crops, their rapid rates



-4-
of growth do not significantly affect the overall performance of the agricul-
tural sector.
1.12    The early years after Independence were characterized by both area
expansion and yield increases for most crops. Between 1950/51 and 1960/61,
rice and wheat production (major cereals in the State) grew at respectable
rates of 5.2Z and 4.8X pa. respectively. In the 1960s, the agricultural
scene changed significantly with increases in production of most crops due
largely to riLing yields; wheat and maize production grew at 9.92 and 9.72
p.a, respectively. Oilseeds and sugarcane production only grew at 3.72 and
1.02 p.a., respectively. Gain in potato production was spectacular at 102
p.a., resulting from both area expansion (4.32 p.a.) and yield increases
(5.62 p.a.). The impressive performance of most crops, except rice and
sugarcane, during this period was largely due to the introduction of hig8
yielding varieties and accelerated development of private tubewells in the
latter part of the 1960s.
1.13    The transformation in rice production seemed to lag a few years
behind wheat. From 1971 to 1978, rice production improved significantly,
growing at 4.72 p.a., slightly above wheat production (4.12). Production of
areas under otber cereal crops such as maize and barley declined. Cash crops
performed well during this period, groving at 4-5X p.a. Production of oil-
seeds and sugarcane improved significantly, with growths of 4.22 and 4.42
p.a., respectively. Potato production maintained its earlier momentum,
growing at 9.52 p.s.
1.14    Irritation Development. The State is well endowed with water resour-
ces. Nevertbeless, only about 8.9 N ha (522) of the total net cultivated
area of 17.0 M ha was irrigated in 1979180. Between 1950/51 and the onset of
the Green Revolution, surface and groundwater development contributed equally
to the expansion of irrigated areas. However, since 1965/66, groundwater
development has accounted for virtually all increases in net irrigated area.
In 1979/80, about 5.7 M ha (642) of the total net irrigated area was supplied
with groundwater compared to 2.8 N ha provided by large scale surface water
irrigation schemes. The remainder is served by storage tanks or by pump lift
schemes from rivers. Progress of irrigation development in terms of net
irrigated area in the State since 1950151 is shown below:

1.15    About 10.4 N ha or 402 of the gross cropped area (25.0 M ha) is
presently irrigated and wheat accounts for the largest share of the expansion
of irrigated area since Independence. The general trend for major crops has
been as follows:

1.16    Power SuDly and Demand  Uttar Pradesh is well endowed with natural
resources for generating power. However, due to limited financial resources,
the State has only installed 3,710 MW of generation of which about 30% is
provided by hydel schemes and the balance by thermal stations. Per capita
generation of electricity was about 115 kWh in 1979/80 compared to an
all-India average of 164 kWh. Per capita consumption of electricity rose
from about 7 kWh/annum at the commencement of the First Five-Year Plan (1951)
to 87 kWh/annum by 1579/80. This still lags behind the national average of
130 kWh/annum per capita. The progress of rural electrification has been
slow and presently only about one-third of the villages has electric power.
1.17    Agriculture accounts for about 34% of the total energy consumption
in the State. Public tubewells account for about 15% of the energy used in
the agricultural sector (i.e., 4% of total statewide energy use). The rapid
expansion of private tubewells over the last two decades has resulted in an
ever-increasing (and difficult to control) demand on the power transmission
capacity in rural areas. The consequence is that rural power availability
now averages about eight hours supply per day with large variations in both
running hours per day and quality of the supply depending on location within
the State.
II. THE PROJECT AREA AND PRESENT DEVELOPMENT
Salient Features
2.01    Location. The Upper Ganga Canal (UGC) system lies between the Ganga
and Yamuna Rivers in western UP and covers 10 of the 57 administrative dis-
tricts of the State. The southern boundary of the project is the alignment
of the Lower Ganga main canal (Map IBRD 17648R).
2.02    Climate.  The project area has a sub-tropical monsoon climate charac-
terized by wet, hot summers and relatively warm dry winters (Table T-2).
Average annual rainfall varies from about 1050 mm in the northern part of the
project area to about 650 mm in the southwest (Map IBRD 17647R). The south-
western monsoon, which contributes nearly 80% of the annual rainfall, nor-
mally starts in mid-June and generally withdraws by the end of September.



-6-
The monsoon shows considerable annual variations in amounts and distribution
of precipitation and the times of onset and termination are also uncertain.
Long dry spells may occur within the rainy season. Uncertainty regarding
amount and distribution of rainfall makes irrigation a prerequisite for
successful crop production even during the monsoon season. The winter season
of December to February has mean minimum daily temperatures in the range of
6-100C. This is followed by very hot and dry weather in May and June with
daily maximums exceeding 410C.
2.03    Topography and Soils.  Tne project area is gently undulating except
for the northern part where the streams from the Shivalik foothills are
deeply incised. Ground elevation falls from about 280 m above mean sea level
(m.s.l.) in the north to about 150 m above m.s.l. in the south. Natural
drainage is provided by numerous streams which flow roughly north to south
into the '-cundary rivers. Within the project area, there are low lands or
'khadars' formed where the rivers used to meander in the past. Most khadars
have saline soils but are generally underlain by fresh groundwater.
2.04    The soils of the project area are alluvial.  In Saharanpur and Meerut
districts, they are deep, dark grey, loam to loamy sands. In the southern
part (Mainpuri district), they are slightly acidic loams and sandy loans.
Saline and alkaline efflorsences, known as 'usar' and 'reh' occur in Aligarh,
Mainpuri and Etah districts (5-6% of the CCA) but are not major problems.
Fertility levels are medium to high.
2.05    Land Use.  The UGC system has a gross command area of about 1.95 M ha
of which the net commandable area is about 0.98 1 ha.  About 0.58 M ha is non
cultivable; of the remaining 0.39 M ha about 0.13 M ha is commanded by direct
irrigation public tubewells and 0.26 M ha will be served by the Madhya Ganga
Canal system presently under construction (para 2.10).
2.06    Population. Land Holdinus and Land Tenure.  Rural population density
is about 470 persons per km4. The lowest densities occur in Mathura district
(324) and the highest in Ghaziabad district (506). The average farm size in
the project area is about 0.8 ha which is considerably smaller than the State
average of 1.2 ha. Holdings of less than 2 ha account for about 77% of the
number of farms but only 36% of the total area. There are a variety of land
tenure arrangements. An Act in the-early 1950s abolished intermediate
tenancy and provided security of -.enure to former tenants. In 1961, a second
Act imposed a ceiling on rural landholdings with the specific aim of achiev-
ing greater equality in the landholdings of individual cultivators. However,
legal loopholes, coupled with enforcement difficulties, have meant that this
Act has been ineffective in achieving its objective. In 1971, the land
reform issue was reopened but so far has remained unresolved.
2.07    Roads.  The National Highway system crosses the project area from
Delhi towards Dehra Dun to the north, Lucknow to the east and southwards
towards Aligarh. There is also an extensive State highway network which is,
like the National Highways, reasonably well maintained. District Council and
village roads connect the smaller towns and villages to the State and
National road grid but many are unsurfaced and not motorable after prolonged



-7-
rain in the monsoon season. Unsurfaced roads are generally always usable by
animal transport, the principal means of moving farm produce.' The heaviest
burden placed on the road system is during sugarcane harvest but, since the
rainfall at that time is very low, there is no need for additional road
building or upgrading under the project.
Water Resources and Utilization
2.08    Water Resources.  The project area is wholly contained within the
drainage basin of the river Ganga system 1/ which is both an international
(Nepal, China, Bangladesh and India) and an inter-state (seven Indian States)
river. Evaluation of the hydrology and existing development on the Ganga
shows that the proposed project is not harmful to the interests of other
riparians in terms of disputes presently recorded (Annex 7, SDV). The UGC
takes off the river Ganga at Hardwar, where the upstream catchment is about
3% of the Ganga basin. The a nual average river flow at the project diver-
sion point is about 17,500 Mm (14.19 MAF); all low flow of the jiver
(October to May) is diverted into the UGC system (about 2,150 Mm ). In the
high flow period (June to September), diversion into the UGC is governed by
main canal capacity agd averages about 2,750 Nm3 with diversions in the zaid
season about 1,770 Mm .
2.09    Surface Irrigation.  The UGC was constructed during 1830-54 and was
the first large scale irrigation project in Uttar Pradesh. Originally it was
designed to divert dry season flows from the river Ganga to provide protec-
tive irrigation in the rabi season. The design of the system reflects the
technical requirements and capabilities as well as the social needs and
objectives of 19th century India. Piecemeal improvements have been made over
the years, but no overall modernization program has been undertaken to ensure
the most efficient-use of the available water supplies. The UGC system was
originally supplied from temporary diversions until 1920, when the first
diversion weir (Bhimgoda Barrage) was completed. Bhingoda Barrage is now
being replaced by a modern structure due to be completed in 1984/85. The
original diversion discharge of the UGC was 189 cumecs (6,750 cusecs) but
this has been progressively increased to about 294 cumecs. The system con-
sists of about 6,540 km of canals with a nominal design duty of about
1 cfs/100 ha. Under present conditions, the system can provide barely two
irrigations during the rabi season when river water supplies are low. In
kharif, canal water supplies generally exceed demand except at the start and
end of the season.
2.10    In addition to the UGC system, along the length of the river Ganga
that forms a boundary of the UGC command area, there are (existing, under
construction or planned) five other major canal systems with a combined
diversion capacity of about 1,204 cumecs. The geographical location of these
developments near the project area is shown schematically on Chart C-1.  The
j] The Ganga basin is one of the world's largest watersheds, covering about
one million Km2, of which about 85% is within India and forms about 26%
of India's territory.



-8-
existing Lower Ganga canal (238 cumecs) and the Parallel Lower Ganga canal
(126 cumecs) take off from the Ganga on the right bank at Narora Barrage and
form the southern boundary of the UGC project area (Map IBRD 17648R). The
Madhya Ganga (I) canal (232 cumecs) is under construction and cuts through
the project area to serve about 0.26 M ha which is presently unirrigated; in
addition, the MGC augments water supplies to some parts of the UGC command
area only in the kharif season when the river Ganga is in flood. On the left
bank, at Bhimgoda Barrage, the Eastern Ganga canal (134 cumecs) is under
construction. Also planned on the left bank of the Ganga is the Madhya Ganga
(II) canal (190 cumecs). Upstream of Bhimgoda Barrage, GOUP has the Tehri
dam (live storage about 2,590 Mm ) under construction; in addition, Kotli
Behl and Utyasu storage projects are at an advanced planning stage. These
three storage schemes are power/irrigation projects but water releases from
storage will probably be governed by hydro-power requirements.
2.11    Over the years, farmers in the upper third of the UGC system have
taken more than their fair share of water supplies and are growing substan-
tial areas of sugarcane (about 0.2 N ha). This inequitable water distribu-
tion has now become an established water right and is supported by a heavy
investment in sugar processing facilities. The water right cannot be changed
or corrected. Thus an essential objective of the rehabilitation of the UGC
system would be to generate additional water supplies for tail end users who
receive a poor irrigation service, in both qualitative and quantitative
terms. Additional water sources available within the UGC system would result
from:  (i) reduction of seepage losses in the unlined co veyance system which
at present averages about 2.6 cumecs/Mm (8.5 cusecs/Mft ) of wetted canal
surface; (ii) improvement in the operational efficiency; and (iii) develop-
ment of groundwater for conjunctive use with surface water supplies.
2.12    At present, operational losses are substantial since there are inade-
quate control structures to regulate and manage the flow. Once irrigation
starts, the system runs with little change in regime except occasionally to
respond to heavy rainfall. The ungated pipe outlets are easily tampered with
and do not provide constant flows or equitable distribution of water to the
areas served. Below the outlets, water 'istribution is inefficient since
the 'warabundi' system (para 5.09) cannot effectively function given the
condition of the watercourse channels. The unreliable timing and quality of
the irrigation service has resulted in a breakdown of basic discipline which
should be enforced by the Irrigation Department (ID). A number of outlet
studies in the UGC command area confirm that farmers at the head of the
system and near the outlets draw considerably more water than those less
favorably located.
2.13    Groundwater (Annex 8, SDV).  The project area is underlain by
alluvial deposits which form a single, though heterogenous, aquifer system
which can exceed 1,000 m in thickness in some parts. Aquifers are formed
by beds of sand which interfinger with beds of silt, clay and kankar. The
aquifer system is recharged mainly by rainfall, percolation from canals, and
field losses. Runoff is by seepage to the main natural drains which form
line-sinks for groundwater effluent. Depletion of groundwater also occurs
through evaporation from shallow water tables and by extraction by private



-9-
and public wells. Underflow due to the regional hydraulic gradient forms a
relatively small part of the water balance.
2.14    A comprehensive groundwater study of the UGC command area was under-
taken during project preparation. The mean annual recharge is estimated to
be about 6,200 MmW. Net extraction by various types of tubewells and dug-
wells amounted to about 3,800 Mm in 1980/81 or some 612 of the groundwater
resources. Thus, the prospect for further groundwater development in the
project area is good. Groundwater resources, estimated conservatively,
indicate that existing groundwater development and that proposed under the
project would still use only about 62% of exploitable amounts. Thus project
requirements of groundwater resources would be ensured.
2.15    Most of the water contained by the alluvial aquifer system has less
than 700 parts per million (ppm) dissolved solids. There are considerable
areas of better quality water with dissolved solids falling as low as
250 ppm. There are few pockets of water with high chloride concentrations
(in excess of 250 ppm Cl) but their localities are well defined and could be
avoided by project tubewells. As the pumped groundwater developed under the
project would be blended with surface water in the canals in proportions of
about 1:5, water quality problems are not foreseen.
Present ARricultural Development (Annex 9, SDV)
2.16    Crops.  The three crop seasons are the zaid (hot) season (roughly
from mid-March to the end of June), the kharif (wet) season (July-October),
and the rabi (dry) season (November-March). Apart from a small area under
orchards, the only perennial crop is sugarcane which occupies between 36% to
14% of the CCA in the five northern administrative districts (the sugarcane
zone) and 5% to 1% in the five southern districts. This pattern has emerged
because rainfall in the northern districts is higher, and the limited zaid
water supply, essential to sustain a perennial crop, is mainly diverted into
the upper part of the UGC scheme. The pattern is now institutionalized by
the extensive processing facilities in the northern districts. There is
greater uniformity in the area devoted to seasonal crops; irrigated wheat
averages about 30% of the CCA in the northern districts and about 26% in the
southern districts. Other rabi crops vary between 14% and 20%. Rice growing
increases inversely to the sugarcane area (8% in the north, 30% in the south)
and is the second choice for using kharif water. Other irrigated kharif
crops occupy 43% in the north and 16% in the south. Zaid (hot season) crop-
ping intensities are very low because of unreliable and limited water supply:
fodder, pulse crops and some maize are usually grown.
2.17    Farmers have only minimal fallow areas in both rabi and kharif
seasons. In kharif, they select a crop mix that enables them to plant almost
100% of their area either with a grain (pearl millet, sorghum and maize)
which usually receives little or no irrigation, or rice which has to be fully
irrigated and a fodder crop (sorghum, pulses). In rabi, by adjusting the
relative areas of wheat, barley and chickpeas (gram), farmers spread avail-
able water over most of their cultivable land. The only exception are areas
where infiltration rates are low and irrigation supplies are insufficient to
grow rice. These are the 'usar' lands, mostly occurring in the tail-end



-10-
distributary commands (para 2.04), and usually earmarked as village grazing
areas; usar lands can be readily reclaimed.
2.18    Crop Yields.  Present yield levels of principal crops, while showing
considerable variation between the better and less efficient farmers, compare
well to averages obtained in adjacent States:
Project Area     Puniab      Haryana
…                ----------- ton/ha…------    -
rice               2.1             2.9         2.7
wheat              2.1             2.7          2.3
sugarcane         43.0            56.5        40.0
At present rice generally receives lower investments per unit area, less atten-
tion to details of cultivation, and limited attention by research and extension
services.
Agricultural Supporting Services
2.19    Agricultural Research.  State Agricultural Universities are responsible
for basic and applied agricultural research; C.S. Pant Agricultural University
in Pantnagar and the C.S. Azad Agricultural University in Kanpur serve the
Meerut and Agra administrative divisions respectively.  Present research
programs cover all branches of agriculture but focus mainly on use of fer-
tilizer, pest control and crop varieties.  Notable achievements include
development and popularization of sugarcane varieties that continue to give
high recovery rates throughout an extended crushing season.  The Universities
pay less attention to water management and maximization of crop yields under
farmers' existing constraints of water availability. LimiCed work on cultural
practices has concentrated more on developing techniques suitable for trac-
tor-drawn than for animal-drawn equipment. The Department of Agriculture (DA)
is responsible for adaptive research and has ten regional agricultural testing
and demonstration stations throughout UP. The State also maintains an Irriga-
tion Research Institute at Roorke and a Horticultural Research Station at
Saharanpur. Central Government Research Institutes for sugarcane, grasslands
and soil conservation are located outside the project area at Lucknow, Jhansi
and Dehra Dun, respectively. Research facilities are currently being expanded
under the Bank supported National Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 855-IN,
US$27.OM).
2.20    Agricultural Extension.  Technically, agricultural extension is the
responsibility of the DA. However, the primary contacts with the farmers - the
multipurpose village level workers (VLW) - are under the administrative control
of the Block Development Officer of the Department of Community Development
(CD). On technical matters, VLWs receive guidance from staff of the District
Agriculture Office who are employees of the DA. In general, there are about 10
VLWs per block, covering about 25,000 to 30,000 ha (or one VLW for every 3,000
farm families). The present extension system is inadequate since: (i) exten-
sion services are poorly planned and supervised; (ii) VLWs have too many
responsibilities and are assigned to cover too large an area; (iii) linkages



-11-
with research and training are weak; and (iv) VLWs suffer from restricted
mobility and inadequate housing. The GOUP is aware of the shortcomings and
outdated nature of the existing extension service and has under active con-
sideration, the introduction of the Training and Visit (T&V) system (para
3.28).
2.21    Agricultural Inputs.  There is a well developed system for distribu-
tion and sale of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds throughout the project
area. Fertilizers are marketed mainly by the private sector; the DA sells
only about 1OX of the fertilizer used. Fertilizer consumption growth rate is
about 9% per annum and now exceeds 50 kg of nutrients per cropped ha. Pes-
ticide use is limited, with sugarcane and to a lesser extent rice as the main
users. The sales points are usually the same as for fertilizers and the
existing network would be adequate for the project needs. Improved seeds are
produced and marketed by the DA and by the Bank-supported Terai Seeds Cor-
poration (Ln. 614-IN; US$13.0 M). The main market is for hybrid pearl millet
seed and wheat. Some of the HYV rice seed sold by the cooperatives, usually
once or twice grown certified seed, is of poor quality.
2.22    Agricultural Credit.  Institutional credit organization follows the
normal pattern for India. There are about 1200 primary cooperative credit
societies and 54 branches of the State Land Development Bank (SLDB) within
the UGC command area. The cooperative banks, which provide short and medium
term loans mainly for agricultural inputs, are organized with the State
Cooperative Bank at the State level and 55 branch banks at the district
level. The SLDBs operate through their branches and affiliated offices in
%tehsils' (sub-district) and Block headquarters and handle long term credit
(up to 15 years). Commercial banks also have an important role in agricul-
tural lending (about 15Z). Despite this extensive credit network, growth in
actual cash terms has been negative over the last few years. Overdues of
cooperative banks are presently about one-quarter of the demand and statewide
recovery performance of the SLDB in 1981-82 was about 66%. In general, there
is no serious credit constraints but the recovery performance give grounds
for concern.
2.23    Farm Power.  There are about 5,000 tractors and nearly one million
pair of oxen and draft buffaloes in the project area, or about one HP of
draft power per ha of cultivable land. Tractor sales are in excess of
machines being scrapped. The condition of the animals is adequate because of
ample fodder production and the large amount of available stover and straw.
Therefore, there is not likely to be a draft power shortage within the
project area. About 200,000 private tubewells (PTWs) use the easily
exploitable shallow aquifers and are an important contribution to the area's
productivity. About two-thirds of the PTWs are in the southern one-third of
the area, principally due to the inadequate and erratic canal water supplies.
The wells are used mainly in the rabi and zaid seasons but also provide
supplementary water supply during kharif. The motors of PTWs provide an
important source of power for other farm activities such as threshing.
2.24    Marketinx. Processing and Storage.  Marketing in UP is regulated
under the Agricultural Produce Market Act (1964); marketable surplus is
traded in main wholesale markets and sub-yards throughout the project area.



-12-
In general, marketing facilities have matched the increasing crop production
for most farm products. Foodgrains in excess of intra-State demand are
procured by GOI agencies or bought by private traders. Oilseed crops and
pulses find a ready market; the constraint to expanding trade is the limited
supply, not demand. Processing facilities are adequate for all the common
crops grown. There are 26 industrial sugarmills and nearly 800 jaggery
(khandasari) mills, mainly located in the sugarcane zone. Flour milling and
rice husking are well developed both as a cottage and large-scale industry.
The standard of rice husking is good, especially for processing the
high-value, long-grained scented (Basmati) rice. Storage, which is adequate
in both the public and private sector, is provided by three main agencies:
the State Warehousing Corporation; the Central Warehousing Corporation; and
the State Marketing Federation. In addition, some cooperatives also have
godowns. The Bank Group is presently financing The Second Fooodgrain Storage
Project (Cr. 747-IN; US$107 M) in UP (among other States in India) and
another storage project is being financed by the European Economic Community.
III. THE PROJECT
Proiect Formulation
3.01    By the mid 1970s, GOUP had recognized that the UGC system was reach-
ing the end of its effective life span. The original planning and design
objectives of the scheme could not be adapted to meet requirements of modern
irrigated agriculture without major rehabilitation. Furthermore, an impor-
tant inequity in water supply has developed through extensive sugarcane
cultivation in the upper part of the project area. This has made the irriga-
tion service to the lower part of the command even more unreliable and
untimely because of the reduced water supply. Since all the dependable water
resources in the river Ganga have been committed in western UP, GOUP has
recognized that the only way to provide additional supplies is from within
existing canal command areas. To reduce the present inequities, GOUP has
decided that water supplies resulting from savings or additions would be
passed down the system to the areas which are under-supplied at present.
3.02    Preliminary project preparation was carried out by the technical
departments of GOUP in close coordination with the Central Water Commission
(CWC) of GOI. In August 1979, GOI and GOUP decided to approach the Bank
regarding a possible UP Composite Irrigation Project to modernize the UGC,
LGC and Agra Canal systems. A consultancy firm, Water and Power Consultancy
Services (India) Ltd., (WAPCOS), New Delhi, India, was retained to prepare
the Project Feasibility Report. An Identification Report was produced in
November 1980, followed by a comprehensive UGC Feasibility Report in December
1982. On the basis of these reports, it was decided to restrict the proposed
project to the UGC system and also to exclude the main canal headworks, so
that the project would be strictly a rehabilitation and modernization opera-
tion and not a new diversion scheme.
3.03    Project Obiectives.  The main project objectives are (i) risk aver-
sion; (ii) rehabilitation and modernization of the system and using the



-13-
savings resulting from lining canals and improvements in the operational
characteristics of the canal system to increase the commanded area;
(iii) supplement water supply through conjunctive use of groundwater with
surface water supplies; and (iv) improvement of the State's capability to
plan, design and manage irrigation schemes. An additional objective of the
first time slice is to maximize benefits from the sunk investment in the
Madhya Ganga (I) Canal system, which physically interrelates with the UGC
system (para 2.10). Agricultural development needed to realize project
benefits have been identified and would be implemented outside the project
(para 3.28). An agreement has been reached with GOUP that it would carry out
the planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance of the
project works in accordance with standards and criteria acceptable to IDA.
3.04    Justification for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project will be
the first in the State which attempts a comprehensive rehabilitation and
modernization of a major existing irrigation system. The technologies and
implementation procedures will be novel since, in addition to a major con-
struction program, the existing irrigation service must be maintained to
protect present benefits. The first time slice will demonstrate how this can
be done. It will also have important sectoral implications since there are
several other major canals system in UP which need to be modernized (para
3.02). In addition, the project will assist the Irrigation Department (ID)
to develop its capabilities for planning, design, monitoring and evaluation
of completed works both in terms of quantity and quality of irrigation serv-
ice and agricultural benefits. In this respect, Bank involvement during the
project preparation stage has already resulted in considerable cost savings
through more effective planning and design. It has also focussed Govern-
ment's attention on operation and maintenance of existing works which, except
for establishment costs, are considerably underfunded. The most important
justification for Bank involvement in the project is to emphasize the
priority that GOUP must give to rehabilitation and modernization of existing
irrigation schemes if the State's present irrigation potential is to be
translated into agricul:ural benefits. Although the priority had been recog-
nized at the technical and administrative levels of Government, allocation of
scarce development budget to existing irrigated areas has had, until this
project, little priority politically since it is more attractive to propose
and start new irrigation schemes.
Water SuDplP and Demand
3.05    The water supply for the UGC scheme is obtained from run-of-the river
flows which are subject to seasonal and annual variations. Surface water
availability, calculated from long-term streamflow records (Annex 7, SDV),
has therefore been based on the 75% dependable flow in river Ganga estimated
for each cropping season. Groundwater availability has been estimated using
a comprehensive groundwater model which was completed during project prepara-
tion (para 2.14). Crop water requirements have been calculated in accordance
with FAO Publication No. 24 utilizing the modified Penman method of estimat-
ing potential evapotranspiration and related to expected cropping patterns
for the project's various agro-climatic zones. Water balance studies take
into account the historical right of the UGC system to divert water from the
river Ganga, effective rainfall, reliable groundwater supplies, and the



-14-
estimated demand for irrigation, domestic and industrial water supplies.
These studies show that potential irrigation demand will always exceed supply
within the UGC command area, except for a short period in the kharif season
(July to September) when the river is in flood. Thus conjunctive use of
groundwater within the UGC scheme will be important, since it will
(i) enable variations inherent in existing surface water supply to be
reduced; (ii) help alleviate local groundwater drainage problems where they.
exist; and (iii) in particular, complement insufficient surface supplies for
the rice crop (especially for rice nurseries) which occur before river flows
increase significantly in June/July.
3.06    In addition to the UGC system, there are (existing, under construc-
tion or planned) five other major canals, with a combined diversion capacity
of about 43,000 cusecs along the stretch of the Ganga River that forms a
boundary of the UGC command area. Historical flow data indicate that there
is insufficient dependable flow in the river to satisfy all these projects
through a complete kharif season, specially before July when rice is to be
planted and in the last few weeks before its maturing after September. Thus,
the project could be affected in those low flow years when GOUP has to decide
how to distribute a shortfall in water supply between the various canal
systems that interrelate with the UGC scheme. Within the UGC system, the
project aims to distribute equitably water supplies throughout the command
area. To achieve this, water savings or additions obtained through project
works would be passed down the canal system to make up water shortages in the
tail reaches of the command below the sugarcane zone. In addition, blocks to
be modernized would be designed with a water allowance per unit of cultivable
area assuming the full modernization of the UGC scheme. This would avoid
farmers in the first modernized blocks establishing a 'users right' to excess
water allocation, similar to existing privileged farmers in the sugarcane
zone; such a right would be difficult to take away when the development
proceeds and extra water developed by the project is needed elsewhere in the
UGC command. With respect to water allocation both to and within the UGC
system, GOUP has undertaken that it would (i) allocate to the UGC system the
right to water supplies from the Ganga as assumed in project planning and
design; (ii) allocate water supplies equitably within the project command;
and (iii) allocate to modernized blocks under the project, water supplies per
unit area as shall be required to irrigate such modernized blocks as
designed, assuming that the entire UGC system is modernized.
Proiect Scope
3.07    The project would finance a six-year time slice to rehabilitate and
modernize the UGC system. The entire development program is likely to take
at least 30 years to complete, depending on finance resources available to
GOUP and the relative priorities of other works in the State's irrigation
sector. Project planning has been confined at present to a first phase
development (about 18 years) which is within reasonably predictable planning
horizons. The work program, which includes expensive common works such as
the replacement main canal, has been scheduled to give maximum
benefit/investment returns. In addition, the >roject has been formulated
with maximum flexibility so that GOUP can eva.aate and amend, if necessary,



-15-
the level of modernization which would be appropriate and affordable, given
statewide priorities in the irrigation sector.
Project Components
3.08    The principal components are:
(a)  Risk Aversion Works.  Replacement of the four major cross
drainage structures on the main canal together with construction
of lined channel to link these structures back to the existing

Detailed Description
3.09    Risk Aversion Works (Annex 15, SDV).  Under the project, priority has
been given to risk aversion works to protect the existing benefits from
irrigation. The greatest risk to the existing system dre four major
cross-drainage structures on torrent streams over the' wtin canal between mile
5 and 18, located upstream of the first major offtate from the main canal
(mile 22). In recent years, the structures have shown signs of deterioration
and the possibility and effects of failure are such that they should be
replaced as soon as possible. The highest priorities for replacement are
Solani aqueduct and Dhanori level crossing (Table 2a, Annex 3). The replace-
ment structures are located so that most of the existing main canal would
have to be replaced to provide approach and exit alignments to the new struc-
ture sites. In addition, the main canal would be designed (i) with increased
capacity (294 to 350 cumecs) to operate a new silt ejector at about mile 13;
(ii) to give a least cost cross section since it need not be restricted by
design levels at existing structures; and (iii) so that the existing main
canal can be operated almost continuously. The above considerations will be
taken into account when finalizing the design for the replacement canal on
this upper reach. Replacement canal reaches will be lined.
3.10    To reduce the risk to the UGC system while works described above are
under construction, the main canal common to both UGC and MGC systems (mile
118 to 148) would be rehabilitated and new lined parallel canal would be
constructed on this reach to complement the capacity of the existing unlined
main canal (Map IBRD 17648R). The new lined channel (about 140 cumecs at
mile 118) would carry all rabi season flows to the UGC system. The existing
unlined main canal would be operated in kharif when peak design discharges
occur. This will effectively eliminate risk to the UGC system below mile 118
(about 20Z of UGC command area) since this part of the system could be
provided with an alternative diversion source from the river Ganga. It will
also enable the existing main canal (mile 118-148) to become an important
section of feeder canal for the MGC system and remove the existing capacity
constraint within the UG canal above mile 148. Between mile 22 and 118, risk
of failure on the main canal is small and vould mainly consist of the pos-
sible failure of cross channel structures. Under general maintenance funds
for the UGC scheme, GOUP would rehabilitate or replace any failure as tem-
porary works until the main canal between mile 22-118 is replaced by a new
lined channel.
3.11    Main Canal Modernization.  Work done on the main canal described
under risk aversion works would include a modernization element. Work would
also be initiated under the project on a lined parallel replacement channel



-17-
between mile 148 and 181. The replacement and parallel channels would be
designed so that water savings from lining and additional supplies from ATWs
could be conveyed to the lower part of the UGC command area. The replacement
canal would be lined to reduce seepage losses and maintenance needs and
sufficient control structures would be provided so that the system can
respond adequately and efficiently to changing seasonal water demands. The
new channel would replace rather than complement the existing main canal
since this would (i) avoid costs associated with linking the unlined and
lined channels at common control points; (ii) reduce channel section since
the new design would not have to be compatible with the existing unlined
channel; and (iii) eliminate costs of rehabilitating many structures on the
existing main canal which would need to be replaced if the existing canal was
to continue to function. 1/ A flexible approach of staged construction would
be adopted for channels with capacities above 40 cumecs so that they can be
enlarged in the future. Improved control and adequate escapes would enable
encroachment on lined freeboard for short periods of peak demand.
3.12    The type of lining used on the main canal (and branch canals under
future work programs) would depend on channel capacity, availability of
materials and construction methods appropriate to the site. Generally,
lining would be burnt brick tiles with a single layer on the bed set in
cement plaster, and a double layer of tiles on side slopes set in cement
plaster with a sandwiched layer of cement plaster. For both bed and side
slopes, the tile plaster bed layer would be placed over a compacted subgrade.
Cross regulators on the main canal would be provided with either radial or
lifting gates (depending on canal capacity) with gearing mechanism and
designed for eventual mechanization with electric motors. Access structures
would be designed to accommodate modern loading factors and re-sited, where
necessary, to reflect present and future needs.
3.13    Canal Distribution System Modernization.  The irrigation system below
the main canal consist of branch canals, distributaries, minors and vater-
courses. Typically, a distributary commands 12,000-25,000 ha, though there
are many canals designated as distributaries outside this range. The dis-
tributaries feed minors, each serving about 200-1,000 ha. There are
presently ungated pipe outlets to chaks (outlet commands) on all elements
of the canal system including the main canal down to minors. Chak areas
range from one hectare to over 200 ha with about 90Z between 30-60 ha.
Watercourses (guls) deliver irrigation water to field channels within the
chaks. Thus modernization of the distribution system would include: (i)
rationalization of the various canal command area elements; (ii) elimination
of direct outlets from main, branch and major distributary canals, where
possible; (iii) lining of canals to reduce seepage losses; (iv) provision of
improved regulation structures to control water delivery within the system;
and (v) provision of escape structures.
1/ The right-of-way of the existing main canal may be used at some future
date to channelize supplies to the Lower Ganga Canal (LGC) rather than
pass valuable rabi water down the river Ganga to headworks of the LGC
system at Narora Barrage (Map IERD, 17648R).



-18-
3.14    Design criteria for the canal distribution systems are discussed in
Annex 10, SDV. Canal distribution system modernization would be undertaken
in Bulandshar and Harduaganj distributary commands serving about 39,000 ha,
and initiated in Machua distributary command (about 4,000 ha). Dis-
tributaries and minors would be lined, except for limited areas where lining
can be proved unnecessary as a result of tests and observations (e.g., imper-
vious soils, etc.). Generally, existing channels would be modernized and
lined except when extended closures of the canal system may not practical; in
such cases, a parallel lined canal would be constructed. Lining would be
either pre-cast concrete slabs or, more commonly, a single layer of burnt
clay tiles bedded in cement mortar, placed on a compacted sub-grade. The
cement plaster layer is the seepage barrier with tiles providing mechanical
protection. Where appropriate, mechanical protection may be provided by
pre-cast concrete slabs and a polyethyelene film may be substituted for the
cement plaster layer. Field testing of various types of lining would con-
tinue throughout the project period and specifications would be modified if
improvements are recognized, or a more cost-effective design proves to be
practical. Since burnt clay tiles vould be the preferred lining material,
about five improved automatic tile kilns with modern tile moldiog equipment
would be set up under the project. This would enable high quality clay tiles
to be manufactured to uniform standards.
3.15    Improved water control and regulation capabilities are essential for
more efficient management of the UGC System. Existing control structures are
insufficient and do not allow the water regulation required for efficient and
timely distribution and delivery of irrigation supplies. In addition, most
structures are in poor condition and many have reached the end of their
useful life. Project modernization vorks would include replacement of
regulators on all canals, construction of additional cross regulators,
installation of water measuring devices in head reaches of larger channels,
remodelling of watercourse outlets, provision for escapes as needed, and
remodelling of falls, as well as construction of ancillary facilities includ-
ing cow ghats, bridges, and buildings. Design of water regulation and con-
trol facilities would provide for future upgrading through introduction of
improved technologies for canal control.
3.16    Costs for canal modernization including structures, staff support
(such as housing units for construction field staff), engineering, but
excluding physical and price contingencies, average about Rs 5,200 per ha
CCA, including lining estimated at Rs 2,100 per ha CCA.
3.17    Watercourse Modernization.  The proposed project would finance mod-
ernization (mainly lining) of about 950 watercourses within the distributary
block comands to be modernized under the project (para 3.14). After
rationalization of chak commands, each watercourse system would serve on
average about 50 farmers, linking individual fasm plots within an area of
about 8 ha to the canal network operated by the Government. The linkage from
the lined watercourse to the farmer's field would be tbrough unlined field
channels. Typically, a watercourse system is about 1.7 km in length and has
a capacity of about 1.0 cusecs. In general, water losses are highest in



-19-
watercourse head reaches, because the head reach runs longer than the tail
reach due to operation of the warabundi rotation (para 5.09).
3.18    Watercourse modernization would follow designs which have proven
effective and economical in Bank-supported projects elsewhere in India. The
lining for an individual watercourse would average about 75% of its total
length and, depending on local costs and site conditions, would be either:
(i) vertical sides constructed of brick masonry on an in-situ concrete slab
bed, or (ii) vertical brick masonry sides as above, but with brick masonry
bed over a compacted subgrade. In very sandy areas, the inside face of the
brick masonry lining would have cement mortar plaster to minimize leakage,
and polyethylene sheet would be used in the bed as an additional seepageF
barrier. On about one per cent of the watercourse l-ning program, innovative
designs and materials would be tried and results monitored and integrated
into the on-going program. Watercourse modernization would also include
construction of improved gated turnouts, division boxes, culverts,
cross-drainage structures and falls. Before a modernized watercourse is
considered complete, performance of each modernized watercourse would be
monitored for six months to ensure design specifications are net; any repairs
or modifications needed would be made. After completion, the lined
watecourse would be maintained by the ID. The average cost of watercourse
modernization, excluding physical and price contingencies, is estimated at
about Rs 53 per running metre.
3.19    Augmentation Tubewells (ATWs).  With full modernization of the UGC
system, ATWs would be constructed along main, branch and selected dis-
tributary channels and grouped so that (i) they can be served by separate or
"dedicated" 11 kV feeder lines from the nearest 132 kV sub-station or canal
hydel station; and (ii) the combined discharge would be large enough to be
operationally significant when used conjunctively with surface water supplies
in the canal system, but would not exceed 20X of surface water capacity in
the parent canal.
3.20    Under the project, about 33 ATWs with a total capacity of about
2.2 cumecs would be installed along Bulandshahr and Harduaganj dis-
tributaries, and spaced to deliver about 3 cusecs per 1.5 mile reach of canal
in a single row discharging directly into the canals.  Minimum spacing
between ATWs and private tubewells would be about 150m. Each ATW would
consist of a well, submersible pump unit, switch gear, starter and protection
relay, delivery pipework, and power lines (Annex 12, SDV). Project ATWs
would be served by about 81 km of dedicated 11 kV feeder lines. Capacitors
and separate switch gear would be provided on 11 kV lines at each sub-station
to improve the voltage at the feeder end. The cost of typical 1.5 and 3.0
cusecs ATWs, excluding physical and price contingencies, would be about Rs.
0.22 M and Rs. 0.29 M respectively. Agreements have been reached with GOUP
that it would cause UPSEB to: (i) provide independent electric 11 kV feeders
from 132 kV sub-stations to connect all ATWs; (ii) ensure that these feeders
would remain exclusive to the ATWs; (iii) provide ATWs with continuous power
supply when required with a voltage fluctuation of not greater than +6%; and
(iv) energize the tubewell system according to a schedule to be prepared by
ID not later than September 30, 1986 and acceptable to IDA.



-20-
3.21    Canal Communication System (Annex 13. SDV).  The present canal comr-
munication system uses telegraph and magneto (local communication) telephones
to connect the major regulation and control points and has been in operation
since the beginning of the century. Modern and dependable communications are
required to improve canal system operations and management efficiency. As a
first step, the project would provide two-way radio sets for voice communica-
tion between the most important stations in the UCC and MGC systems. Sta-
tions to be upgraded are located at regulation points on main canals, impor-
tant cross-drainage points and locations involving inter-scheme regulators
which supply the Agra and Lower Ganga Canal systems. The GOI Post and
Telegraphs (PMT) Department would provide base station two-way radio sets for
rent or purchase, which would be housed at existing communications facilities
and operated by the present signalling staff. The project would also provide
for (i) additional hand-held units on a pilot demonstration basis; and (ii)
services of a local consultant to assist with detailed planning of the canal
communications network to maximize system management and operational
efficiency. GOUP has completed a feasibility study of the required UGC
communication system and final allocation of frequency bands will be based on
the results of this study. The total cost for the complete communication
network for the fully modernized system is estimated at Rs. 69.3 M of which
equipment costing about Rs. 16.1 M would be installed over the project
period. An agreement has been reached with GOI that radio frequencies for
the UGC communication system would be allocated to GOUP by August 31, 1985.
3.22    Drainage Improvements.  There are no major sub-surface drainage
requirements within the distributary block commands to be modernized under
the project. However, reconnaisance surveys in Aligarh and Bulandshar dis-
tricts indicate that drainage would be needed within the UGC command to
remove excess surface water. Local flooding can occur because natural
drainage channels have been interrupted by physical obstacles such as roads,
bunds and irrigation channels and have tended to silt up. As a consequence,
the natural waterways need to be remodelled and enlarged so that drainage
effluent can be removed from the cultivated area before standing crops are
damaged. In addition, the Lower Ganga Canal (LGC) forms a barrier across the
tail end of the UGC command area (Map IBRD 17648R) and an outfall drain,
parallel to the LGC, will be necessary to remove drainage surplus to the
River Yanuma once more irrigated water supplies reach the southern part of
UGC command. Thoughout the UGC command, minor drainage channels would be
required to effectively collect rainfall runoff and to provide outlets for
canal escapes. Link drains would be provided where necessary to remove
runoff to the nearest drainage ways, which would be enlarged and remodelled
to remove bottlenecks. Cost estimates have been provisionally based on
drainage ditches with capacities of about 1.0 1/sec/ha. Under the project, a
detailed drainage study would be undertaken for the command areas of the
three distributaries to be modernized under this time slice (64,000 ha).
Based on the results of the study, the project would support a pilot drainage
work program which would include remodelling and enlarging the natural
drainage waterways, construction of collector drainage channels to field
drain level, all structures required for access, and initial construction on
works required to remove drainage surplus from the UGC command. In addition,
a reconnaissance level survey would be undertaken to prepare a general
drainage plan for the entire UGC command.



-21-
3.23    Hydro-electric-(Hydel) Stations (Annex 11, SDV).  There are eight
generating stations on the existing UG main canal with an installed capacity
of about 45 MW. The earliest stations were commissioned in the 1930s and all
units are reaching the end of their useful life. As the main canal is mod-
ernized, new power houses will be constructed on the replacement parallel
channel at or near the existing generating stations. Under the project, the
Palra station (0.5 MW) would be replaced at about mile 148.6 on the main
canal (Map IBRD, 17648R). In addition, construction would commence on civil
works of the Pathari station (27 MW) located at mile 7 on the main canal.
The stations would be multi-purpose structures utilizing the controlled fall
as a regulating point on the main canal and also providing road access over
the canal. The project would: {i) finance civil works undertaken by the ID
in conjunction with the canal construction program; and (ii) procurement and
installation of mechanical and electrical equipment and switchyards to con-
nect the stations to the grid through UPSEB.
3.24    Water and Land ManaRement Institute (WALMI).  As part of a long-term
program to build up the professional cadre for irrigation management in the
State, GOUP would commence in-service training programs in water management
and land development for irrigated agriculture (Annex 14, SDV). The project
would construct a new training center with residential and training accom-
modation at Okhla near New Delhi (Map IBRD 17648R). Provision would be made
for equipment, incremental staff salaries and training allowances, consultant
services, and to a limited extent, training visits for institute staff both
within India and abroad. The GOUP has issued the order to sanction the WAIMI
and posted the first WALMI Director. Agreements have been reached with GOUP
that it would Ci) maintain WALNI headed by a Director with suitable
qualifications and experience; and (ii) by September 30, 1985, draw up a
student training program acceptable to IDA and start such training by March
31, 1986.
3.25    Management Improvements.  Both residential and non-residential build-
ings are provided as standard items under all construction programs vith the
number and size of the buildings based on long established statewide norms.
The buildings used during construction are handed over to O&M staff when
works are commissioned; non-residential buildings are used for management
purposes and storage facilities for O&M supplies and equipment. Although
these arrangements are satisfactory for construction and O&M staff and are
provided for under the project as part of civil works, there has been no
systematic provision for the other ID staff. In recent years, investigation
and planning (I&P), design and monitoring and evaluation activities have been
decentralized from Lucknow as the statewide development program has expanded.
In most regional and divisional headquarters, the ID has very little accom-
modation and rentals are expensive and limited. As a consequence, par-
ticulaxly in western UP, the ID has difficulty in attracting qualified staff,
for essential ID activities other than construction and O&M. The ID has
recognized that rehabilitation and modernization of existing irrigation
systems will continue in western UP (para 3.04) at least on a scale equal to
the project into the foreseeable future. Therefore, under the project,
residential buildings would be constructed for selected grades of staff in
I&P and design activities (para 5.06) so that about 66% of staff required for



-22-
the project would be housed by project completion. The buildings would be
standard ID designs and generally constructed on land presently owned by the
ID. The type and size of houses, unit costs, and the expenditure schedule
are given in Table 9, Annex 3. The project would also provide funds for (i)
special studies by ID staff or consultants or services from universities and
other research institutions in India, and (ii) equipment and vehicles for
project preparation, implementation and management. In addition, the project
would provide for study tours to enable ID staff to visit other projects both
within India and abroad, to widen their professional experience. Detailed
costs of these items is given in Tables 10 and 11, Annex 3.
3.26    Technical Services.  During project preparation, GOUP has benefited
(and will continue to benefit) from implementation assistance which brings
outside ideas and new methodology into the ID. Furthermore, the ID is
staffed almost exclusively with engineers and has limited experience in
planning work that requires a multi-disciplinary approach. It would also
benefit from an advisory input with respect to operation, maintenance and
general management of completed irrigation schemes. The ID is aware of the
areas were improvements can be made and has indicated willingness to consider
technical assistance under the project and to assist in planning further
development stages after completion of the first time slice.
3.27    The project would finance the cost of a Advisory Planning Group (APG)
which could include either qualified Indian or International Consultants (or
a joint venture). The APG would assist the ID in those tasks which cannot be
fully or adequately undertaken within the Department. This would include
agricultural and socio-economic studies and planning requirements, techniques
for effective monitoring and data collection; and evaluation of data col-
lected, supervision of baseline and other special surveys; and macro planning
and design of subsequent phases of the UGC modernization program. The APG
would also advise the ID on operation, maintenance and general management of
the UGC system.  The consultancy service would involve about 154 man months.
The monthly cost including salaries, fees and subsistence for foreign con-
sultants would average about US$8,700. Detailed terms of reference of APG
are given in Annex 4 and the estimated costs (assuming foreign consultants
are retained)-are summarized in Table 10, Annex 3.  An agreement has been
reached with GOUP that by December 31, 1984, it would retain Consultants to
provide general assistance to the ID in accordance with terms of reference
agreed with IDA and with experience and qualifications acceptable to IDA.
Agricultural Extension and Research
3.28    Agricultural extension in the project area, and applied research to
address farmer's needs under the project need considerable strengthening. In
this respect, GOUP are already engaged (with Bank's assistance) in preparing
an agricultural extension project based on the Training and Visit (T&V)
system. In addition, the on-going Bank-supported National Agricultural
Research Project (Cr. IN-855; US$ 27.0 M) provides the means to finance
apprcpriate applied research programs; though funds provided under this
project are already fully committed, it is expected that the Bank will con-
tinue to support applied research in India through a follow-up project.
Should such IDA financing not become available, the applied research program



-23-
required for the project would be financed by GOUP. Therefore, instead of
including agricultural extension and research components in the project, an
agreement has been reached with GOUP that, by December 31, 1986, it would
strengthen, as required, the existing organization and service such that it
can adequately perform agricultural extension activities in the Bulandshahr
and Aligarh administrative districts of Uttar Pradesh. Agreements have also
been reached with GOUP that it would: (i) not later than December 1, 1984,
prepare a proposal for an applied agricultural research program acceptable to
IDA, for submission to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) for
its review and comments; (ii) commence applied research investigations not
later than June 1, 1985; and (iii) review and update the program annually
commencing on March 1, 1986.
Status of Project Preparation
3.29    The project works are in close proximity to existing channels and
structures for which the ID has as-built drawings. Therefore the project
preparation is based on accurate site data including long and cross sections
for channels and foundation conditions for most structures. Where necessary,
ID is complementing available data with an on-going site investigation
program, particularly for sections of the main canal and some major struc-
tures which are designed as individual works. Works below branch canal head
regulators are prepared using type designs for channels and structures
adapted to suit actual site conditions. The ID has prepared the type designs
necessary for project implementation based on design principles and criteria
formulated during project preparation and approved by IDA. Detailed layouts
have been prepared for the distribution blocks to be modernized under the
project (para 3.13). The status of preparation of the project is reflected
in the physical contingencies for civil works which vary from about 7% to 15%
and is sufficient to estimate project costs with acceptable accuracy. The ID
has made provisions satisfactory to IDA to ensure that detailed designs will
be available in a timely manner to meet the project implementation schedule.
3.30    Of the major works, the four cross-drainage structures on the main
canal (para 3.09) are under design based on similar structures have been
built recently elsewhere in UP; the ID expects to complete the detailed
designs by about August 1985 for review by IDA. Construction of the first
major structure will start in March 1986 and the remainder will start at
intervals up to March 1990. Detailed designs have been completed for about
4,000 ha of the distributary blocks to be modernized and which are scheduled
to be under construction by September 1985. Additional surveys required to
finalize layouts of other areas to be modernized under the project will be
completed by December 1985.
Implementation Schedule (Chart C-2)
3.31    The project would be implemented over six years from September, 1984
to September, 1990. The main construction season is from September to May
although certain activities, particularly on major works, can continue
throughout the year. In many new projects in India, utilization of water has
been slow because minor distribution systems were not constructed ful'ly or



-24-
concurrently with water being available in major canals. To avoid this risk,
the distribution systems would be modernized on a block-by-block basis con-
currently with completion of the main distributary channel. Construction
work would be scheduled with a minimum interruption of water deliveries to
existing irrigation schemes. Farmers will be informed of canal closures at
least one crop season ahead to enable them to make suitable adjustments in
their cropping patterns.

April 1984 contract prices. The provision for physical contingencies range
between 5% and 17% depending on the status of designs and average about 9%
for all civil works. Engineering, design and administration are estimated at
about 13% of the civil works including local costs of engineering services
retained by the ID for investigation, planning and design (para 3.27).
Expected price increases during the project period are taken as 7.0 % in
1984/85, 8.0 % in 1985/87, and 6.0% thereafter.



-25-
Financing
4.03      The proposed IDA credit of US$125.0 M, would finance the foreign
exchange component (about US$26.3 M) and about 48% of local costs. All
expenditures would be met by GOUP from its development budget, which includes
a GOI contribution. The IDA credit would be made to GOI on standard IDA
terms. An agreement has been reached that GOI would make the proceeds of the
credit available to GOUP on GOI's standard terms and arrangements for
development assistance to the States. In addition, agreements have been
reached that from GOUP, it would promptly provide resources and funds to (i)
execute the project in accordance with the implementation and expenditure
schedules for the project period, and (ii) operate and maintain adequately
and efficiently the irrigation systems under the project.

Note: hi Figures in parentheses are the amounts eligible for financing under the Ma, Credit.
Hj Excluding USS2.4 H which is unallocated to specific work. (see Table T-5).
4.05      Works to be financed under the project would cost approximately US$
167.2 M, excluding equipment (para 4.06) and engineering and administration.
About US$ 87.1 M, or 52% of the civil works, would be let through Interna-
tional Competitive Bidding (ICB) contracts, about US$57.4 N (34Z) through
Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) contracts, and the remaining US$22.7 M (14%)
would be let under piecework contracts or be carried out by GOUP's departmen-
tal forces. All ICB and LCB contracts for civil works would be let on the
basis of standardized documents and procedures recently developed by GOI's
Central Water Commission and approved by the Bank Group.



-26-
(a) ICB Contracts for Main Canal Works (US$87.1 M). Works for main
canal in excess of US$6 M per contract would be let on the basis
of ICB in accordance with the Bank Group's procurement
guidelines. To encourage the participation of larger contrac-
tors, similar works would be packaged where practical for bid-
ding. However, to gain the interest of smaller contractors, the
bid package would be designed also to allow bidding for all or
any part of the work. Indian contractors would be entitled to a
7.5% preference for the purpose of bid evaluation. Tender
documents would specify this preference and the manner of its
application.
(b) LCB Contracts (US$55.9 M). These works would be individually
small (less then US$6 M per contract), scattered over a large
area, and carried out intermittently as determined by weather
conditions and agricultural activities. They would therefore
not be suitable for international tendering.
Cc)  Advance Contracting (US$1.5 M).  Works contracts will have been
let between January 1984 when the project was appraised and
September 1984 when the time-slice covered by the project is
expected to start. These contracts are not suitable for ICB
for the same reasons as described in item (b) above and would be
let after LCB on the basis of CWC's standardized procedures and
guidelines. An estimated US$1.5 M worth of works would be
outstanding under such contracts after September 1984 and would
be eligible for financing from the proposed credit.
Cd) Non-ICB/LCB Works (US$22.7 M). These works would also be
individually small and scattered and their implementation would
be governed by weather and agricultural conditions. Because of
these and other technical constraints, there would be a general
lack of interest from contractors lozated outside the areas
covered by the project. These works would therefore be imprac-
tical for ICB or country-wide tendering; most of them would
instead be carried out under small piece-work or rate contracts.
When required by safety or quality considerations or when the
quantities of work are difficult to estimate in advance, small
works may be implemented by GOUP's departmental forces.
4.06    Power Supplv.  Power transmission and transiormation works and
procurement and installation of electrical and mechanical equipment in the
hydel stations to be financed under the project would cost approximately
US$0.4 M and US$1.4 M respectively, excluding engineering and administration.
As with IDA credits for rural electrification and small hydel installations,
UPSEB would be responsible for the works including procurement of its own
project materials, using Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) standard
specifications and standard General Conditions of Contract approved by IDA.
Generally, the UPSEB would not procure materials and equipment for project
works as separate contracts but include the project items as part of their
regular procurement for the statewide rural electrification programs. In
view of the expected large number of small contracts and the present smooth



-27-
functioning of the procurement process, only contracts exceeding US$0.5 K
equivalent would require IDA approval prior to contract awards. The UPSEB
procurement procedures for materials procured without using Credit proceeds
are satisfactory.
4.07    Equipment, Instruments and Vehicles (Table 11, Annex 3) to be
financed under the project would cost about US$12.8 M, excluding engineering
and administration cost and goods required for power components (para 4.06).
This includes (i) about US$6.9 K for light and heavy equipment required for
civil works (para 4.05), procured by GOUP and provided by the ID to contrac-
tors; (ii) about US$2.5 M for ATWs, WALMI and the canal communication sys-
tem; and (iii) about US$3.4 M for management improvements. Of this equip-
ment, about US$5.8 e would be suitable for procurement through ICB procedures
and US$5.2 M would be procured through LCB procedures. In addition, about
US$1.8 M of equipment, instruments and vehicles, required for the project
works would be procured locally with units grouped to promote efficiency and
attract adequate competition; however, bids will also be accepted on
individual schedules to allow small manufacturers to compete. A preference
limited to 15%, or the prevailing customs duty if lower, would be extended to
local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. The equipment, instruments
and vehicles would be procured locally to benefit from existing servicing,
supply facilities and spare parts availability. These goods would be
assigned throughout the project area so prompt accessibility to spare parts
and established service facilities is essential. There is adequate domestic
competition and prices are reasonable. Standardized procedures and bidding
documents developed by CWC and approved by IDA would also be used to procure
the equipment, materials and supplies.
4.08    Contract Review.  All bidding packages for works estimated to cost
US$0.5 M equivalent or more, and for goods costing US$100,000 equivalent or
more, would be subject to standard IDA pre-action review. These will account
for at least 80% of the procurement value of works and 90% of the goods. The
remaining contracts would be subject to IDA post-action review.
Disbursements
4.09    Disbursements would be made for: (i) 100% of the foreign expenditures
for directly imported equipment; (ii) 100% for locally manufactured goods
procured ex-factory; (iii) 70% for other locally procured goods; (iv) 90% of
expenditures for WALMI; (v) 100% of expenditures for technical services, and
canal communications system; (vi) 65% of expenditures for civil works, (vii)
75% of expenditures on completed ATWs, and (viii) 70% of expenditures on
Residential Buildings for Irrigation Department Staff. Disbursements for
works constructed by departmental forces and for payments of less than Rs.
300,000 for works and Rs. 150,000 for goods may be made against certificates
of expenditures, itemized by sub-project. Documentation for these works
would be retained by GOUP and made available for inspection by IDA during
review missions. Full documentation would be required for all other disbur-
sements. The estimated schedule of expenditure is given in Table T-4. The
semi-annual disbursement schedule and the proposed allocation of the proceeds
of the credit are presented in Table T-5. It is expected that disbursements
would be completed by September 1991. The expected rate of disbursements



-28-
follows the typical disbursement profile in the Indian irrigation sector for
the first three years of project implementation; the rate of disbursement
then remains constant since the project is the first time slice of a long
term development program.
Accounts and Audits
4.10    The project would be subject to uormal Government control and audit-
ing procedures. A resident Audit Officer, representing the State Accountant
General (AG) would audit the project accounts. Although continuous and
annual audits are carried out in a timely manner, the finalization is a
lengthy process during which the Statutory Audit Report is presented to the
State Legislature. It would be essential therefore to have interim state-
ments of account certified as to accuracy and authenticity by an independent
competent auditor. Such statements, certified by the AG or his designate,
supported by an itemized account and a suamAry of the expenditures, would be
submitted to IDA as soon as possible after the end of each fiscal year.
Agreements have been reached with GOUP that it would cause the ID and UPSEB
to: (i) maintain separate accounts on project expenditures kept in accord-
ance with sound accounting principles and procedures; (ii) have these
accounts certified as to their accuracy and authenticity annually by inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to IDA and make the resulting interim statements
of account available to IDA as soon as possible, but not later than nine
months after the end of each fiscal year; (iii) have the project accounts
audited annually in accordance with sound auditing principles and submit the
audit report to IDA as soon as available; (iv) maintain separate accounts for
the O&M expenditures in such a manner that the O&M costs of works constructed
under the project can be identified; and (v) make available complete accounts
and financial statements to IDA for inspection during project review.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
5.01    Uttar Pradesh has a well structured administrative organization.
Under the project, GOUP would (i) strengthen the agencies responsible for
execution and management of the project works; (ii) establish procedures to
monitor progress of project implementation and realization of project
benefits; and (iii) establish units to undertake the planning and design of
future stages of the UGC rehabilitation and modernization program.
5.02    Overall responsibility for project implementation would rest with the
Secretary for Irrigation and Energy (IS). Two agencies under his jurisdic-
tion would implement the project. The Irrigation Department (ID) constructs,
operates and maintains surface and public groundwater irrigation schemes and
drainage works in the State; the UP State Electricity Board (UPSEB) is
responsible for construction, operation and maintenance of power transmission
and transformation under the project and also for the procurement and instal-
lation of the mechanical and electrical equipment for hydel stations. In
addition to the construction agencies, the Department of Agriculture (DA)
would be responsible for the agricultural development activities to be
provided once project works are commissioned (para 3.28).



-29-
5.03    A Chief Engineer (CE Level I) has been appointed to act as the
Project Coordinator (PC), reporting directly to the IS through the
Engineer-in-Chief (Chart C-3). He will be responsible for the day-to-day
coordination at the working level between the participating agencies. The PC
will be assisted by a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) which has been set up
exclusively for the project.  The PCU vill draw up annual implementation and
development programs; requests for the necessary financial provisions for the
program; collate expenditures for reimbursement from IDA; prepare project
reports and summaries of monitoring and evaluation studies; and formulate and
maintain an information link to project beneficiaries concerning all aspects
of the project including the proposed implementation schedule. An agreement
has been reached with GOUP that it would maintain the Project Coordinating
Unit within the ID with a suitably qualified and experienced Chief Engineer
(Level 1) appointed to head the unit.
Irrization Department (ID)
5.04    Existing Organization.  The present organization of ID is flexible
and is adjusted to the work program and progress of on-going projects. An
Engineer-in-Chief heads the ID and is assisted by 35 Chief Engineers (CEs) of
Level-I and Level-II grades. Each CE (Level-II) controls about five circles,
each headed by a Superintending Engineer (SE) who is responsible for three to
five divisions, each of which is headed by an Executive Engineer (EE). A
division, in turn, consists of three to five sub-divisions which are under
the control of Assistant Engineers (AEs).
5.05    Major irrigation structures are designed in the offices of CEs
(Level-II, Design) located in Lucknow and Roorkee. Design Units in the
offices of CEs (Design) prepare general layouts of schemes and undertake
detail structural designs which are then supplied to construction circles and
divisional offices. Although detailed designs of major irrigation works are
carried out in accordance with sound engineering practices, there is con-
siderable room for improvement in the general planning and design of minor
irrigation systems.
5.06    Proposed Project Orxanization.  The ID would be strengthened to
implement the project and introduce improvements in planning, design, con-
struction and O&M. The organization strength at the start (1984185) and end
of the project period (l99019l) is given on Chart C-3. Under the project,
the following additional units would be established:
(a) A Project Co-ordinating Unit and a Project Accounting Unit (PAU)
under the Project Coordinator. In addition to co-ordinating
project activities (para 5.03), the PCU would organize the study
tours supported under the project (para 5.14). The PC would
also be responsible for the Water and Land Management Institute
(WALMI) component.
(b) An Investigation and Planning (IMP) Wing, headed by CE
(Level-II) consisting of: three I&P circles; an Irrigated
Agriculture (IA) Unit headed by a Joint Director Agriculture



-30-
(para 5.07); a Project Monitoring and Evaluation (PME) Unit
which would also be responsible for in-service training require-
ments; and a Quality Control Circle responsible for all aspects
of quality control during construction and commissioning phases
of the project program. The I&P Wing would be responsible for
all detailed investigation and planning required for the
project, for planning of the works program after 1990/91 and for
monitoring and evaluation activities required under the project.
The CE (I&P) would be responsible for the Advisory Planning
Group (para 3.27).
tc) A Design Wing, headed by a CE (level-II), consisting of three
design circles. The wing would be responsible for all detailed
design of channels and structures under the project.
(d) A new Construction Wing headed by a CE (Level-I1), consisting of
four construction circles.
(e) The existing O&M Wing for the UGC system with three OEM Circles
and headed by the CE, Ganga (level-II) and expanded to include
two new construction circles.
Cf) A new Construction and ONM Wing headed by a CE (Level-II),
consisting of three construction circles and two O0M circles.
The new Construction Wing (item d above) would be primarily responsible for
the major works on the main canal (mile 3-22). The Construction/O&M Wings
(items e and f above) would operate mainly below mile 118 on the main canal
with the project command area divided to reflect the organizational strength
of each wing. The organization build-up of the ID through the project period
is given in Table T-7.
5.07    Proiect Staffing Requirements.  The staffing build-up within ID under
the project is shown in Table T-8. Based on the implementation schedule and
workload, the yearvise staff requirement can be summarized as follows:
Existing                                                89/90
Category       Staff      84/85    85/86    86/87    87/88    88/89   91/92
CE Level-I            -         1         1        1         1        1      1
CE Level-I1           3         4         4        4        4         5      5
SE                    7        16        19       20        21       23     24
EE                   20        49        58       66        70       77     81
AE                   63       137       173      213       229      257    274
The above table shows the substantial expansion which must take place within
the project organization to complete the works on schedule. Such staff would
be available either through transfer from other parts of the ID, or through
recruitment depending on the overall staffing requirements and work load of
the ID through the project period. The staff for the Irrigated Agriculture
Unit would be provided on deputation by the DA. An agreement has been



-31-
reached with GOUP that it would sanction and fill staff positions in accord-
ance with an organization plan and a staffing schedule established in con-
sultation with IDA and train such staff so that the ID can carry out the
project program and operate and maintain the project works.
5.08    Operation and Maintenance.  Each distributary will be operated as a
unit and allowance made for local rainfall variations on irrigation demand.
At peak demand periods, all canals would run at full design discharge; at
other times, main and branch canals would be operated on a varying discharge
basis with distributary systems rotated to reflect the local area demand.
In the kharif season, supplementary irrigation would be provided to make up
water shortages. Generally water supply in kbarif would exceed demand except
for the beginning and end of the season. For the rabi crop, water demand
will always exceed supply and farmers would be notified of their water
allocation early enough to plan their cropping pattern, accordingly.
5.09    Below the watercourse outlet, the entire flow would be supplied to
each turnout on a time rotation basis or 'warabundi' with period of flow
proportional to the cultivable command area of the turnout. The supply at
the turnout would be allocated by turns to each farmer, with the time of a
turn proportional to the area of the farmers' holding. The turn would define
the water rights of individual farmers with respect to quantity and time of
their turn in the rotational cycle. Distribution below the watercourse
channel would follow the present practice of using, where necessary, collec-
tive field channels located along property boundaries except for those areas
where, by agreement of the farmers served, irrigation of kharif rice is
undertaken on a field-to-field basis.
5.10    At present, there is no canal system operating in UP designed to the
standards of the project. Consequently, GOUP has not finalized requirements
of staffing, equipment and facilities to ensure efficient operation and
preventive maintenance of the overall UGC system while it is being modern-
ized. However. the project does provide for equipment and facilities for
known needs during the time slice; it also provides for a comprehensive
management study once sufficient works are completed for project O&M require-
ments to be evaluated. Agreements have been reached with COUP that it would:
(i) carry out, under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, a detailed
management study for reviewing existing rules, procedures and requirements
for the general management of the UGC system, including the routine operation
and preventive maintenance of the project; (ii) submit by September 30, 1985,
a report summarizing the results and recommendations of the study to IDA for
its review and comment; and (iii) thereafter, taking into consideration IDA's
comments, if any, adopt and introduce such recommendations. In addition,
areements have been reached with GOUP that it would (i) operate and maintain
the UGC system such that the quality of irrigation service proposed under the
project can be achieved; and (ii) on June 1 of each year, commencing June 1,
1985, inform IDA of the annual financial and other allocations made for the
operation and maintenance for both the surface and groundwater irrigation
works under the project ana the overall UGC scheme.

-32-
5.11    Proaress Review and ReportinB  Recuirements.  Progress reports would
be prepared by the PCU (para 5.03) on a quarterly basis and would be sub-
mitted to IDA within two months after the end of the reporting period. Each
report would contain brief descriptions of the main events of the reporting
period, including: construction progress; expenditures incurred; project
staffing status; tender evaluation and award of contracts; irrigation poten-
tial created; and actual areas irrigated. Agreements have been reached with
COUP that it would submit to IDA: (i) project progress reports on a
quarterly basis, commencing January 1, 1985, to be submitted to IDA within
two months after the end of each reporting period; and (ii) a project comple-
tion report no later than six months after the closing date of the project.
5.12    Monitoring and Evaluation (Annex 16, SDV).  A strong monitoring and
evaluation (K&E) system would be essential to ensure a reliable assessment of
project progress, for undertaking studies and investigations required for
project implementation, and for assessment of project performance. Data
generated through M&E activities would be essential for the preparation of
future development phases of the UCC system. ME activities vould be coor-
dinated by the ID as the main implementing agency.
5.13    The emphasis of MIE activities with respect to irrigation vould be as
follows: (i) technical aspects including project implementation, technical
performance, design standards; specifications and cost effectiveness, alter-
native canal lining tecbniques including lining of watercourses, channel
design standards including freeboard, and labor intensive construction
methods; (ii) system water management from the headworks to the watercourse;
and (iii) routine monitoring of 06H of the irrigation system. Within the IAP
Wing (para 5.06), the PME Unit vould be responsible for irrigation related
MIE vhilst the IA Unit would cover agricultural MIE activities.  Assistance
would be obtained from Universities or other agencies especially for data
analysis and base-line surveys. As required, the ID would call on the
Department of Agriculture (DA) to assist in M6E of the agricultural perfor-
mance of the project (para 5.17).
5.14    TraininR.  Training of project staff would be organized by the PME
Unit (para 5.06) and would be required for: (i) planning and design, includ-
ing the layout of minor distribution systems; (ii) water allocation;
(iii) land acquisition procedures and legal parameters affecti'j the project;
and (iv) the OM of the modernized irrigation systems. The training would be
"in-service", directed by senior ID officers and other experts and generally
undertaken at the WALMI (para 3.24). The courses would include lectures,
discussions, case studies and field trips. In particular, the courses would
cover planning, design and o0M of improved irrigation systems, eater manage-
ment at the field level, cultivator organization and basic cultivation prac-
tices for principle crops to be grovw in the project comand ax:as. Junior
staff would be trained for about three veeks and senior staff for about one
week. In addition, the PHE Unit would organize the study tours provided
under the project for ID staff (para 3.25).



-33-
Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Board (UPSEB)
5.15    General.  The UPSEB is responsible for the construction and O&M of
rural electrification (RE) works in the State and has set up a separate
Public Tubewell Electrification (PTE) Unit for energizing public tubewells.
With respect to proiect tubewells, PTE unit would undertake all planning and
design activities associated with energizing the wells. It would prepare
or approve cost estimates received from field staff and arrange for the
necessary sanctions to implement the works. The unit would also coordinate
procurement and supply of materials to field units, monitor the progress of
works and be responsible for the prompt receipt of work accounts from the
field units. The UPSEB units would coordinate closely with field officers of
the ID. The planning, design and implementation of electrical and mechanical
works for the hydel stations would be undertaken by the units in the UPSEB
responsible for swall hydel development. Close liaison would be maintained
with the design units in the ID responsible for the hydel civil works.
5.16   Oeration and Maintenance (Power Supply).  The O&M of power supply to
each ATW group would be the responsibility of the UPSEB officer in charge of
sub-station from which the dedicated feeder line is taken. He would also
keep daily records of energy sent out to the ATWs from metering facilities at
the sub-station. The AE (O&M) for the area where the ATWs are located would
be responsible for maintenance of 11 kV main and spur lines and transformer
centers supplying individual project tubewells. The O&M staff responsible
for existing hydel stations on the UG main canal would take over the new
stations once they are commissioned.
Department of Agriculture
5.17    The Department of Agriculture's (DA) role in the execution of the
project would be within its broader organizational framework. While the ID
is organized according to canal commands, the DA is organized according to
the administrative units of the State (i.e. divisions, districts, tehsils,
and blocks). Since it would not be practical to alter the organizational
structure of the DA, the project has reached understandings with GOUP that
agricultural extension and research serving the project area would be
strengthened 'para 3.28). However, to ensure that irrigation services meet
the agricultural requirements of the Project, DA staff at State and divi-
sional levels would be members of the appropriate project coordination and
executive committees.
VI. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, MARKET PROSPECT AND PRICES
Cropping Patterns
6.01    The present and expected future cropping patterns in the three dis-
tributary commands to be modernized are shown in Table T-6. The present
cropping patterns are based on data collected by either the lD or Revenue
Department. Actual cropping intensities may be higher than indicated, since
farmers do much unreported water spreading (para 2.17). Waterspreading is
likely to continue after proiect implementation since water supplies would be



-34-
insufficient for farmers to irrigate fully their land holdings in any crop-
ping season.
6.02    The 'future without' project scenario assumes that additional water
supplies from Madhya Ganga canal in kharif will be used for rice. However
the rice area would be less than in the 'future with' project situation
because (i) the unlined canal system would have a lower conveyance efficiency
that the modernized system; and (ii) there would be no ATWs to augment water
supplies. In addition, field percolation losses with rice cultivation are
likely to be higher because applied research to reduce them (para 3.28) may
not be conducted.
6.03    Rabi cropping intensities with the project would increase only
slightly but there would be a change in the crop mix (para 6.04). It is
assumed that all crops would be irrigated nearer to actual water require-
ments, since witb the project, the irrigation service will be predictable,
timely and reliable. Nonetheless, the 'future with' project scenario does
not take into account possible benefits of the applied research program (para
3.28). This may bring about further increases in cropping intensities and
replace some coarse grains (sorghum, pearl millet, barley) with high-value,
high yielding oilseeds and pulse crops, notably rape and grounduuts. These
cropping systems are already practised by a few progressive farmers in the
project area, and extensively in the neighboring Punjab and Haryana States.
Such agricultural changes would not only increase farm incomes but allow
better utilization of irrigation water (Annex 9, SDV).
Crop-Yields and Production
6.C4    Table T-9 shows present and expected yields and production based on
cropping patterns given in Table T-6, and the development scenarios outlined
for the 'future without' and 'future with' project situations. Farmers would
tend to change to higher-yielding varieties of coarse grains and from barley
to wheat. Yields would increase because of improved irrigation service. The
main benefits would accrue in the zaid season when cropping intensities are
expected to more than double.
Input Requirements
6.05    Future requirements of fertilizers and pesticides will depend on
availability rather than marketing and distribution. Since the declared (and
to date successfully pursued) policy of GOI is to bring on stream new fer-
tilizer plants and to increase importation of fertilizer and pesticide
materials not locally manufactured, the project input requirements should be
secure. The additional fodder and crop by-products under the project will
ensure that animal draft power will continue to be adequate for the project's
needs.
6.06    No labour shortages are expected for the distributary command areas
to be modernized, although there could be seasonal scarcities at full project
development. At present, the UGC command relies on temporary labour for
sugarcane and wheat harvesting, although increasing use of threshing machines
is releasing many labourers after the wheat is cut. Labor shortage may occur



-35-
for rice transplanting, harvesting, and threshing. However, water supply for
rice is scheduled for the project only after all other areas relying on the
Ganga river in this season are served. Therefore the labor force transplant-
ing rice should continue to be available when needed in the project area.
Since increase of rice cultivation would be fairly gradual, there will be
sufficient time for the necessary adjustments to take place. Manual thresh-
ing of the rice crop is being superseded by modifications to locally made
wheat threshers available in the project area.
Market Prospects and Prices (Annex 2)
6.07    The project modernizes a large existing irrigated area and thus
market and processing facilities for all main crops are established and can
readily be expanded. Production increases, although substantial in terms of
the immediate areas developed under the project, are small related to the
market. Marketing of surplus produce is not expected to pose any significant
problems since the established trading system through private dealers and
Government markets would absorb the supply. However, many small farmers may
continue to receive unfavorable prices because they sell crops at harvest
time for want of suitable storage and in order to repay crop loans. The
project may therefore generate the need for more storage capacity at local
cooperative levels to allow farmers to store their produce and thus benefit
from higher seasonal prices.
6.08    No major change in crop prices are foreseen because prices are lar-
gely determined by seasonal supply and demand pattern. The Government-s
price supports for sugarcane, rice and wheat have been particularly effective
in maintaining sufficient incentive for farmers, while keeping the real price
to consumers fairly stable. It has therefore been assumed that future
farmgate prices (in constant terms) for paddy and wheat would follow the
official procurement prices of Rs. 1380/ton and Rs. 1520/ton for paddy and
wheat respectively (April 1984). Sugarcane would continue to follow
well-established farugate prices in the areas where sugarcane is the major
crop (about Rs. 220/ton in 1984).
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
General
7.01    The two main project objectives -  risk aversion and modernization of
the existing UGC system - have important financial implications for both the
State and individual farmers within the UGC command area. In terms of the
first objective, GOUP has realized that delay in replacing works at risk has
endangered the entire UGC system. A failure would be catastrophic since most
of the direct beneficiaries are small farmers who would not survive without a
regular income. To the State, water charges in the UGC command (assessed at
about Rs. 78 N for 1982-83) could not be collected if the UGC system ceased
to operate in any year. Thus, GOUP would face a substantial tax loss. Even
more important would be the loss of other sources of revenue to the State
budget, such as sales taxes. Apart from the financial implications of com-
plete system failure, the poor condition of the existing system has resulted
in serious reduction of its productivity potential in terms of direct losses



-36-
of income and profits to taxpayers and, indirectly, as an important loss of
tax revenue to the State budget. The second project objective, to modernize
the canal distribution system, will substantially improve the utilization of
sunk costs and the project investment which must be made in risk aversion
works. Modernization will significantly improve farmers' income, par-
ticularly in the tail-end sections of canal commands. A consequence of
increased financial benefits to the individual farmers will be an increase of
tax revenue to the State.
Risk to Present Income Levels
7.02    The likely consequences in terms of foregone agricultural production
if part of the UGC system should fail are described in Annex 2. An attempt
has been made to quantify the losses in farm incomes and other consequences
of such a failure for various parts of the UGC command area. Disruption of
canal water supply would result in an average annual loss of farm income of
about Rs. 2,000 per ha for about 400,000 ha (or 33%) of the UGC command.
Another 300,000 ha, presently supplied from the Mat Feeder, vould also suffer
an annual loss of about Rs. 1,200 per ha. Data on present farm incomes and
expenditures are inadequate to assess the impact on different farm sizes,
but, the most seriously affected would be marginal farmers with less than 1.0
ha (62% of all farms) and agricultural laborers.
Farm Incomes from Modernization
7.03    Outlet studies conducted throughout the project area have shown that
present firm incomes vary considerably with location of the farm in the canal
command. There is a significant decrease in irrigation intensity from head
to tail along main, branch and distributary canal systems and also within
individual watercourse command areas. Since the basic project objective in
modernizing the existing system is to provide a timely and reliable irriga-
tion service and increase water supplies to all beneficiaries, assessment of
project impact on farmers' income has been made with farm location rather
than holding size as the dominant variable. The effect on farm incomes has
been examined for a typical farm of 1.0 ha at the head and tail reach of each
distributary commands to be modernized. For both locations on each dis-
tributary, farm budgets have been estimated for the 'present', 'future
without' and 'future with' project situations. The main determinants of
cropping patterns and intensities, household size, and the use of hired labor
have been generated from farm surveys and district statistics. The detailed
assumptions used in formulating model farm budgets are given in Annex 2.
Financial prices, input requirements and individual crop budgets are given in
Tables 1,3, and 4, of Annex 2. Typical farm budgets are given in Table T-10
and incremental farm incomes (after deduction of water and land related
charges) are summarized below:

P = Present         Wo = 'Future without' Project       W = 'Future with' Project
The increase in net farm incomes due to modernization would range from 54% to
132%. Production increase in head reaches of the canal systems would be
mainly due to improved timeliness and reliability of the irrigation service;
the tail reach would also benefit from a substantial increase in water sup-
plied. Smaller farms would experience larger increases per unit area than
large farms for both crop production and total income.
Impact on Poverty
7.04    Annual incomes per capita 'vith' and 'without' the project are
estimated as follows:
Location                              Per Capita Income (Rs)

The average per capita income in UP is about Rs. 1000 and thus, the present
average income of a typical farming family in the distributary areas falls
below the State average. Furthermore, if the poverty line is taken as Rs.
840 (US$78) j1 per capita then, at present, most farm households live close
to or below this poverty line (Annex 2). At full development, average per
capita income (after deduction of water charges and other taxes) would
increase by between Rs. 450 (US$42) and Rs. 670 (US$62) per annum. The
farmers located at the tail of the distributary systems would experience a
comparably higher income increase than those at the head. Incomes of the
average family on farming units of 1.0 ha or more would exceed the poverty
level. Thus, the project will alleviate poverty for many farmers.

-38-
7.05    A primary concern will be to assist farmers to obtain the other
inputs necessary to generate the incremental crop production possible with
reliable and equitable irrigation. Nonetheless, there will be small farmers
who may be unable to generate a reliable income from crop production to
sustain the family and provide sufficient cash flow to buy inputs for modern
irrigated agriculture. Therefore, in terms of formulating a cost recovery
policy and appropriate water charges, attention must be given to the weaker
elements of the project population which will remain close to or below the
poverty line, even with full development benefits. To achieve this objec-
tive, a socio-economic study of project beneficiaries would be undertaken
once sufficient project works have been completed and operated long enough to
provide a significant data base. The study would Ci) evaluate the extent to
which the weaker elements of the project population are able fully to utilize
the irrigation service and to purchase other inputs necessary to achieve full
development benefits; and (ii) formulate proposals to enable full development
benefits to the project to be achieved in a timely manner. In this respect,
agreements have been reached with GOUP that it would: Ci) carry out base
line socio-economic surveys of farmers benefiting from the project with terme
of reference established in consultation with IDA; and (ii) submit, by July
31, 1986, a report summarizing the results and recommendations of the study
to IDA for its review and comments.
Repayment Capacity of Farmers
7.06    For each farm model (para 7.03), the incremental land rent or project
rent has been estimated. This is defined as the incremental income less
allowances for depreciation, use of own resources (family labor and bullock
power), perceived risk and own management services. The project rent there-
fore measures the net incentive of farmers to participate in the project. If
the entire project rent was taxed away, this would leave a farmer indifferent
to participating in the project. In practice, the project rent is calculated
for a 'typical' farming situation and can only be estimated within broad
tolerances. With the assumptions used in the analysis, the project rent does
not exhibit significant variations among the various farm models. The level
of project rent seems to be influenced primarily by cropping intensity which
tends to be higher on the smaller farms. An average farm of 1.0 ha would
realize a rent of about Rs. 2,500. Since most beneficiaries would be small
or marginal farmers, it may not be desirable that a substantial portion of
the project rent is made available for cost recovery.
Cost Recovery
7.07    Water Charges.  In general, GOUP has been vigilant with respect to
cost recovery in the irrigation sector. Current water rates are charged on a
cropped area basis, and vary from Rs. 87 per ha for kharif foodgrains (other
than paddy) to Rs. 237 per ha for sugarcane (Table T-11). At present, the
revenue from water charges is about Rs. 400 per ha of irrigated area in the
northern sugarcane growing areas, and declines to about Rs. 150 per ha in the
southern parts of the UGC command. The revenue assessment in the UGC command
area was Rs. 78 N (1982/83). Although in recent years, most of the assessed
revenue is collected, records indicate that the irrigated area in under-



-39-
recorded mainly because the irrigation service is of poor quality. The
expenditure for O&M (including establishment charges) in 1982/83 for the UGC
scheme was about Rs. 51 M (Table T-l1). Although revenue exceeds O&M costs
by Rs. 27 M or 5IO% (1982/83), the O&M of the UGC scheme tends to be under-
funded since the scheme is under modernization. In addition to water char-
ges, the Irrigation and Flood Protection Act provides for collection of a
betterment levy for improvements of irrigation service. However, due to
legal difficulties in its enforcement, the Act is currently suspended.
7.08    Other Azricultural Taxes.  Indirect taxation provides the main source
of public revenues from agriculture (about 90%) and is steadily growing in
real terms. The State Government receives income from sales and commodity
taxes, provisions of support services and rural infrastructure, and charges
for selling produce in regulated markets. The revenue from indirect taxation
declines in the UGC command progressively from north to south with the
decrease in farm incomes because of the difference between the northern
sugarcane areas and the southern part of the UGC system. The revenue for the
UGC scheme, averages about Rs. 90 per ha of net CCA.
7.09    The Potential for Increased Recovery.  It is anticipated that at full
development, the average net income per irrigated ha of CCA in the modernized
areas will increase from Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 4,600 and average rent per ha of
CCA from about Rs. 250 to Rs. 2,500. Consequently, there will be a con-
siderable potential for increasing irrigation charges within the project
command.  However, because water rates are uniform throughout the State
irrespective of the irrigation service provided, their level relates to the
repayment capability of those farmers realizing the lowest irrigation
benefits - typically the tail end farmers in traditionally designed
projects.
7.10    The project will be the first attempt by the State to rehabilitate
and modernize a major existing scheme. Nonetheless, on completion of the
first time slice, the modernized command area will constitute only about 4.0%
of the canal irrigated area within the UGC scheme, and less than 0.5% of the
canal irrigated area in the State. Since modernization of the UGC system
will take place over an extended period (about 30 years), GOUP will have to
address the problem of cost recovery from areas served by a modern irrigation
facilities within the command of an existing canal system. It is unlikely
that GOUP will be able to realize the increased potential for revenue from
higher water rates in modernized irrigation projects, unless the principle of
"statewide uniform rates" is amended. This could be done by introducing a
charge system consisting of two or more tiers, with higher water rates in
modernized projects and new irrigation projects designed to modern standards.
There are precedents to such a tier system in India and in UP. For example,
public tubewell irrigation within UP has water charges set considerably
higher than those for gravity canal irrigation, recognizing the operational
costs of public tubewells.
7.11    Timinz Considerations.  The optimal timing for increasing water
charges has to be carefully assessed. A premature increase (i.e. before most
of the farmers realize the incremental benefits) could be undesirable
because: (i) it may discourage farmers (especially tail-enders) from using



-40-
water and could thus reduce irrigation benefits from the society viewpoint
and further aggravate income inequities; (ii) it could be offset by lower
recovery percentages and high administrative costs; and (iii) further large
increases in irrigation charges during project implementation might reduce
farmers' cooperation and delay the attainment of full development. On the
other hand, the negative aspects of a "late" increase. It is also likely
that it would not be feasible to introduce a differential charge system
before sizeable areas within the State are designed and constructed to
improved irrigation standards and are commissioned, successfully operated and
irrigated areas are realizing the potential benefits. The completed areas of
modern irrigation systems would have to be large enough to warrant the legal
an. institutional changes required to set up a new water charge system.
7.12    Conclusion.  The appropriate time to initiate changes in the water
charge system would be after the performance of the project has been con-
firmed and evaluated. Until then the level of charges can be expected to
relate to statewide rather than project considerations. As the method of
water charging would have a considerable effect on the efficiency of water
use at farm level, the implications of alternative methods of water charging
should be carefully assessed before changes can be recommended. To achieve
this objective, a study would be required before practical proposals for
improvements to the present water charge system can be made. This would
include studies of: {i) legal aspects of various methods of recovery (e.g.
introduction of a two or more tier water charge); (ii) other factors affect-
ing recovery of irrigation charges; and (iii) estimates of the incremental
net income and rent accruing to farmers in modernized irrigation projects.
The study would (taking into account statewide implications) formulate an
appropriate water charge system for existing irrigation schemes which are to
be rehabilitated and modernized over an extended time period. In this
respect, agreements have been reached with GOUP that it would (i) on the
basis of appropriate studies, furnish to IDA for its review and comments by
December 31, 1985, a proposal for establishing a water charge system for
modernized irrigated areas within the command area of existing surface
irrigation schemes, which would take into account the efficiency and
reliability of the irrigation service as well as the quantity of water
provided; (ii) taking into account IDA's comments on this proposal, furnish
to IDA for its review and comment not later than September 30, 1986, a
timetable for applying a new water charge system; and (iii) taking into
account IDA's comments, implement the new water charge system in accordance
with this timetable within the project area. In addition, agreements have
been reached with GOUP that it would: (i) continue to set water charges for
surface irrigation systems with regular reviews of the cost of providing the
service, to ensure that revenue covers the average operation and maintenance
costs and a reasonable share of investment costs of new and modernized
irrigation schemes in the project area taking into account the repayment
capacity of irrigation beneficiaries; and (ii) cause the UPSEB to charge the
ID for electricity for augmentation tubewells constructed under the project
on a metered basis.



-41-
Cost and Rent Recovery under the Proiect
7.13    The assumptions made for estimating rent and cost recovery are given
in Annex 2. Under these assumptions, the rent and cost recovery indices
would be about 13% and 41% respectively. Full recovery of the resources
invested in the risk aversion works over a period of 50 years at 12% interest
per annum would require an average annual recovery of about Rs. 70 per ha of
CCA. The cost of modernization of Bulandshahr distributary would require
Rs. 370 per ha of CCA for full repayment. However, given the reliance of
GOUP on indirect taxation, the actual level of rent and cost recovery cannot
be adequately assessed since increased agricultural income would generate
growth in other sectors of the economy and thus additional tax revenue.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Project Impact
8.01    The modernization program of the UGC system is likely to take at
least 30 years to complete, depending on finance available and relative
priorities of other development work in the State. The extended development
period means that substantial investments will be made in common works (such
as main and branch canals) in advance of investments in modernizing canal
distribution systems. However, unlike most major projects to be
rehabilitated, the UGC system has deteriorated to such an extent that exist-
ing irrigation benefits are at risk. Thus major investments have to be made
in common works irrespective of whether the UGC system is modernized. Since
GOUP has planned to rehabilitate the UGC system, the risk aversion works have
been designed (at additional cost) to contribute to the modernization objec-
tives.
8.02    The project impact has therefore been evaluated in terms of three
distinct, but interrelated benefits: (i) risk aversion to protect the exist-
ing irrigation system; (ii) modernizing the main canal; and (iii) modernizing
canal distribution blocks. The project impact can be summarized as follows:
(a) Risk Aversion. The project will reduce the risk of failure in
the main canal head reach (para 3.10). Such failure would have
a catastrophic effect on the UGC command area above the point
where the Madbya Ganga canal joins the system (about 720,000
ha). The project also gives priority to main canal works below
the intersection point of the UG and MG canals so that the
irrigation service to about 300,000 ha commanded by the UG main
canal below mile 118 can be guaranteed (para 3.11).
(b) Impact of Common Works. The risk aversion works and other
common works, such as modernizing the main canal, will have a
long-term direct benefit to the overall UGC scheme (1.2 M ha).
The lined reglacement canal under the project will (i) save
about 240 Mm of seepage losses each year; (ii) remove channel
capacity constraints to the lower parts of the UGC command; and
(iii) improve the managability of the UGC system to benefit all
areas served.



-42-
(c) Distributary Modernization. The rehabilitation and modernization
of the existing works will improve the quantity and quality of
irrigation service. Direct benefits typical of full development
of the UGC system would be obtained in the distributary commands
to be modernized under the project (para 3.14). An additional
direct benefit will be that the sunk investments in the HG canal
system can be more quickly realized once the UGC main canal
(mile 118-148) is completed.
8.03    In addition to direct benefits, the project will demonstrate a prac-
tical way to rehabilitate and modernize existing irrigation schemes which are
at or near the end of their useful life. It will also have an important
social benefit in that, for the first time in the State, there would be a
modern surface irrigation development that can deliver an equitable and
predictable water allocation to each farmer. The improved irrigation service
in the modernized distributary commands will demonstrate the impact that can
be obtained from this level of investment. This will include substantial
reduction of the farmer's risk and the provision of incentives for complemen-
tary investments, such as higher input applications and introduction of
higher value crops that require a dependable water supply. Finally, in
addition to direct agricultural benefits, the project includes various
institution building components which will assist the ID to develop its
capability to plan, design, implement and manage irrigation schemes (paras
3.24-3.27).
8.04    The project impact of modernizing distributary canal commands in
terms of increased agricultural production, employment generated and farm
families benefited is summarized below:

and lining of the main canal.
h/ Assumes modernization of the canal system over about 270,000 ha.
Beneficiaries
8.05    The risk aversion components would directly benefit about 1.7 H farm
families whose main source of income would be at risk without the project and
would indirectly benefit a large number of landless laborers. Beneficiaries
would also include owners and employees of the extensive agricultural serv-
ices that depend on the existing UGC system. Within the distributary blocks
to be fully modernized, the project would directly benefit about 53,000 farm



-43-
families, most of which are small or marginal farmers. A considerable
increase in employment would be generated by project construction works and
by increases in agricultural production. Unskilled labor employed in con-
struction work over the next 30 years would be equivalent to about 90,000
full time jobs. The increase of irrigated area and improvement of the exist-
ing system would result in an increase of direct employment. At full
development of the UGC system, the increased demand for project labor for
agricultural production would amount to about 25 M man/days per annum (equiv-
alent to about 110,000 full time jobs). It is estimated that about two thirds
of the demand would be supplied by hired labor, the majority of which would
be landless. The development would also generate additional employment in
local non-farming sectors such as marketing, transport and processing. Thus,
the project would substantially decrease unemployment and the high level of
underemployment in the UGC command area.
Project Analysis
8.06    Only agricultural production benefits have been considered in the
economic analysis. Economic prices for tradeable inputs and outputs are
based on IBRD price projections expressed in 1984 prices. The financial
prices of non-traded inputs and outputs have been adjusted by appropriate
conversion factors, to bring them to the same price basis as the traded ones.
The shadow price of agricultural labor was assumed at 67Z of the present
average wage rates for nired labor. Detailed assumptions on economic
analysis are given in Annex 2.
Justification for Risk Aversion Wnirks
8.07    A technical discussion of the risk aversion works is presented in
Annex 15, SDV; the assumptions used in the justification for risk aversion
works are given in Annex 2. Site evidence indicates that structures on the
UG main canal are liable to failure in the near future but factors which
could cause failure cannot be quantified in terms of a probability indicator.
Under the circumstances, justification for the risk aversion works has been
evaluated by comparing the economic costs of the works with the foregone
benefits which would result if there was a failure. The main assumptions
are as follows:
(a) Costs of Risk Aversion Works. The risk aversion works serve a
multi-purpose function (para 8.02). Under the project, the capacity
of the head reach of the UG main canal would be increased from about
294 to 350 cumecs for operational considerations which relate to
modernization of the entire UGC system. The incremental cost of
providing this extra capacity has been excluded from the risk aver-
sion component, and incorporated as part of the modernization costs
on a pro-rata basis related to canal capacity. Thus, for evaluating
impact, about 842 of investment costs of the main canal works have
been apportioned to risk aversion, with 16Z charged to rehabilitation
and modernization of the overall UGC scheme. On this assumption, the
economic costs of risk aversion works, adjusted by the CCF, are
estimated at Rs. 941 M (US$87.1 M) in April 1984 prices, including
physical contingencies but excluding price contingencies and the cost



-44-
of land acquisition (Table 2, Annex 2). The present value of the
risk aversion costs would be about Re 443 M based on the project
implementation schedule for these works.
(b) The effects of a failure. The economic benefits to risk aversion
works would result from preventing return of a substantial part of
UGC command area (about 400,000 ha) to temporary rainfed conditions
supplemented by whatever groundwater resources that can be utilized
until the damaged works could be repaired or replaced. The main
production loss would be to sugarcane (about 20% reduction in area
and a similar reduction in yield) and the consequential effect on
the sugar processing industries. The net value of production, if
irrigation is discontinued, would decrease (i) by a minimum of about
Rs. 480 H per annum in financial prices or Rs. 510 M (US$47 M) in
economic prices in the year of a major failure; and (ii) in sub-
sequent years until replacement works are completed, by about Rs 880
H per annum in financial prices or Rs 850 M (US$79 H) in economic
prices.
In addition to the loss of direct benefits, a failure, even if temporary,
would have a devastating effect on farm incomes and employment and on
indirect benefits generated from agriculture. Farm employment would decrease
by about 7.1 M man/days per annum (equivalent to about 29,700 full-time
jobs). The demand for hired labor in agriculture and other activities would
decrease and there would be a major contraction in all sectors of the local
economy, depressing wages and profits over much of western UP.
8.08    Timing of Risk Aversion Works.  Although deterioration of the struc-
tures at risk is obvious, the rate of deterioration, probability and type of
failure at any point in time cannot be quantified. To evaluate the conse-
quences of undertaking the risk aversion program too early, an analysis has
been made to assess how long the existing structures would have to last
without failure so that the forgone direct agricultural benefits would equal
the replacement costs (both estimated to net present value discounted at
12%). This evaluation confirms that an immediate replacement program is
justified if failure were to occur within the next 20 years. The technical
judgement is that the structures are unlikely to last that long.
8.09    The above analysis relates to the existing UGC scheme and does not
take account of modernization. The modernization program will involve major
investments and result in farmers adopting agricultural objectives which
require much greater investments in inputs in response to a reliable and
timely irrigation service. If the UGC system is to be modernized, a prereq-
uisite is the removal of the present risk of failure in the main canal. It
has tberefore been concluded that risk of failure is unacceptable since loss
of production and income due to failure would be catastrophic. A failure
would inevitably result in considerable social unrest, particularly as the
extent of the risk is common local knowledge. Although the replacement of
the risk aversion works is planned to take about 12 years, this program could
be accelerated if any of the works at risk shoved an increasing rate of
deterioration.

Canal Modernization Components
8.10    The rehabilitation and modernization program for the UGC system
consists of two parts: ti) main canal modernization which have an impact
throughout the UGC command; and (ii) distributary blocks where benefits are
confined within the distributary command area. Under the project, works
under item (i) above include sections of main canal required to alleviate
risks to the existing UGC system (mile 3-22 and 118-148) and initial works
below mile 148. Thus, except for the small investment below mile 148, the
main canal works must be undertaken whether or not the overall UGC scheme is
modernized. Thus, apart from risk aversion, the main canal investment will
improve the qualit- and quantity of irrigation service throughout the UGC
system as measured at the head regulators of the canal distribution system.
The improvements to the irrigation service would result from lining and
improving the operational efficiency of the canal.
Main Canal Modernization
8.11   Analysis Assumptions.  The economic costs of the main canal have been
apportioned 84% to risk aversion and 16% to modernization to reflect the
multi-purpose benefits of such works (para 8.07). The economic costs of all
civil works, the canal communication system, land acquisition, administration
and engineering, operation and maintenance have been included in the deriva-
tion of the ERR. The benefits attributable to main canal modernization would
result from saving of seepage losses and improvement to operational
efficiency. At present, the unproductive use of water supplied to the UG
main canal averages about 28Z of the annual head diversion, with seepage
accounting for about 11% of the loss (Annex 6, SDV).  With lining and
improved regulation, the main canal would operate at about 90% efficiency,
compared to a present efficiency of about 72Z. Witbin the UGC command area
which will benefit from main canal modernization, irrigation demand will
always exceed supply throughout the year, including the critical period of
rice planting during the kharif season (para 3.05). It can therefore be
assumed that saved water supplies in the main canal vould translate into an
equivalent increase in irrigated area; the present crop mix and yields would
remain substantially unchanged since the increased water supplies would be
relatively small.
8.12    Economic Rate of Return.  Discounting the apportioned cost and
benefit streams over a 50 year period, canal modernization gives an estimated
ERR of 19% and a net present value at 12% discount rate of Rps 370/ha over
the area commanded by the UGC scheme. These results indicate a clear
economic viability for modernizing the main canal sections included under the
project. The cost and benefit streams are given in Table T-13. Benefits
attributable to the completion of the MGC system (para 8.02), which would
augment the present kharif water supply downstream mile 118 of the UGC main
canal, have been excluded from the economie analysis.



Canal Distributary Blocks
8.13    Analysis Assumptions.  Within canal distributary blocks, water saved
through lining and improved regulation and from ATWs would be used vithin
the distributary command area. Extra water supplies available from coumon
works would be distributed throughout the UCC command to achieve the alloca-
tion pattern described in para 3.06. Since it can be assumed that the two
distributary blocks to be completely modernized under the project (about
39,000 ha) will be typical of the overall development of the UGC system, the
analysis has been undertaken tor these distributary commands. The economic
costs of all civil works, equipment, land acquisition, administration and
engineering, and OEM have been included in the derivation of the ERR.
Incremental benefits from distributary modernization assume that: (i) the
'future without' project situation includes the impact attributed to addi-
tional water supplies from common vorks (para 8.10); and (ii) each dis-
tributary block would be modernized and operated with an apportionated head
discharge equivalent to that available when the UGC system is fully developed
(para 3.06). Thus, an analysis of canal distributary modernization can be
undertaken independent of when thc works are completed in the overall UGC
development program. Benefit build-up relates to the assumed phasing of
modernized areas coming under irrigation, a three-year transition from
present to future cropping intensities, and a more gradual build-up of yields
and input use including adoption of high yielding crop varieties. The cost
of pumping for the ATWs is based on the estimated marginal cost of elec-
tricity for Uttar Pradesh.
8.14    Economic Rate of Return.  Discounting the cost and benefit streams
over a 50 year period, the estimated ERR is 22X and the present value at 122
discount rate is Rps 3,700/ha. The results indi.ate clear economic viability
for the modernization of a typical unit of the eistribution system under the
project. The cost and benefit streams for the analysis are given in Table
T-13.
8.15    Economics of Canal Lining.  Lining of the distribution system down to
and including watercourse channels is an essential project component since,
apart from groundwater development, lining is the only way to increase water
supplies. The decision to line canals was made after examination of several
planning and design alternatives during project preparation. These alterna-
tives included whether all or part of a typical distributary system should be
lined and the types of lining which should be used. In estimating the ERR of
canal modernization, incremental benefits are largely due to those generated
by the reduction of seepage losses. However, there will be substantial other
benefits from lining which cannot be properly quantified. These include: (i)
the greater flexibility in operating a lined canal system, particularly to
serve small and varying crop areas, and to provide water for early kharif
rice nurseries; (ii) the greater reliability of water supply; (iii) the
possibility to spread irrigation benefits equitably and over a large area;
and (iv) the relative cost advantage of reduction in channel cross section
when a canal is lined. Another important benefit from lining saller chan-
nels is that it enables management to be more effective, in that individual
farmers cannot easily tamper with the system. This would help overcome a
major problem with the existing system, namely that local discipline has
virtually broken down due to the unreliability of the irrigation service.
Detailed analysis of the present conveyance and operational efficiency of



-47-
the UGC system is given in Annex 6, SDV. Since at present there are no lined
distributary systems designed to project standards in western UP, the likely
impact of lining has been estimated from data collected from Bank-supported
programs elsewhere in India, where similar canal systems have been modern-
ized.  An important M&E objective of the project will be to confirm the
benefits attributed to canal lining of the various elements of a distributary
system.
Sensitivity Analysis
8.16    A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effects of
deviation from the main assumptions made for determining the economic
viability of the project. The measure of sensitivity used, the 'switching
value', is the value of the variable tested which would reduce the present
value of the project's net incremental benefits discounted at 12% (the
estimated opportunity cost of capital) to zero. The results are summarized
in the following table, with additional tests presented in Annex 2.

Changes in other parameters, such as particular values of conversion factors,

Proiect Risk
8.17    The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that only large
deviations from the basic assumptions would make the project economically not
viable. However, the net benefits and/or the equity of their distribution
could be affected by the following specific events:
(a) Surface Water Supply. GOUP could reduce supplies to the UGC system
by diverting Ganga water to other new and existing projects in west-
ern UP. This risk is small, since the UGC system has a long estab-
lished users' right, and influential farmers would react strongly if
there was a reduction in their existing irrigation supplies. In
addition, GOUP has given an undertaking that it would maintain the
present surface water allocations to the UGC system (para 3.06).
(b) ManaReability of the UGC Scheme. The deterioration of the existing
system is such that many farmers have ceased to respect the need of
discipline for the common good. Present works, which are easy to
tamper with, would be replaced under modernization of the distribu-
tion system. Lining of the minor canal system would make it possible
to identify the miscreants and, more important, make the system
operation predictable and thus manageable.
(c) System Failure. A basic project objective is to avert risks to parts
of the existing UGC scheme but failure could occur before replacement
works are commissioned. Such a failure would be an unavoidable risk,
since the project is planned to alleviate identified risks as quickly
as possible. Nonetheless, the on-going detailed preparation of risk
aversion works would minimize the foregone benefits to the existing
irrigated areas in the case of a failure.
(d) Institutional Capabilitv. GOUP may have difficulty in recruiting
adequate staff qualified for macro-planning and design, monitoring
and evaluation, and the management principles (O&M) of completed
works. These difficulties would be considerably reduced when GOUP
retains an Advisory Planning Group (para 3.27) and provides housing
for such departmental staff (para 3.25).
8.18    Agricultural Objectives.  A possible risk is that the applied
research program either fails to develop techniques for rice that match the
crop water requirements and water availability on which the project cropping
patterns are based or that these techniques are so difficult or time consum-
ing that farmers would be reluctant to adopt them. Apart from equity and
income distribution problems, this may cause some upstream farmers to attempt
to take more than their share of water to maintain their rice area. There-
fore otber farmers would have to replace rice with lower value crops. This
risk ji minor and production increases due to the project have been conserva-
tively estimated. It is therefore concluded that the risk of not attaining



-49-
the assumed crop yield levels and the design cropping patterns (or something
similar in terms of farm income) is small. Moreover, the principal tasks of
the applied research program would be to develop land preparation techniques
to reduce percolation losses in rice paddies and to identify animal-drawn
tillage implements to prepare land adequately for wheat after rice.
8.19    Although the risk of GOUP not proceeding with project works after
completion of this time slice was considered in the sensitivity analysis, it
is regarded as small.  GOUP is fully committed to modernization of the UGC
command area and, with the existing sunk cost and those under the project,
the economic viability of the remaining works would be high. It is therefore
expected that if future financial constraints result in a reduction in the
StateCs overall irrigation development program, GOUP would continue with the
implementation of follow-up phases of this project until its completion.
Thus, the project risks do not exceed those associated with irrigation
projects of similar size and type in India.
Environmental Effects
8.20    The main water-related diseases in UP are malaria and typhoid.  The
construction of drainage facilities and the lining of canals in the project
command would tend to reduce areas of stagnant water which can be breeding
grounds for mosquitoes. However, although the project should have only
beneficial environmental effects, an agreement has been reached with GOUP
that it would take all measures as may be considered necessary to minimize
the risk of malaria and other water-related diseases within the project area.

31  Risk Equivalent - Expected gross value of production x farmers' risk aversion
factor x coefficient of variation of yields. The risk aversion factor has been
assumed as 1.7 in the Bulandshahr distributary and 1.8 in Harduaganj and Machua
distributaries in the 'without project' situation, and a uniform factor of 1.3 in
the 'with project' situation. The coefficient of yield variation has been
assumed as 30Z in the 'without project' siuation and a uniform rate of 202 in
the 'with project' situation.
Al The reward for management and entrepreneurship is primarily a premium for the
special skills required in farm management. Consequently, it has been assumed
that the "management fee" is equal to 10% of the net returns.
5/ Project rent relates to the incremental production on land developed under the
project that can achieve full project benefits.

UPPER GANGA IRRIGATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Assumptions for Economic and Financial Analysis
Price and Conversion Factors
1.      General.  The economic prices of major traded agricultural com-
modities (at farm gate) were derived from the IBRD world market prices (1984
projected through 1995) expressed in 1984 currency values with appropriate
adjustments for freight, handling and processing. Non-traded foodgrains and
other non-traded goods and services were brought to a common basis with the
traded goods and services through the use of conversion factors. Three
conversion factors have been used: (i) Standard Conversion Factor (SCF); (ii)
Construction Conversion Factor (CCF); and (iii) Food Conversion Factor (FCF).
Details on the derivation of the conversion factors and their use in
described below. The opportunity cost of capital (OCC) was assumed at 12..
A standard exchange rate of US$1.0 to Rs 10.8 was used to convert prices
expressed in US dollars to local currency values. The assumptions used to
derive the estimates are described below.
2.      Standard Conversion Factor.  For economic analysis, costs and
benefits of the project have been evaluated at world market prices in order
to measure India's net economic benefits from the project. This requires
certain price adjustments, since many items are not traded in the world
markets and the prices of others are affected by tariffs and trade restric-
tions. To make them comparable, a SCF have been applied to the price of
non-traded goods. In the absence of trade restrictions, the SCF can be
estimated by using the following formula:
SCF  -              + M
X + Sx + m+ Tm
where: X - export value (f.o.b.);
M - import value (c.i.f.);
S - subsidies on exports;
T - taxeL an duties on imports
For the period since 1970, this calculation has produced a SCF of 0.86.
However, since this method does not take into consideration quantitative
restrictions on trade, the estimates derived provide only an upper limit for
the SCF. The Indian Planning Comiss ion recommends to use in the evaluation
of industrial projects, conversion factors for foreign exchange and untraded



-74-
ANNEX 2
Page 2
goods that imply a SCF of about 0.75. This estimate is considered to be
nearer to the lover limit of the real SCF. Consequently, a SCF of 0.8 has
been used in the economic analysis.
3.      Construction Conversion Factor.  The construction of project civil
works require the use of a mixture nf equipment, materials, and skilled and
unskilled labor:
(a) Traded Component: This component includes capital-intensive
works which require imported materials. Hence the conversion
factor of 1.00 has been used. It is estimated that about
5% of the construction costs fall under this category.
(b)  Non-Traded Component.  This component includes works that
require skilled labor and locally manufactured materials.
The SCF of 0.80 has been used as the conversion factor for
these works which include about 45% of construction costs.
(c) Unskilled Labor. A ratio of economic to financial wages equal
to that assumed for agricultural labor (67%) has been assumed
for unskilled construction labor (para 6). It is estimated
that the cost of unskilled labor constitutes about 50Z of the
total construction costs.
The weighted average of these conversion factors would be as follows:
Conversion Factor      Weitht
Traded Items                       1.00              0.05
Non-Traded Items                   0.80              0.45
Unskilled Labor                    0.67              0.50
Construction Costs                 0.75              1.00
(weighted average)
Thus, a CCF of 0.75 has been adopted for converting the cost of construction
wc-ks from financial to economic prices.
4.      Economic Prices of Commodities and Foodirain Conversion Factor (FCF).
The economic prices for traded commodities such as rice, wheat, oilseeds and
sugarcane were derived by using border prices in US dollars according to IBRD
commodity projections and converted to local currency values at the standard
exchange rate. The domestic cost components (such as local transport, han-
dling and marketing charges) were adjusted by a SCF of 0.80. The economic
prices for non-traded foodgrain (maize, pulses and barley were assumed to be
non-traded) were derived by applying a FCF jj to the present financial
prices. The recent sharp downward revision of IBRD agricultural commodity
price forecasts bave brought the world market price of wheat and rice to
1/ Estimated as a ratio of wheat and rice production valued at economic
prices to wheat and rice production valued at average domestic market
prices.



-75-
ANNEX 2
Page 3
parity with  Ae domestic market prices in India.  As a result, a FCF of 1.0
has been use1 in the economic analysis.
5.      Prices cf Agricultural Inputs.  Fertilizers have been valued at the
projected world market price.  Pesticides and insecticides have been assumed
to be traded.  In order to make an allowance for taxes and subsidies and for
the cost of transport and marketing, a conversion factor of 0.95 has been
applied to their financial prices. The economic price of seed and miscel-
laneous charges has been assumed to approximate their financial price. The
economic price of farm power (bullock pair with operator) was derived from
going daily rental rates, adjusted by the SCF. A sunmary of economic and
financial prices is presented in Table 1.
6.      Opportunity Cost of Labor.  It is estimated that demand for labor
would not caange appreciably as a result of the project since agricalture
wages in the project area have been amongst the highest in UP. Based on the
available information from the rural areas in the State and experience else-
where in India, the following assumptions have been adopted for estimates of
marginal cost of farm labor:
(a) At the slack employment periods, the marginal cost of labor
would equal the value of additional consumption needed for family
members to undertake field work (Rs. 0.90 per man/day), 1/ plus
the value of foregone activities such as home improvement
estimated at about Rs. 3.20 per man/day.
(b) As the demand for labor intensifies before the peak seasons
(transplanting of rice and harvesting), the marginal cost would rise
from the minimum average market rate of about Rs. 8.0 per man/day to
about Rs. 10.0 per man/day.
gc) At the time of peak labor demand, the marginal cost would be
equal to the maximum market rate of about Rs. 12.0 man/day.
(d)  lihen the employment is equal to or larger than the estimated
supply of farm labor from the area, the la3or would be drawn
from non-farm activities and supplemented by migrants.
At the time of peak labor demand, the marginal cost would be
equal to the market rate for such periods of about Rs. 12.0 man/day.
The SCF and the FCF (for adjustments under item b above) and appropriate
weights were applied to the various marginal wage rates resulting in an
average ecenomic wage of Rs. 6.0. When compared to the financ al wage rates,
this is equivalent to an unskilled labor conversion factor of about 0.67.
1/ Estimated as 75% of the current average daily consumption of foodgrains
(560 grams per day).

Present Situation
8.      A review of the present UGC system in terms of efficiency and opera-
tional performance, availability of surface and groundwater resources, and
agricultural production is given in Annexes 6, 7, 8 and 9, SDV. The review
innicates the following:
(a) The Risk Element. The original design capacity of 6,750 cusecs at
the head of UCC system has been increased to about 10,500 cusecs at
present (Annex 5, SDV). This has resulted in excessive stress on the
Solani aqueduct and three other major cross-drainage structures on
the first 22 miles of UG main canal. A failure of any one of the
structures is a real possibility and has been considerably aggravated
by the lack of proper maintenance (Annex 15, SDV).
(b)  The Existing Canal Distribution System.  Apart from the risk of
failure, a basic problem with the existing UGC system is its low
operational and conveyance efficiency. It is estimated that on
average from every cubic meter of water diverted at headworks at
Hardwar only about 0.2 m3 reaches the farmers' fields. As in most
Indian irrigation schemes, the irrigation distribution system below
the watercourse outlet (commanding about 50 ha) is inefficient.
(c) The Consequences for ARriculture. The existing UGC system cannot
respond to the demands of modern agriculture. The potential for
improvement can be seen in the northern part o' the system, which,
due to its favorable location, benefits from extra irrigation sup-
plies. On the other hand, farmers in the southern part of the com-
mand receive the residual irrigation water supplies. Consequently,
farm incomes in the north average about twice that in the south of
the UGC command. Indeed, in some of the southern parts of the com-
mand, waterlogging can be a concern when excess irrigation supplies
are routed there. What is true for the system wide inequities also
applies to individual distributary and watercourse outlet commands.
(d) The Absence of Discipline. Because of the deterioration of the
irrigation system, the ID is unwilling or unable to enforce dis-
cipline in water allocation among farmers. The North India Canal and
Drainage Act (1874), as amended in 1973,is often ignored and the
efficiency of water use suffers still further. The breakdown of
order is particularly apparent in water-short areas.
Risk Aversion Component
9.      The primary objective 3f the risk aversion component is to ensure the
continuity of irrigation in a command area which is already irrigated rather
than to develop new areas. Its main economic benefits would come from
preventing the project area from temporarily reverting to rainfed conditions.
10.     The Effects of Failure.  The technical status of the four cross
drainage structures is described in Annex 15, SDV. Failure would most likely
occur during the second half of the monsoon period due to high floods in one
of the four torrent rivers that cross the main canal between mile 3 and 22.
The economic consequences of a failure are expected as follows:



-77-
ANNEX 2
Page 5
(a) Areas Affected. The interruption of water supply would directly
affect the upper 400,000 ha of the UGC command area which has no
alternative way of receiving a surface water supply. At mile 118,
the UG main canal is joined by Madhya Ganga (MG) main canal; there-
fore once the MGC is operational, there would be an alternative way
of supplying the UGC command from the Ganga, thus protecting about
500,000 ha. In addition, 300,000 ha below mile 118 that are
presently supplied through the Mat Feeder (off-take at mile 110 on
UGC) could also be directly affected; after completion of MGC
(expected 1988), this area would be able to receive canal water from
an alternative supply source on the river Ganga (Map IBRD 17648R).
However, since this would occur well before completion of the risk
aversion works under the project (1996), this area would be affected
equally in the 'future with' and 'future without' project situations.
(b) Production Loss in Kharif. At the time of likely failure, rice and
sugarcane yields would be reduced by about 60Z and 15% respectively;
other kharif crops would yield on average about 10% less than if
irrigation supplies continued. This would result in an average loss
of about Rs 500/ha in the upper 400,000 ha of the UGC command area.
(c) Production Loss in Rabi and Zaid. The area planted to wheat would
decline by about 50% and yields would diminish also by about 50Z.
Low value, drought resistant crops would be substituted for wheat
and other high value crops. The sugarcane area would decline by
about 20% and a fodder shortage is likely to develop. Zaid cropping
would no; be possible except for areas served by tubewells. The
combined loss in the rabi and zaid seasons would amount to abcut
Rs/ha 700 in the upper 400,000 ha of the UGC command.
id) Permanent Loss. If the canal water supply could not be resumed
within a year, kharif crops would be planted later and yields would
further decline. The decrease in the net value of production, if
irrigation is discontinued through a whole annual cropping cycle, is
estimated at about Rs. 850 M in economic prices in the northern
400,000 ha which cannot be served through the MGC system and about
Rs. 380 M in the 300,000 ha bupplied through the Mat Feeder. The
possibiiity of the latter loss would be eliminated by the completion
of the MGC system.
(e) Indirect Consequences. Farmers would try to substitute for the lost
canal water by increased investment in private tubewells and an
increase in pumping of existing private wells. However, investment
in private groundwater development would be restricted by implementa-
tion capacity and availability of investment finance. The demand
for farm labor would decrease. Losses in agriculture would set off a
negative multiplier effect in other sectors of the local economy.
The sugar processing industry and other agriculture related
industries would be particularly affected. However, these consequen-
ces have not been taken into account in the analysis.

11.     Costs of Risk Aversion Component.  At present the ID undertakes only
emergency maintenance on the four cross drainage structures, primarily
because the UG main canal is operated almost continuously. While the ID has
planned for the ultimate replacement of all the UGC system, regular main-
tenance is underfunded (particularly with respect to major works). The
economic costs of risk azersion works, adjusted by the CCF, are estimated at
Rs. 941 M in April 1984 prices, including physical contingencies, but exclud-
ing price contingencies and the cost of land acquisition (Table 2). Under
the project, the capacity of the UG main canal will be increased from about
9,000 to 12,500 cusecs for various operational considerations, which relate
to modernization of the overall UGC system. The incremental costs of provid-
ing for this extra capacity have been excluded from the risk aversion com-
ponent and incorporated as part of the costs of modernization on a pro-rata
basis, related to canal capacity. The present value of the replacement costs
on the proposed work schedule would therefore be about Rs. 443 M and far less
than one year loss of agricultural production (Rs. 850 M). The replacement
of the risk aversion works is planned to take about 12 years but this program
could be accelerated if any of the works at risk showed an increasing rate of
deterioration.
12.     Timizng of Replacement Works.  Although deterioration of the struc-
tures is obvious, the rate of deterioration and probability of failure at any
point in time cannot be quantified. However, it has been assessed that risk
of failure is unacceptably high and that losses of production and income due
to failure would be catastrophic. A large number of farmers would be
affected and failure would inevitably result in considerable social unrest,
particularly now that the extent of the risk is common local knowledge. The
comparison of replacement costs and foregone agriculture benefits for the
period required to replace the works at risk have been estimated in terms of
net present value (discounted at 12%). This evaluation confirms that an
immediate commencement of replacement works is justified if it is predicted
that a failure could occur within the next 20 years. The conclusive techni-
cal judgment is that the structures are unlikely to last for that period.
Finally, the modernization of the canal distribution system will involve
major investment-, and result in farmers adopting agricultural objectives
which require much greater investments in inputs and assume a reliable,
timely irrigation service. Clearly if the UGC system is to be modernized, a
prerequisite is the removal of the present risk of failure in the main canal.
Modernization of Main Canal
13.     Present Conveyance Efficiency.  The characteristics and performance
of the existing UG main canal are analysed in Annex 6, SDV. The wettVd
surface of the main canal at full supply level (FSL) is about 132 Nft with
wetted perimeters ranging from about 100 ft at the tail to more than 240 ft
near the head. Seepage losses have been estimated on long reaches of the
canal as part of the feasibility study for the project. The seepage loss
rate is about 8.5 cusecs/Mft   aad with the total wetted perimeter at FSL for
the entire main canal of 132 Mft implies a loss rate of 1,122 cusecs.
Expressed as a portion of the diversion capacity at the head of 10,500
cusecs, this loss is about 11X of the diverted water, indicating a conveyance
efficiency of about 90% at FSL.

ANNEX 2

14.     An attempt has been made to estimate total conveyance losses (seepage
and operational) on the main canal by difference, using a gross balance
derived from ID records (data from 1971-1979) of total volume diverted
annually and by seasons to the main canal head, and declining diversions into
branches, distributaries, escapes and deliveries to the LGC system. This
water balance gives an overall conveyance efficiency of about 72%. The high
losses result from (i) the canal flows at less than FSL for most of the year
(particularly in rabi and zaid) which implies a higher loss rate as a propor-
tion of flow diverted, and (ii) unaccounted operational losses.
15.     Modernization Benefits.  The planning, design and management prin-
ciples of the rehabilitated and modernized UG main canal are given in Annex
10, SDV. The modernization of the main canal would result in a significant
improvement in the overall conveyance efficiency. The seepage losses in the
main canal at FSL would be reduced from 11% at present to about 2%. The
constraints in the conveyance capacity at the tail of the canal would be
remove.-. Moreover, new control structures and canal communication system
would reduce the presently high operational losses. The overall conveyance
efficiency of the main canal would increase from the present 72% to about
90%.
16.     The savings of water as a result of higher conveyance efficiency of
the modernized main canal would be used in the lower part of the UGC system
commanding about 600,000 ha (below the sugarcane zone). This will increase
the quantity of water in the tail end of the delivery system and improve the
reliability and predictability of the irrigation service. The impact of the
works has been assumed to be proportionate to the rate of progress in lining
the main canal. Since the demand for irrigation in an average year would
always exceed supply it has been assumed that the increment in the overall
conveyance efficiency would translate into an equivalent increase in
irrigated area with the cropping pattern and yield levels unchanged.
17.     The Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value.  Discounting the
apportioned capital costs adjusted by the CCF, including physical contingen-
cies and the opportunity cost of land and the benefit streams expressed in
1984 constant prices gives an ERR of 19% and a NPV of Rs. 257.3 M. The cost
and benefit streams are given in Table 7.
Distributary Modernization.
18.     Crop Budgets and Cropping Patterns.  Assessments of crop yields and
cropping patterns, for the 'future with' as well as 'future without' project
situations, were based on (i) farm surveys in the project areas; (ii) yield
statistics; and (iii) direct information from the field. Project yields
represent an estimate of average crop yields which can be expected in an
average year, assuming satisfactory supporting services, (including an effec-
tive agricultural extension service).  At present, the most imortant crops
are wheat, sugarcane and paddy which each account for about 20% of total
revenue generated and the intensities of these crops are not expected to
change significantly with modernization. Care has been taken to exclude from
the economic analysis those benefits which would result from completion of
the MGC system which will augment kharif water supply in the UG main canal
below mile 118.

ANNEX 2

19.     Direct Benefits.  Estimates of crop production, yields, inputs and
farm incomes at 'present', 'future without' and 'future with' project situa-
tions are based on the crop yields and production input data given in Table
3, and on the following assumptions:
(a) Crop Yields and Inputs. A five-year build-up period has been assumed
for transition of yield levels from the 'present' to 'future with'
project situation. The build-up rate was based on historic produc-
tivity trends. It was also assumed that crop yields in the 'future
without' project situation would increase from present yield levels
by about 10% in the next eight years.
(b) Cropping Intensities. Experience from irrigation projects elsewhere
in India suggest that increases in cropping intensity to the full
development level will be faster than increases in crop yields. A
build-up period of three years has therefore been assumed for transi-
tion from 'present' to 'future with' project intensities. The
'future without' project cropping pattern is also expected to change
mainly due to the completion of NGC (Table T-6, Main Report). A
prerequisite to attain the rice area postulated under the project
would be reduction of percolation losses in ricefields. Suitable
cultural practices would be formulated under the adaptive research
program. The success of this program presents a small risk since
equivalent programs on similar soils in other parts of the
Indo-Gangetic Plain have achieved this research objective. The
program would mainly entail identification of the right farm imple-
ments and techniques for their use on the farmers' fields.
gc) Rate of Modernization. The rate of completion of modernized irriga-
tion blocks under the project was based on the current implementation
proposals of the ID.
The summary of the expected build-up rates is as follows:
Rate of Change              Year    1   2    3   4    5   6    7    8   9   10

20.     Crop and Farm Budgets.  Using project yields and production input
data (Table 2), individual crop budgets at both financial and economic prices
(Tables 4 and 5 respectively) have been calculated for the main crops for
the 'present' situation and the 'future without' and 'future with' project
situation at full development. Table 6 gives the average crop budget for the
various seasonal cropping patterns and for a typical cropping calendar.
21.     Modernization Benefit Streams.  Based on the assumptions given in
para 15 above, an incremental benefit stream have been estimated for Har-
duaganj distributary command which is typical of distributaries to be modern-
ized under the project (Table 8).
22.     Costs of Distributary Nodernization.  The capital costs of all civil
works within a typical distributary command including the capital costs of
the augmentation tubevells, charges for engineering and administration and
physical contingencies were based on April 1984 contract rates adjusted by
the CCF. Land acquisition requirements under the project are small except
for the main canal replacement. The land lost to agriculture production as a
result of construction was valued at the net economic return per unit area
under the 'future without' project situation. The net return foregone each
year was treated as a recurrent project cost.
23.     Operation and Maintenance Costs.  In 1982/83, rhe budget allocation
for O&M of the existing UGC system was about Rs. 66 per irrigated ha (or 43
Rs/ha of GCA). This provision included costs of establishment and routine
works but excluded special repairs such as damage or failure of individual
structures which in recent years have averaged about Rs. 20 per irrigated
hectare. Recent studies have indicated that about Rs. 100/ha would be needed
to adequately provide for effective operation and preventive maintenance.
However, for the purpose of the analysis it has been assumed that there would
be no incremental cost over present O&M costs of the existing UGC canal
system as estimated by the ID. .] The average annual operation costs of ATWs
as well as maintenance requirements were based on experience from the
on-going State tubevell program (Annex 12, SDV).
j1/ Under the project, a detailed study will be made of the management
requirements of the UGC scheme including the assessment of realistic O&M
costs so that the system can provide the irrigation service necessary to
achieve the predicted project benefits (Annex 10, SDV).

24.     The Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value.  Based on the
above assumptions, the ERR and the NPV were estimated for the two modernized
distributaries. Discounting the cost and benefit streams over 50 years at
12X discount rate gives the following results:
Typical Distributary Command Area          ERR            NPV
(Rs/ha)
-   Bulandshahr                     18%          2,470
-   Harduaganj                      25%         4,330
The cost and benefits for the two distributaries to be fully modernized
under the project are given in Table 9.
25.     The Economics of Canal  Lining.  The only benefits quantified and
used in the economic analysis are production increases as a result of expan-
sion of irrigated area and increased crop yields due to reduced seepage
losses from canal lining. Full benefits from canal modernization are assumed
to accrue by the fifth year after completion of works. This is a conserva-
tive assumption since in the normal operation of the canal system, the ID and
farmers served, both operate and plan to accommodate substantial year-to-year
variations in water supplies available in the UGC system. Additional
benefits, such as reduced waterlogging and deep percolation, less water
travel time, improved op rational efficiency, and ease of management have not
been quantified or included in project benefits. Seepage loss reductions
fr m canal lining are conservatively estimated to average about 6.5 cusecs/M
ft of wetted perimeter (Annex 10, SDV).
26.     Economics of Watercourse Modernization.  Benefits include reduction
in seepage losses, improved operation, more reliable water deliveries, and
more equitable distribution of water within each watercourse CCA. However,
benefits are estimated mainly on the basis of increased irrigated area
resulting from reduced seepage losses. Most farmers in the UGC command area
are fully accustomed to irrigation, and watercourse improvements on each chak
will be clearly visible to farmers. The increase in stream size of water
deliveries will be apparent, particularly in watercourse tail areas, as soon
as watercourse modernization works are completed. Benefits from the works
for each chak will therefore start to accrue by the first year following
completion of the watercourse.
27.     Economics of Au2mentation Tubewells.  ATWs under the project are
expected to add about 50 !-4m of water to the UGC system at full development.
The existing UGC canal system can easily accommodate this amount of addi-
tional water and farmers can readily use it. Since there has been no pre-
vious experience of conjunctive surface and groundwater use in the project
area and the additional supply of groundwater from ATWs will be small com-
pared to surface water supplies, ATWs have aot been evaluated separately from
other investments under the project. However, the marginal value of conjunc-
tive groundvater use will be high since the ATWs can be operated at full
capacity to supplement surface supplies when river flows are low or at peak
irrigation demand periods. The ATW program has been considered a pilot
operation, which vill be fully evaluated when sufficient wells are commis-
sioned to provide a statistically significant data base.

Sensitivity Analysis
28.     Several tests were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of project
assumptions made in the economic analysis (tabulated in para 8.13, Main
Report). Additional details relating to these assumptions are as follows:
(a)  Commoditv Prices.  The most important crops grown in the UGC system
at present, and expected to be grown in the future, are wheat, sugar-
cane and paddy. A reduction in the price of wheat by 25% would
reduce the ERR by less than one percentage point. A similar reduc-
tion in the price of sugarcane or paddy would have about the same
effect.
(b) Implementation Schedules. The effects of construction delays would
result in higher overall project costs and would slow down the tran-
sition process to future benefits in the modernized command areas.
Such a delay could result from institutional problems, shortages of
key construction materials or problems with land acquisition. The
largest impact on the ERR would be through delays in the completion
of watercourses. A delav of three years in the completion of water-
course lining would reduce the ERR to 10%. For this reason, modern-
ization of watercourses has been made a separate component under the
project so that it can be carefully monitored.
(c) BudRetary Constraints. If there were serious budgetary constraints
during the project period, restricting investments that GOUP could
make to the project, this would reduce the rate of modernization
works in favor of giving priority to risk aversion works. If the
progress of modernization were reduced to half the rate assumed under
the project, the ERR would decline to about 16X.
Cost and Rent Recovery
29.     Estimates of cost and rent recoveries used in this report (Table T-10
and T-12) were based on the assumption that water related charges would
remain unchanged (in real terms) over the project life time. The increment
for indirect cost recovery per ha from taxes on agricultural production at
full development is expected to reach about Rs. 50 to 120/ha depending on
location and 0&M cost would amount to Rs. 100/ha. Cost and revenue streams
are discounted at 12% per annum over 50 years in constant 1984 prices. Under
these assumptions, the rent recovery indexes relate to the complete modern-
ization of the overall UGC scheme.  The present va'ue of the resources
invested in the project discounted over a period of 50 years at 12% per annum
is equal to about Rs. 4,500 per ha of CCA. The present value of the average
annual recovery through water related charges and agricultural taxes over a
50-year period at 12% annum is estimated at Rs. 1,850 per ha of CCA. The
Cost Recovery Index would therefore amount to about 41% (Table T-12).

INDIA
UPPER GANGA IRRIGATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Advisory Planning Group
Background
1.      The original project proposals were prepared by the Irrigation
Department (ID) in the early 1970s. They followed the traditional planning
and design concepts of the period in India after independence. In 1979, COUP
retained WAPCOS to produce a Feasibility Report (FR) which was completed in
December 1982. The report incorporated many new ideas and concepts for the
planning, design and management of the proposed irrigation systems which are
novel in UP and now need to be translated into practice. In addition, the
project organization will require a substantial increase in implementation
capacity at all staff levels both for planuing, design and construction if
the proposed implementation programs are to be achieved.
2.      Under the circumstances, GOUP has agreed that an Advisory Planning
Group (APG) would be retained to advise and assist the ID. The terms of
reference would be: (i) translating the concepts of the Feasibility Report
of the Upper Ganga Composite Irrigation Project into detailed planning and
design procedures; (ii) testing alternative design solutions; (iii) estab-
lishing least cost solutions for meeting the performance criteria established
for the irrigation system layouts; and (iv) advice on drainage and improved
operation and maintenance procedures so that both existing and modernized
irrigation systems can be managed efficiently; forulating a program for the
comprehensive and thorough monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities in the
irrigation sector to complement the ID's efforts with respect to M&E and, in
particular, ensure that sufficient data is collected to effectively evaluate
the work program completed under the project (the first time slice of the
overall modernization of the UGC system).
3.      The advantages of having an APG to assist the ID is that it would
provide a group of experienced multi-disciplinary professionals who are not
burden with routine administrative duties or a work program outside the
project.
Advisory Planning Group
4.      GOUP would retain the services of a Consultant Group experienced in
planning, design and implementation of modern irrigation schemes; the group

(b) assist the ID in identifying data and monitoring requirements to
improve the system irrigation efficiency of the project (particularly
with respect to canal lining) and then formulating a least cost
solution for the works to be constructed;
(c) assist the ID in the formulation of technical specifications and
typical tender documents suitable for the procurement procedures
(both ICB and LCB) under the project;
(d) assist the ID in setting up project quality control units; and
(e) assist and advice the ID in the detailed preparation of future time
slices of the first phase development (i.e. up to about year 2000) of
the UCC modernization program and provisional schedule and scope in
modernizing the overall UCC scheme.

Micro Planning
(a) Assist the ID in preparing a program for surveys and investigations
required to ensure that project implementation schedule are met in a
timely manner;
(b) advise the ID on the preparation of detailed guidelines for design
of irrigation systems below the watercourse outlet so that works can
be constructed on a block-by-block basis and with minimum inter-
ference to the existing irrigation service; and
(c) assist the ID in setting up procedures and techniques to evaluate
lining of guls (watercourses) below the outlet structure.
Minor Drainaze
(a) Advise the ID on design and implementation of minor drainage works
under the project; in particular, advise on design criteria, standard
outfall and access structures, and any remedial or additional works
needed to utilize natural main drainage channels; and
(b) assist the ID in the preparation of TORs of the project drainage
study and, then, assist in the supervision of the investigations and
evaluation of the results.
Monitoring and Evaluation
(a) Advise the ID on M&E activities which would be required for prepara-
tion of future development phases of the project and on the implemen-
tation of such activities; in particular, advise on the quality and
quantity of data to be collected so that evaluation can be made as
soon as possible and with acceptable degrees of certainty;
(b) advise and assist the ID with the following M&E tasks with respect to
irrigation works and service:
(i) technical aspects including project implementation; technical
performance; design standards; specifications and least cost
solutions; alternative canal lining techniques including lining
of watercourses from the outlet structure to end of the lined
channel; channel design standards including freeboard; and labor
intensive construction methods;
(ii) irrigation system management from head works to watercourse
outlet; and
(iii)  routine monitoring of operation and maintenance of the existing

(a) Assist the ID in evaluating the management requirements for irriga-
tion works under the project and the problems associated with transi-
tion from existing to improved management procedures; and
(b) assist the ID in the preparation of terms of reference for a detailed
management study and, as required, the preparation of the study. The
basic objectives of the study would be to assist the ID in estab-
lishing rules, procedures and requirements for the general manage-
ment, together with routine operations and preventive maintenance of
the UGC system. In particular, the study would:
(i) assist GOUP identify organizational changes which will have to be
made to efficiently and effectively manage the works under the
project and the existing UGC scheme;
(ii)  review planning of water utilization and allocation including the
integrated operation required to meet the multi-purpose needs of
the project schemes, namely, industrial and domestic needs and,
in the kharif, rabi and zaid seasons irrigation;
(iii) assist the ID on technical or project implications of existing
water agreements that might be necessary under the North India

benefits are achieved; in particular, how the Act may be amended
to assist in the equitable allocation of scarce water resources;
(iv)  assist the ID in the preparation of O&M procedures for UGC scheme
to include the operation of irrigation systems diverting various
water supplies from the Ganga above Narora Barrage and allocation
of water resources in Western UP; and
(v) assist the ID in the water charge system study to be under the
project.
Conditions of Employment
5.      The Advisory Planning Group would be responsible to the Project
Co-ordinator through the Chief Engineer (Investigation and Planning) who
would be directly responsible for the project planning (see Chart C-3). The
APG would function only in an advisory role. The tentative plan would be for
the Consultants to establish a project office in New Delhi or Meerut, with
adequate technical staff supported by Senior Consultants from their Read
Office. The location of the office would be decided once the composition of
APG is finalized. The initial agreement between GOUP and the Consultants
would be for three years, subject to satisfactory performance; this would be
extended by mutual agreement, if necessary. The local costs may be supported
from the Project Preparation (PP) Fund which was established under the Second
Uttar Pradesh Public Tubewells Project C::. 1337-IN). The PP Fund has been
instru.mental in gradually strengthening the State's ability to plan and
prepare irrigation and multi-purpose water resources project and also provide



-113-                             ANNEX 4
Page 5
opportunities for the domestic consulting industry. Local coats for techni-
cal assistance would be 100X reimbursable under the project, including any
costs for facilities and service required by the Consultants so that they can
function effectively. If foreign consultants are retained, the forei2n costs
of consultants for APG would either be covered under the project or, through
bilateral aid. Any bi-lateral aid would be subject of a separate agreement
between GOI/GOUP and the Government of the donor country.
6.      The Advisory Planning Unit would consist of two Senior Engineers:
one would be experienced in planning, design and implementation of modern
irrigation systems and the other would have similar experience but with more
focus on the operation and maintenance and general management of such sys-
tems. The APG vould also include the services of a Senior Agriculturalist
and a Senior Project Economist primarily to assist and advise the proposed
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit and the units responsible for future planning
activities. In addition, experts in groundwater, irrigation lav, irrigated
agriculture and hydrology would be provided by the APG on short term basis as
required.
7.      The ID would provide sufficient transportation, equipment and
facilities for the APG to function efficiently and such provisions would
revert to the ID on the termination of the consultancy. The ID would also
provide necessary support staff to assist the APG to fulfill their obliga-
tions. The provisional cost estimates of the APG are given in Table 10,
Annex 3 of the Staff Appraisal Report.
