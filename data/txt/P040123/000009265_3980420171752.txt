PERU
DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION LOAN
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:           The Republic of Peru
Beneficiary:       Not applicable.
Poverty:           Not applicable.
Amount:             US$183 million
Terms:             Repayable in 17 years, on level repayments, including five years of grace,
at standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollars single currency
loans.
Commitment Fee:  0.75% on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less
any waiver.
Financiny Plan:    See Schedule A.
Rate of Return:     The internal rate of return (IRR) on the financial resources allocated to
the DDSR operation, based on the savings in payments to commercial
banks, would be 27 percent.1 The IRR is calculated with respect to a
counterfactual Multi-Year Rescheduling Agreement assuming eight years
of grace period, 24 years of maturity, and a LIBOR+13/16 interest rate.
The IRR is well above both the cost at which Peru could borrow the
enhancement funds and the critical level employed in the Bank's project
lending.
Staff Aporaisal Report:          Not applicable.
Proiect Identification Number:   PE-PA-40123
1  The resulting IRR is largely driven by the considerable amount of the debt-buyback option (US$2,472
million or 31 percent of Eligible Debt) and by its high average price discount (62 percent).

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION LOAN
OF US$183 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU
1     I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed Debt
and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR) loan for US$183 million to support implementation of
'The 1996 Financing Plan' between the Republic of Peru and its commercial creditors to
restructure about US$7,988 million of commercial bank and private suppliers debt. The loan
would be repayable in 17 years, on level repayments, including five years of grace, at standard
interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollars single currency loans. A briefing note on this
operation (SecM95-1163) was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 14, 1995.
The DDSR agreement involves: (i) a debt buyback; (ii) the exchange of eligible principal for par,
discount and front-loaded interest reduction (FLIRB) bonds; and (iii) a regularization of past
due interest (PDI) through partial forgiveness, a down payment, and a PDI bond. Proposed
World Bank measures in support of the DDSR operation encompass:
*  A DDSR loan to the Republic of Peru for US$183 million to help finance the debt-
buyback and the principal and interest collateral for the par, discount, and FLIRB
bonds; and
*  A limited waiver of the negative pledge clauses in loan and guarantee agreements
between the Republic of Peru and the Bank to permit a pledge of collateral of about
US$20G million for the DDSR instruments.
*  A set-aside of US$50 million from the proposed Pension Reform Adjustment Loan
(PRAL) for US$100 million presented to the Executive Directors concurrently with
this report.
2.    This report analyzes the effects of the proposed DDSR operation on Peru's medium-term
growth prospects and creditworthiness, and discusses the rationale for Bank involvement.
Section I outlines the domestic origins of Peru's debt crisis. Section II describes the DDSR
agreement provisions, estimates the up-front cost and financial implications, and describes
sources of official support. Section III evaluates debt and debt service reduction implications,
cost-efficiency, indirect economic benefits, and effects on creditworthiness and debt
management. Section IV discusses the rationale for Bank support. Section V presents the
recommendation.
l.    BACKGROUND
3.    During the 1970s, Peru accumulated external debt at a rate faster than the rate of growth
of the economy. After the debt crisis of 1982, the Government initiated negotiations with the
international commercial banks to refinance its external debt and, in early 1983, suspended
debt-service payments until a rescheduling agreement could be reached. In February 1984, an



-2-
agreement in principle was reached, however, non-compliance with the IMF program targets
made implementation of the agreement impossible.
4.    Peru's arrears grew rapidly after 1983, when Peru adopted a best-effort-to-pay practice
on its foreign debt. Then, in July 1985, the Government announced that total foreign debt
payments would be capped at 10 percent of exports. Not until 1988, however, did actual debt
service fall to the 10 percent limit. Initially only payments from public creditors to private
foreign banks were targeted, but in 1987 Peru extended the moratorium to the IFIs and also
banned external debt-service payments by private debtors. In August 1986, Peru was declared
ineligible for IMF lending, in 1987 it was placed in 'non-accrual' status by the World Bank and
in 1989 by the IDB. Threatened with expulsion, the Government resumed current debt-
servicing to the IMF at the end of August 1989.
5.    The administration that took office in July 1990 implemented the most comprehensive
reform program in the history of Peru. Among other sweeping measures, the government took
decisive steps to resume links with the international financial community. Arrears were cleared
with the IDB in September 1991 and with the IMF and the Bank in March 1993. Rescheduling
agreements of official bilateral debt with Paris Club creditors were approved in September 1991,
May 1993, and July 1996. In October 1995 the Government of Peru (GOP) and the Bank
Advisory Committee (BAC) announced an agreement in principle to repackage Peru's medium-
term debt with commercial bank and private supplier creditors. The agreement was a major step
towards reintegrating Peru into the international financial community after more than a decade
of virtual isolation.
II.   THE DDSR AGREEMENT
6.    The DDSR agreement encompasses about US$7,988 million (US$10,812 million if PDI
forgiveness is considered) of public and publicly-guaranteed medium-term debt with commercial
banks and private suppliers. The agreement includes a menu of options to exchange eligible
debt for new instruments, a debt buyback, and substantial PDI forgiveness. The up-front cost of
the operation is estimated at about US$1,435 million, and about 44 percent of the cost would be
financed using part of the country's own reserves. This section describes the main provisions of
the agreement, reports the response of creditors, estimates the up-front cost, and identifies the
financing sources for the operation.
A. Main Provisions
Eligible Debt
7.    The DDSR operation encompasses all medium- and long-term, public and publicly-
guaranteed debt, currently in arrears, with commercial banks and private supplier creditors. The
agreement is comprehensive, reducing the debt and debt service obligations through a menu of
options for buying back or exchanging eligible principal--US$4,183 million, including principal



-3-
arrears--, and past-due interest (PDI)--US$3,805 million.4 The total amount covered,
US$7,988 mnillion, corresponds to about 25 percent of the total external debt of Peru and about
40 percent of the public and publicly-guaranteed debt.
Treatment of Principal
8.    The agreement offers creditors a menu of three types of new exchange instruments, a
debt-buyback for the exchange of principal claims, and a separate treatment of PDI5 (see Table
1). Holders of eligible debt would exchange their claims to principal for one of the following
options:
* Par Bonds (registered) at below market interest rates, commencing at 3 percent in
year one, rising to 4 percent in years sixteen through twenty-five, and 5 percent in
years twenty-sixth through thirty, with a bullet payment upon maturity (30 years);
* Discount Bonds (registered) with face value 45 percent below that of the eligible
debt, at interest rate of LIBOR plus 13/16 percent, with a bullet payment upon
maturity (30 years);
* Front-Loaded Interest Reduction Bonds (registered), at below market interest rates
during years one through ten, commencing at 3.25 percent in year one and gradually
rising to 5 percent in year ten, and to the six-month LIBOR plus 13/16 percent
thereafter, with a maturity of 20 years and a grace period of 8 years; and
* A tender offer for a debt-buyback conducted through a 'Dutch' auction with
separate bids for principal and past due interest (PDI). (See para. 12 below).
9.    The principal of the Discount Bond (DB) and Par Bond (PB) will be collateralized in full
by the pledge of US Treasury zero-coupon bonds delivered on the closing date and held in an
escrow account. Payment of six months of interest would be secured on a rolling basis by the
pledge of cash or permitted investments delivered on the closing date and held by the collateral
agent (a correspondent bank) in a separate account. Collateral of interest would be based on a
reference rate of: (i) 7 percent per annum (for the DB), and (ii) 3 percent in year one to fifteen,
rising to 4 percent in years sixteen through twenty-five, and 5 percent in years twenty-sixth
through thirty (for the PB). The principal of the FL1RB is not collateralized. Until the tenth
anniversary after closing, payment of six months of interest would be secured on a rolling basis
by the pledge of cash or permitted investments delivered on the closing date. Collateral of
interest on the FLIRB would be based on a reference rate of 3.25 percent per annum. Earnings
on all of the collateral accounts would accrue to Peru once the collateral requirements are
satisfied. The agreement allows the repurchase of bonds at any price and time provided certain
4 This agreed PDI is the result of substantial forgiveness, estimated by the Government at about US$2,823
million. This Govermnent estimate will not be included in the following sections in the evaluation of the
quality of the DDSR agreement.
5   A debt-equity conversion (debt for privatization program) has already occurred, redeeming US$318 million
in principal arrears and US$254 million in interest arrears. This swap, however, is not included in the
DDSR financing pool.

conditions are filly met by the GOP. 6 The bonds will be issued in two simultaneous offerings,
one in the United States to US persons and the other outside the US to Non-US persons.

-5-
Treatment of Past Due Interest (PDI)
10.    The agreement restructures PDI by means of: (i) PDI forgiveness; (ii) partial PDI
payments prior to closing; (iii) a downpayment on PDI at closing; and (iv) a PDI bond. PDI
forgiveness, estimated by the Government to reduce PDI obligations by about US$2.8 billion,
results from the recalculation of PDI at lower-than-contractual interest rates.7'8  During 1996
Peru made partial payments on PDI totaling US$90 million. At closing, Peru will make a
US$225 million downpayment on PDI. Remaining PDI (US$3.8 billion) would be exchanged
for PDI bonds (registered), having twenty year final maturity and a five years grace period, at
below market interest rates, commencing at 4 percent in the first two years, rising to 4.5 percent
in years three to six, 5 percent in years seven to ten, and LIBOR plus 13/16 percent from year
eleven through twenty.
11.    Because of the prolonged period with little or no debt service, the share of PDI in Peru's
DDSR agreement is unusually high. At 61 percent the share of PDI in total debt exceeds that of
Panama (50 percent), Ecuador (42 percent) and is well above the sample average (14 percent)--

The basis for the recalculation of PDI is set forth in Annex D of the Financing Plan. It determines eligible
interest by using PDI factors which express amounts of eligible interest as percentage of eligible principal.
PDI factors, in turn, depend on two elements, the interest on principal (IOP) and the interest on past-due
interest (101). The former assumes that accrual for each item begins at the mid-point of the month of
Interest Accrual Date and continues to Closing. It is based on monthly LIBOR plus 13/16 percent p.a. The
latter assumes accrual beginning on the first day of calendar quarter after IOP first became due and
continues to Closing. The interest basis is the lesser of 2.5 percent p.a. or LIBOR plus 13/16 percent p.a.

B. Responses
12.    Creditors responded to the 1996 Financing Plan with commitments for 97 percent of the
eligible debt by mid-September 1996: 42.5 percent of these commitments was allocated to the
FLIRBs; 22.7 percent to DBs; 4.6 percent to PBs; and 30.2 percent of the eligible principal to
the debt-buyback. The buyback reduced US$1,265 million of principal and US$1,180 million
of PDI--the average price of the debt-buyback was about 38 cents on the dollar9. While the
allocation results in less debt and debt service reduction than a balanced one, it also results in
considerably lower up-front costs. The impact of the debt- buyback in total debt and debt
service reduction outweighs all other aspects of the final allocation of commitments.
C. Costs and Sources of Support
13.    The total costs of closing the DDSR agreement is estimated to be about US$1,435
million (see Table 3). Of the total cost US$315 million corresponds to payments on PDI and
US$939 million to the debt buyback. The remainder includes the estimated cost of the collateral
for the DBs (US$114 million), the PBs (US$38 million), and the FLIRBs (US$29 million).

While the final cost of principal collateral will depend on changes in the yield of the zero-coupon
bonds before the final purchase, the cost of interest collateral is predetermined by the agreed
reference rates. 10
14.   The Government has requested support from the World Bank, the IMF, the IDB and the
Export-Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM) to help finance the up-front costs of the DDSR
Agreement (see Table 3). Bank support would include the proposed US$183 million DDSR
Loan and US$50 million of set-aside funds from the US$100 million Pension Reform
Adjustment Loan (PRAL) simultaneously presented for approval to the Executive Directors.
IMF support would include set-aside funds from the previous and current Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) program in an amount of SDR105.5 million (US$153 million equivalent) and
SDR55 million (US$80 million equivalent) from an Augmentation of the EFF. IDB will provide
a self-standing DDSR Loan of US$233 million equivalent approved by the Board in November
6, 1996. JEXIM Bank support would include US$100 million equivalent in co-financing of the
proposed Bank's PRAL and the IMF's EFF. The Government would finance the remaining up-
front costs of the DDSR agreement (about US$635 million) from its own resources. The
Government would carry the burden of higher-than-estimated collateral costs to the extent that
some additional lending does not materialize.
III. EVALUATION OF THE DEBT AGREEMENT
15.   This section studies the: (i) extent of debt reduction; (ii) cost-efficiency of the DDSR
agreement; (iii) indirect economic benefits; and (iv) impact of the DDSR agreement on debt
management and creditworthiness. Implementation of the DDSR operation would:
o restructure about 40 percent of Peru's total public and publicly-guaranteed external
debt and reduce its the face value by about US$3,187 million (excluding forgiveness
of about US$2,823 million);
*  result in a debt reduction equivalent (DRE) of about US$4,453 million, or 55.8
percent of the eligible debt and 11.4 percent of the total public and publicly-
guaranteed debt;
*  result in cash flow savings in 1996-2026 with net present value of US$2,045 million
(3.3 percent of GDP) and an IRR of 27 percent--compared to counter-factual debt
service;
*  reduce interest rate risk, by exchanging 85 percent of the eligible debt (after
buyback) into fixed-rate instruments for the next ten years;
*  augment the relative exposure of the IFIs, from 18 to 23 percent of Peru's public
and publicly-guaranteed debt, and
10 The estimated acquisition cost of the collateral is about US$200 million. Because the collateral is in the
form of zero-coupon bonds its value will increase over time as the bonds approach maturity.



-8-
*  reduce Peru's flexibility to adjust future debt service obligations to shocks, inasmuch
as 22.9 percent of Peru's public and publicly guaranteed external debt heretofore
subject to rescheduling would be transformed into bonds.
A. The Extent of Debt Reduction
16.   This part studies the debt reduction impact of the DDSR agreement: (i) it estimates the
debt reduction equivalent (DRE) and compares the results with those of previous DDSRs, (ii)
identifies the importance of the debt-buyback in total debt reduction, and (iii) discusses the
sensitivity of the results to changes in market interest rates.
17.   The DDSR agreement results in a DRE of US$4,454 million or 55.8 percent of the
eligible debt (see Table 4 below)." This DRE is higher than that secured in 10 out of the 14
previous DDSR agreements by other countries and is well above the average (35 percent). Even
so, because the restructuring encompasses only 25 percent of Peru's external debt, debt
reduction as a percentage of total public and publicly guaranteed debt (11.4 percent), is below
the average in previous DDSRs (16 percent).
18.   The DRE is the result of: (i) a decrease in the face value of commercial debt of about
US$3,187 million, stemming from: (a) the buyback of US$1,265 million of principal and the
corresponding US$1,180 million of PDI; (b) the exchange of 22.7 percent of principal at a
discount of 45 percent (US$427 million), and (c) the downpayment at closing of PDI (US$315
million); (ii) the net present value of interest savings reduction through PB and FLIRB
exchanges and the PDI bond (US$1,086 million); and (iii) the principal prepayment equivalent of
collateral placed beyond Peru's reach (US$181 million). Thus, the debt-buyback is responsible
for fifty-five percent of the debt reduction and 77 percent of the total reduction in the face value
of commercial debt.
19.   The DRE estimate is not sensitive to the assumption used to forecast future market
interest rates. For instance, estimating the DRE using a fixed LIBOR rate'2 instead of the
Treasury bill yield curve, used in Table 4, would result in a DRE 5 percent lower (US$208
million) than in the benchmark case; likewise, lowering the yield curve by 25 basis points would
result in a DRE 1.2 percent lower (US$53 million) than in the benchmark case.
Had savings from PDI forgiveness been included in the estimate, DRE would have increased to 67 percent
of eligible debt.

B. The Cost-Efficiency of the DDSR Agreement
20.   To evaluate the cost-efficiency of the DDSR this part compares: (i) the debt reduction
attained by investing funds in purchasing the enhancements with that resulting from using these
funds in a market-based debt-buyback; and (ii) the cash flows resulting from the DDSR
Agreement with those that would accrue under a counterfactual Multi-Year Rescheduling
Agreement (MYRA).
Comparison with a Market-Based Debt Buyback
21.   The debt reduction attained by investing funds in purchasing the enhancements can be
compared to that resulting from using these funds in a market-based debt buyback. This is done
by comparing the buyback equivalent price (BEP) of the deal with the post deal price (PDP) of
the uncollateralized portion of the remaining debt. The BEP is calculated as the market value of
new instruments minus the market value of enhancements divided by the debt reduction
equivalent; this indicates the theoretical market price at which Peru would be indifferent (secure
the same debt reduction) between financing the enhancements or financing a market buyback.
The PDP is approximated by the price of the non-collateralized portion of the creditor's new
portfolio. This stripped price is calculated as the market value of the new instruments minus the
principal prepayment equivalent of the collateral, divided by the face value of the new
instruments minus the DRE. It indicates the market price at which a buyback could be
implemented.
22.   The DDSR operation achieved debt relief at a substantially lower financial cost to Peru
than a market-based debt reduction would have entailed. At 31 cents on the dollar the BEP is 56
percent lower than the PDP, which is above the discount in all previous DDSRs with the
exception of Panama's and Poland's. An alternative indicator of the efficiency of the DDSR
agreement results from comparing the break-even price-- calculated as the market value of new
instruments divided by the nominal value of the eligible debt--with the PDP. At 49 cents on the
dollar the break-even price is 31 percent lower than the PDP, which is above the average
discount (23.1 percent) in previous DDSR operations--see Table 5. The savings resulting from
the DDSR compared to a market-based debt reduction are about US$1,763 million, or 3 percent
of GDP. At the same time, Peru obtained 67 percent of the overall benefits generated by the
operation, compared to an average of 59 percent for previous DDSR operations. The DDSR
agreement is also cost effective, as measured by the vIMF. 13
13 The result would be obtained by comparing the BEP defined as total cost/debt reduction to the secondary
market price on or before the Agreement in principle was announced (in this case as of October 27, 1995).
Because the secondary market price (37.9 cents on the dollar) is higher than the calculated BEP (30.9 cents
on the dollar), Peru has benefited from allocating resources to the DDSR rather than to a market-based
buyback type of operation.

Comparison with a Counterfactual Multi- Year Rescheduling Agreement
23.   Evaluating the cash flow implications of the DDSR operation requires a counter-factual
scenario. A return to arrears financing would be inconsistent with the Government's objectives
of reestablishing creditworthiness, regaining access to long-term resources from international
financial markets, creating an inviting environment for new investment, and strengthening the
market economy. While generating a temporary cash flow benefit over a DDSR arrangement,
accumulation of arrears would postpone recovery of full creditworthiness, disrupt
implementation of the ongoing reform program, and damage the consolidation of a dynamic
market economy. Thus, it lacks plausibility and must be rejected. Resuming debt service under
the original contractual terms is also an implausible scenario; it would impose, on the
Government's finances, the unbearable burden of paying up-front most of the principal and PDI.
Thus, it must also be rejected.
24.   In light of these considerations, and following the approach adopted in other DDSR
loans supported by the Bank since 1992, the cash flow savings of the DDSR are evaluated with
respect to a counterfactual consisting on (i) the same treatment with regard to PDI and a (ii)
Multi-Year Rescheduling Agreement (MYRA) covering the principal at interest rate of LIBOR
plus 13/16 percent, with a maturity of 24 years, grace period of 8 years and annual amortization
payments of 5 percent of the principal from 2004 through to 2009 and 7 percent of the principal
from 2010 through 2019.
25.   The cash flow savings and the interest rate relief provided by the DDSR agreement
compared to the counterfactual, are presented in Table 6. Gross benefits consist of the: (i) flow
of debt service relief under the counterfactual; (ii) interest earnings on interest collateral
accounts; and (iii) funds to be released from the FLIRB collateral account in 2006, and the PB
and DB accounts in 2026. Gross costs include the: (i) US$939 million for the debt-buyback; (ii)
US$315 million of up-front PDI payment; (iii) US$181 million to purchase principal and interest
collateral; and (iv) debt service on the new instruments. In the initial year, when the up-front
costs of DDSR are incurred, the liquidity impact of DDSR as compared to the counterfactual, is
highly negative (US$320 million). However, from 1997 through 2026 the DDSR would provide
average annual debt service relief of about US$177 million compared to the counterfactual. The
internal rate of return (IRR) of this cash flow is about 27 percent, which is above the cost at
which Peru could borrow the enhancement funds and above the critical level employed in the
Bank's project lending. The net present value of the cash flow savings is US$2,045 million, or
about 3.3 percent of GDP.

C. Indirect Economic Benefits
26.    Peru's economic recovery since 1990 has been the result of structural reform,
pacification and decisive steps towards reintegrating the country into the international financial
market. These bold steps resulted in rapid restoration of domestic and international investor
confidence in the country--as evidenced by the dramatic turnaround in capital flows (see
paragraphs 21 to 23 of the PRAL MOP). While Peru's formal reintegration into the
international capital market has taken several years, investor confidence was secured on the basis
of the quality of domestic policies and the expectation that Peru would fully restore
relationships with its creditors in the medium-term. Had this not been the case, the economic
recovery would have been a slower and more painful process.



-14-
27.    The favorable impact of the DDSR operation in the economy will be increased by the
quality of the ongoing reform program-- described in detail in the PRAL MOP. 14 This program
successfully addresses the causes of economic mismanagement that led to the debt overhang and
establishes the basis to consolidate a dynamic market economy. At the same time, the DDSR
agreement will, substantially enhance the effectiveness of the reform program in accelerating
growth and reducing poverty. Indeed, without DDSR the ongoing reform program would be
much more difficult to implement in the years ahead. The DDSR operation would achieve this
result by: (i) substantially reducing market uncertainty over Peru's ability and willingness to fully
service its external debt, and the sizable distortions and costs this uncertainty entails; and (ii)
reducing the debt overhang and the associated "tax" on future output, which also acts as a
disincentive to reform efforts and private investment.
28.   The DDSR operation would alleviate market uncertainty over Peru's capacity and
willingness to service its debt by: (i) eliminating Peru's arrears and normalizing its relations with
commercial creditors; (ii) reducing the present value of debt service payments by 3.5 percent of
GDP; (iii) shielding 85 percent of commercial interest obligations15 from interest rate risk; and
(iv) transforming commercial loans into bonds, thereby allaying concerns about future
rescheduling and rendering actual payments more predictable. Official support for DDSR
should further curtail market uncertainty, by ensuring a credible financing plan, both for the up-
front costs of the operation and future financing requirements, and by signaling that the
Government is undertaking the reforms needed to sustain economic growth and maintain
creditworthiness. Finally, market uncertainty should decline because the cost of debt service
default in a post-DDSR world would rise dramatically, providing a strong incentive for Peru to
meet the debt service obligations assumed under the DDSR operation.
29.    Substantially reduced market uncertainty would translate into appreciable benefits to
Peru by reducing the sovereign risk premium and real domestic interest rates, and by broadening
access to international capital markets on competitive terms and maturities for both public and
private sector borrowers. While sovereign-risk commercial bank lending to Peru may not resume
for some time, renewed commercial lending for project finance and growing direct foreign
investment will play a key role in upgrading Peru's endowment of physical capital. The
macroeconomic impact of the DDSR operation against a counterfactual, which incorporates the
Multi-Year Rescheduling Agreement explained in the previous section, is presented in Table 7.16
(the full projection period is shown in Annex Table I)
14 A short- and medium-term macroeconomic outlook is presented in the PRAL MOP.
5  These obligations stem from the exchange of principal eligible debt for new instruments bearing fixed
interest rates for, at least, the first ten years.
16 The counterfactual scenario maintains the same policy framework except for the debt agreement. However,
it contemplates a less favorable macroeconomic outcome driven by the indirect effects that a more
demanding debt agreement would have over the economy. Given the extra debt service burden imposed by
the MYRA, investors confidence would sustain a lower level of private investment which, in turn, would
generate less economic growth. Finally, the consequent spill over effects would be felt on the public sector
accounts as well as on the balance of payments.

I/ Includes change in stocks.
30.    The recent evolution of forward-looking market-based indicators is suggestive of the
indirect benefits of DDSR, inasmuch as these financial variables tend to adjust quickly to new
information regarding the future. Especially relevant are secondary market debt prices, and
stock market prices because they tend to adjust immediately to new information. Remarkably,
the price of Peru's debt on the secondary market has climbed 20 percent since the
announcement of the DDSR Agreement in Principle in October, 1995, from 69 cents to 83
cents, in May 1996 (and to 115 cents in October 1996). This is a clear-cut indication that the
market expects the DDSR agreement to generate substantial indirect benefits for Peru. Also,
since July, 1996, when the when-and-if issued Peru Brady instruments began to trade, the spread
of the FLIRB over the equivalent maturity US Treasury stripped bond (stripped spread) has
systematically declined, from more than 700 to less than 480 basis points (between June and
November 1996). This further indicates that the market's perception of Peru's sovereign risk
has improved as a result of DDSR. Domestically, the stock exchange also has registered gains
(about 10 percent in dollar terms since October 1995), but this market is very thin.



-16-
D. Creditworthiness and Debt Management
Reduced Overall Burden
31.   DDSR would facilitate debt management and substantially enhance Peru's
creditworthiness by increasing its capacity and willingness to service its debt, both directly
(through debt reduction) and indirectly (through enhanced economic performance). In 1996, the
DDSR operation would reduce total public and publicly-guaranteed external debt by 4
percentage points of GDP, to about 33 percent, and diminish public debt service payments as a
share of exports of goods and nonfactor services by 7 percentage points (Annex Table II). Over
the longer run, total public and publicly-guaranteed debt is projected to decline steadily to about
23 percent of GDP by the year 2000 and about 12 percent by 2006. Similarly, the public debt
service ratio would decrease to 21 percent by the year 2000, 'averaging 17.4 percent a year
through 2006. Furthermore, the maintenance of sound economic policies would be encouraged
by the up-front cost that Peru has paid in order to regain creditworthiness, and debt management
strengthened as creditworthiness improves and the cost of mismanagement increases.
32.   The more favorable outlook of the debt service brought about by the agreement,
however, should be faced with some caution. The reduction in accrued debt service payments
should, truly, improve the performance of both the external and the fiscal accounts.
Nonetheless, that is not, necessarily, the result on a cash basis, in light of the fact that the
country has been in arrears for twelve years. The Government should, therefore, pursue a well
managed macroeconomic policy in order to guarantee that the necessary foreign exchange and
fiscal resources to fulfill debt service payments will be available.
Debt to Official Creditors
33.   The reduction of commercial bank debt, coupled with additional lending by IFIs to help
finance DDSR (and disbursements under ongoing operations), would raise the share of official
creditors in the present value of Peru's remaining obligations, from 45 percent to 49 percent
between 1995 and 1996. In particular, it would raise the relative burden of the IFIs, from 12 to
15 percent. By the same token, the share of private creditors would decline, from 29 percent to
21 percent. (the structure of Peru's external debt is shown in Annex Table III)
Reduced Flexibility
34.   While the DDSR agreement would greatly improve Peru's capacity to service its debt, it
would potentially constrain the country's ability to adjust its debt service to adverse external
shocks or domestic policy shocks. More particularly, it would raise the transactions costs of an
eventual debt restructuring relative to one in which loans were simply rescheduled, as in a
MYRA. In effect, DDSR raises the relative share of debt held in bonds by about 16 percent.
The conversion of bank loans to bonds and additional lending by IFIs for DDSR would raise the
share of relatively inflexible debt by about 19 percent. While this result is an inevitable outcome
of a Brady deal, the extent of this increase is low relative to that resulting from previous DDSR
operations because of the moderate share of commercial bank debt in Peru's total external debt



-17-
(around 30 percent). While increasing over time, the share of preferred creditors in public debt
service will stay below the Bank's guideline of 35 percent over the next decade.
IV. RATIONALE FOR BANK SUPPORT
35.   The Government of Peru has requested support for the DDSR operation from the World
Bank, the IDB, the IMF and the JEXIM, as described in Section II. The settlement of the debt
agreement -- i.e., the exchange of bonds for old debt -- is expected to occur on December 20,
1996. The Government has also requested a limited waiver of the negative pledge clauses in its
loan and guarantee agreements with the Bank and other creditors. This chapter discusses the
conditions of eligibility for such support, the proposed Bank measures to support the DDSR
Agreement, the request for waiver of the negative pledge clause, and the benefits and risks of
the operation.
A. Eligibility for DDSR Support
36.   Peru meets the eligibility criteria for Bank DDSR support. First, since August 1990, the
Bank has assisted the Government in preparing and, successfully, implementing its stabilization
and structural reform program as discussed in detail in the PRAL MOP. Second, the
Government has been unable to pay contractual interest and amortization on external debt with
commercial creditors. Had the Government resumed payments on its commercial debt at
contractual terms, it would have had to sacrifice provision of key services such as security,
primary health and education, and targeted social programs. This would have had a devastating
cost for re-establishment of public order and for poverty alleviation. Third, the Government's
financing plan for the DDSR operation is consistent with both external and fiscal balance. It
brings debt service within the Government's financing possibilities and will help achieve a
sustained growth path with real GDP growth rates in the range of 6 percent per year. Fourth,
the Bank's use of resources to support DDSR is efficient, as the Government's investment in the
DDSR deal achieves a satisfactory rate of return with respect to alternative means of
regularizing arrears. Fifth, Bank support for the DDSR would help implementation of the
ongoing reform program by way of broadening Peru's access to long-term external financing.
Thus, the resources devoted to DDSR will make a positive contribution to the country's growth
and development prospects.
37.   Balance of payments support is necessary in spite of Peru's strong foreign exchange
reserve position. First, because the economy is highly dollarized and the capital account is
completely open, high foreign exchange reserves reduce exposure to short term capital outflows
and are a critical ingredient for the stability of the financial system. Secondly, about 44 percent
of the direct financial requirements for the DDSR agreement will be met with Peru's foreign
reserves. Financing a higher percentage of the up-front cost of the DDSR agreement, while, at
the same time, allocating US$1 billion of the international reserves to the pension trust fund,
would jeopardize the stability of the external financing program.



-18-
B. The Proposed Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan
38.   The proposed DDSR Loan of US$183 million would be used to help finance the up-front
cost of the DDSR Agreement. Consistent with existing guidelines the proposed loan amounts to
14 percent of the overall FY97-99 lending program (US$1,317 million) which is consistent with
the lending levels presented in the CAS discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on
November 22, 1994. The proposed amount complements the other sources of funding,
including Peru's own contribution of about US$635 million. The proposed amount for the
Bank's contribution is consistent with the financial support from the IMF, the IDB, and the
JEXIM. (see para. 14)
C. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness
39.   Conditions of loan effectiveness would be: (i) consistency of the Government's
macroeconomic framework with the adjustment program; (ii) availability of adequate resources
to implement the financing plan; (iii) the effectiveness of the Implementation Agreement for the
set-aside from the PRAL; 17 and (iv) confirmation that Peru has entered into debt exchange
agreements covering 95 percent of eligible debt (approximately 22.7 percent of eligible debt to
be exchanged for Discount Bonds, 4.6 percent for Par Bonds, and 42.5 percent for FLIRBs).
Subject to fulfillment of these conditions, it is proposed that the full amount of the DDSR Loan
be made available when needed for the purchase of collateral and/or to meet eligible buyback
payment requirements and subject to the concurrent disbursement of the PRAL set-aside and to
the disbursement arrangements described below.
D. Disbursement and Other Arrangements
40.   Disbursement arrangements for this DDSR loan and the set-aside would be set forth
respectively in the DDSR Loan Agreement and in the Implementation Agreement of the set-
aside from the concurrent proposed PRAL. The proceeds of this DDSR loan and the set-aside
would be disbursed for payments covering eligible up-front cost items, namely principal and
interest collateral for the new debt instruments and the buyback.
41.   No withdrawals would be made from the set-aside of the PRAL and the DDSR loan
unless the Bank shall have approved the procedures for withdrawal and is satisfied with the
arrangement for collateral holding. The Bank will disburse (on account of the Borrower) either
directly to the collateral agent to provide funds for the acquisition of collateral or to the
Borrower to reimburse it for the cost of already acquired collateral and eligible debt-buyback
expenses.'8 Conditions for disbursement: (i) the set-asides will be disbursed concurrently with
the DDSR; and (ii) the Bank is provided with a certificate showing that the specific buyback
17 The Implementation Agreement will become effective only if: (i) an opinion is furnished to the Bank that
the Implementation Agreement is valid and binding on the Borrower; (ii) Peru has entered into debt
exchange agreements covering 95 percent of eligible debt, with approximately 22.7 percent of eligible debt
to be exchanged for Discount Bonds, 4.6 percent for Par Bonds, and 42.5 percent for FLIRBs; (iii) adequate
resources will be available to finance the purchase of the collateral instruments and to cover the direct cost
of the debt buyback.
Is The Bank for International Settlements will be the collateral agent.



-19-
remains in full force and effect. The Bank will provide (under the DDSR loan) up to 100
percent retroactive financing, if needed, on the basis of eligible expenditures incurred after
September 1, 1996. For the purpose of establishing and maintaining the collateral accounts, the
Government will appoint a collateral agent.
42.   The Government would be required to have the records and accounts of the payments
financed out of the proceeds of the loan audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,
and to furnish to the Bank the audit reports and other information regarding those records and
accounts and the audit thereof The Closing Date of the Loan would be March 31, 1997.
E. Prepayment Provisions
43.   Under the 'Financing Plan', the Government is entitled to repurchase any of the DDSR
instruments at any time and price, provided it is not in default on any of the new instruments.
The Implementation Agreement and the DDSR Loan Agreement each includes provisions
entitling the Bank to request prepayment of funds in certain circumstances to the extent that the
collateral they finance is released to Peru following a repurchase of Par, Discount, or FLIRB
bonds .
F. Waiver of Negative Pledge Clauses
44.   The Government has formally requested, pursuant to the terms of the negative pledge
clauses in the loan and guarantee agreements between the Bank and the Government, that the
Bank consent to the pledge of collateral in the amounts required for the par bonds, discount
bonds, and FLIRBs to be issued by Peru. It is estimated that a waiver of up to US$200 million
would be required for this purpose. The pledge of collateral will be for the 30-year life of the
par and discount bonds. The Bank has received a letter from the Government formally
requesting the waiver of the negative pledge clause and reaffirming its obligation to continue to
make timely payments on its loans from the Bank. The Government also states its
understanding that such loans would not be subject to rescheduling. Likewise, the Government
also stated its understanding that the consent of the World Bank to a waiver of the negative
pledge clause would be limited to the transactions included in the DDSR operation as described
in this report and would be without prejudice to the Bank's position on the negative pledge
clause under its loan and guarantee agreements in general. The GOP is also requesting the
necessary waivers of negative pledge clauses in agreements with the IDB.
45.   Given that the Agreement satisfies the criteria for DDSR programs which can be
supported by the Bank within its established guidelines, granting the above waiver would be in
accordance with the Bank's policy.
G. Benefits
46.   The expected benefits of the operation to Peru have already been discussed above.
Clearing arrears, resuming normal relations with the international financial community, and
recouping full creditworthiness are means to pave the way to attract more foreign investment.
Furthermore, the commitment of the Government to stay the course of the reform program, in

light of its impressive track record, lends an extra element of confidence to potential investors.
Consequently, the positive effects of the proposed DDSR agreement will be felt not only in
terms of financial relief for the country but also through higher investment, increasing the
likelihood of sustained economic growth coupled with higher stability in the country's external
accounts.
H. Risks
47.   The DDSR Agreement increases the Bank's share of Peru's external debt and debt
service, but these shares remain within acceptable levels. Debt service to the Bank as proportion
of public debt service is projected to increase from about 8 percent in 1995 to around 16 percent
in 1999, declining to about 15 percent, on average, thereafter. And debt service to the Bank as
a fraction of exports of goods and non-factor services is projected to average about 3 percent
between 1996 and 2006 (see Annex Table II). Reduced flexibility in Peru's external debt
translates into greater risk to the Bank in the event of adverse external shocks or domestic
policy shocks because it would be more difficult for Peru to service senior obligations.
However, the DDSR agreement also mitigates the vulnerability of the economy to external
shocks. First, it diminishes the debt service burden and enhances creditworthiness. Second, it
reduces the exposure of the economy to both interest rate risk--by exchanging 85 percent of
eligible debt into fixed-rate instruments. In addition, risk is mitigated by the positive impact of
the DDSR Agreement and of the ongoing reform program on economic growth and in
improving external balances.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
48.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank and would be consistent with the approved guidelines for Bank support of DDSR
programs. I therefore recommend that the Executive Directors approve the Debt and Debt
Service Reduction Loan on the terms and conditions proposed.
49.   Furthermore, to make possible the provision of collateral required by the Financing Plan,
I also recommend that the Executive Directors consent to the request of the Government of
Peru for a waiver of the negative pledge restrictions in the Bank's loan and guarantee
agreements with the Republic of Peru, to the extent and based on the conditions proposed, such
consent to become effective upon receipt by the Government of all similar consents required
from other creditors.
