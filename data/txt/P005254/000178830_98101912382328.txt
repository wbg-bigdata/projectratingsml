JORDAN
APPRAISAL OF ARAB POTASH PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
1.01      The Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has requested
World Bank financing for the proposed Arab Potash Fertilizer project (the
Project) aimed at producing 1.2 million metric tons per year (tpy) of potash
(potassium chloride or muriate of potash - KCl), equivalent to 0.72 million
tpy of K 20, by solar evaporation of Dead Sea brine. The Project will be
located in the southern basin of the Dead Sea (Map IBRD-3078 R2). Its output
will be exported principally to countries in the Indian Subcontinent, East
Asia and Pacific Oceania, and to the US. This report presents the main
findings of the Bank mission, consisting of Messrs. Harinder Kohli, Edilberto
Segura, Jiro Kuroda, Christopher Pratt and Edouard Siou, who visited Jordan
in November 1977 to review the proposed Project. It is based on information
obtained by the mission from the Arab Potash Company (APC or the Company),
that contained in the feasibility report of February 1978 prepared by APC's
consultants Jacobs International Inc. (JII) of the US and Sir Alexander Gibb
and Partners (AGP) of the UK, and discussions with the Company and the
consultants.
1.02      The Project will be owned and operated by APC, a Jordanian company
majority-owned by the Jordanian Government. APC's shareholders will contri-
bute US$193 million equivalent in equity, representing 45% of the estimated
total project financing requirements of US$429 million. The proposed World
Bank loan of US$35 million equivalent will be the first Bank loan to Jordan
and will cover about 8% of such financing needs and approximately 11% of total
foreign exchange requirements calculated at US$310 million. Concessionary
debt financing has been arranged from a number of bilateral and regional
financing institutions, including Kuwait Fund for Economic Development (KFED),
US$35 million; the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD),
US$15 million; the Libyan Government through the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank
(LAFB), US$50 million; OPEC Fund, US$7 million; and the United States Agency
for International Development (AID), US$38 million. The Government of Jordan
proposes to obtain commercial loans of about US$20 million to complete the
financing plan.
B. Project History
1.03      The proposed Project is designed to exploit one of the few large
physical resources available to Jordan - the Dead Sea brine - which is rich
in minerals and salts, including potash. It will be the largest single
industrial project ever undertaken in the country and represents a successful
culmination of efforts going back many years. The Project may be followed by
others to commercially extract from the Dead Sea other valuable elements such
as bromine and magnesium. Recovery of Dead Sea potash on the basis of solar
evaporation of brine was started about 1930 by the now defunct Palestine
Potash Ltd. By 1945, after expansions, annual production reached 100,000



- 2 -
tons, but in 1948, the north-end facilities were damaged and those in the
south were abandoned as a result of hostilities. Subsequently, in 1952,
Dead Sea Works Ltd. (DSW) was formed and modest commercial production started
in the mid 1950s. In 1961, with initial financial assistance from the Bank
(289-IS of July 11, 1961), DSW undertook a large expansion program which,
after solving major dike construction and product harvesting problems, has
gradually raised Israeli potash production to about 1.2 million tpy.
1.04      In 1956, the Government of Jordan formed the Arab Potash Company to
develop a project on the Jordanian side similar to the DSW operations. After
some experimental work on the northern and southern shores, in 1960, APC
invited tenders for a study to assess the potential of a potash plant at
the southern end. This study, conducted by the Western Knapp Engineering Co.
of the US, considered a 250,000 tpy project, but it became evident that a
plant of this size was uneconomical. APC then, with the assistance of AID,
retained Jacobs Engineering Company of the US (parent company of JII) to
review the Western Knapp report and to investigate in greater detail the
feasibility of establishing a potash plant. Jacobs Engineering, in turn,
retained Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners to consult on dike design, evapora-
tion pans and civil works. These studies indicated that a plant of a yearly
capacity of 1.0 million tpy of potash was viable, provided the problem of
building dikes on unstable mud and salt beds could be overcome economically
(a major problem at that time being encountered by DSW). Discussions were
then held between APC and W.R. Grace Co. of the US to act as the technical and
marketing partner, and with AID and the World Bank Group regarding possible
financing assistance. These discussions reached an advanced stage before the
1967 hostilities intervened and stopped further progress.
1.05      In 1974, the Project was revived by the Government.  A Pilot Engi-
neering Project costing US$10 million, supported by a US$6 million assistance
by AID and a US$1 million IDA credit (S-19-JO, June 6, 1975), was initiated
in late 1975 to construct trial dikes and undertake detailed field work, as
well as detailed engineering and marketing studies, and to re-establish the
technical, economic and commercial viability of a full-scale project under
updated conditions. This Pilot Project, described in detail in Annex 1,
was carried out during 1976 and 1977 with the assistance of the consultants,
Jacobs and Alexander Gibb. Based on the results of the Pilot Project, a
preliminary feasibility report was issued by the consultants in December
1976 (Project File: Reference A) and a final report in February 1978 (Project
File: Reference B) indicating that a full-scale project for the production of
1.2 million tpy of potash was viable. The proposed Project is based on the
results of the Pilot Project and this study. As allowed in the respective
credit agreements, AID and IDA funds on-lent to APC for the Pilot Project will
be refinanced as Government equity contribution towards the full-scale project.
1.06      The Bank has worked closely with APC and its consultants during the
successful implementation of the Pilot Project. The Bank has also maintained
close contact with potential colenders to the Project and prepared a report
summarizing the findings of its appraisal mission for a Co-lenders Meeting
that took place in Amman in April 1978. The Project is considered technically,
economically and financially viable.



II. THE ARAB POTASH COMPANY
2.01       The Arab Potash Company (APC), the Project sponsor and proposed
borrower, was founded in 1956 by the Government of Jordan to commercially
exploit the minerals contained in Dead Sea brine. In 1958, the Government
granted a 100 year concession (Project File - Reference C - Concession Agree-
ment) to APC giving it exclusive rights for the extraction of these minerals,
and granting it tax and fiscal incentives.  APC's initially authorized capi-
tal was JD 4.5 million (US$13.9 million) of which JD 1. 8 million was paid in.
The initial capital stock was subscribed by the Government of Jordan (49.5%),
several Arab Governments - Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria -
and private shareholders (50.5%). When further project preparation was
halted after the 1967 war, APC dismissed most of its staff, and many small
private shareholders exercised the option given to them to sell their shares
to the Jordanian Government at the original subscription price. In March 1978
and again in August 1978, APC's shareholders authorized major increases in the
Company's share capital to provide an adequate equity base for financing the
proposed Project. The currently authorized capital of APC amounts to JD 63
million (US$193 million) of which JD 7.7 million (US$23 million) have been
paid in. This equity is expected to be sufficient to implement the Project.
2.02       APC expects its equity ownership pattern to be as follows:  The
Government of Jordan, 51%; the multinational Arab Mining Company, 1/ 25%;
the Islamic Development Bank, 6%; and several Arab states and private share-
holders, at least 4% (reflecting their original contributions); the remaining
14% is expected to be partly subscribed by the original shareholders among
the Arab states -- including Libya, which has expressed interest in buying
5% of equity -- and partly by Arab and Jordanian institutions and individuals.
The Government has confirmed that it will purchase any unsubscribed shares.
2.03      APC at present has no major source of income except for sale of
small amounts of common salt to industrial users and from investments of its
surplus funds in Governmental Development Bonds and bank deposits. No divi-
dends have so far been paid by the Company. APC audited financial statements
as of December 31, 1977, are summarized below:

the following Arab Governments: Saudi Arabia (20%), Abu Dhabi (20%),
Kuwait (20%), Iraq (20%), and Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and other
Arab States (2-3% each). As of December 31, 1977, the AMC's subscribed
capital amounted to US$396 million equivalent.



-4-
2.04      APC's organization is in the early stages of development and, up to
the end of 1977, the Company was largely devoted to the execution of the Pilot
Project. The statutes of APC specify that its Board of Directors should have
eleven members; ten members have already been appointed -- seven, including the
Chairman, by the Government and three by the Arab Mining Company. The eleventh
member most likely will be appointed by the Islamic Development Bank after its
equity contribution has been subscribed. The Chairman of the Board of Directors,
Mr. Ali Khasawneh, is also the General Manager of the Company. The General
Manager is a dynamic executive with extensive business experience overseas.
His appointment as head of APC has been largely responsible for the speed and
efficiency with which the Pilot Project was executed and the proposed full-scale
Project prepared. Due to the important role played by the General Manager in
the Project, agreement has been reached with APC that it will not change its
General Manager without prior consultation with the Bank. In early 1978 APC
staff totalled 49, including 2 chemical engineers, 2 civil engineers, 3
chemists, 12 financial and administrative staff, and 21 laborers at the plant
site. While this organization and staffing, shown in Annex 2, was adequate
for supervising the implementation of the Pilot Project, APC needs to substan-
tially strengthen both, at an early date, to adequately supervise the imple-
mentation of the full-scale Project. As further discussed in Chapter VIII,
the Company is aware of this critical need and is taking steps to build up its
staff and organization.
III. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN JORDAN
3.01      The Jordanian economy has grown at an average annual rate of 5.1% in
the Three-Year Plan Period (1972-75), followed by a high rate of 12% in. the
first year of the Five-Year Plan (1976-80). Industry (mining, manufacturing,
and construction) has been the most dynamic sector in the economy and now
represents 26% of GDP (about US$300 million value added), compared with 20%
in 1972. Agriculture, on the other hand, has decreased its share of GDP from
13% in 1972 to 8.4% in 1976. Industrial exports have also grown rapidly from
US$32.2 million in 1972 to US$152 million (or 29% of total exports) in 1976.
Of these industrial exports, phosphate rock has been the single most important
item, reaching US$58 million in 1976.
3.02      Despite its rapid growth, the industrial sector is still in an
inception stage. It is made up of 15 large industrial enterprises employing
100 or more people, about 580 establishments employing from 5 to 99 people,
and some 6,000 small industries with less than 4 workers; in 1976, employment
in the sector totalled 36,000. The first two groups, with less than 600
establishments together, account for 87% of industrial value added, 94% of
the sector's fixed assets and 68% of employment. Most industries are heavily
concentrated in the Amman/Zarqa area because of proximity to consumers,
availability of utilities and communications and ease of transportation.
3.03      The long-term growth of the industrial sector is constrained by the
small size of the domestic market and by the country's limited resource base.
(Jordan has a total population of 2 million and an area of 97,000 sq. km). It
is because of these constraints that the Government is attaching high priority



to the implementation of large, export-oriented industrial projects that would
utilize the country's limited resources, namely, potash, phosphate and lime-
stone. For the same reasons, the scope for development of medium- and small-
scale industries is not promising at the present time. Furthermore, in the
short term, the industrial sector is constrained by an evident shortage of
medium-level technicians who are mostly drawn, due to higher wageb, to the
neighboring Arab countries especially since 1973 when the region started
experiencing an immense development thrust. Although firm manpower data are
not available, it is believed that a larger number of Jordanians (250,000)
are employed overseas than in the local market (150,000), representing a sub-
stantial drain of semi-skilled labor.
3.04      Under the 1976-80 Five-Year Plan, four basic goals have been set
for the industrial sector: (i) a 26% annual growth rate, (ii) increase and
diversification of exports of industrial and mining products, (iii) wider
geographical distribution of new industries, and (iv) higher degree of com-
plementarity and linkage within the sector. Industrial investment amounting
to JD 230 million (US$690 million) or 30% of the total of the Plan is
envisaged over the Plan period, most of which is expected to be financed from
foreign sources. To promote these investments, the Government is planning a
series of measures, including revision of the custom tariff structure, tax
exemption incentives for export-oriented industries, and modification of
industrial licencing. Moreover, in order to locate industries away from the
Anmman/Zarqa area, the provision of industrial services and utilities to other
cities as well as the establishment of a vocational training fund are under
active consideration.
3.05      The Government's industrial sector goals are closely linked to the
primary objective of the Five-Year Plan itself, which is to increase the
degree of self-sufficiency of the economy and Jordan's export base as well
as to decentralize industrial activity in the country. In pursuing this
objective, the Government intends to exploit the country's limited natural
resources as efficiently as possible which, as mentioned above, consist of
three main minerals - phosphate rock, limestone and Dead Sea brine which, apart
from potash, also contains bromine and magnesium. The proposed Potash Project,
which would absorb as much as 30% of the Government's industrial investments
during 1978-1982, is included in the Plan as a high priority. Other major
industrial projects listed in the Plan include the expansion of phosphate
production from a current capacity of 2.5 million to 7 million tpy, the
construction of a chemical fertilizer plant (sulphuric acid unit of 3,200 tpd,
phosphoric acid unit of 1,100 tpd, triple-super phosphate unit of 2,000 tpd),
the expansion of cement production (from 630,000 to 1.25 million tpy) and the
expansion of the country's only petroleum refinery (from 1 million to 3.45
million tpy). In view of the current small domestic market for industrial
products, much of the annual industrial growth target of 26% would be forth-
coming from these major projects. These projects will also bring substantial
foreign exchange earnings: by end of the Plan period in 1980, the export
earnings by mineral-based industries are projected to reach US$300 million,
compared to US$58 million in 1976. The Potash Project, at full capacity in
1985, will contribute an additional US$150 million to gross export earnings.

IV. THE WORLD POTASH INDUSTRY AND MARKET
A.   Background
4.01      Potash is one of three main plant nutrients - nitrogen, phosphorus
and potash (N-P-K) - although it is used less extensively than the other two.
In 1977, about 24 million tons of potash (in terms of K 0) were used as
fertilizer (95% of estimated total world potash production) compared to 46
million tons of nitrogen (N) and 26 million tons of phosphate (P). The word
potash is generally used to describe various potassium ores and products in
terms of their percent potassium oxide (I 0) content, even though § 0 itself
does not occur naturally. While most nitrogenous fertilizers are produced
chemically, most potash is obtained - as is phosphate - from natural deposits
in the form of underground deposits, dry lake beds and natural brines.
4.02      Although potassium, the seventh most abundant element, is widely
distributed in the earth's crust, potash is only economically produced in
a small number of locations in the world - fewer than the number of major
supply sources of other fertilizer building blocks such as ammonia, phosphate
rock or sulphur -- and, therefore, has to be moved long distances to in-
termediate and final users. As shown in Annex 4-1, the main potash producers
and their share in world capacity are the USSR (29%), Canada (26%), and the
German Democratic Republic (11%), the first two emerging as such only in the
last decade. Other important producers are the Federal Republic of Germany
(9%), the US (9%), and France (7%). While Jordan and Israel are not expected
to reach production levels of these major producers, the potash reserves of
the Dead Sea are one of the larger single potash sources in the world when
compared with individual mines elsewhere.
4.03      The West European producers have traditionally been exercising a
strong leadership over the world potash market through their established
commercial arrangements. The focal point of these arrangements is a marketing
association of Western European producers, generally known as the Potash
Syndicate. This association, whose principal leadership in terms of policy
formulation has been held by German-French producers, not only tries to
establish quantitative restrictions on sales in the European market through
coordination with other producers - such as UK, GDR, USSR, Italy and to a
lesser extent with Canada and US - but also promotes an orderly marketing of
potash, thereby affecting pricing. The Potash Syndicate, formed in the 1920s,
was quite strong until the early 1960s but its influence, except in the
European market, has recently been declining. During the last decade, Canada
has emerged as the second major producer and world's largest exporter of potash
and its increasing role in the world market has diminished the importance of
the Potash Syndicate. Canada is also the only country (other than USSR) that
can significantly increase production in the future and, therefore, its role
as market leader will become very significant.

4.04      Potash products are basically categorized into Potassium Chloride
(KC1, 60-62% K 0 content), Potassium Sulphate (K 2SO ), Potassium Magnesium
Sulphate (KMgSo4, 54% K 0 content), and lower grade Potassium Chloride Salts.
In 1975/76, about 85% of potash was produced as potassium chloride, 6% as
potassium sulphate, and the remaining 9% in lower grades. Gradewise, potas-
sium chloride products are classified into three groups: standard (diameter
of 0.2-0.8 mm), granular (1.4-3.3 mm), and coarse (6.0-6.5 mm); about 75-80%
of world production is in the form of standard grade. The coarse and granular
grades are generally required for direct application or bulk blending compound
fertilizer and carry a substantial price premium.
B.   Historical World Consumption of Potash
4.05      Total world potash consumption has grown at an average annual rate
of 5.9% during the past twenty years, reaching about 25 million tons of K 20 in
1976/77. Of this consumption, about 96% was for fertilizer applications and
the remaining 4% for various industrial uses. The historical development
of these two markets is briefly described below.
4.06      World consumption of potash fertilizer has increased from 7.2 mil-
lion tons in 1956/57 to 23.8 million tons in 1976/77, at an average annual
growth rate of 6.4% as shown in the following table. About half (by volume)
of all potash fertilizer is currently consumed in the developed market econ-
omies, primarily in North America and Western Europe. Centrally planned
economies, again in the more developed Eastern Europe, account for another
40% of world potash fertilizer consumption. Developing countries currently
consume only about 10% of potash fertilizers, compared to about 20% of world
nitrogenous fertilizers; this higher share of nitrogen use in developing
countries is on account of the fact that it generally gives more immediate
results, particularly at low total nutrient application rates. As a conse-
quence, potash consumption in developing countries is very low at only 3 kg/ha
of cultivated land in Asia and 7 kg/ha in Latin America, compared to 48 kg/ha
in Western Europe. The N-P-K ratio in developing countries in 1976/77 was
1-0.4-0.2, compared to 1-0.6-0.6 in developed countries. This underutiliza-
tion of potash by developing countries could have serious long-term conse-
quences as a rising potash deficit will eventually limit the efficiency of
nitrogen applications. However, in recent years potash consumption in devel-
oping countries has grown faster (13.2% per year) than in either the developed
economies (3.8% per year), or the centrally planned economies (10.4% per year).

4.07      Most of the non-fertilizer potash consumption, about 4% of total,
is in industrial applications, primarily for the production of caustic potash.
Caustic potash, made from potassium chloride, is an intermediate product in the
manufacture of other chemicals. Over 90% of its consumption is in the deter-
gent, soap, glass, ceramic, textile, dye and drug industries. Other potassium
salts, such as potassium carbonate and potassium nitrate, are also used for
miscellaneous industrial applications. The development of industrial potash
consumption since the mid-1960s is shown below:
Estimated World Industrial Potash Consumption 1965/66-1976/77
(in thousand tons K20)
Year         1965/66  1970/71 1971/72  1972/73  1973/74  1974/75  1975/76 1976/77

As indicated above, between 1965/66-1973/74 world industrial potash consumption
increased at an annual average rate of 5.7% to 727,000 tons K 20.  However,
consumption dropped in 1974-76 due to the general industrial recession in
the developed countries. This trend was reversed in 1976/77 when industrial
potash consumption rose to 750,000 tons K 0, most of which was accounted for
by North America (38%), Western Europe (39%) and the centrally planned econ-
omies of Eastern Europe (10%). Japan accounted for the bulk of the remaining
offtake in the world; developing countries' consumption is less than 5% of
world total.

C.   Historical Capacity and Production Growth
4.08      The design capacity of the world potash producers totalled 30.4
million tons  K 20 in 1976/77, after steadily growing from 24.4 million tons
in 1970/71. However, this design capacity can be attained only wnen optimum
conditions affecting production are consistently fulfilled for extended periods
for all production units at the same time. Therefore, world effective capa-
city should more realistically be calculated by assessing actual production
when no market constraints hampered production. Such conditions had occurred
in 1973/74 and 1974/75 when demand exceeded supply. During this period world
capacity utilization averaged 88-89%. The current effective capacity calcu-
lated on the above basis is estimated at 28.9 million tons K20, as shown
in Annex 4-2. Western Europe (20%) and North America (35%), along with the
USSR (30%) and the German Democratic Republic (10%), accounted for over 95% of
world potash production capacity in 1976/77. The two East European countries
and Canada have substantially increased their capacity in the recent past; the
USSR and the German Democratic Republic from 6.5 million in 1970/71 to 11.5
million tons in 1976/77, while Canadian capacity has increased from 1.2
million tons in 1962/63 to 7.6 million tons. Other producers, particularly
the traditional West European and US producers, have reached optimum capacity
levels and, therefore, have shown only minimal increases.
4.09      World potash production has grown at a steady average rate of 5.9%
over the period 1969/70-74/75, although a lower than average growth rate was
experienced in 1972/73 when labor and production problems hit various mines
in the world. Recent changes in world potash production are summarized in
the following table.

In 1975/76, for the first time in recent history, world production fell
slightly to 23.7 million tons K 20 from the 23.8 million tons K 20 in 1973/74.
This was caused by uncertain market conditions resulting from sharply in-
creased potash prices, as well as decreased application of other fertilizer
nutrients. During this period, most producers cut back on capacity utiliza-
tion to prevent an excessive accumulation of stocks. The production level
rose to a new high of 25 million tons K 20 in 1976/77.
D. Projected Potash Demand and Supply Balance
4.10      The table on the following page gives the potash demand and supply
situation projected by. Bank staff through 1984/85 (Project File: Reference D).
World potash fertilizer demand is expected to grow from 23.8 million tons
of K20 in 1976/77 to 34.5 million tons in 1984/85, at an average annual
growth rate of 4.8% compared to 6.4% during the past 20 years. In absolute
terms, most of this increased demand will originate in developed economies
(from 11.9 million tons in 1976/77 to 15.3 million tons in 1984/85) and cen-
trally planned economies (from 8.9 million tons to 14.5 million tons). How-
ever, potash consumption is projected to continue growing at a faster annual
rate in developing countries (8.6%) than in the first two groups (4.2%) and
should reach 4.6 million tons in 1984/85, compared to 2.4 million tons in
1976/77.
4.11      A detailed country-by-country review of projected demand and of
present and planned new potash production facilities indicates that the
present surplus in potash supply capability will gradually disappear during
the next two to three years, and demand and supply will again be in balance
around 1981-83. Thereafter, new production facilities, in addition to those
currently firmly planned or already started, will be needed to meet increas-
ing market demand. Much of the new capacity needs through mid-1980's are
likely to be met by expansions and debottlenecking of existing facilities
in Canada (in addition to two large new mines announced in the USSR). But
after the mid 1980s, a large portion of new capacity needs would have to be met
through new greenfield mines. This projected demand/supply balance suggests
that, from the world market viewpoint, the Project will come into production
at an appropriate moment.
E. Historical and Projected Potash Prices
4.12      The development of world potash prices during the past twenty years
or so can be divided into three main periods. During the decade 1955-64,
when traditional Western European producers still dominated world potash
markets, export prices remained fairly steady, averaging US$76/ton KCl (all
prices expressed in 1977 dollars). Then, as two major new producers, Canada
and the USSR, increased their market share, export prices suffered a major
and steady decline in real terms -- averaging US$59/ton during 1965-69 --
until they reached a low of US$49 in 1969. This sharp decline prompted the
Saskatchewan Provincial Government, where most Canadian production is located,
to (i) prorate the output of each producer to about 40% of capacity, (ii)

establish a floor price of US$63.2 per ton (as a temporary excess supply
measure), and (iii) impose a large Provincial tax. These measures had an
immediate impact on world export prices, which rose by 35% to US$65 per ton
of KC1 in 1970, as other producers accepted Canadian price leadership. As
shown in Annex 4-3, prices steadily increased thereafter until 1973 and then
rose sharply to over US$90/ton in 1975 on account of a temporary supply
shortage only to fall drastically again in 1976. Nevertheless, the price
peak in potash was still not as dramatic as in other fertilizers. The
average Canadian export price during the seven year period 1970-76 was US$68
and about US$65 during the last twelve years, all in 1977 terms.
4.13      While the potash industry normally uses FOB Vancouver prices as
reference (due to Canada's export price leadership role), these prices are
generally substantially lower than domestic US, or European domestic and
export prices. The difference between FOB Vancouver and domestic US prices
has recently been about US$10/ton of KC1 mainly due to the freight difference
but also due to greater stability of the US domestic market as compared to
exports. The difference between FOB Vancouver and Northwest European export
prices has been between US$8-15 per ton, depending on prevailing market
conditions. Similar, though possibly somewhat lower differences are under-
stood to be common between domestic and export prices in Europe. Since for
most producers (excluding Canada) domestic markets represent about 80% of
total sales, the average realization price for most potash producers is
estimated to be about US$10 higher than the FOB Vancouver price. On this
basis, the average world potash purchase price between 1965 and 1976 is
estimated at about US$75 (in 1977 dollars), compared with the FOB Vancouver
export price of US$65 for the same period (para 4.12).
4.14      During 1977, potash export prices averaged US$55-50 FOB Vancouver
and US$70-60 FOB Northwest Europe. These prices are low compared to the
historical prices discussed above and are the results of continuing high
inventories with the producers and the current low, though improving, level
of consumption compared to effectively available capacity. Future potash
prices are likely to be affected by three major factors. In the short term,
prices will be influenced primarily by demand/ supply expectations. For the
long term, once current capacity is fully utilized, prices will approach
levels needed to attract new capacity. The third and the most uncertain
factor is the Provincial Tax situation in Canada.
4.15      As discussed earlier, the current excess supply situation is ex-
pected to continue until the early 1980s. Therefore, no major price increases
are expected in real terms in the short-term. But, thereafter, to maintain
the continuity of adequate supply beyond this point, new capacity will need to
be added. Therefore, from the early eighties, potash prices will be increas-
ingly influenced by the economics of production from new capacity, initially
mainly through expansion of existing mines and subsequently through construc-
tion of entirely new facilities.



- 13 -
4.16      The Canadian suppliers, as the most economic producers and the
largest world exporters (40% of world total), are, as noted above, currently
the price leaders. This situation is likely to continue in the future both
because Canada has the largest potential for expansion and because Saskatchewan
is expected to remain the most economic large-scale potash source. Therefore,
future long-term prices are likely to be determined by the economics of a new
mine in Saskatchewan. Specialized consultants engaged by APC, and the Bank,
have estimated that the investment cost of such a mine with a capacity of
1.5-2.0 million tons of KCl per year will be about US$180 per ton of annual
capacity (in 1977 dollar terms), excluding working capital and interest during
construction. Production costs are estimated at US$14.50 per ton. Assuming
a before-tax return on investment (ROI) expectation of 10-25% (a 15% ROI will
yield an after-tax discounted cash flow return of about 10%), the long-term
potash prices needed to justify investments in a new mine would range between
US$71.70 and US$101.30/ton KCl, as calculated below, with US$80/ton KCI as the
most likely price:

Total FOB Vancouver Price    71.70       81.80    101.30
4.17      The above calculations do not take into account the Saskatchewan
Provincial Tax which was imposed about 7 years ago and presently stands at
about US$14/ton KCl. The Canadian industry is currently seeking relief from
this tax, and some changes in its structure are possible. Even though some
tax (perhaps at a lower level) may remain, for purposes of calculating floor
prices, this report ignores the tax factor. If a lower tax rate of, say,
US$10 per ton were assumed, the price needed to give a 15% before-tax return
(or 8-10% after-tax return) would be over US$90 per ton.
4.18      A strong improvement in prices from the current low level is ex-
pected by the early 1980s as the need for capacity expansion becomes more
evident.  However, prices are not expected to jump suddenly as soon as demand
and supply come into balance, because initially most capacity increases should
come from debottlenecking and expansion of existing facilities, and because
potash producers are likely to maintain their traditional policy of increasing



- 14 -
prices only gradually. It is, therefore, believed that the above projected
most likely long-term price of US$80 per ton (based on 15% before-tax return)
will be achieved only by about 1990. On this basis, potash prices (FOB
Vancouver, in 1977 dollars) are projected to develop as follow:
Projected Potash Prices 1978-1990
(in 1977 US$ per ton KCI, FOB Vancouver)
Year        1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990
Price/ton   53   58   61   64   65   67   69   71   73   75   77   79   80
These projections would imply that the average historical price of US$64,
which prevailed during the past 12 year period, will be reached again only in
1981. The price of US$75 envisaged for 1987 is equivalent in real terms to
the price during the decade of 1955-1965, when supply and demand were about
in balance.
V. THE MARKETING OF JORDAiIAN POTASH
5.01      The analysis in the previous chapter of the anticipated evolution
of world potash demand and supply suggests that APC would enter the market
under reasonably favorable conditions, as the long period of excess production
capacity now prevailing is expected to end in the early 1980s. APC's market-
ing prospects are further enhanced by the fact that its output will represent
a very small share of world demand, and it should therefore be possible to
accommodate such output within the framework of the envisaged demand growth.
Indeed, APC's production at full capacity would represent only 1.9% of total
forecast world demand of 37.1 million tons K 20 in 1985 and less than one-half
of the expected annual increase in potash consumption. The fact that APC will
have to export the bulk of its output should not constitute a unique marketing
problem for APC since potash is a commodity that is widely traded in the inter-
national market. In fact, of the 25.0 million tons K 0 produced in 1976,
about 50% (i.e. 12.3 million tons) was traded internaiionally as shown below:

5.02      Notwithstanding the generally favorable prospects for APC's market-
ing efforts, the degree of success of selling the Company's production is
dependent on a positive marketing strategy and adequate planning and prepara-
tion work prior to the start of plant operations. The virtual absence of a
domestic market makes it important for APC to analyze and understand the wide
variations in the size of individual markets as well as the growth prospects
and specific needs of potential customers. APC management is aware of the
crucial need for an effective marketing effort and has now outlined a basic
potash marketing strategy with respect to (i) potential markets; (ii) market-
ing organization and representation; (iii) product specification and packaging;
(iv) pricing, inventory and shipping policies; (v) promotion and market
seeding; and (vi) timing of its marketing effort. Although the main elements
of APC's marketing strategy have been established in principle, there is a
need for a more precise definition and selection of marketing options.  This
matter will be further elaborated by APC during the coming months and the
Company will submit its detailed marketing strategy to the Bank by November
1978.
5.03      Potential Markets:  APC expects to market 1.2 million tons per year
of potash by 1985, equivalent to 720,000 tpy of nutrient K 2, and to concen-
trate its marketing efforts in the South Asia, East Asia, and Pacific regions
where it enjoys a comparative location and freight advantage. The Arab coun-
tries in the Middle East and Africa also constitute natural potential markets.
In addition, APC is exploring marketing possibility in the United States.

5.04      India will constitute for APC one of its principal target markets in
view of Jordan's freight-favorable location compared to other major suppliers.
In 1977, India consumed about 500,000 tons of standard grade potassium chloride
(320,000 tons K20) all of which was imported. The Indian Government's 6th Plan
anticipates potash consumption to increase at a rate of about 15% per year,
reaching 1.1 million tons of K20 by 1985, or 800,000 tons K 0 more than the
2   ,                 ~~~~~~~~2
1977 level. Even though the Bank's estimates indicate that annual potash
consumption may reach only about 800,000 tons K20 by 1985, such a figure
still represents a substantial increase in potash consumption of 480,000 tons
K 0. APC plans to capture a portion of this demand growth. Potash sales
there would be facilitated by the fact that India imports all potash through a
single government agency -- Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation of India
Ltd. At present, the principal suppliers to India are Canada and the German
Democratic Republic, both of which offer attractive financing or trade terms.
To effectively compete in this market, APC is presently exploring means to
enable it also to offer similar facilities. In particular, the Islamic
Development Bank has expressed interest in considering financing part of APC's
export sales. These facilities will be supplemented by export credits to be
granted by the Central Bank of Jordan. The imported potash requirements of
other countries in South Asia -- Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka,
Nepal and Burma -- are modest, aggregating less than 40,000 tpy of K 20 at
present. In all these countries, central government agencies are also respon-
sible for potash imports. While APC enjoys a measurable freight advantage in
these countries and should explore sales opportunities there, they represent
only limited sales potential.
5.05      In the Far East and Southeast Asia, Japan is a major potash consumer
(660,000 tons of K 20 in 1976), followed by the Republic of Korea (160,000),
Malaysia (150,000), Philippines (70,000), Thailand (50,000) and Indonesia
(45,000). (Thailand's own potash reserves are currently considered uneconomical
for commercial exploitation.) In most of these countries the freight advantage
enjoyed by APC vis-a-vis Canada is negligible. Nevertheless, since their com-
bined consumption is expected to reach about 1.8 million tons of K20 by 1985,
these markets will represent an important target for APC. Oceania, New Zealand
and, to a lesser degree, Australia, with a combined potential consumption of
about 480,000 tons of K20 by the mid 1980s, are also important markets for
APC. At present, the principal supplier to New Zealand is the United States.
Purchasers are individual private companies who negotiate directly with potash
producers.
5.06      The Arab countries currently consume limited amounts of potash.
Only Morocco and Algeria import measurable quantities -- a total of about
60,000 tons of K 0 per year which is expected to grow to about 140,000 tons
of K20 per year by 1985. The other twelve Arab countries currently consume
only about 16,000 tons of K 20 annually. Therefore, the Arab countries are not
expected to play an important role in the consumption of APC potash, except
for Iraq as mentioned below. Furthermore, since most of the Arab countries
have saline soils, as much as 85% of their potash fertilizer consumption is
in the form of potassium sulphate. APC does not presently plan to have
facilities to transform potassium chloride into potassium sulphate; but,



- 17 -
even if APC were to establish such production capabilities, the Arab world
would still remain only a small market and the location of other major con-
suming countries in Northwest Africa would impose a small freight disadvantage
compared to the established supply sources, principally Spain and Italy. In
the longer term, however, as potash usage spreads across the Arab world, it
would represent an attractive market for APC, especially if the Company were
to establish potassium sulphate production facilities. In this regard, Iraq
may become an important market even earlier since it is planning to build a
large compound fertilizer plant at Al Kaim to produce various formulations
that would require as much as of 130,000 tpy of regular potash in the mid-
1980s. Most of the Iraqi plant's output is expected to be exported.
5.07      The United States is the major world consumer and importer of
potash, with major consumers located in the Midwest and Southeast. Canada
is the major supplier but, since 1975, the USSR and the German Democratic
Republic have been marketing potash in the US through Occidental Chemical
Company and Philipps Brothers. Compared to potash from Saskatchewan, Canada,
APC potash would be sold in Southeast US at competitive prices, since
Canadian potash is shipped through Vancouver and California ports at high
transportation and trans-shipment costs. The US market is quite complex and
involves a large number of buyers; it could best be served through agents.
With this approach, the US could become an important market outlet for APC.
Most US market potash demand is for coarse/granular material; since APC will
have the capability of producing as much as 30% of its output in granular
form, it could supply the US customers. However, to fully exploit this
market APC may also have to install compacting facilities (para 5.11).
5.08      Marketing Organization and Representation:  APC's marketing group
will be headed by an experienced Sales Executive and consist of commercial,
technical, shipping and accounting staff. The appointment of that Executive
as soon as feasible is critical to the development of a detailed marketing
strategy, the marketing organization for implementing it and, therefore, to
the eventual success of APC as a potash exporter. APC has agreed to appoint
such a Sales Executive by October 1, 1978, for this purpose.
5.09      As to the degree of local representation for its sales, APC believes
that the various potential markets can be classified into two groups according
to the degree of market penetration required by them, as follows: (i) direct
sales by APC staff (Arab countries, Indian subcontinent, Philippines, Korea,
Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand); and (ii) sales by agents representing APC (US,
Europe, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand). In the first group, APC expects to
be able to handle sales directly, since there is normally a single purchasing
agency in each country; however, even in these countries, it will be necessary
for APC to have some degree of local representation to handle documents and
local formalities. In the second group of countries, the local agents would
be fully accredited and authorized to negotiate on behalf of APC. In these
countries, APC has already started identifying potential local representatives
and/or marketers and has received encouraging responses. Based on these con-
tacts APC has agreed that by March 1979, it will obtain letters from customers
stating their intentions in principle to purchase annually, starting in 1982,
at least 600,000 tons of potash or APC's production, whichever is less.



- .18 -
5.10      APC is also giving further consideration to the desirability of
complementing its activities with the Jordan Phosphate Mines and eventually
with the Jordan Phosphate Fertilizer Industry to jointly exploit marketing
and distribution opportunities.
5.11      Product Specification and Packaging:  Except for the US and Japan,
the demand for potassium chloride is in standard grade, which is the principal
grade to be produced by APC. In the US and Japan, because of the require-
ments of bulk blending, granular or coarse grades are normally required.
Although as much as 30% of APC's output would be in granular grade, APC is
also considering the desirability of installing the required facilities at
Aqaba to compact as much as 20% of its production to meet the product needs
of bulk blenders in the US and Japan. A decision about these facilities will
be taken in consultation with the Bank by March 31, 1979, after APC's marketing
strategy has been finalized. By that time APC will also decide on the timing
by which it should install facilities for transforming potassium chloride into
potassium sulphate which, as noted above, is required by most Arab countries.
5.12      Pricing, Inventory and Shipping Policies:  Although the world supply
and demand balance is expected to be reasonably favorable by the time APC's
plant comes on stream, APC may have to initially offer some price discounts,
perhaps up to 10% of prevailing world prices in order to break into the
market. The Company has taken this possibility into account when estimating
its cash flow needs during the initial years of operations. APC will also
have to follow the customary commercial practice regarding credit terms. The
majority of sales in APC's potential markets involve minimum credit, i.e. pay-
ments are at sight or within 30 days. Extended credits, however, are essential
features in such countries as Thailand (where the cost of credit can normally
be reflected in suppliers' price calculations) and India, which enjoys
financing from Government agencies of the supplying countries such as CIDA
of Canada. APC, as a new supplier, will face strong pressure to be particu-
larly flexible regarding conditions of sales and may have to offer credit
terms extending beyond 60 days. The need for such concessions may, on the
other hand, be substantially reduced in case potash should be in tight supply
in the mid-1980s. Close monitoring by APC in the next few years of the world
market trends is, therefore, important to determine APC's credit policy during
its initial operations. APC has agreed to submit by June 30, 1979, a detailed
analysis of its export credit needs and to finalize by September 30, 1979,
arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, necessary to meet them. The Govern-
ment is understood to have undertaken to assist APC in obtaining satisfactory
export credit facilities. Regarding inventory policy, APC plans to make
provisions to store up to 150,000 tons KCl at Aqaba in order to enable it
to offer expeditious and efficient service to its new clients as well as to
spot buyers requiring material at short notice. APC is also considering
maintaining small stock piles at some Southeast Asian ports in order to
facilitate sales in these areas.
5.13      Promotion and Market Seeding:  As shown in para 5.14, APC intends
to initiate promotional activities very soon. Such activities would enable
APC's competitors to adjust their own marketing plans by taking account of
the entry of a new supplier. APC also intends to enter the market with token
supplies, well in advance of its own production, by securing supplies from



- 19 -
other producers. This "market seeding" would offer APC's marketing team, as
well as potential consumers, the important benefits of reciprocal familiariza-
tion before APC plant operations start.
5.14      Timing of Marketing Effort:  In view of the different decisions
concerning marketing that still need to be taken and then implemented during
project execution, APC has established a specific timetable for various
activities generally outlined in this chapter, as shown below:

VI. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Location and Scope
6.01      The Project is located on a 150 sq. km concession area belonging to
APC in the southern basin of the Dead Sea, some 130 km from Amman and 200 km
from Aqaba Port. The shallow depth of the Dead Sea in that area and the hot,
dry weather offer excellent conditions for mineral recovery from sea brine
aided by solar evaporation at relatively low operating costs. The Dead Sea
is an inland lake about 80 km long and up to 18 km wide, and covers an area
of about 900 sq. km between Jordan and Israel. It is fed by the Jordan and
Mujib rivers and other smaller streams, but has no outlet. The water level
of the Dead Sea is about 400 m below the Red Sea level at the Port of Aqaba.
The Dead Sea essentially comprises two basins joined by a narrow stretch of
water at the Lisan Peninsula, the main northern basin which is relatively
deep (up to 400 m) and the smaller, southern end which is shallow and dries
up during part of the year (Map IBRD-3078 R2).
6.02      Low rainfall, high ambient temperatures and pressure, low humidity
and prolonged sunshine have gradually concentrated the dissolved mineral
contents of the incoming waters. The Dead Sea has a salinity of about 30%,



- 20 -
compared to some 4% for typical sea water. This represents some 45,000
million tons of dissolved solids, of which 75% are magnesium and sodium
chlorides. Substantial amounts of potassium chloride, calcium chloride and
magnesium bromide are also present. Total reserves of potash (potassium
chloride) are estimated at about 2,000 million tons. The proposed Project has
been designed for an annual production of 1.2 million metric tons of potash,
with the possibility of attaining an ultimate capacity of 1.7 million tons.
In the future, in a second stage not included in this Project, the Company
plans to extract bromine, magnesium and other chemicals contained in Dead Sea
brine.
B.   Production Process and Technology
6.03      The production process is technically sound; it is similar to
the process utilized by Dead Sea Works and some other projects elsewhere
in the World. A schematic diagram of the carnallite route for solar potash
recovery is shown on the following page. The principal project components
to be constructed at the southern end of the Dead Sea, as shown in the sim-
plified flow chart on the following page, are: (i) solar evaporation ponds
for the concentration of brine, and a brine transfer system to bring the
brine from the Dead Sea to the evaporation pans and then transfer it between
pans; (ii) a harvesting system for dredging and transporting the solids preci-
pitated in the final pans (principally carnallite, a double salt of potassium
and magnesium, KCI.Mg Cl2. 6H 20 containing about 23% potash) to the refinery;
(iii) a refinery to produce fertilizer grade potash from the harvested car-
nallite; (iv) a water supply system, and a steam and power generating plant
to provide the needs of the plants and township; and (v) an associated town-
ship. Project layout is shown in Map IBRD-13362 R and details of the Project
are given in the Project Feasibility Report prepared by APC's consultants in
February 1978 (Project File - Reference B).
6.04      Solar Evaporation and Brine Transfer Systems.  Brine containing
about 1% potash in the deep section of the Dead Sea, north of the Lisan
Peninsula, will be pumped and conveyed via a 10 km canal to large shallow
evaporation ponds. These ponds will be filled with brine of different con-
centrations to a depth of about one meter. The pan area will cover the
entire southern end of the Jordanian Dead Sea, which is the most suitable
location for the construction of ponds. In order to encompass the evapora-
tion pans, about 58 km of dikes will be built, mostly over salt and soft
silty mud beds that are either permeable or unstable. The area which will
form the base of the evaporating pans was mostly under water in the mid-
1960s. However, the level of the sea has steadily fallen by about 3 m over
the last 12 years, and the area is now practically dry during most of the
year. Although this sea recession will facilitate the construction of dikes,
they still represent the largest single component in the project costs.
6.05      In order to minimize pan area, and dike construction and operating
costs, the consultants have recommended that the pan system be operated in
three steps and in a continuous manner rather than batchwise. The evaporating
pans will have a total area of 70.8 sq. km, of which 40 sq. km would be in one
salt pan (where most of the sodium chloride will crystallize and precipitate

to the bottom of the pond, accumulating at a rate of 15 cm per year 1/), 14.8
sq. km in two precarnallite pans and 16.0 sq. km in three carnallite pans.
In order to maintain optimal carnallite crystallizing conditions, protect the
bottom of the carnallite pans and provide a surface for the running of the
harvesting machines, a thick layer of common salt will be deposited into the
bottom of the carnallite pans prior to the starting of carnallite production.
This laying of salt will be effected by a temporary brine supply system
that will bring brine directly from the Dead Sea into the carnallite pans.
The pan design is considered reasonable. However, one of the project risks
is the possibility that the evaporation rates, principally in the carnallite
pans, might be lower than now expected, thereby reducing production below the
1.2 million tpy of potash envisaged. This risk, however, is not considered
high, since the pan area was determined as a result of extensive evaporation
tests carried out during the Pilot Project. APC also plans to continue
collecting further data at the test pan station built for the Pilot Project,
to confirm that design criteria are consistent with field data collected
uniformly over a longer time period. In case new data were to lead to the
unlikely finding that a larger carnallite pan area would be desirable, APC
will then modify the pan design by adding a fourth carnallite pan or by
operating the three carnallite pans in series. Except for this potential
risk, the pan design is not expected to pose any major problems.
6.06      As shown in the project layout chart, Map 13362, the Truce Line
between Jordan and Israel forms the western boundary of the Project site; APC
dikes will be built parallel both to the Truce Line and to the Israeli's DSW
dikes and the average distance between APC and DSW dikes will be about 500 m.
Between the two dikes there will be a 18 km long channel to dissipate sub-
stantial amounts of flash flood waters from the several wadis in the southern
area, as well as to provide an outlet for the disposal of effluents and waste
brine from the two projects. The proposed width of 500 m is designed to
discharge to the Dead Sea up to 2,900 m /sec of flood water from the mouth of
tqe southern wadis during the rainy season, at an average speed of about 1.6
m /sec, which is considered the maximum flood volume that can occur with a
probability of one in 1,000 years. The proposed width of the channel has
been carefully studied and is considered adequate. The APC dikes forming the
channel between APC and DSW will have flood protection consisting of gravel
of relatively large size and, where required, groynes to direct the flow and
avoid scouring of dike foundations. A breach section with a lower crest level
will be included on some of the dikes so that floods can be attenuated in the
pans without causing excessive damage, should the estimated one in 1,000 year
flood level be exceeded at any time. APC has asked its civil consultants AGP
to devise measures to minimize the risk of flood damage to the dikes during
the construction period. DSW dikes that will form the western side of this
flood water channel are already adequately protected.
1/   This accumulation of salt at the bottom of the pan will require, after
10 years of operation, the raising of the dikes encompassing the salt
pan by about 2 meters. The accumulation of salt will also increase
the evaporating area of the salt pan to about 60 sq. km.



- 23 -
6.07      Dikes will be constructed over soils that are either permeable or
unstable, and present two major and different design problems; dikes to be
built over salt beds will require special horizontal and vertical seepage
control, while those over soft mud at the south end will call for special
construction methods to overcome stability problems. On the basis of exten-
sive soil tests carried out during the Pilot Project, the civil engineering
consultants have established that all dikes should have an impermeable clay
core that will effectively reduce horizontal seepage through the dikes. To
control vertical seepage in about 20 km of dikes to be built over salt beds,
a cutoff barrier will be placed below the dikes down to about 5 m into a con-
tinuous foundation of clay layer. During the Pilot Project the consultants
also built and tested about 500 m of trial dikes, 3 to 5 m high, to determine
the most economic cross-section design and construction methods under differ-
ent soil conditions. Optimal dike cross-sections, that ensure dike stability
at minimum costs, have now been established. The full-scale dikes will be
constructed in stages to allow for the settlement of the unstable foundations
and reduce filling costs. The dikes will be constructed from locally avail-
able materials, principally gravels from the nearby wadi fans and clay from
the Lisan Peninsula. Failure of dikes was a major problem faced by DSW during
its initial operations. However, the proposed Project is not expected to face
similar problems due to the extensive trial and design work done during the
Pilot Project. The proposed dike design and construction methods are consid-
ered satisfactory.
6.08      The design and construction of the dikes and evaporation pans also
take into consideration the hydrology of the Dead Sea and its surrounding
area in order to ascertain the extent to which sea levels may fluctuate,
thereby affecting the Project. Rising levels can endanger the dikes by
overtopping them; falling levels would affect the location of the main intake
and lead to significant extra pumping costs to lift the brine to the pans.
Extensive hydrological studies concerning the Dead Sea have been carried out
by the consultants based on historical trends, in-situ investigations and
testing as well as laboratory simulated models. Such studies show that the
most likely possibility is a slow decline of sea level, averaging 0.6 m per
year. With the level of abstractions and brine pumping increasing over time,
the risk of any significant increase in sea level and overtopping the dikes
is minimal. Given the probability that the sea level will continue to recede,
the main brine intake has been sited in a deep area of the sea, some 10 km
from the main salt pan.
6.09      Israel is understood to be considering a scheme for using the
natural head between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea to generate hydro-
power, which creates a major uncertainty concerning the future Dead Sea
level, and would affect both the APC and Israeli Dead Sea Works. However, if
such a scheme were indeed implemented, it could even be beneficial to the two
companies as it would help in stabilizing the level of the Dead Sea or at
least in slowing the present downward trend. Even if the amount of water
coming into the Dead Sea from the power project became large enough to sub-
stantially raise the sea to a level that would endanger the dikes, it should
not constitute a significant problem for the APC dikes since such a scheme would
take several years to be implemented; during this time, APC can take measures



- 24 -
to overcome any problem. Also as noted earlier, after 10 years of operations
the APC dikes will have to be raised anyway, thus minimizing the possible
risk to APC of the Israeli hydroelectric scheme. The possible addition of
Mediterranean sea water to the Dead Sea brine is not expected to harm potash
production.
6.10      Harvesting of Carnallite.  The crystalline carnallite mixture
containing about 23% potash will precipitate in the three carnallite pans,
which will operate in parallel. This mixture will be harvested by specially
designed continuous bottom-operated, track-driven dredging equipment, and
delivered in slurry form to the adjacent chemical refinery on shore. This
dredging method is different from the one used in DSW operations which
utilize cable-operated floating dredges that minimize bearing requirements of
the salt bottom. However, the required cable winching, anchoring and ancil-
lary equipment is costly and complicated to operate. The proposed APC har-
vesting units would be approximately 3 m wide by 6 m long and can operate
in the brine with minimum bearing pressure. A commercially available laser
system would be used to assist the operator in guiding the harvester in a
straight line. The cutter of the harvester will supply the slurry containing
about 20% solids to a pump mounted on the harvester's deck. This pump will
transfer the slurry via a 10-inch floating pipeline to a mobile dewatering
unit on the nearest dike; this unit will increase the solid content to 40%
before the slurry is pumped to the potash refinery. Although the proposed
harvesting units are still in the design stage, they are not on the Project's
critical path. But the proposed units have not yet been commercially used for
a similar purpose, although the individual components (i.e. cutting elements,
pumps, driving wheels, laser equipment) have been used successfully elsewhere.
APC is, therefore, planning to order the construction of one prototype har-
vester to conduct extensive field tests in order to confirm that the proposed
design would indeed perform as expected and to determine its optimal configu-
ration. APC has agreed to order such a prototype unit by September 1, 1978,
and conduct field tests to determine by July 1, 1979, the optimal configuration
of the system. In the unlikely event that the proposed harvesting machine is
found to be impractical, the more cumbersome, but proven, floating cutterdredge
would be adopted instead. Therefore, the risk that an adequate harvesting
system would not be found is minimal.
6.11      The Potash Refinery.  The refinery, designed to produce 1.2 million
tpy of potash based on 330 days of operation per year, will be located close
to the carnallite pans, on firm, well-drained ground. In it, the 40% slurry
harvested from the carnallite pans will be decomposed into sodium, magnesium
and potassium chlorides. While most of the magnesium chloride will be sepa-
rated and returned to the pan area, sodium and potassium chloride will combine
with each other to make a synthetic sylvinite. The delicate decomposition of
sylvinite into potassium and sodium will be achieved by the hot-leach/crystal-
lization process, under which sylvinite is leached with hot water under
closely-controlled conditions to dissolve the potassium chloride, which is
then further concentrated and crystallized in vacuum crystallizers. After
separation, drying and screening the potash crystals are treated with anti-
caking agents and stored for eventual shipment. This process, described in
more detail in Annex 6-1, yields free-flowing potash crystals of standard



- 25 -
and granular size and purity, and is now generally preferred by the industry;
the process is also the one utilized in the expansion of the DSW. The APC
decision on the choice of the process appears sound. The refinery will con-
tain considerable amounts of relatively costly materials and some equipment
duplication, in order to ensure optimum and reliable operations given the
remoteness of the plant location and the high ambient temperature that will
be experienced during the summer months. Such design has also increased the
estimated cost of the plant. The consultants have, therefore, been asked to
review, during the detailed engineering and procurement process, their equip-
ment specifications and to recommend if plant costs could be reduced by using
different specifications, without unduly risking reliable plant operations.
C.   The Township
6.12      During the construction phase, the civil works and process plant
contractors will employ over 800 persons, including many expatriates; the
majority of the local labor will come from outside the neighboring local-
ities. Later, when the plant becomes operational, APC will employ some 630
permanent staff, again the majority of whom will come from outside the general
area of the works. The adjoining small villages of Safi and Mazra as well as
the nearest town, Karak (situated about 50 km from the plant site), will not
be able to meet the Project's total needs of housing and social services.
Therefore, to attract people to the remote project site, a township will be
constructed to accommodate the contractors' staff during the construction
stage and later the bulk of APC's permanent staff during regular operations.
6.13      Eight possible sites for the township were investigated.  Of these,
two were located close to the nearest village of Safi and the Jordan-Israel
border, but had to be abandoned because these plots are prime agricultural
land and because of security considerations; the two available sites closest
to the plant proved to be too small; another two near Mazra village were
exposed to flood risks. The last two possible sites, similar in size and
topography, are not far from Mazra, about 20 km from the plant; one is pri-
vately owned and the other belongs to APC. The APC site, located some 135 m
above the Dead Sea level, was selected after the Jordanian Archeological
Institute and experts contracted by AID confirmed that no archeological
remains exist underneath; APC has obtained written clearance from the Insti-
tute for building a township at this site. It has also been confirmed that
this plot would not be required for agriculture or other uses.  The site
selected for the township is considered satisfactory.
6.14      The township will house some 2,270 persons, in 380 housing units
that will be composed of four main category groups: (i) senior staff (29
units); (ii) skilled technical and clerical staff (136 units); (iii) semi-
skilled staff (185 units); and (iv) 30 bachelor quarters. In view of the
climatic conditions, all dwellings as well as public buildings will be air
conditioned with package type window units. The township will, as shown in
Annex 6-2, also contain essential community facilities, including administra-
tive offices, shops, a bank, a post office, one community center, schools
(kindergarten and elementary) and a health clinic. The Project will include



- 26 -
the construction of housing and principal township facilities, except for the
fire station, mosque and church and police station that will be provided by
the Jordanian Government. The proposed scope of the township, despite its
relatively high cost, is consistent with project needs and is considered
reasonable.
D.   Utilities and Raw Materials
6.15      The plant location is remote and normal utilities such as water
and electricity are not currently available at the site. The Project scope,
therefore, includes provision for the supply within the project area of the
bulk of the utilities required.
6.16      Water Requirements and Supply. During normal operations, the wat r
requirements of the process plant will be about 5.6 million cubic meters (m')
per year, most of which can be supplied with loderate salinity. The town-
ship will require an additional 0.5 million m per year of potable water.
With the assistance of the Institute of Hydrology (Oxford, UK), the consul-
tants have carried out extensive studies, including five borehole drillings,
to determine the water potential in the area and the optimal means to tap such
resources. The study confirmed that there is sufficient water available in
the area to satisfy the needs of the proposed Project, in addition to present
uses. In fact, excluding flood flows, the perennial annual volume of water
leaving the escarpment in the project area in the fSrm of base flows in the3
wadis or springs is estimated at about 45 million m  (of which 25 million m
come from the Wadi Hasa, about 7 km from the plant). This flow is several
times the project requirements. However, part of this flow is currently
utilized for irrigation. Therefore, to minimize any negative effect on
irrigation, the prime source of water for the Project would be groundwater
accumulated in underground alluvial aquifers, after such water has been
utilized for irrigation. This groundwater is generally of potable quality.
The largest aquifer is the Ghor Safi, which is fed by water from the Wadi
Hasa. To utilize it, about 7 new boreholes will be drilled during Project
execution. Furthermore, it is proposed that during the months of May to
August, when agricultural demand for water is considerably reduced, water for
the refinery VIll be taken from the Wadi Hasa directly. In this manner, only
3.7 million m  per year would be withdrawn f om the Ghor Safi aquifer, which
has a storage capacity of about 67 million m . Groundwater abstraction and
surface water diversion could thus be used at different times of the year with
a greater overall efficiency of groundwater usage; this is in line with the
national objective of achieving an optimum water resource plan for the area.
As to water supply for the towSship, the Ghor Mazra aquifer near the township
his a capacity of 25 million m and a recharge capability of about 1.3 million
m per year. Such a recharge would be sufficiSnt to satisfy the water needs
of the township which amounts to 0.5 million m per year.
6.17      The long term reliability of groundwater supplies could be jeo-
pardized by any significant diversion of water for irrigation or other uses
outside the limits of the aquifers, as this may reduce the amount of recharge.
It is, therefore, important that the planning of any improvement or extensions



- 27 -
to irrigated areas dependent on surface water and the development of ground-
water resources for the Project be carefully coordinated to ensure the op-
timal use of water. Therefore, the Government has agreed to consult with the
Bank before taking any measures in water resource management that would impair
the operations of the proposed Project. In addition, during project imple-
mentation APC has agreed to continue its borehole drilling investigations and
monitoring of groundwater resources to obtain closer and direct estimates of
recharges and yield potentials, in order to be able to determine the optimal
design and location of productive wells. Subsequently, during project opera-
tions, APC will monitor underground water levels and water quality to deter-
mine any possible variations in annual sustained yields.
6.18      Electric Power.  At full operation, the Project will have a total
connected electric power demand of 44 mega watts (MW), but the average load
would be 23 MW. This average demand will consist of 8 MW from the evapora-
tion and brine transfer system, 12 MW from the refinery and 3 MW from the
township. It is currently envisaged that the Project's power needs would be
supplied from two different sources. The Project itself will include a fuel-
fired steam turbine power generating unit with a capacity of 14 MW, which
would be sufficient to cover the minimum operating needs of the Project and
be consistent with the steam requirements of the process plant. The remaining
9 MW would be supplied by the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) from the
national grid, from the Amman area as northern Jordan will continue to have
surplus power. JEA plans to initially connect the Project to the national
grid by completing a new transmission line from Amman to Safi by early 1981.
Subsequently, it expects to build, by the mid-1980s, a second line connecting
Safi with a proposed new power station in Aqaba. The proposed power supply
arrangement would minimize the financial and economic cost to APC of obtaining
its power needs, and would also maximize overall benefits to the country. In
addition, by linking the Project to the proposed national power grid by two
transmission lines, it will improve the reliability of power supplies to the
plant. In view of the importance of electric power to the plant's operations,
agreement has been obtained from the Government that it will ensure comple-
tion of the proposed northern transmission line from the national grid to
the Project site as scheduled by March 1, 1981, and that the cost of such
electric power to APC will be determined on the basis of the prevailing bulk
supply rates.
6.19      Raw Materials.  The principal raw materials, in addition to brine,
needed by the Project at full capacity will be about 69,000 tpy of heavy fuel
oil and 1.0 million gallons/year of diesel oil. Fuel oil, in addition to
solar energy, will be the principal source of energy for the Project. These
two products will account for as much as 46% of the total annual operating
costs. Smaller amounts of various imported chemicals (such as sulphuric acid,
zeolite, anti-caking agents) representing about 7% of annual operating costs
will also be required. The heavy fuel and diesel oils will be supplied by the
Jordanian Petroleum Refinery Company (JPR), from its refinery at Zarqa. This
company is the only authorized importer and producer of petroleum products in
Jordan, and has a long standing supply arrangement with Saudi Arabia at sub-
sidized prices. The Government has agreed to take any necessary actions to
ensure that JPR will provide with adequate and timely supply of the Project's
petroleum products needs.

E.   Ecology
6.20      Potash is not a hazardous product, though potash dust could ad-
versely affect vegetation. This dust will be restricted and recovered by
appropriate collection devices at critical producSion points. Disposal
of common salt-tailings, involving some 460,000 m annually, will be under-
taken by building several piles and levelling these with a bulldozer as
required. Disposal of waste brine and magnesium chloride will be made in a
manner that provides minimum disturbance to the sea brine at the main intake
point. All dikes will be regularly patrolled and inspected to ensure that
settling and seepage conform to predetermined acceptable levels. Satisfactory
assurances have been obtained that APC will comply with acceptable inter-
nationally recognized environmental standards.
VII. TRANSPORTATION AND PORT FACILITIES
A. Inland Transportation
7.01      Potash will be transported by road from the plant site to the Port
of Aqaba for storage and shipping to export markets. A recently completed
road between Safi and Aqaba is adequate for the transportation of APC's
output. This 2-lane 7-meter wide road runs along the almost level plain,
"Rift Valley," and has a design speed of 100 km p.h. The road pavement is
elevated about one meter above ground level to facilitate drainage and has a
good gravel foundation and a double bituminous surface dressing. This base
and surfacing should be adequate for the planned potash payloads of about
9 tons per axle. This road has been designed for a maximum axle load of 12
tons and 5% gradient. Depending on the total volume of traffic, the road
will require resurfacing every few years; the surface should consist of either
bituminous premix carpeting or asphaltic concrete. Resurfacing will be
carried out by the Ministry of Transport as part of its national road main-
tenance program. In view of the importance of the road for the Project, the
Government has agreed to take the necessary measures to maintain the road
according to sound engineering practices.
7.02      Jordanian authorities have considered the possibility of utilizing
railway to transport potash to Aqaba. But because of the location of the
plant at 400 m below sea level, it is not economically feasible to utilize
this transport mode. The existing railway line from Amman to Aqaba runs along
the country's central mountains about 1,000 m above sea level and it would
have been necessary to build a 50 km spur between the plant site and the
existing line to Aqaba that would have had to ascend about 1,400 m.
7.03      APC has decided to operate its own fleet of trucks because of the
high frequency of trips to be made between the plant and Aqaba, the relatively
large number of specialized trucks involved, and the need to have a reliable
service in a relatively remote location. A financial analysis prepared by
APC also indicates that a Company-owned fleet will be cheaper than contract
haulage by private operators, on the basis of actual trucking rates being



- 29 -
charged for phosphate. APC will purchase 35 trucks, each with a 60 ton capa-
city, to haul the plant's output. These trucks will operate round-the-clock
and will make 472 round trips per week. A minimum of 98 drivers will be
required. The Company also plans to acquire three wreckers and three pickups
to patrol the road, transport maintenance parts to stalled trucks, and tow
stalled vehicles that can be repaired only in the maintenance workshop to be
located at Safi. APC's decision on the transportation arrangements is con-
sidered reasonable and viable, though it may have to ultimately acquire 10-15
additional trucks depending on its actual initial experience with the fleet.
B. Port Facilities
7.04      Practically all of APC's output will be exported via the Port of
Aqaba, the only seaport of Jordan. At present, the port handles about 0.8
million tons per year of general cargo and 2.0 million tons per year of bulk
cargo, principally phosphate. The port facilities include two deep water
berths for general cargo with a total length of 360 m and a depth of 10 m
and two bulk berths for phosphate capable of handling up to 6.0 million tons
per year in ships of up to 100,000 tons deadweight. The port also has two
floating berths, one of which is utilized for general cargo and the other for
containers. The port is administered by the Aqaba Port Authority, an agency
of the Ministry of Transport, which is responsible for the handling of bulk
products, shipping movements and the provision of port facilities. The
handling of general cargo is carried out by another agency of the Ministry of
Transport, the Maritime Establishment. There are about 500 permanent staff
working at the port. The management and staff of both organizations are
efficient and competent; they have been receiving technical assistance from
the German Government under an agreement with KfW.
7.05      Because of port congestion and contamination, pollution and envi-
ronmental constraints, the Government has decided to build separate industrial
port facilities to handle exports of both potash and final phosphate products
at a site about 17 km south of the current port area. The proposed site has
an area of about 20 hectares. The potash facilities to be provided in this
industrial port include bulk storage (150,000 metric tons), potash screening
(300 tons per hour), potash bagging (25 tons per hour), bagged storage (5,000
tons), bulk loading equipment (1,500 tons per hour), and ship berthing facili-
ties capable of accommodating ships of 20,000 to 50,000 tons deadweight. The
cost of these potash facilities is estimated at about US$33 million (in 1977
prices) to be financed by the Jordanian Government, primarily with conces-
sionary foreign financing.
7.06      The industrial port facilities will be built--and eventually operated
and administered--by the Aqaba Port Authority. It is envisaged that APC will
be charged a tariff of about US$2.15 per ton of potash, which should be ade-
quate to cover port operating costs and depreciation, and yield a reasonable
return on capital.  The Government has agreed that the ultimate tariff to be
charged to APC will be determined in accordance with established economic and
financial standards and practices.  The Government has also agreed to complete
all the required potash related port facilities by December 31, 1981, a timing



- 30 -
consistent with the APC project schedule and according to the implementation
schedule shown below; it will take any action needed to ensure the timely and
efficient shipment of APC's products. The Government has already selected a
qualified international consulting engineering firm to undertake a final site
comparison and selection study, prepare a master plan and preliminary design,
technical, economic and financial analysis, and later on carry out final
design and construction supervision activities.

7.07      With the assistance of the enginering consultants, it is expected
that the Port Authority will be able to competently carry out this port project.
During project execution, the Port Authority will work closely with a special
committee set up at the Ministry of Transport; APC and the National Planning
Council are permanent members of this committee, whose task is to ensure that
the potash port facilities are built on time, taking into consideration the
needs of APC.
VIII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND INITIAL OPERATION
A. Organization and Management for Project Execution and Operations
8.01      During project implementation and initial operations, APC, as it
builds up its own organization and staff, will be assisted by four groups
of experienced consultants for (i) project management; (ii) supervision;
(iii) financial matters; and (iv) operations management. The role of these
consultants and the status of engaging them is discussed below.



- 31 -
1.   Project Management
8.02      APC has signed an engineering services and project management agree-
ment with JII (as noted previously, a subsidiary of JEC of Pasadena, USA), for
the design, engineering, procurement, project management assistance and
supervision of the Project. The contract is satisfactory and its terms and
conditions cannot be changed without the prior approval of the Bank. It will
be jointly executed by JII's Office in Dublin, and two sub-contractors, Sir
Alexander Gibb and Partners (AGP) of Reading, UK, and Technical Services
Office, a Jordanian engineering firm of Amman, Jordan. JII will act as the
prime engineering consultants and have the ultimate responsibility for the
proper execution of all the works but both JII and AGP will jointly oversee
the execution of the Project. The responsibilities of the different consulting
firms will be as follows:
(i) JII will (a) execute the conceptual engineering and design
for the processing plant (refinery and power plant) including
instrument engineering, piping, civil, architectural, electrical
and mechanical designs; (b) prepare final specifications and
design criteria for the harvesting system, including carnallite
transport to the processing plant; (c) provide the necessary
data for the solar evaporation system; (d) assist APC in pre-
qualification of suppliers for the processing plant and submit
their recommendations to APC; (e) prepare and issue bid docu-
ments for all major processing equipment, make technical and
economic evaluation of related bids and make recommendations
to APC for purchase; and (f) supervise, inspect and approve
all work to ensure its correct execution in accordance with
the contract. In addition, JII will coordinate the works to
be done by the Government on the potash port construction,
storage and loading facilities at Aqaba. Finally, it will
assist in the development of a continuing operating plan and
a marketing plan.
(ii)  AGP will carry out the final tests required for dike con-
struction as well as civil engineering of the entire eva-
poration system, including pans, dikes, canals, and brine
intake and transfer system. AGP is responsible for the
prequalification, preparation of bidding documents, eval-
uation and award recommendation for the main civil work
contract and will supervise its execution. AGP will also
be responsible for the design, procurement and construction
supervision of the fresh water supply system, the electrical
distribution system from the transformers to the various
pumping stations, and all the conceptual, architectural and
engineering designs, procurement and construction supervision
of the township including infrastructure, housing, social and
commercial centers, electricity distribution, and sewerage
and telephone systems.
(iii)  The Technical Services Office will provide miscellaneous
assistance such as minor engineering works, secretarial help,
recruitment of most local labor, and will liaise with the
technical staff of JII and local authorities as required.



- 32 -
8.03      JII and AGP will submit to APC weekly and monthly reports, giving
summaries of the work progress. In preparing bid documents and procurement
procedures, they will take into consideration the requirements of the various
financing agencies. They will also prepare detailed manuals for start-up,
operations and maintenance of the total project facilities, including speci-
fications concerning safety procedures to be followed.
8.04      The engineering services contract between APC and JII is on a "Cost
plus Fixed Dollar Fee" basis, and includes a total budget figure of US$23.3
million in current dollars, which cannot be exceeded without APC's prior
approval (Project File - Reference E). The fixed dollar fee for the consul-
tants amounts to US$1,674,000 (US$970,000 for JII, US$650,000 for AGP and
US$54,000 for TSO). The consultants will provide 223 man-years of expatriate
assistance and 198 man-years of local staff assistance, at an average per man-
month cost of US$6,250 and US$2,420 respectively. The level of effort and
its costs are considered acceptable. The contract also includes bonus clauses
under which US$466,700 of incentives would be paid to the consultants if they
issue tender documents and complete the test-runs for the refinery (at 75% and
100% capacity) within the agreed upon Project schedule. Since the bonuses
amount to 28% of the fixed fee, they are considered an adequate incentive for
the consultants to perform their work adequately and on time.
2.   Supervision
8.05      Given the magnitude of the task to be carried out by the engineer-
ing consultants, APC has selected an experienced technical advisory firm
(King-Wilkinson of the Netherlands) which will provide 2-3 permanent staff and
necessary specialists on short-term basis to advise APC management regarding
project execution, comment on the appropriateness of various details in Proj-
ect scope and specifications, and assist in supervising procurement activities.
These consultants will provide about 120 man-months at an average cost of
US$8,000 per man-month. The scope of the work to be carried out by this
technical advisory firm is given in Annex 8-1.
3.   Financial Matters
8.06      APC has also selected a consortium of two major international
accounting consulting firms (Deloitte, Haskins and Sells of the UK and SGV
Group of the Philippines) to assist in the design and implementation of a
financial control and accounting system. Such a system is required to have
proper control of the execution of the Project and its subsequent operation.
Terms of reference for the work to be carried out by these consultants are
attached as Annex 8-2, and will require about 85 man-months of expatriate
assistance, at an average cost of US$8,500 per man-month. These consultants
started work in July 1978.
4.   Operations Management
8.07      Regarding the operations management of the Company after the Proj-
ect is completed, APC recognizes that it does not have adequate experience in
operating a large project of this type. It has, therefore, decided to obtain
outside assistance to overcome the difficulties which are usually associated
with the start-up and initial operations of such a large and complex plant.



- 33 -
For this purpose, APC intends to enter into an operations management contract
with an experienced engineering or operating firm for a period of about five
years. The signing of an operations management contract satisfactory to the
Bank is a condition of loan effectiveness. The contract is expected to start
about two years before the anticipated start-up of production. At the begin-
ning of the contract period, in consultation with APC, the consultants will
appoint most of the top-level production management group, which ultimately
will develop a team of about 30 expatriates and necessary local counterpart
staff. In the first year of the contract period, the expatriate management
staff will begin developing pre-operating and start-up plans, and make arrange-
ments for training visits by the local staff to operating facilities in the
US and Europe. In the second year, the remaining expatriate members of the
management team will be appointed and their Jordanian counterparts designated.
The plant will be commissioned and tested in the third contract year and is
expected to reach near capacity during the fifth year. At the end of the
fifth year, the plant will be turned over to the Jordanian management, and
any expatriates remaining would be directly employed by APC. During those
five years, the management and organization of APC will be developed on a
sound basis, while the participation of expatriate staff in management will
be phased out gradually.
8.08      APC has already received a proposal from JII for operations manage-
ment along the lines described above (Project File - Reference F), which is
under consideration. The proposal, which is satisfactory, includes penalty
and bonus clauses linked to the achievement of agreed production targets.
8.09      APC management is fully aware that the above-mentioned arrangements
with various consulting firms will not work satisfactorily unless APC simul-
taneously also develops a strong and competent staff and organization of
its own. Moreover, these arrangements are short-term measures in any case
and APC will have to rely on its own organization for the long-term success of
this massive project. Towards this objective, APC is actively seeking quali-
fied Jordanian staff. APC has agreed to implement an organization plan in
consultation with the Bank. Considering the efforts being made by APC to
strengthen its own organization and staff, and the outside assistance it has
been able to secure, the arrangements for project management and subsequent
operations are adequate. The proposed arrangements initially involve many
organizations and costs but are considered absolutely necessary for the proper
implementation and operation of the Project.
B. Project Implementation Schedule
8.10      The Project is complex and will be implemented in a relatively
remote area. A detailed implementation schedule is shown on the following
page. Mechanical completion is estimated to take 56 months after the start
of the engineering consultants work in November 1977. Initial carnallite
harvesting and start-up operations, at approximately 25% capacity, are
scheduled to begin in July 1982 and the Project is expected to attain full
capacity production by 1985. The implementation schedule of the three major
components of the Project -- the township, the solar evaporation system, and
the refinery (including the harvesting system) -- is described below.

8.11      The township will house construction workers and staff during the
construction phase and, therefore, some of the houses will be constructed
before the start of the major construction activities at the plant site. The
township contract was awarded in May 1978 and 75 housing units are scheduled
to be ready for occupancy by end-1978. The construction schedule calls for
the finalization of additional units by the end of 1979 with the final handing
over of houses by mid-1980. Work on township infrastructure -- including all
supporting services, commercial and social centers, roadworks, water and power
supplies, sewage collection and treatment -- started in July 1978 and is
scheduled to be completed by end-1979.
8.12      For the Solar Evaporation System, the bidding documents were issued
in June 1978, with the contract to be awarded by the end of 1978; construction
is to start at the beginning of 1979. Expeditious construction of access roads
is necessary to enable a rapid start of dike construction. Some of these
access roads across the Lisan Peninsula have already been built by the same
contractor -- Brown and Root of US -- that worked on the Pilot Project. Con-
struction of the first stage of the main salt pan dike (which will serve as
a bed for the piping of the temporary brine supply system), together with the
dikes encompassing the first carnallite pan is expected to start by March 1979
and completed by April 1980. Immediately thereafter, this first pan would
begin to be filled with brine for the laying of the salt bed. Subsequent
construction work has been scheduled so as to have carnallite from this first
pan ready for harvesting by mid-1982. The preparation of the salt bed in this
carnallite pan is therefore the critical activity that will have to be closely
monitored. The other two carnallite pans will be diked during 1980 and 1981,
and the salt beds laid and treated thereafter. The bulk of the solar evapora-
tion system is scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 1981.
8.13      Preparation of technical specifications for the mechanical components
-- including the refinery, the power and steam plants and the harvesters --
started in January 1978 and is scheduled for completion by March 1979. Orders
for time critical equipment like the crystallizers and filters are scheduled
for late 1978. Orders for the power and steam plants will be placed in early
1979 for delivery by late 1980, and orders for the remaining process plant and
equipment will be awarded in the second quarter of 1979 for delivery in mid-
1980. A pilot harvesting unit is scheduled to be ordered during the third
quarter of 1978 and delivered in time to permit testing and procurement of
the final units before the start of harvesting of carnallite scheduled for
mid-1982. Shakedown tests of the whole plant are scheduled to be carried out
during the first half of 1982, with plant start-up expected for mid-1982.
8.14      Given the complexity of the Project, the implementation program will
have to be closely monitored. The schedule, though somewhat tight, is consid-
ered attainable; the status of the financing arrangements is quite advanced as
indicated in para 9.15 and is consistent with the schedule of the Project.

IX. CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Capital Costs
9.01      Total financing required for the Project, including working capital
and interest during construction, is estimated at US$428.8 million equivalent

/a   Direct and indirect foreign exchange costs.
/b   Based on an exchange rate of JD 1 = US$3.03.
9.02      Estimates for the civil works, including the solar evaporation sys-
tem, roadworks and township, were prepared by the civil engineering consul-
tants, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, and are based on estimated December
1977 costs for similar construction contracts in Jordan. Dike construction
costs are based on experience developed on optimum methods of construction
and cross sections of dikes, and on actual construction costs during the Pilot
Project. These estimates are, therefore, relatively firm and the 15% physical
contingency allowed for civil works is considered adequate. The estimates for



- 37 -
the refinery, mechanical works and rolling stock were prepared by JII and
are based on recent quotations obtained from the major suppliers of plant and
equipment expected to bid for the Project. A physical contingency allowance of
10% is included for these items, which is considered reasonable as most project
parameters by now are relatively well defined. A contingency of 5% is included
in the estimated engineering services, which are covered by the already signed
contract. The Pilot Project which has already been completed does not include
any contingencies.
9.03      The Base Cost estimates are in December 1977 prices.  Price escala-
tion for foreign exchange costs is projected at 7.5% during 1978 and 1979 and
7.0% thereafter. Regarding escalation of local costs -- although Jordan, like
other countries in the Middle East, is currently experiencing high inflation
rates -- it is expected that inflation rates in the country will decrease
gradually over the coming years due to active measures being taken by the
Government. Local price escalation is therefore projected at 15.5% for 1978,
13.0% for 1979, 11.0% for 1980, and 8.5% per year thereafter. On these bases,
price contingencies are calculated at 20% of the Base Cost estimate and phys-
ical contingencies (excluding cost of land). The Project has been exempted
from import duties.
9.04      The working capital estimate is based on planned storage capacities
and inventories (including 60 days finished goods inventory) which are con-
sidered adequate. Accounts receivable are based on payment terms of 60 days,
which is considered reasonable. Special credit terms for sales to India (para
5.12) are expected to be met by the Central Bank of Jordan and possibly the
Islamic Development Bank. Detailed calculations of working capital are given
in Annex 9-2. Interest during construction, at US$50.6 million, appears high
in absolute terms but is in line with total Project cost and the five-year
construction schedule.
9.05      In comparison with capital cost estimates for potash-producing facil-
ities in other countries such as Canada and Western Europe, the estimates
for the APC Project are high, for a number of reasons. First, the proposed
Project will be located in a remote area and therefore the cost estimate
includes relatively large amounts for infrastructure such as a township,
water supply systems, electric power utilities, access roads, etc. Second,
the need for operational reliability in such a remote location and hot climate
requires the installation of relatively costly equipment; the additional cost
of this equipment, however, should reduce maintenance costs. Third, the
proposed Project requires the construction of several kilometers of dikes,
while potash projects in other countries are based on underground mining which
involves lower capital though higher operating costs. And, fourth, charges
for price escalation and interest during construction are higher than in other
projects because of the somewhat longer implementation period. In spite of
the relatively high capital cost of the Project, it is both financially and
economically viable as Chapters X and XI demonstrate. Still, considering the
large size of the total financing needs, APC plans to continuously review the
possibility of reducing capital costs during project implementation.

9.07      The Jordanian Government has agreed that the Project will be financed
with at least 45% equity (excluding internal cash generation), equivalent to
US$193.2 million at the estimated costs. About US$23 million of the Company's
equity have already been paid in, including US$20 million by the Government of
Jordan. The equity contribution of the Government will be made from annual
budgetary allocations and its 1978 Budget includes sufficient provisions
for additional equity payments. A part of foreign equity funds would be used
to finance the gap between local costs of the Project and local financing.
At least US$98.5 million equivalent, representing 51% of equity (excluding
internal cash generation), will be contributed by the Government. The Arab
Mining Company will subscribe US$48.3 million (25% of equity) and the Islamic
Development Bank US$12 million (6%). The remaining 18% equity has been offered
to the original shareholders (private individuals and Arab states); the Govern-
ment of Libya is considering purchase of 5% of this. The Government has com-
mitted itself to purchase any equity remaining unsubscribed after these share-
holders have exercised their option to contribute additional equity and other
potential investors in Jordan and the Gulf countries have been offered an
opportunity to invest. The same will apply in case APC equity needs increase
beyond the currently anticipated US$193.2 million equivalent level. The full
subscription of the increased authorized capital of JD 63 million and the
payment of the initial installment are conditions of loan effectiveness.



- 39 -
9.08      During 1984 and 1985, it is expected that APC would be able to
generate internally sufficient cash flows to finance about US$17.3 million
of principally the increases in permanent working capital during this period.
9.09      Debt financing totalling about US$218 million equivalent is ex-
pected to be obtained from five main sources or groups of sources. The
proposed World Bank loan of US$35 million would cover 8% of total project
financing requirements and 11% of foreign exchange costs. The loan would
be made directly to APC, which will carry the exchange risk, at an annual
interest rate of 10%, including a guarantee fee to the Government of 2.1%, 1/
for 13 years, including 6 years of grace. These terms are recommended to
enable repayments to start only in 1985. As discussed later in para 10.06, it
is imperative that the repayment of principal of long-term debt does not
commence prior to 1985. 2/ An earlier start of repayment would lead to
unacceptable debt service ratios for APC during 1982 and 1983.
9.10      AID is expected to provide a loan of US$38 million, in two tranches,
to the Government for 40 years, including 10 years of grace, at an annual
interest rate of 2% for the first 10 years and 3% thereafter. The onlending
terms to APC will be 20 years maturity, including 6 years of grace, at 8% per
annum. APC will carry the foreign exchange risk.
9.11      A total of US$107 million equivalent in long-term debt will be pro-
vided to the Government by several regional bilateral and multilateral agen-
cies. The Kuwait Fund for Economic Development has agreed to provide US$35
million; the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development would contribute
US$15 million, the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank US$50 million and the OPEC Spe-
cial Fund US$7 million. In addition, the Iraqi Fund is considering a loan,
which if approved, would reduce the amount of the commercial loan (para
9.13). These funds will be lent to the Government at annual interest rates of
between 3.5% to 6%, with an average of slightly above 4.5%. The onlending
terms to APC will be 20 years maturity, including 6 years of grace, at 8% per
annum.
9.12      The differential between the 8% onlending rate to APC and the aver-
age 4.5% interest to be paid by the Government on AID and other bilateral and
multilateral funds and that for the Bank loan (2.1%) are estimated to total
US$18.3 million and will not be paid by APC to the Government during the
implementation period (1978-83); it will be deferred until December 31, 1984
and paid to the Government in ten equal semi-annual installments thereafter.
9.13      Finally, the remaining debt financing needs of US$20 million equiv-
alent will be met through commercial borrowings by APC. The Company, which
has already been approached by a number of banks in various countries, is not
expected to have any major difficulty in raising these funds. APC has agreed
to finalize arrangements for these funds before December 31, 1979, on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
1/   Based on the difference between the Bank's standard lending rate, pres-
ently 7.9%, and the 10%.
2/   This a sumes project implementation in accordance with the Schedule on
page 3 .



- 40 -
9.14      The signing of the loan agreements with AID and other bilateral and
multilateral agencies is a condition of loan effectiveness. Should execution
of the Project require additional funds, independently of whether these addi-
tional funds are needed on account of a cost overrun or shortfall of APC's
internal cash generation, the Government has agreed to promptly provide such
funds to complete the Project and do so in the form of equity and/or loans,
as appropriate. Such obligation by the Government will be diminished by the
additional equity contributions that APC's other shareholders might make to
help finance the overrun. All funds to the Project, including those to
finance possible costs overruns will be provided in a manner such that APC's
debt to equity ratio will not exceed 55:45 at Project Completion and there-
after. Also, to safeguard APC's liquidity, it will at all times after Proj-
ect Completion maintain a minimum quick ratio of 0.8 to 1.0. For purposes
of this covenant, the Project will be considered complete when it reaches a
75% capacity utilization for a continuous period of at least three months, in
accordance with the test runs to be carried out by the operations management
consultants.
9.15      The processing of loans by AID and other bilateral and multilateral
agencies is at an advanced stage. AID has completed its appraisal and pre-
sented the Project to its management; signing of the first tranche of its loan
(US$5 million) is expected during August 1978 and the second tranche (US$33
million) by October 1978. The Islamic Bank and the Kuwait Fund have also
appraised and substantially negotiated their contributions with APC. The
management of the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank has already considered the Project
and has presented it to the Libyan Government for its approval. The OPEC Fund
has approved its loan and the Arab Fund is expected to process its loan during
the next few months.
C. Procurement
9.16      Procurement for the Project will be carried out in accordance with
the guidelines of the lending agencies. The consultants will prepare bid
documents and assist APC in qualifying and selecting contractors. The Proj-
ect will be divided into three main procurement categories: (i) the township;
(ii) solar evaporation and brine transfer systems; and (iii) the refinery.
Each of these categories is significantly different in work content, timing
and location, so that there will be few interface problems.
9.17      The contract for the township has been awarded after international
competitive bidding with post-qualification of contractors. It is a fixed
price contract on a lump-sum basis. Bidding documents, including detailed
working drawings, were issued in November 1977 to about 30 international
contractors that had expressed interest in bidding for the township. Seven
proposals were received in mid-March 1978 and evaluated by AGP. The contract
was awarded in May as per project schedule and preliminary work has already
started.



- 41 -
9.18      The civil works contract for the solar evaporation and brine transfer
system will also be procured under international competitive bidding with pre-
qualification of contractors. During February 1978, the civil works (as well
as the process plant) were advertised in a number of international newspapers,
technical magazines and the UN Development Forum, inviting interested con-
tractors and suppliers to register with the consultants. Biddiig documents
were issued in June 1978 and the contract award is scheduled by end-1978. The
method of bidding for dike construction will be on the basis of unit prices
and bill of quantities. The civil enginering consultants, AGP, acquired sub-
stantial experience in dike construction under permeable and unstable soils
during the execution of the Pilot Project. It has, therefore, prepared
detailed working drawings and technical specifications for dike construction;
the chosen contractor will be required to construct the dikes in accordance
with these specifications. The contractor will also be required to employ a
specialized sub-contractor for the supply and installation of the pumps for
the brine transfer system, and the electrical distribution and substations.
9.19      For the process plant, i.e., the harvesting system, refinery and
power generating plant, APC's general consultants, JII, will prepare detailed
technical specifications for equipment items. Procurement for both equipment
supply and erection will be carried out under international competitive bid-
ding, except for a limited amount of small items and proprietory items which
will be procured after prudent international shopping. As far as erection
is concerned, three separate contracts may be awarded, i.e., one each for the
harvesting system, the earthworks and the erection of both the refinery and
the power plant.
9.20      In view of the different procurement practices of the various co-
lenders to the Project, procurement will be done under parallel financing
arrangements on the basis of prior allocation of packages to different groups
of financing sources. The Bank loan will finance (a) equipment and materials
for the refinery and power plant; (b) the main mechanical contract for the
erection of the refinery and power plant; and (c) consultancy services for
engineering and construction management, technical advisory, financial and
accounting system, and operations management. International competitive
bidding will be used for procurement of refinery and power plant equipment,
and for the mechanical erection contract, in accordance with a list of goods
agreed with the Bank, except for small items costing less than US$100,000 (up
to a total maximum of US$1.0 million) and proprietary items not exceeding
US$3.0 million which will be procured after prudent international shopping.
The Bank loan would retroactively finance up to US$1.0 million of expenditures
on engineering and construction management services, incurred after March 31,
1978.
9.21      The Arab institutions will jointly finance the main civil works
contracts for the construction of the solar evaporation system which is esti-
mated to cost US$140 million. AID would jointly finance with the Bank
the engineering services contract already awarded to JII and possibly the
contract for operations management in case it is awarded to a US company.
Some equipment awarded to US suppliers after international competitive bid-
ding would also be financed by AID rather than by untied sources.

The Bank loan is expected to be completely disbursed by June 30, 1984. A dis-
bursement schedule is given in Annex 9-3.
X. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Revenues and Operating Costs
10.01     For the financial analysis, it is assumed that the Project will
start commercial production in mid-1982 and that capacity utilization will
gradually increase from an average of 13% in 1982 to 100% in 1985 when 1.2
million tons of potassium chloride would be produced and exported. This
relatively slow production build-up is consistent with the implementation
schedule and the technical characteristics of carnallite build up, and is
judged as reasonable considering the complexity of the Project. Revenue
estimates assume that potash prices in real terms will be US$75 per ton FOB
Vancouver by 1987 and US$80 by 1990 as discussed in Chapter IV (para 4.18).
The financial and economic projections, based on these FOB Vancouver price
projections, have also assumed that during its first three years of operation,
APC as a new producer would offer a price discount of 10% below the prevail-
ing international prices, in order to penetrate the markets. Thereafter, APC



- 43 -
should be able to charge international prices for its products. In addition
APC should be able to profit from an additional margin reflecting the ocean
freight advantage that it enjoys in some of its potential markets on account
of geographical proximity. As earlier mentioned, the delivery price of potash
is likely to be principally determined by Canadian producers. Currently, APC's
freight advantage in the Indian and Pacific Ocean area over Canadian potash
(priced at Vancouver) ranges from a negligible amount for Japan to US$5-7 per
ton for Singapore and to US$10-15 per ton for India. The ocean freight market
is currently depressed and these rate differentials are probably the minimum
that can be expected in the future. It is assumed that APC's freight advan-
tage throughout its potential markets would average US$5 per ton KC1. The
total netback (excluding initial price discounts) to APC is therefore assumed
at US$80 per ton in 1987 and US$85 per ton by 1990 (FOB Aqaba, in 1977 prices),
as shown in Annex 10-1. The equilibrium price in 1990 (i.e. US$80/ton KCI, FOB
Vancouver) is expected to be effective during the Project's remaining economic
life.
10.02     The total production and transportation cost of APC's potash at
Aqaba, after the plant reaches full capacity is shown in Annex 10-2 and is
summarized below:
JORDAN - Production and Transportation Costs Estimates
(in Constant 1977 US Dollars/ton KC1)

3.  Port and Loading Charges               2.15           12
TOTAL COST:                    18.41          100
10.03     APC's total direct production cost ex-factory is estimated at
US$13.22 per ton in 1977 dollars. Heavy fuel and diesel oil are costed at
international prices delivered at the plant site (US$81 per ton for fuel
oil and US$119 per ton for diesel oil) and represent 46% of production cost.
The local prices of these petroleum products are presently about 25% of
international prices because of subsidized oil supplies from Saudi Arabia
(para 6.19). It is not certain, however, whether these subsidies will
continue after the plant starts operations since there are no long-term
contractual arrangements between the two countries. For this reason the
financial projections of the Company have been prepared using international



- 44 -
prices for fuel and diesel oil. Transportation between the plant and Aqaba
will be by truck and its costs include drivers' salaries, truck maintenance,
gasoline, truck loading costs and a toll of US$0.50 per ton for road mainte-
nance (Annex 10-2). Port and ship loading charges will be paid to the Aqaba
Port Authority, which will administer the port facilities, and are composed
of operating costs, depreciation and a reasonable return on port investments.
B. Financial Projections
10.04     Financial projections are expressed in current US dollars.  Annual
inflation rates for foreign exchange costs and revenues are assumed to be 7.5%
during 1978 and 1979 and 7.0% thereafter. Inflation rates in Jordan are ex-
pected to decline from 15.5% in 1978 to 8.0% after 1981. In spite of the
differential between international and local inflation rates, the exchange
rate between the US dollar and the JD is assumed to remain at the rate of
US$3.03 per JD during the foreseeable future. This is a conservative assump-
tion but is regarded appropriate in view of the healthy balance of payments
position of the country. The assumptions used in the financial projec-
tions on the terms and conditions for loans granted by several financing
institutions are shown in Annex 10-3; loan repayments would start in 1984 for
commercial loans, and 1985 for the Bank loan as well as for the loans from
AID and other bilateral and multilateral agencies. Repayment of the deferred
interest accrued to the Government of Jordan during construction is assumed to
start in 1985. Based on these assumptions, the projections are made in full
detail in Annex 10-4 and are summarized below:

- 45 -
10.05     Revenues are expected to increase from US$11.5 million in 1982 to
US$150 million in 1985, when the plant would reach full capacity utilization.
Total sales represent 99.5% of revenue, the rest representing income from
charges made to employees for housing and utilities. The evolution of pro-
duction costs reflects the lack of variability of costs typical of a plant
with large economies of scale. The high production costs in the early years
of plant operations are also due to the employment of more expensive expa-
triate staff who would assist in operations management. In part due to
these factors, the Company would incur heavy losses of US$12.8 million in
1982 and US$19.4 million in 1983. However, as depreciation represents an
important share of total costs, APC would be able to start generating a posi-
tive cash flow in 1983, when it would amount to US$12.9 million. Although
debt service coverage in 1983 would still be low at 1.7, it will improve
quickly from 1984 and would reach a comfortable level of 2.5 in 1985, the
year with largest debt service of US$42.1 million.
10.06     However, in case project implementation were to slip by one year,
as shown in Annex 10-5, APC would not be able to generate positive internal
cash flow until 1984; only in 1985 would it be able to reach a debt service
ratio of above 1.0. 1/ This sensitivity analysis highlights the need for the
Bank and other co-lending institutions to provide in their loans appropriate
grace periods so that principal repayments will not start before 1985. Under-
standings have been reached with co-lenders on the provision of appropriate
grace periods to APC.
10.07     In 1986, the profit and cash breakeven capacity utilization are
calculated at 45% and 28% respectively, as shown in Annex 10-6.
C. Financial Covenants
10.08     APC has agreed to follow prudent financial practices and also to:
(i) maintain at all times during project implementation a debt/equity ratio
of 60/40 or better, and 55/45 at and after project completion; (ii) maintain
a quick ratio of at least 0.8:1.0 at and after Project completion; (iii) not
incur additional debt if by so doing its debt service coverage would fall
below 1.5; (iv) limit its dividend payments and financial commitments to
affiliated companies (if any), or make prepayment of any debt, if such action
would cause its quick ratio to fall below 1.0:1.0; (v) until the Project has
operated at 90% capacity for twelve consecutive months or until December 31,
1985, whichever is later, not pay any dividend or undertake any expansion
program, including capital investments, exceeding US$1.0 million per year,
or any other major disbursement of funds without prior approval of the Bank;
and (vi) have its accounts audited annually in time by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. In addition, the Government has agreed to waive
royalty payments until Project Completion date or December 31, 1985, which-
ever is later.
1/   The projections are based on the same assumptions for financing arrange-
ment and slightly increased capital expenditures (about 4%) due to price
escalation.



- 46 -
D. Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
10.09     The financial rate of return for the Project in constant 1977 terms
is estimated at 12.4% before taxes and 11.0% after taxes. If the local sub-
sidized price of fuel in Jordan--which as previously noted is about 25% of
international prices--were to prevail during the project life, the financial
rate of return for the Project after taxes would increase to 12.2%. Sensi-
tivity tests show that the rates of return are quite resistant to unfavorable
variations in revenues and capital and operating costs. This stability in
return is due to the Project's low direct operating costs compared to ex-
pected revenues. A 13% variation in revenues (resulting, for example, from
a reduction throughout the project life in the expected Vancouver prices from
US$75 per ton to US$65 per ton) would reduce the before tax financial return
from 12.4% to 10.2%. The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in
Annex 10-7 and summarized below (see para 10.15 regarding the results of a
risk analysis):
Sensitivity Test on Before Tax
Financial Rate of Return
(in %)
Base Case                                          12.4

One Year Delay in Completion                       11.7
E.   Major Risks
10.10     The Project is not only massive in size but also quite complex
technically; it will also be located at a remote site and involves a long
implementation period. It will be executed by a relatively new company, in
a relatively small country with limited resources and without any domestic
market for its products. A combination of these factors leads to some unusual
financial, technical, market and management risks being faced by the Project;
other potential risks are linked to political uncertainties in the region.
10.11     Because of the size of this Project in relation to the Jordanian
economy, if the Company is faced with serious financial difficulties, the
entire country may be affected.  As discussed in para 10.06, during its first
two years of operation the Project could face significant financial risks if
the terms of its long-term borrowing were not appropriate.  Therefore, under-
standings have been reached with APC and the co-lenders that the financing
plan will include appropriate loan terms. After 1984, financial risks will
be reduced substantially as the Company would generate a significant internal
cash flow and since the cash breakeven is low at 28% of capacity.



- 47 -
10.12     Marketing is another area that represents significant risks as
discussed in Chapter V. It is imperative that during project execution the
Company take appropriate measures to ensure that its output will have a ready
market by the time the plant comes on stream. APC has prepared a timetable of
critical actions in marketing to be taken during project execution, including
the hiring of an experienced Sales Executive by October 1978. The timely
implementation of this timetable will reduce marketing risks.
10.13     The Project is not expected to face any critical technical risks due
to the substantial preparatory work done during the Pilot Project. Moreover,
while the Project does not involve standard designs and processes, it is quite
similar to the Dead Sea Works facilities which are now operating successfully.
The consultants seem justified in their confidence that the technical problems
initially faced by DSW will not be repeated in the Project. Still, the three
principal technical uncertainties facing the Project are that (i) the evapor-
ation rates in the carnallite pans may prove to be lower than expected, with
corresponding reduction in production; (ii) the proposed harvesting units
may not operate as contemplated, which would require the use of an alternative
system; (iii) water resources in the Project area may be diverted to other
uses; and (iv) flash floods substantially larger than anticipated may damage
dikes during construction or overtop dikes during operation and thus tempo-
rarily disrupt production. These risks, however, would be reduced by the
measures taken or contemplated by APC and its consultants and the satisfac-
tory assurances obtained from the Government, as described earlier in this
report.
10.14     Finally, considering the size and complexity of the Project and that
APC is still at the initial stages of developing its organization, the Project
could face major management risks. In order to reduce these risks, appropriate
measures described in Chapter VII have been taken, namely, contracting the
services of consultants for assistance in project execution, developing a
financial control and accounting system, managing initial operations, and
simultaneous strengthening of APC's own staff and organization.
10.15     In order to quantify the possible impact of the several risks and
uncertainties associated with the Project, a risk analysis was carried out
under which probabilities were attached to possible variation in revenues,
capital and operating costs, and to possible delays in project execution.
This risk analysis confirmed that the Project's viability over the long term
is quite stable; there is a 90% probability that the before tax financial (and
economic) return would be between 8% and 15%. The expected financial rate of
return calculated by this risk analysis is about 12.8%, and the probability
that the rate of return will fall below 8% is less than 5%.
10.16     In summary, the Project does face a combination of risks, but it
is believed that with the measures taken by APC and the number of assurances
obtained from APC and the Government, the risks associated with the Project are
reduced to an acceptable level.

XI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
11.01     For the economic analysis of the Project, which will export its
entire output, all financial costs and benefit data have been subdivided into
tradeable and nontradeable items. The tradeable items are valued at inter-
national prices, and nontradeable items have been adjusted to reflect the
economic prices to Jordan. Since the financial costs and benefits contain
a high proportion of the tradeable items mostly expressed in international
prices, they have been used for economic rate of return calculations.
11.02     Of the nontradeable components of the costs, skilled and unskilled
labor costs are estimated to reflect the opportunity cost of labor in the
Middle East area. Jordan has been supplying a substantial number of skilled
and unskilled workers to the neighboring Arab countries in the past two
decades and this is likely to continue. The other significant cost item is
fuel, which had already been valued at international prices in the financial
analysis. However, the economic cost of potash port usage is assumed at about
US$2.75/ton (compared to financial charge of US$2.15/ton), which is calculated
to provide a 10% return on APC related port investments. No further adjust-
ments to financial costs were considered necessary. Regarding the economic
value of project land, it is considered equal to the price paid to the pri-
vate owners, even though it is located in a remote area with no agricultural
or other use; therefore the land has a negligible economic value.
11.03     The sales revenues of the Company's output assumed for financial
analysis are based on international prices as expected during the life of
the Project. Here, again, the financial prices are directly interpreted as
economic values.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
11.04     The economic rate of return is calculated at 12.4% in constant
terms, as shown in Annex 11-1. This rate is similar to the before tax finan-
cial rate of return obtained in the previous chapter. The results of the
sensitivity analysis is shown in the Chart on the following page. As with
the financial return, the economic return is quite resistant to changes in
costs and revenues. A 10% reduction in revenues lowers the return to 10.7%,
while a 10% increase in capital costs reduces the return to 11.4%.
C.   Competitive Position of APC
11.05     The viability of the Project is also supported by the fact that
APC has a satisfactory competitive position in production costs, compared
with Canada, which is the major world potash trader, in spite of the fact
that the capital cost for the Project is substantially higher than the capi-
tal cost of a new venture in Canada. Production costs for the Project and
for a typical Canadian plant are given in paragraphs 10.02 and 4.16, respec-
tively. APC's total direct production cost, ex-factory, of US$13.22 per ton

KC1 is only slightly lower than direct production cost in Canada, estimated
at US$14.50 per ton. However, since APC's plant is located only 200 km from
Aqaba, while Canadian mines are 1,000 km from Vancouver, APC's FOB Aqaba
total cost of US$18.41 per ton is about US$15 per ton lower than Canada's
FOB cost at Vancouver, which is estimated at about US$35.15 per ton. This
price differential, however, is partially offset by the higher financial
costs to be incurred by APC due to the larger capital cost involved. On the
assumption that the notional Canadian plant could be financed at about the
same terms as the APC Project, the total cost plus debt service would amount
to about US$47 per ton for APC's potash, compared to US$50 per ton for Canada.
This figure indicates that also under comparable financing costs APC would be
able to compete successfully in world markets and especially in the Indian
and Pacific Ocean area where APC has a freight advantage of US$5-10 per ton,
at the minimum.
D.   Other Benefits
11.06     The Project will also generate other substantial benefits to Jordan,
including net foreign exchange earnings of about US$1,000 million (in 1977 dol-
lars) over the life of the Project (for purposes of this calculation assumed
to be 20 operating years - Annex 11-2), direct creation of some 700 permanent
jobs and about 1,000 jobs during construction, and the establishment of a new
industrial growth pole in a remote area of the country, all meeting important
objectives of the Government's policies in the industrial sector. When the
Project reaches full operation in 1985, it will contribute some US$150 million
per year to exports, representing about 15% of industrial exports and about 8%
of total country exports. The Project will also help diversify and strengthen
the Jordanian export base, thus securing more stable foreign exchange earnings
in the future:  mainly due to the Project's exports, Jordan's traditional de-
pendence on phosphate exports will be reduced, as the share of phosphate exports
is reduced from 50% of industrial exports to 38%.
11.07     The Project will also have a major beneficial fiscal impact on the
country's budget. As detailed in Annex 11-3, the Project, during its life,
will make a net cumulative contribution to the Government of about US$900
million, in the form of taxes, dividends, guarantee fees on foreign loans,
port charges and surplus cash generated for other investments. The. maximum
likely total initial Government contribution of US$116 million in APC equity
and investments in infrastructure (assuming that the industrial port will
be financed by foreign assistance) is calculated to bring an attractive DCF
return of over 23%.
11.08     The location of the Project will serve another important goal of
the industrial sector, i.e., geographical dispersion of the industry. The
proposed project site, which, at present, is sparsely populated and does not
have any major economic activity, will be converted into an industrial area
with a major modern township. The emergence of a new township and more
frequent traffic between the plant site and Amman-Zarqa and Aqaba will sub-
stantially activate the regional economy, including commercial activities
in the Karak-Mazra-Safi area. This increased economic activity will provide
improved infrastructure and social services to the area. Finally, the Project



- 51 -
will also have significant institution building effects. APC will acquire
substantial expertise in engineering, project management and operations,
international marketing, and financial matters. Such expertise will be
utilized for the development of other projects in the Dead Sea area, includ-
ing the extraction of bromine and magnesium. In short, the Project will have
a major impact on the Jordanian economy.

JORDAN - ARAB POTASH PROJECT
THE PILOT PROJECT
1.        The Pilot Project carried out during 1976-1977 had the fol-
lowing components:
(i) the design, construction, and testing of trial dikes
to determine optimal full scale design and construction
methods as well as seepage control;
(ii) construction of test ponds to determine evaporation rates
and optimal evaporation pan design;
(iii) undertaking of physico-chemical tests to establish the
best means for recovering and producing commercial grades
of potash;
(iv) undertaking of extensive hydrological studies to determine
the availability of fresh water as well as flood volumes
and velocities in the Project area and to estimate the
future levels of the Dead Sea;
(v) preparation of a detailed feasibility report to determine
capital and operating costs, analyse market potential,
and determine the technical, financial, and economic
viability of the Project.
2.        The construction of the trial dikes involved considerable field
work, including boring and core testing of the sea bed and surrounding
soft shore plus grouting experiments to determine optimal ways of minimizing
leakage from the ponds. Some 800 bore holes drilled and soil tests made
both in situ and in the consultants' laboratories: three trial dikes
totalling about 500 m and made of different slopes and heights ranging
from 3 to 5 m were constructed and tested to determine points of failure
and ultimate strength and permeability. Impermeable dike cores made of
materials in the locality and imported artificial membranes were tested
for their suitability for the Project. The tests and studies revealed
that there is adequate quality material for dike construction within
a reasonable distance from the site. Materials for the foundation,
sides, and top surface layer of the dikes will be quarried nearby.
Marl from the Lisan Peninsula will be used for the impermeable dike
core, the surrounding wadis will provide sand to be used as a filtering
layer,gravel for the dikes, and stones for rip rap protection of the dikes.
3.        Some ten test pans of different dimensions were used to de-
termine the evaporation rates of the Dead Sea brine at different specific
gravities, and the optimal specific gravities and temperatures for the
deposition of carnallite were obtained. It was also found that the
addition of Naphthol Green dye to the brine could improve the evaporation
rates by some 15 to 20%. However, the economics of utilizing this dye
in the carnallite pans are currently considered questionable but will be
investigated when the plant comes on stream.

4.        Some two tons of carnallite produced at the test site were
sent to US laboratories for analysis and were successfully processed
into commercial grade potash by the hot leach/crystallization process
which will be used in the Project's refinery.
5.        Extensive hydrological studies, which included five boreholes,
carried out by the consultants with the assistance of the Institute of
Hydrology (Oxford, UK) revealed that there is an adequate supply of water
for both the plant and the township needs which have been estimated
at 5.6 and 0.5 million m3/ year respectively. In fact, excluding flood
flows, the perennial annual volume of water leaving the excarpment of
the Project area in the form of base, which flows in the surrounding
wadis or springs, is estimated at about 45 million m3 (of which 25 million
m3 comes from Wadi Hasa some 7 km from the plant). Considerable volume
of groundwater is also available in the plant vicinity from Chor Safi
aquifer which has a storage capacity of about 67 million m3. The town-
ship will obtain its water requirements from nearby Ghor Mazra which has  3
a capacity of 25 million m3 and a recharge capacity of about 1.3 million m
per year.
6.        Past records of rainfall intensity over the Project catchment
area has been studied, and it has been estimated that the maximum flood
volume that might occur at the wadi mouths with a probability of one in
1,000 years is 2,900 m3/sec. Such floods would pass through the Truce Line
channel to reach the Dead Sea at 2,150 m3/sec. To prevent flood water
damage to the dikes, the width of this channel will be some 500 m and will
also provide an outlet for the effluents from DSW and-APC works.  In
addition, appropriate measures have been designed to protect the APC dikes
exposed to such floods.
7.        An analysis of the level of the Dead Sea from 1861 to date in
relation to the rainfall data available over the same period was made.
These historical trends together with in situ investigations and testing
provided data for laboratory simulated models. These studies show that
the most likely possibility is a slow decline of the Dead Sea level
averaging 60 cm/year, thus providing data for brine intake location and dike
height.
8.        The Pilot Project provided useful data for the preparation of
the optimum size of the full scale project and its capital and operating
costs. A study of the potential potash market confirmed that the Project
is likely to have potential markets for its product when it comes into
production in the early 1980s.
9.        Based on the results of the Pilot Project, a 10 volume detailed
Feasibility Report was issued by the consultants in February 1978 (Project
File - Reference B). The study confirms that the full scale project
with an annual capacity of 1.2 million tons of KC1 will be technically,
economically, and financially viable.

JORDAN - ARAB POTASH PROJECT
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE HOT-LEACH/CRYSTALLIZATION REFINING PROCESS
1. The 40% slurry delivered from the carnallite pans and
containing inter alia carnallite and sodium chloride is
fed to the chemical plant.
2.  The slurry is dewatered in belt filters,and the clarified
liquor is recycled to the carnallite pans.
3. The dewatered carnallite-sodium chloride mixture is de-
composed in a two stage water countercurrent system. The
potassium chloride is not dissolved by the freshwater and
remains in solid form together with the sodium chloride
while the magnesium chloride, which is more soluble, is
dissolved in the water.
4. The precipitated potash and sodium chloride form a
synthetic sylvinite containing approximately three parts
of potash to two parts of Sodium chloride.
5. The synthetic sylvinite is dewatered and fed to the hot-
leach system.
6. In the hot-leach system, the sylvinite plus fresh water
are heated to 2100F. Here 100% of the potassium chloride
in the sylvinite is dissolved since its solubility increases
with temperature. Sodium chloride is not dissolved, re-
maining in solid form since the solubility of common salt
does not change with temperature.
7. The solid sodium chloride is thickened and removed by
centrifugation.
8. The liquor - rich in potassium chloride - is then fed into
the crystallization system. This liquor still contains sub-
stantial amounts of sodium chloride that should be removed.
9. Potassium chloride is crystallized in a three stage,
fractionally crystallizing system. First, the solutions
are cooled by a flash evaporation which results in a net
water removal from the system. Since the solubility of
potassium chloride diminishes as temperature declines,
potash is precipitated in the crystallizer. The solubility
of sodium chloride is not affected by temperature and re-
mains in the solution. The three stages in the crystallizing
system are operated at 180, 150, and 120OF respectively.
10. To prevent the precipitation of sodium chloride because
of the vaporization, water is added to the crystallizer
in a quantity approximately equal to the water removed
by the flash cooling.

Page 2
11. The potassium chloride crystals are withdrawn from the
crystallizers in the form of a slurry and dewatered
and dried.
12.  The potassium chloride depleted mother liquor from the
third stage is recycled to the hot-leach section.

JORDAN - ARAB POTASH PROJECT
SCOPE OF WORK FOR TECHNICAL ADVISORY FIRM
Background
1.        The Arab Potash Company (APC), a Company majority owned by the
Jordanian Government, is implementing a project to commercially exploit
the minerals contained in the Dead Sea brine. The Company's plant would be
located at the southern end of the Dead Sea. Project construction would
start during 1978 with the aim of commencing operation in mid 1982. APC
would be producing 1.2 million metric tons per year of potassium chloride.
The production process involves solar evaporation of Dead Sea brine in large
shallow ponds, followed by refining utilizing the hot-leach/crystallization
process. Utilities required and a township will also form part of the Pro-
ject. The Company's output will be exported through the Port of Aqaba
principally to the countries in the Indian and Pacific Ocean Area. The
Company would transport its output to Aqaba (200 km) in its own trucks.
Storage and ship loading at Aqaba would be the responsibility of the Aqaba
Port Authority, a Government agency under the Ministry of Transport. The
Project is estimated to cost US$429 million, including about US$310 mil-
lion in foreign exchange. It would be financed 45% by equity and 55% by
debt from regional and international financing institutions.
2.        In November 1977, APC contracted the services of Jacobs International
Inc. (JII) of USA to provide engineering services including design engineering,
procurement, project management assistance and supervision of the project.
JII in turn subcontracted Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners of UK to assist
in civil engineering aspects and the Technical Service Office of Jordan to
provide miscellaneous office assistance.
Objectives
3.        APC has decided to engage a consulting firm to act as its
"Technical Advisors" which are expected to work closely with APC's
technical staff and provide advice and solution to any unforeseen problems
that may arise. The technical advisors are not expected to duplicate the
work to be carried out by the engineering consultants. However, they will act
as APC's advisors and owner's representatives to assist APC in the owner's
supervision of the proper implementation of the project. The technical
advisors will act as part of APC's staff and will work closely with local
counterparts who will gradually take their responsibilities. The head of the
advisory team will report directly to APC's general manager.
4.        This Technical Advisory Body is expected to supply three
specialists with substantive practical experience in three main engineering
fields: civil, chemical, and mechanical. In addition, other specialists
may be called upon to provide other specialized advice as needed. It is
anticipated that most of such advice would be needed for short periods, but
in some cases, such specialists may be needed over extended periods (3 to 12
months). At least the head of the team will be stationed in Jordan during
the entire implementation of the project. Other specialists may be located,
at least during part of the time, in the offices of the engineering consultants



- 64 -                       ANNEX 8-1
Page 2
in the USA and/or England and/or Ireland.
5.        The specialists to be provided by the consulting firm should be
highly qualified and with considerable experience in the execution of large
chemical processing plants of a similar nature, preferably potash plants.
Since the works involve the construction of some 60 km of dike on dif-
ficult terrain in a tropical environment, the civil engineer provided by
the consulting firm should be highly qualified with extensive practical ex-
perience in dam construction in similar environment. He should also, pre-
ferably, be experienced in the other civil construction such as roads and
housing. The chemical engineers should have extensive practical experience
in the chemical field preferably in fertilizer production processes with
particular experience in the extraction of potash by crystallization re-
fining. The mechanical engineer should have considerable experience in
chemical fertilizer machinery and equipment, principally for potash pro-
duction including carnallite harvesting equipment.
Scope of Work
6.        The specific areas where advice of the specialists will be re-
quired are:
(a) Comment of the appropriateness of the project's
scope and specifications suggested by the con-
sultants, including any subsequent changes.
(b) Provide assistance to APC in the supervision of the
execution of the project.
(c) Assist APC in supervising all procurement activities
and make comments to APC on the evaluation and recom-
mendations for the award of contracts.
(d) Advise APC on any other matters concerning project design,
implementation, and operation as APC may request from
time to time.

JORDAN - ARAB POTASH PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE
FOR A FINANCIAL CONTROL & ACCOUNTING SYSTEM
Background
1.        The Arab Potash Company (APC), a company owned primarily by the
Jordanian Government, is implementing a project to commercially exploit the
minerals contained in the Dead Sea brine. The company's plant would be
located at the southern end of the Dead Sea and would start project con-
struction during 1978 with the aim of commencing operation in mid 1982.  In
November 1977, APC contracted the services of the consultants Jacobs In-
ternational Inc. (JII) and Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners to provide
engineering services for project implementation, including the development
of a cost accounting system for project construction. APC would be producing
1.2 million metric tons per year of potassium chloride. The production pro-
cess involves solar evaporation of Dead Sea brine followed by refining
utilizing the hot-leach/crystallization process. The company's output
will be exported through the Port of Aqaba principally to the countries in
the Indian and Pacific Ocean Area. The company would transport its output
to Aqaba (200 km) in its own trucks. Storage and ship loading at Aqaba would
be the responsibility of the Aqaba Port Authority, a Government agency under
the Ministry of Transport. However, APC would have to maintain certain in-
volvement in shipping to serve those markets which traditionally buy on a
CIF basis. The project is estimated to cost US$429 million, including about
US$310 million in foreign exchange. It would be financed 45% by equity and
55% by debt from various Arab funds and international agencies. More details
about the company's proposed operations will be provided upon request.
2.        APC has decided to engage technical assistance (accounting con-
sultants) for the design and implementation of a financial control and ac-
counting system. It is anticipated that the bulk of the consultants' work
would be carried out over a period of about two years and, if necessary,
APC will retain the consultants for an additional period to assist in the
implementation and initial operation of the accounting system.
Objectives
3.        The purpose of the technical assistance is to:
(i)  design and assist APC in the implementation of a financial
control and accounting system. Such system should be designed
as to properly and timely reflect APC's operations and
activities during project implementation and after the
start of commercial operations. It shall be capable of
accurately recording the various costs inputs from all
aspects of APC's operations and should readily provide
the wide range of data needed to assist management in its
operations and financial decisions;



- 66 -                        ANNEX 8-2
Page 2
(ii) train APC staff to facilitate the implementation and use
of the MIS and design instruction manuals setting out
objectives and procedures of the system; and
(iii) assist in the initial implementation of the system.
Scope of Work
4.        The accounting consultants shall discuss with APC about its needs
regarding financial planning, general and cost accounting, and operations.
Since the engineering consultants (JII) will develop .a cost accounting
system to reflect the cost of construction of the project, the accounting
consultants should coordinate work with JII to ensure consistency and avoid
duplication of activities. More specifically, the tasks of the accounting
consultants shall be as follows:
(a) develop and help implement a "Cost Accounting System" with
accounts classification into variable and fixed costs and
direct and indirect costs, detailing cost centers. The
cost accounting system should be able to generate in-
formation for assigning responsibility, measure labor and
input productivity against standards, analyse and control
cost variances (i.e., input and labor price and quantity,
efficiency, overhead, and capacity variances) from the
standards, and for determining the level of profitability
of APC so that pricing decisions can be taken with the
full knowledge of costs. The system should also include
payroll accounting and procedures, including coding
structures and recovery and control procedures;
(b) develop and help implement a "Standard Financial Accounting
System" and general accounts classifications detailing balance
sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, etc., to-
gether with related policies, systems procedures, principles
of accounting recommended, follow up methods, and de-
finitions. The system should develop and provide for the
timely collection of accounts receivables and settlement
of accounts payables. It should also contain standard and
depreciation policy for fixed asset accounting;
(c) develop and help implement a system of "Financial Planning",
including the introduction of operational objectives and the
planned allocation of resources in the form of Operating
Expense Budgets and Capital Expenditures Budgets (Cash Flows)
which would be issued periodically as needed. The budgeting
system should be coordinated with the financial accounts in
order to reconcile budget variances with financial figures;
(d) develop and help implement policies and procedures, related
analytical techniques, and mechanical tools to ensure pro-
ject planning, formulation, justification, management, and
control of the above budgets, including analysis of budget
variances;



- 67 -                        ANNEX 8-2
Page 3
(e) help implement the use of related analytical techniques for
the recording, planning, control, and evaluation of the
"Operational Activities" of the company, including selling,
order processing, work preparations, production inventory
and material requirement, procurement, quality control,
transportation, distribution and shipping, personnel,
etc., and evaluate their financial implications;
(f) help implement "Internal Auditing Systems" through internal
audit procedures and built-in internal checks especially for
the handling and accounting of cash, payroll, purchasing,
inventories, etc.;
(g) recommend and help install an "Organizational Structure"
for the most efficient conduct of the administrative, account-
ing and finance functions within the context of the overall
organization structure, determine communications channels, and
write job descriptions for financial and accounting staff;
also review the organizational plans for other aspects (construction,
plant operations, and marketing) of the company prepared by other
groups; fill any gap in such plans and integrate them into an
overall corporate plan.
(h) determine the desirability of the use of the accounting machines
or electronic data processing equipment;
(i) design and help implement the use of "Standard Forms"
for recording and controlling all transactions; im-
plement systems of "Management Reporting", including
documentation procedures for the development of information
in a frequency and amount as may be needed for decision
making and corrective actions at different management
levels;
(J) prepare an "Accounting Manual" to assist supervisions in
ensuring the adequate accounting of all transactions, the
timely and accurate presentation of information, and the
training of staff. The accounting manual shall set forth a
coded chart of accounts detailing and describing balance sheet
accounts, income accounts, functional and departmental ac-
counts, cost/profit centers, objective accounts, policies,
standard procedure instructions, limits of authority, forms
and methods governing their use, report formats (including
an inventory of reports describing their purpose and method
of preparation, assigning responsibilities for preparation,
and seeking preparation dates, due dates, frequency and
distribution), use of capital and expense budget programs
(including guidelines distinguishing capital items and items
charged directly to expense), etc.
5.        The accounting consultants shall review financial and accounting
staffing requirements and responsibilities during project execution and
operations and shall:

(a) design a system for selecting of qualified financial
and accounting staff as needed;
(b) identify training requirements, arrange in-house or outside
training programs for financial and accounting staff, and
prepare training course material;
(c) design policies and procedures with reference to hiring,
performance, and progress reviews, promotions, discipline,
salaries, and position classification; and
(d) provide, as necessary, one or two staff members to assist
APC in the initial installation and implementation of
the system.
Schedule for Consultancy Services
6.        The accounting consultants shall prepare and submit the following
reports within the time limit indicated below:
(a) An Inception Report listing the proposals, plans, and
recommendations regarding the financial control and
accounting system, including any need for the intro-
duction and adaptation of electronic data processing equip-
ment or alternative accounting machines within three
months of contracting date.
(b) Progress Reports, at two months intervals, giving a state-
ment of all work performed during the reporting period.
