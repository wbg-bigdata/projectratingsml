MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF URUGUAY
FOR A HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Uruguay for the equivalent of US$15.6 million to help
finance a project aimed at rationalizing health sector spending through reductions in the
role of the public sector in the direct provision of health services. The proposed loan
would be at the Bank's standard interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including 5
years of grace.
2.    Background. A relatively small country in both area (177,000 square kilometers)
and population (3.1 million), Uruguay enjoyed a long period of relative prosperity and
political stability up to the early 1980s. However, during most of the 1980s the country
was afflicted by a severe debt crisis and a deep recession. By 1989, despite the initial
achievements of two Bank-supported structural adjustment loans and an IMF standby
program, GDP growth was again stagnant and the annual inflation rate approached 100
percent. When President Lacalle took office in 1990, he concentrated on restoring short-
term stability, furthering financial sector reforms, and reducing the size of the state.
Accomplishments on the latter have been modest, but prudent fiscal management coupled
with a highly favorable external environment have helped improve most macroeconomic
variables. Annual GDP growth, which averaged less than one percent between 1988 and
1990, increased to 7.4 percent in 1992, and is expected to have slowed to 1.5 percent
during 1994. The per capita GNP of US$3,910 (1993) remains among the highest in the
Region. While economic performance has been satisfactory, concerns about its
sustainability have surfaced following serious setbacks in public sector reform and public
enterprise restructuring (e.g., Congressional rejection of a social security reform
proposal, and the reversal by referendum of the telephone company's privatization).
3.    The welfare tradition and the presence of a strong, socially-oriented private sector
have resulted in almost universal coverage and some of the most favorable health indices
in Latin America. Over 90 percent of the population has access to health care from a
variety of public and private sources. The public sector covers about 40 percent of the
population and represents about 30 percent of sector spending. It comprises: the
Ministry of Public Health (MSP) covering the poor and uninsured (i.e., about one quarter
of the population); the Teaching Hospital, providing specialized services mainly to MSP
beneficiaries; and the Military and Police systems, offering family coverage to their
active and retired members. The network of non-profit, private medical cooperatives
(IAMCs), comprising 53 medical cooperatives, offers comprehensive quality services to
about half the population. IAMCs are financed through resource transfers from the
sickness insurance fund of the social security system (DISSE) and individual or other
group premiums. DISSE accounts for 15 percent of sector revenues and finances the
provision of services (through payroll deductions) of private sector employees, a portion
of the self-employed and informal sectors, and a segment of civil servants (i.e., about 18
percent of the population). Service provision is contracted out to IAMCs at preferential



rates negotiated by the Ministry of Economy (MEF). While relatively small, 35 partial
private insurance schemes (SPs) have grown substantially over the past five years.
Unlike the IAMCs, SPs are subject to little regulation. They typically offer two types of
coverage: high-end specialized services to high-income groups (e.g., emergency
services, high technology diagnoses), and minimum coverage to low-income populations
who cannot afford IAMC premiums but are reluctant to use public sector facilities.
4.    In the midst of difficulties in maintaining expenditures, the continuation and
expansion of health service provision, especially to the poor, remains a challenge. The
sector's viability is threatened by: (a) the upward pressure on costs driven by an aging
population (by the year 2000, one of every five Uruguayans will be over 60), an
oversupply of physicians (Uruguay has one of the highest concentrations of doctors in the
world), an increase in individuals' expectations as to the amount and quality of services,
and the unregulated growth of SPs; (b) the MSP's weakness in defining policy and
enforcing it through regulatory and financing mechanisms; and (c) the MSP's increasing
failure to efficiently deliver quality services to the poor and uninsured. Without action on
reform, the sector's medium-term outlook is one of escalating costs and equity erosion.
5.    Government Sectoral Policy. The Government's sectoral policy is defined in a
September 1993 document. The policy's main thrust is to rationalize sector spending by:
(a) reducing the role of the MSP in the direct provision of services through, primarily, a
gradual delegation of the MSP's service delivery responsibilities to the IAMCs;
(b) enhancing the capacity of the public sector to regulate and finance health activities;
(c) strengthening the sector's management capacity; and (d) improving the sector's ability
to set disease priorities, particularly for public health programs. To address the legal,
economic, financial and labor implications of this policy, and justify the delegation of
service delivery responsibilities to the IAMCs, the Government has completed a
comprehensive feasibility study. The study was reviewed during appraisal and establishes
the viability of the service delegation strategy. Prior to negotiations, the Government
submitted to the Bank a written legal opinion confirming the findings of the study.
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The ongoing dialogue with the Government
has resulted in a general agreement on the pending reform agenda, but the efforts of the
current administration have been thwarted by a lack of broad-based political support. In
these circumstances, the Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS), discussed by the
Board on January 25, 1994, has been to provide selective support to: (a) facilitating the
private sector's adjustment to competition; (b) improving human capital formation by
enhancing the efficiency and quality of health and education services; (c) addressing
critical environmental issues; and (d) assisting the modest efforts of public sector reform
through ongoing and projected technical assistance. In support of this strategy, the Bank
has recently approved two operations: the Irrigation and Natural Resources Management
Project (Ln. 3697), which will develop and implement a soil and water management
strategy, and the Basic Education Quality Improvement Project (Ln. 3729), which aims to
improve the primary education system. Concurrently with the processing of the proposed
project, a Health Sector Strategy Report has been prepared; a first draft was finalized in
January 1995. The findings of the study support the objectives of the proposed project
and underscore the need to strengthen the regulatory framework and delegate the MSP's



- 3 -
service delivery responsibilities to the LAMCs. In these respects, the proposed project
complements the objectives of other Bank-financed projects and is fully consistent with
the CAS discussed by the Board on January 25, 1994.
7.    Project Objectives. The proposed project addresses the Government's sectoral
policy goal of rationalizing health sector spending. Given the complexity inherent in
health sector reforms and the existing institutional constraints, the proposed project
focuses on a limited set of key and attainable objectives to lay the foundation for
incremental and sustainable improvements. Its aims are twofold: (a) improve the
efficiency and quality of services provided to the poor and uninsured by reducing the
MSP's role in the direct provision of health services; and (b) establish the framework for
the development of health sector institutions. To realize these aims and build a solid
foundation for the health sector, the proposed project focuses on three facilitating aspects
of reform: (a) facilitating the delegation of MSP service delivery functions to the private
sector--Component I; (b) developing the sector's regulatory and accreditation functions
and selectively strengthening information systems and human resources--Component II;
and (c) setting sector disease priorities through global-burden-of-disease and cost-
effectiveness analyses--Component III.
8.    Project Description. The project consists of three components: (a) Delegation of
MSP's Service Delivery Responsibilities; (b) Institutional Development; and
(c) Establishment of Sector Disease Priorities.
(a)    Component I: The Delegation of MSP's Service Delivery
Responsibilities component (18 percent of total project costs) will establish
the basis for the gradual reduction of the MSP's role in service provision.
To this end, the project will define, analyze and implement, on a pilot
basis, alternatives for contracting the provision of MSP services to eligible
entities, principally to the IAMCs (other alternatives include the
decentralization to local government and the establishment of public
hospitals as independent trusts). The project will: (a) carry out a review
of international experience on the decentralization and delegation of health
services; (b) establish and analyze different alternatives for contracting the
provision of MSP health services with eligible entities, including the design
of (i) an operational framework for each alternative and (ii) mechanisms
for the payment of health services to be provided by the eligible entities;
and (c) carry out a pilot program in about four of the country's nineteen
departments that will involve (i) selecting the eligible departments and
entities to which the provision of services will be delegated; (ii) drafting
the legal contractual agreements for each of the altematives defined in (b)
above; (iii) contracting (delegation agreement) the provision of health
services with eligible entities in the pilot departments; (iv) strengthening
the capacity of eligible entities through technical assistance, training and
medical equipment by signing an agreement (assistance agreement) between
the MSP and the eligible entity; and (v) designing and implementing an
evaluation system to assess the viability and impact of the delegation of



- 4 -
service provision. The proposed project will finance technical assistance
and studies, training, workshops and seminars, and medical equipment.
(b)   Component II: The Institutional Development component (61 percent of
total project costs) will support the institutional strengthening of the sector
and will improve management practices, primarily to support the gradual
reduction of the MSP's role in service provision. More specifically, this
component will: (a) review and improve, if needed, the sector's regulatory
framework to facilitate the delegation of service provision and the
institutional reorganization of the sector, with emphasis on linking sector
financing to sector priorities and quality standards; (b) design and
implement the sector's management information system (MIS); and
(c) strengthen the technical and management capacity of sector
professionals through a limited number of scholarships.
(c)    Component IH: The Establishment of Sector Disease Priorities
component (21 percent of total project costs) will support the adjustment of
the health service delivery model to the country's demographic and
epidemiological profile. Resource allocation within the sector, particularly
for public health interventions, will be rationalized on the basis of global
burden of disease and cost-effectiveness analyses. To this end, the project
will carry out, inter alia: (a) a review of intemational experience in
disease priority-setting; (b) a nationwide disease priority-setting analysis;
(c) the strengthening of selected priority programs (e.g., cardiovascular
diseases, AIDS/STDs) through the financing of equipment and supplies,
technical assistance and media campaigns; (d) an evaluation to assess the
impact of rationalizing sector disease priorities; and (e) designing
nationwide quality assessment and accreditation standards.
9.    Based on the findings and lessons learned from the project, the Government will
elaborate a comprehensive health sector strategy to further the reform process and guide
policy in the five years following project completion. Expected outcomes of the proposed
project were agreed during negotiations and include, inter alia: (a) the delegation of
services for, at a minimum, 35,000 MSP beneficiaries; (b) a decrease of at least 15
percent in the average cost per beneficiary following the delegation of services; and
(c) the development of national public health campaigns linked to the five most cost-
effective health interventions.
10.   Project Cost and Financing. The project will be carried out over five years.
The total project cost is estimated at US$28 million equivalent, including taxes (US$5.1
million equivalent) and physical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$17.1 million, or 61 percent of the total project cost. The
proposed loan of US$15.6 million equivalent will finance 55.7 percent of the total project
cost. It will cover US$12.8 million equivalent or 75 percent of foreign exchange
expenditures, and US$2.8 million equivalent or 16 percent of estimated local
expenditures. The Government will finance US$12.4 million or 44.3 percent of the total
project cost. During negotiations, it was agreed that the Government's counterpart



funding requirements will be (in US dollar equivalents): US$1.6 million, US$2.5
million, US$3.5 million, US$2.4 million, and US$2.4 million, respectively, for the five
years of implementation. Prior to negotiations, the Government submitted to the Bank a
letter from the MEF stating that: (a) the MSP will receive a cash advance equivalent to
about two months of projected counterpart expenditures to initiate project execution;
(b) the MEF will make available the remaining balance for the first year of
implementation in treasury notes earmarked to the MSP for project execution; and (c) a
cash balance of no less than US$100,000 equivalent will be maintained in the project
account at all times.
11.   Project preparation was financed with two advances from the Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) totalling US$900,000, dated April 1, 1993 and May 9, 1994. To facilitate
timely project implementation the Government will establish, maintain and operate, under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, a Special Account in the Central Bank of
Uruguay or a commercial bank. The Special Account will be denominated in US dollars
and will be established with an initial deposit of US$800,000, equivalent to the average
four-month project financing requirement.
12.   Project Implementation. The MSP will be responsible for project
implementation. A Presidential Decree of December 1993 created a project
implementation unit under the MSP, i.e., Unidad Coordinadora del Proyecto de
Fortalecimiento Institucional del Sector Salud (FISS). FISS prepared the project and will
be responsible for its implementation. Its mandate includes: (a) carrying out the
project's technical and administrative functions; (b) coordinating with all relevant units of
the MSP and other public and private agencies; (c) monitoring and evaluating project
activities; and (d) reporting to the Bank. FISS will work closely with MSP staff, and
will initially consist of about 10 higher-level and eight support-level staff organized
around four management units headed by a general project coordinator. During
preparation FISS produced a number of documents to guide project implementation,
including administrative manuals, cost tables, implementation timetables, draft terms of
reference for all studies and technical assistance, eligibility criteria for the selection of
departments and entities to which service provision will be delegated, and critical actions
to monitor implementation. Each of these documents was reviewed during appraisal and
was incorporated into an implementation manual. During negotiations, the Government
and the Bank agreed on a critical set of actions (Implementation Program) to be
completed during implementation. The Government and the Bank will hold Annual and
Mid-Term Reviews to assess, inter alia, overall implementation progress, compliance
with legal covenants, and the adequacy of available and programmed financing. Annual
audits will be carried out by the Court of Accounts of the Republic (Tribunal de Cuentas
de la Reputblica) or by a private firm of independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and
will be submitted to the Bank no later that six months following the end of the
Government's fiscal year. The project completion date will be December 31, 1999 and
the project closing date June 30, 2000.
13.   Project Sustainability. The proposed project will entail minimal incremental
recurrent costs. Administrative costs related to the management of FISS (e.g., secretarial
support, rent and utilities, and maintenance of office equipment and office supplies)



- 6 -
represent only about four percent of total project costs and will be funded by the
Government. Personnel costs are not recurrent since FISS will be constituted by
consultants under short- or medium-term contracts, and FISS is expected to be dismantled
at the end of implementation. The proposed project enjoys broad political support within
both the outgoing and the incoming Administrations. Most importantly, the proposed
operation has received the endorsement of prominent interest groups, such as the
Uruguayan Medical Association and a number of private sector institutions. While
project sustainability is not related to the Government's ability to find "fiscal space" for
the project, it is heavily dependent on the political will and the technical ability to
incorporate the project's recommendations and lessons learned from the pilot experiences
into broader reform efforts. The political will was confirmed during appraisal when the
project received explicit support from representatives of the two main political parties.
The incoming Administration has confirmed its commitment to the objectives and design
of the proposed project.
14.   Bank Experience and Lessons Learned. The project design builds on the
experience of relevant operations financed by the Bank Group over the past decade.
Lessons learned from these projects indicate that successful implementation is closely
associated with: (a) linking the definition of project objectives and scope to a clear policy
framework; (b) obtaining strong and pervasive government commitment; (c) designing
simple projects with focused and modest objectives; and (d) linking the financing of
critical investments to the implementation of policy and/or institutional reform. These
lessons have been incorporated into the project.
15.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that: (a) an
evaluation of the pilot program will be completed no later than December 31, 1997; (b) a
draft health sector strategy will be prepared no later than January 31, 1998, and finalized
no later than March 31, 1999; (c) annual amounts of counterpart funding will be made
available for each of the five years of project implementation, and a cash balance of no
less than US$100,000 will be maintained in the project account at all times; (d) the
Government will carry out the project in accordance with the Implementation Manual and
within the parameters of the Implementation Program; (e) the Government, through FISS,
will submit to the Bank quarterly progress reports no later than 30 days after the end of
every quarter of each calendar year, and the last quarterly report of each calendar year
will include an assessment of overall implementation progress over the past year; (f) the
Govemment, through FISS, will submit to the Bank a detailed work program plan for the
following year not later than December 1 of each year; (g) annual implementation
reviews should take place not later than March 31 of each year; and (h) a mid-term
review should take place no later than March 31, 1998. Conditions of loan
effectiveness are that: (a) the MEF deposit in the project account an amount not less
than US$175,000 equivalent and designate treasury notes with a face value equivalent to
the remaining balance of the counterpart funding requirements of the first year of
implementation; (b) FISS is fully staffed and its head has been appointed; and (c) the
Implementation Manual has been approved by the MSP. Conditions of disbursement
under the Delegation of MSP's Service Delivery Responsibilities component include:
(a) for the implementation of the pilot program, the review and improvement, if needed,
of the sector's regulatory framework to be carried out under the Institutional



- 7 -
Development component; and (b) for the strengthening of the capacity of eligible entities,
the signing of delegation and assistance agreements between the MSP and the eligible
entity and the requirement mentioned in (a) herein.
16.   Poverty Category. Given the relatively high income per capita and equitable
income distribution, the incidence of poverty in Uruguay is slight. However, continuing
to provide services to the poor amidst fiscal pressures remains an important challenge.
Given the difficulties in increasing expenditures, efforts will need to focus on more
efficient targeting of services. This project will specifically target poverty by helping to
increase the quality of government health services, which are primarily used by the poor.
17.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed project does not present environmental
risks. It has an environmental rating of "C".
18.   Program Objective Categories. Within the broad category of human resource
development, the project's objectives are to promote more effective health policies and to
reduce poverty.
19.   Participatory Approach. Project preparation encouraged the participation of
three major stakeholders (i.e., the MSAS, the IAMCs and the Uruguayan Medical
Association), and their views were incorporated into project design . Implementation,
particularly of the Delegation of MSP's Service Delivery Responsibilities component, will
involve the active participation of the IAMCs.
20.   Expected Benefits. The main benefit of the proposed project will be to help
Government set a methodological and institutional foundation to rationalize health sector
spending. By defining operational alternatives for reduction of the MSP's role in the
direct provision of services and testing the contracting of services on a pilot basis, the
project will provide a solid empirical base for a broad reform of the sector aimed at
reducing inefficiencies and improving equity. The project will enhance the Govemment's
ability to better link priorities and quality to financing by means of strengthening its
financing and regulatory capacity. By improving management information systems, the
proposed operation will enhance the information base for decision-making. The project
will help improve the human resource base in the sector through scholarships in key
deficient areas. Finally, by building mechanisms for setting epidemiological priorities
(i.e., global burden of disease and cost-effectiveness), the project will help establish a
sounder, more rational basis for health interventions.
21.   Risks and Safeguards. The two principal risks of the proposed project are:
(a) a lack of future political commitment to reform in the health sector; and (b) project
implementation demands outstripping the MSP's managerial capacity. Political
commitment is particularly important in the case of Uruguay, where serious efforts to
advance reform have been thwarted by a lack of political and public support. This risk
will be minimized by: (i) the attention given during preparation to ensure the support of
the key stakeholders in the health sector; and (ii) a project design which is not overly
ambitious, and allows for gradually building the capacity and knowledge base for
reforms. With regard to the project's demands outstripping the MSP's managerial



- 8 -
capacity, this risk should be minimized by: (i) a full-time project unit that has
successfully managed preparation and is familiar with Bank Guidelines following its
administration of two advances from the PPF; (ii) a conservative implementation
timetable; and (iii) annual and mid-term project reviews to assess implementation
progress and adjust the pace and scope of implementation as needed.
22.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
