VIDELE/BALARIA ENHANCED OI REC"VERY PROJECT-
(LOAN 2148-RO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This report reviews the results of axi enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
project, partly financed by Loan 2148-RO.  The loan, made to the Banca de
Investitii (IB) with the guarantee of the Socialist Republic of Romania, for
the equivalent of US$101.5 million (including the capitalized front end fee of
US$1.5 million) was approved on May 20, 1982. It was fully disbursed in
December 1984, about 18 months ahead of the appraisal forecast. The proceeds
of the loan financed tubulars (casing, tubing, linepipe), drilling and
production materials and equipment for drilling over 900 wells, installation
of surface production and in situ combustion facilities. The project was
physically completed with a two-year delay, mainly in the installation of
compressor stations in Videle, caused by three successive severe winter
seasons, together with an-excessively long compressor delivery schedule.- The
reservoir performance in Balaria indicates higher oil recovery than originally
expected. The initial results in the other reservoirs are also encouraging.
The target incremental production of 731,000 tons/year is expected to be
achieved by 1989, approximately 3 years behind the appraisal estimate. This
project completion report was prepared by the former Energy Department and
subsequently reviewed by EM4IE, and was based on the information obtained
during completion mission and from the Appraisal, President's and Supervision
reports, as well as other documents from the project files. -The borrower
submitted a final completion report containing its views on the project
implementation and supplied additional data for this report. The PCR has been
submitted to the Borrower, whose response (Annex 16) did not contain any
objections or critical remarks to the PCR.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.

VIDELEIBALARIA ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT
(LOAN 2148-RO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.      -The-loa under.review,-.in--the-amount-of US$101.5 million, -was to -help
finance the 1982-86 slice of the Videle/Balaria in situ combustion enhanced
oil recovery (EOR) program.  The Investment Bank (IB), was the iorrower, and
Bolintin Petroleum Trust (TPB), a state enterprise, was the beneficiary and
the implementing agency.
2.      "he main objective of the project was to stop and reverse the sharply
declining production from the Videle ant' Balaria oil fields by applying the in
situ combustion process. It was predicted (para 2.04 of this report) that
this measure would increase the ultimate oil recovery from these two fields
from 15% to 39S of the owl initially in place and that the annual incremental
production due to the ECR process would reach 731,000 tons (4.9 million
barrels) by 1986 and continue at this.level over the 20-year life of the
project. The incremental production goal is now expected to be reached in
1989 (three years later than planned during project e.ppraisal) because of the
long v-elivery schedule of the 110 compressors required for supplying air to
support the combustion front, and also construction delays caused by the
unprecedented severe winters during the project implementation period.
Nevertheless, production and reservoir data observed so far give positive
indications that, except for the three-year delay, the produ4tion objective
will be met and that the 39X ultimate recovery goal will not only be met but,
may even be exceeded (para 4.03).
3.       The project facilities were comple;ed more than two years later than
planned during project appraisal at a cost of Lei 5.8 billion, approximately
12t less than the appraisal estimate (Lei 6.62 billion). The difference is
mainly attributed to the lower than estimated Cost of the air compressors and
other equipment and materials (para 3.06).
4.       The economic reevaluation (para 7.01) projects that the economic rate
of return (ERR) from the project will be 13X which is satisfactory but
substantially short of the 292 expected at appraisal. The lower ERR is
largely due to the sharp drop in actual and projected future international oil
prices along with the three-year delay in benefits and increased production
costs (mostly offset by the lowez project cost). TPB met the financial
objectives under the project and is expected to maintain a satisfactory
finan4ial performance given the Government's commitment to increase crude oil
prices from time to time to reflect the rising oil production costs which will
accompany the increased use of expensive EOR production techniques (paras.-
5.02-5.03).



5.@     -TPB is a mature and competent institution. and the various
specialized-support organizations it has acces to provide it.with a self-
reliance hich -is not paral-leled- in many developing countvrie.  However, the
project has shown that TPB, as well as the petroleum sector as a whole, could
benefit from relaxing the almost total reliance on Romanian equipment and
technology (para 6.03). The practice is understandable in light of the
country's severe foreign exchange constraints, but this self-reliance must be
weighed against the increasing laj in technology and efficiency which will
follow if it is continued.
6.       Experience in carrying out the project has highlighted the following
lessons (para 9.06):      -
(a)   The EOR process, based on in situ" combiidtion  is a -highly
effective and efficient method for recovering large oil
reserves which would otherwise have to be abandoned in the
reservoir; however, the reservoir must possess the appropriate
geological qualifications, and careful study and analysis of
the ERR surface and sub-surface parameters along with costs and
benefits are required for a successful EOR ooeration.
(b)   In preparing an in situ coTbustion project, the design and
optimization of the surface facilities, especially the air
supply system, should receive the same detailed attention as is
given to the reservoir aspects.
(c)   In selecting items to be financed from its loans, the Bank
should focus on critical items which can promote procurement
efficiency and lead to improved project design and operations.

VI-LM./9LASXA -MMICED OIL RECOVY PROJEC?
(LOAN 2148-RO)
PROJECT COMPLEION REPORT
I   INTRODUCTION
1.01     Oil production iv Romnis dates back to the nineteenth century when
it-ves-one-of-the-important oil-producing ceaters ia-^the--e w .- loveuvert the
mjor oil fields have long since passed their peak primary production years.
Despite the widespread application of secondary recovery techniques of water
and gas injection, production beasn to fall sharply from 1976 ;a, *t- =- -4
million tons in 1976 to 11.5 million tons in 1980. The year 1976 vwas also.
when Rotania became a net oil importer for the first time; by 1980, the cost
of these imports had i creased to almost US$ 2 billion per year. The 1981-
1985 five-Year Plan focused on arresting the oil production decline by finding
and developing new oil reserves and by increasing the production from existing
oil fields so as to stabilize future oil production at about 13 million tons
per year.
1.02    The Plan allocated about a billion dollars to develop increased
production from existing reservoirs, about half that amount to finance conven-
tional secondqiiy recovery and the other half to finance tertiary enhAnced oil
recovery (EOR±I) projects.  Extensive laboratory and field tests had
identified some 41 possible LOR projects, 18 of which were sufficiently
prepared to be included in the plan. These projects incorporated the
generally applied tertiary recovery techniquess thermal including steam
injection and in situ combustion, carbon dioxide injection and polymer
mieellar solution injection. The VidelelBalaria 3OR project, the most
important and largest of the 18, was based oan the in situ combustion process.
1.03     Essentially, the project covered the 1982-1986 portioe of the long
term MR program for the Videle and galaria reservoirs and was expected to
increase ultimate recovery from 152 to 391 of the oil initially in-pLace.
This increase would be equivalent to roughly 102 of the country's net oil
imports or about a US$ 0.2 billion foreign exchange saving per year based on
crude oil prices prevailing in 1981. major components of the project
included:  (i) well,drilling and the facilities necessary to recover, process,
store and transport the oil produced at the two fields; (ii) air injection
fac.lities; (iii) utilities; and (iv) civil works, engineering and technical
services.

..1.04    Tma borrowee  .as the Investment Danxk (IS), the speciialized agency~,
under-the Kinistry-of-?inance for dealing with-investment projects in all'
sectors of the economy except Agriculture and food -processingi The Bolintin-
Petroleum Trust (ZTUS) was the beneficiary of the Bank loan and the
implementing agency of the project.  Tfl, a juridical entity under Romanian
law, is responsible for oil development and extraction in the southwestern
plart of Romania. Its responksibdiiies end activities are exacuaed through a
hitadquarters staff., which takes care of technical, financial and .oordination
matters, and seven semi autonomous operating divisions known ais eonterprises:
Mi four engaged in crude oil production in geographically divided areas; (ii)
one in drilling; MOii one in maintenance end manufacture of oilfield
equipment; and (iv) one in construction and erection services.
1.05     The project was estimated to cost US$ 454.1 millioa. 282 of w.hich was
to be covered by the, Dank loan of US$ 101.5 million.  The balance of the
project was to be financed by TPB from internally generated funds and from
budgetary Allocations by the Government. This report is based on the
completion report prepared by the Investment Bank and the Bolintin Petroleum
Trust and the findings of a mission which visited Romania in June 1987.
II. PROJECT PROPAIIATIOR AND APPRAISAL
2.01     In 19601, a Bank petroleum mission visited Rtomania to review the
Government's investment program for increasing the country's crude oil
production. The mission found that new oil discoveries could not be counted
on to be a major contributor to production in the cear or medium term.- 
However, enhanced oil recovery (OE010from existing fields held the promise of
stabilixing production from these fields17t a substantial level over the next
20 years or more. from the OEM projectsz. mder preparation at the time, the
Bank mission selected the Videle/Dalaria project as the best suited for Bank
participation as it was both the largest in terms of potential incremental oil
production and the most advanced in terms of project preparation. The in situ
combustion process was seletted in lieu of steam injection '~the other LOU
process which was deemed to be suitable for the Videle and Balaria reservoirs)
because of the greater ultimate oil recovery potential, better fuel economy
and the fact that the ezisting production and injection waLls could be used-
with the in situ combustion process but not with the steam injection system.
2.02     Project preparation proceeded expeditiously.  The Instit%;e of
Research and Industrial Design for Oil and Gas Production (ICPPC)I' designed
th4 ROE Tocess on the basis of extensive laboratory tests, studies and pilot
operations which had already been carried outo  Bank consultants and a Bank
engineering panel reviewed the SO& design and offered several beneficial

_3_
reeoCsendaCions which were subsequently incorporated-into thewproject.  The
project was appraised during September/October 1981.-
2.03     Looking at the project-preparation process retrvspectively, some
flaws can be seen in the Bank's and TPB's performance in this activity. The
project preparation effort concentrated almost entirely on the technical
aspects of the EOR program, while three other important elements of the
project preparation process were not given the close attention they should
have received.-
(a) Mechanical design of the surface facilities:  At appraisal,
ICPPC had already prepared preliminary ngineering for these
-facilities based on past practices and experience at TPDS'
ongoing EOR operations.  The large number of small compressors
suggists that a better air supply system could have been
developed. Novever, there is no way to confirm this conclusion
since no thorough project optimization study was undertaken
(para. 8.04).
(b) Project Planning and implementation: Considering the history of
project implementation delays in other sectors, a special effort
was made to ensure expeditious project implementation. Never-
theless, the project completion goals could not be achieved; in
fact, the incremeptal crude oil production target was missed by
three years. Any improvement ia this area will require a
greater effort, especially in identifying and correcting the
institutional constraints responsible (para. 6.03).
(c)  Use of the Bank loan:  It now appears that the Bank loan should
have financed the air compressors instead of the standard
drilling equipment and materials. This requirements would have
provided an opportunity to compare the merits of the compressors
available on the international market with those manufactured in
Romania and may possibly have resulted in a superior air supply
system (para'. 8.05).                -
Considering the financial and institutional constraints at the time, it is
unlikely that any Sank initiative toward improving the shortcomings noted
above would have been very successful. Lowever, any future lending operation
in the sector should address the issue of correcting che project preparation
and implementation deficiencies brought to light by the project.
2.04     The project was expected to increase the ultimate recovery of oil
from the two oil field from about 15S (without the project) to 391 of the oil
initially in place in the reservoirs. This was expected to result in an
annual increm ntal production at full development (then expected in 1986) of
731,000 tons per year, equivalent to roughly 10 of the country's net oil
imports and saving some $0.2 billion per year in foreign exchange. The
project covered the 1982-86 portion of a long term E08 program for the Videle
antd Salaria oil fields and comprised the following:

III. IWPLENMTrATION
Start-Up
3.01     Project implementation got underway -on schedule witiout undue
problems except that initial delays in procuring Banh-finauced materials,
establishing a site organization and drilling rig mobilization slowed drilling
during the first year (295 wells scheduled vs. 34 actually drilled). There
was no permanent adverse impact from this delay as drilling progressed at an
accelerated rate in the following years. In fact, by end-1986, 1,220 wells
had been completed compared to the 909 originally anticipated. The larger
number of wells was a result of operating experience gained as the project
progressed; it was found that a closer spaced well configuration vas necessary
for optimum recovery efficiency along with more in-fill drilling to realize
earlier production gains. There were no revisions to the original project
scope other than the increased number of wells.
Impleeatation Schedule
3.02  : Annex 3 shows graphically the original scheduling of the major
project activities and the actual accomplishments.  It can be seen that the
compressor plants, the heart of the in situ combustion process, missed the
mid-1984 completion target by a wide margin, in fact almost 3.5 years based on
the current October 1987 completion target for the last of the five compressor
plants. The project schedule allowed only about two years to procure, deliver
and construct the five compressor plants.. To complete in the time allocated
an air compressor s teom of the size required for the project would have
't -



-                   s~~-5
required an all-out- construction effort and about a one-year deLivery period
fcr a system based on -hih capacity compressor trains (not of Romanian
manufact^ire).  Actually, no such effort vas made.  The compressors (110 or 22
per compressor plant) were purchased from a Romanian manufacturer with a
staggered delivery time ranging from early 1983 to September 1986. In
addition to the prolonged compressor delivery schedule, further delays were
encountered during the construction phase. The unusually severe winters
during the construction period accounted for moat of these delays, but labor
shortages was also.a factor, although to a lesser degree,A-Ancillary y
facilities experienced similar delays as the compressor plants, but they were
completed by the time they were actually required.
- 3.03     The EOR program had-an air-injection target of 8.t million cubic
meters per day by end-1986 but, because of the compressor delays, only a
5.0 million cubic meters capacity (S71) was installEd by that date. The
reduced air injection capacity caused a substantial decrease in the incremen-
tal oil recovery, from a rate of 731,000 tons per year expected to 101,000
tons per year actually produced. It is now expected that the full 731,000 ton
rate will be achieved in 1989, three years later than the original target.
Reportin8
3.04     TPB and IS met all the reporting requirements; both submitted, on a
regular basis, the progress reports agreed with the Bank.
Procurement
3.05     The borrower procured oil field tubulars (valued at US$60.3 million)
and production equipment (valued at US$39.1 million) totalling US$100 million
out of the Bank's funds following the Bank's international competitive bidding
guidelines. Nine bid lots, approved by the Bank, were internationally
advertised in June 1982. Fifty-one firms procured bid documents and 24
foreign participants competed in the bidding. However, all nine bid Lots were
won by Romanian companies whiclh were the lowest evaluated bidders, probably
because there was an overall shortage of these types of goods in the world at
that time, and international suppliers quoted high and not firm prices and
long deliveries. TPD did not find it necessary to avail itself of the
domestic preference option available to it under the Loan Agrement. The Bank
and the borrower had no disagreement over any procurement matters.
Project Costs

The SAk cost represents the project cost to the Government which adjusted the
cost of the indirect import contents (e.g., petroleum products, iron ore,
coking coal, special steels, sub-assemblies, ete.) of locally purchased equip-
ment and materials to import prices or international levels as opposed to the
Government-set domestic catalog prices which were reflected in the financial
..cost to.TPB. From 1981-86, the government raised catalog prices three times
with the view to eliminate any hidden subsidies to State enterprises; cstalog
prices are currently the sam  as the Government costs. As indicated in the
comparison table, the actual project cost of 5.8 billion Lei underran the 6.62
billion Lei estimated UR cost by 0.82 billion Lei, or 122 of the estimated
cost.  The estimated financial cost to SPB at the time of appraisal was 5.89
billion Lei based on 1981 catalog prices.
3.07     The cost variance analysis in Annex I shows that there were
substantial underruns in the cost of three project components (land
development and roads, well completions and hook-ups, and compressed air
supply) which more than made up for both the over-expenditures in the other
three project components. As a general conclusion, the cost underrun can
probably be attributed to the sizeable physical and price contingencies
included in the estimate. Three of the more signif£cant variances can be
explained by the fact thar:
(a)  Well costs were higher because of the increased number of wells;
(b)  Engineering and supervision costs were underestimatedt based On
Romanian standards, they were estimated at onLy 4Z of the
project cost whereas one would expect them to be at least 102 on



the basis of international experience (and actually turned out
to be 12.6Z in this case); and
(c) Compressor costs in the estimate were based on more expensive
foreign supply.
Disbursements and Financial Sources
3.08     Except for the US$101.5 million Bank loan, all other funds'were
raised by TPB through internal cash generation ana budget allocations from the
State. The Government tnd IB confirmed during negotiations their intention to
seek co-financing for the project as soon as foreign capital market conditions
and Romania's external borrowing program allowed. However, because capital
market conditions did not improve and Romania's creditworthiness continued to
be a concern along vith the Government's policy of not incurring new foreign
debt, no action was taken on co-financing arrangements.
3.09     The comparison of appraisal versus actual disbursement is given in
Annex 7. Actual disbursement was one and half years ahead of the appraisal
estimate due to expeditious procurement by the borrower and faster than
expected deliveries of the Bank financed items. After the conclusion of these
contracts, the borrower requested, and the Bank agreed in November 1983 to the
reallocation of the loan amounts under various categories shown in the
following table:

$101.5                $101.5
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.10     The borrower appointed ICPPC, the designated organization in Romania
for all research, design and engineering activities for oil and gas, as the
consultants for the basic design, reservoir engineering and project
monitoring. With extensive experience of EOR techniques, the consultant's
team of experts performed their assignments satisfactorily. They closely
monitored reservoir behaviour and made modifications in the drilling and
production plans (e.g., drilling 1,220 wells instead of 909 wells as planned)
to assist in arresting the production decline during the early phase of the
EO program and to improve the overall EOR efficiency in Balaria and VideLe
fields. ICPPC satisfactorily monitored reservoir performance as influenced by



the M0R process t Bsalaria and Videle. The Institute is well qualified for
this type of assignment, particularly when in situ combustioa is involved.
3.11     Drilling and construction of surface facilities were provided by the
state enterprises responsible for these services in accordance with the system
prevailing in Romania. These entities were well qualified to carry out the
tasks assigned to them, and they performed them satisfactorily. As already
noted, the construction delays encountered during project implementation were
largely due to the exceptionally severi winters during this period, and labor
shortages were also reported to have U,&b a problem. However, the major cause
of the extended implementation period was the long compressor deliveries. The
supplier of the compressors (a Romanian manufacturer) cannot be held
completely accountable for the delivery schedule since the company apparently
had other priority commitments to fulfill and, in fact, did es #ntially meet
the contract delivery dates except for one compressor station.' There were
no problems or difficulties of any substance with the supply of the other
equipment and materials required for the project.
Environmental Impact
3.12     The Videle/Salaria fields are located in the densely populated
agricultural area of the country, and, thus, the environmental impact of the-
in situ combustion project with carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as efflu^
ents is particularly significant. As agreed with the Bank during appraisal,
the borrower took the required measures for the protection of the environment
against pollution by crude oil, chemically treated water, and combustion
products in oil/gas separation centers. A monitoring system, including
setting up of special laboratories, was installed to de'termine average concen-
tration of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide on a regular basis. Particular
attention was paid to installing facilities to protect against fire and toxis
combustion products, and to coordinate with the Institute of Hygiene and
Ssfety to solve any problems that might be encountered. These arrangements
ajvear to be satisfactory.
IV. OPERATINC PERFORMANCE
Overall Assessment
4.01     The appraisal anticipations were that the field-wide in situ
combustion program in the Balaria "a+b," Videle (East) "a*b," Videle (West)
"a+b' and Videle "c" reservoirs would lead to a peak incremental production of
731,000 tons in 1986 which would then be maintained over the next 20 years.
The current estimate, however, is that full incremental production now stands
to be achieved and maintained only in 1989. The comparison between past and
expected performance against the appraisal forecasts is as follows:
1/    Two stations were delivered early by two months; two stations were
delivered Late by one month; and one station was late by six months.

4.02     The difference between the SAR forecast and the actual and projected
production rates noted above is directly related to the air supply which,
along with the critical reservoir parameters, governs the performance of an in
situ combustion operation. The prolonged air compressor deliveries and
installation delayi (paras. 3.02 and 3.02) resulted in a corresponding delay
in achieving the incremental production targets.



- 10 -
4.03     The question arises as to how reliable are the projected reservoir
performances and whether the projected incremental production of 731,000 tons
per year can ind6ed be achieved by 1989. At 8elaria, nearly peak production
has already been realized.  At Videle East "aub," a daily production of 210
tons of which 190 tons are incremental (902 of total production) has been
attained. At this location, 83 wells on pxoduction have so far been
influenced by the combustion front. At Videle West "c," all of the 80 tons
per day of production at present are incremental, the combustion front having
influen.ed 33 production wells so for. Civen these data and various other
performance details and parameters of the reservoirs, as well as the future
program for air and water injection, it is reasonable to expect that the
production targets will be achieved by 1989. In situ combustion on a field
wide scale has proved to be a success in Balarias. It has been demonstrated
that the ultimate oil recovery from Balaria-will exceed the 392 of the oil
initially in place conservatively assessed at appraisal; an average recovery
of 42Z is now expected. Therefore, with the similar or better reservoir
characteristics existing at Videle, it should be possible to at least meet or
even exceed the 39Z recovery target.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     At the time of appraisal in late 1981, TPs fJinancial performance
had deteriorated from an operating profit (or benefit1l) breakeven situation
in 1978 to progressively larger operating losses in 1979 and 1980. The
Government had recognized this problem and had adopted a policy, as part of
the 1981-1985 Five-Year Plan, that the petroleum industry would earn during
the Plan period a five-year average benefit (i.e., profits before interest
expense) equivalent to at least 7.5Z of the costs of oil extraction. On the
other hand, the service or non-petroleum activities of the petroleum trusts,
which mainly comprise sundry services for employees, were expected to cover
just about 95Z of their correspotding costs reflecting additional employee
benefits. Thus, the overall bene5fit or o*;rating prufit rate during 1981-1985
of the individual petroleum trusts, such as TPB, was expected during appraisal
to be somewhat lower - roughly ranging from 41 to 62 of total revenues.
While this policy on petroleum production profits was a major step in the
right direction, it remined to be demonstrated at the time of appraisal
whether the Covernment would in fact increase prices sufficiently and in a
timely manner given the experience during the 1978-1980 period when prices
were not adjusted sufficiently to reflect increases in costs. The Bank's
financial appraisal of the project and of TPB further indicated that because
most of its oil fields have been in production for over 20 years and have
passed their peak productive years, TPB's oil produ.-ion costs would
continuously increase as it resorts to more capital and energy intensive
secondary and tertiary oil recovery techniques. The investments required for
these more capital intensive drilling, as well as enhanced recovery techni-
ques, would also be very substantial. Thus, in the context of the project, it
_I    The Romanian financial system uses the concept of 'benefits," which
corresponds to operating profit before interest expenses, as a measure
of profitability. Since 1979, a value-added tax repLaced the profit
t4x but the petroleum industry was exempted from this charge.



- II -
was agreed to set minimum financial performance objectives for TP8. These
were.  (a) that TPB would earn reasonable annual benefits (i.e., profits
before interest) equivalent to at least ?.5t of oil production costs; and (b)
that TPB would finance a substantial portion (i.e., at least 301) of its
annual investment program from internally generated cash after provisions for
debt service and benefit distributions. For TP8 to comply with these under-
takings, it was forecasted that the Covernment would have to progressively
raise the price TPB received for its oil by a total of about 601 (in current
terms) between 1981 (Lei 483/ton) and 1986 (Lei 776/ton) and another 92 in
1987 (Lei 847/ton).
5.02     TPS has complied with all the financial covenants, including the
submission of audited accounts and other reports. In particular, TP8 exceeded
the minimum financial objectives during the period 1982-1986. During this
period, the actual benefits averaged 10.31 of the cost of petroleum opera-
tions, compared with the minimum of 7.52 assumed in the SAI.  Likewise, the
actual self-financing rates averaged 411 of the investments, compared to the
381 estimated in the SAR and a minimum ratio of 301 agreed during negotia-
tions. This satisfactory financial performance is mainly due to three
factors: (a) the Covernment increased the price received by TPh for crude oil
by a total of about 682 between 1981 and 19866 on average the price increases
were about S higher than the SM forecasts; (b) the service or non-petroleum
activities of TPm earned benefits (i.e., profits) averaging 61 of the
corresponding costs compared to the SAR assumption that revenues from such
activities would, as mentioned earlier, incur a S loss (i.e., only cover
about 952 of the costs) reflecting additional employee benefitst and (c) TPB
produced about 61 more crude oil than estimated during appraisal because
higher production from other oil fields made up for the lower production from
the Videle and Salaria oil fields caused by the delay in project implementa-
tion. The financial annexes contain details for the income statement
(Annex 8), cash flow statement (Annex 9), balance sheet (Annex 10) and the
production cost structure (Annexes 11 and 12) of TP6 and the Videle enterprise
respectively. The revised incremental production cost structure of the
project is given in Annex 13.  It is shovn that the average financial
production cost of the Videle enterprise when full output is achieved in 1989
would be about Lei 768 per con in current terms compared to Lei 732 per ton
estimated in the SAl for 1986 when the corresponding full output was
expected. A summary of the actual annual financial resu ts for 1982-1986,
together with a comparison between the SAR estimates for the entire five-year
period is shamw below.

5.03     As noted in the SAR, TP?  does not pay oil produccion royalties nor
incoqm taxes. Thus, the price it receives for crude oil (equivalent to about
UIS$6.50/Bbl in 1986) is not comparable to the international price of crude oil
of which typically anywhere from 402 to 702 is accounted for by royalties,
taxes and government share. In addition, TPB does not undertake petroleum
exploration, the most risky activity in the sector, but developes fields
discovered by other specialized exploration enterprises funded by the
Government. Thus, TPB's profitability or return on investments, given the
relatively lover risk of its production operations, need not contain a "risk"
premium and can be lower than the rates for typical incernational oil
exploratioa and production companies. In this context, and in light of the
operating losses incurred by TPB during the years preceeding the project
appraisal (i.e., 1979 and 1980) as well as its other projected large

investments for enhanced oil recovery in the future (i.e., 1982-1987), the
minimum financial performance objectives established under the project, as
well as the actual results, were reasonable and satisfactory.
VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFOSMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Background
6.01     The petroleum industry in Romania is among the oldest in the world
and has a long-standing reputation for being well-organized and self-
reliant. The Ministry of Petroleum is responsible for the overall direction
and coordination of the sundry activities in the petroleum sector under its
purview. Actual operations are carried out by a network of trusts and
enterprises organized along regional and functionat lines. The main elements
in the network are the six oil drilling and extraction trusts of which TPB is
the one,responsible for oil development and production (along with various
ancillary operations and services) in the southwest region of Romania.
OrLanization and Performance
6.02     TPB is organized into seven semi-autonoous operating divisions, also
known as enterprises, and a headquarters group which performs the necessary
support and coordination functiona. Its annual investment and operating
budget is subject to ministerial approval in the context of the Covernment's
five-Year and Annual Plans. The top decision making power within TPB rests
with the Working People's Council which has 25 members representing management
and labor unions and which includes the director of the Trusc who reports to a
deputy minister in the Ministry of Petroleum. A People's Executive Board
chaired by the director and made up of 7 to 9 members picked from the Council
manages the Trust's operations.
6.03     TPB and its operating divisions and the other organizations which
assisted in carrying out the project are staffed with experienced and capable
individuals. Project management and coordination was assigned to a team of
senior level staff from these organizations, the Ministry and ICPPG, and the
project activities came under periodic review by a high-level interministet-ria
committee and the Minister of Petroleum who took an active interest in the
project. Despite this strong, well-organized back-up, TPS fell three years
short of meeting the *nd-1986 incremental oil production goal. The cause of
this shortfall is not due to any lack of experience or technical short-coming;
it is mainly due to two essentially interrelated institutional weaknesses.
The first is to the propensity to use exclusively Romanian equipment and
technology to avoid imports and reliance on foreign technology. This
predilection led to a project design based on air compressors of Romanian
manufacture with a protracted deLivery schedule and which by virtue of their
numbers required a lengthy installation period. Then secondly, having no
options on compressors, it was natural not to; devote time to the kind of
comprehensive studies and planning for the overall project design that went
into the in situ combustion design. For example, there was no investment
study to analyze the costs and benefits associated with the various possible
project design scenarios. Any future Bank lendi.ng operation in the petroleum
sector should focus on rectifying the institutional constraints responsible
for the project preparation and implementation experienced with this project.



- 14 -
Training
6.04     The project did not include provisions for training because it was
felt to be redundant considering the Roanian oil industry's experience and
expertise which was on a par with any in the world in this field. However,
Romania has not kept pace with the international oil industry in offshore
exploration and production and in deep drilling technology. Any future Bank
lending operation in the petroleum sector should address this technology
transfer issue along with the project preparation and impLementation
weaknesses demonstrated in this pftoject, and include appropriate training and
technology transfer provisions.
Loan Covenants
6.05     TPB complied fully with the9 conditions of the Loan Agreement.
Although not a loan condition, the Government and IB did confirm during
negotiations that cofinancing of the project would be sought; however, no
cofinancing arrangements were entered into because of adverse capital market
conditions and other unfavorable conditions (para. 3.08).
VII.  ECONOMIC REEVAL'ATION
7.01     The economic reevaluation of the project follows the same methodology
as was used in tJe SAR. The economic costs and benefits, expressed in
constant 1981 US dollar terms, are on an incremental basis using actual costs
and benefits realized during 1982-1986 and revised estimates from 1987
onwards. The details are discussed in Annex 1S. The economic rate of return
(ERR) of the project is now revised at 131 compared to the 29X estimated in
the SAR. This revised ERa is still satisfactory. The lower return is mostly
due to the sharp decline, in real terms, in international oil prices and to a
Lesser extent to the higher production cost, as well as to the three-year
delay in achieving the full incremental production.  These adverse
developments were slibhtly offset by a 112 lower actual economic capital cost
(USS332 million) compared to the SAR estimates (US$371 million).  W4;reas the
SAR assumed (base case) that the economic value of the crude oil produced by
the project would be about US$221 per ton (jq 1961 terms based on an
international crude oil price of US$34IBbO)' throughout the project life, the
actual (1982-1986) and revised forecast or assumed values (1987-2009) show a
trend dectining from US$196 per ton in 1982 to a low of US$79 per ton in 1986,
temporarily riaing to US$99 per ton in 1987 and again falling to US$92 per ton
by 1989 before gradually rising again to about US$163 per ton by the year 2000
and remaining at that level through the end of the project economic life
(2009). The incremental economic production cost (before provisions for
capital charges or recovery) has been revised upwards and now reestimated at
about US$9.87 per ton (US$1.47/Bbl) compared to the SAM estimate of US$S5.06
per ton (US$0.76/Bbl). This increase is due primarily to higher labor,
chemicals and other input requirements, as well as the real increases in the
economic costs of these inputs.

8.01     A cooperative working relationship was maintained throughout the
project cycle by Bank staff and I8, TPI s-4d GovernmeUt offictals. These
officials confirmed that complying with Sank procedures an4 requirements
created no proSlems of any consequence in carrying out the project, lank
staff undertook sevea supervision missions between May 1982 and October
1986. These missions along with the timely progress reports submitted by the
borrower were adequate for the effe-nive supervision of the project.
8.02     In addition to providing funds needed for accelerating the £01
program, an important concribution considering the rapid production decline
taking place in Romania's oil fields, the Bank participated in the technical
preparation of the project. The tmmanian petroleum industry Wan aong the
first in the world to experiment with and commercialize the in situ combustion
type £01 process. Nevertheless, the Rank correctly insisted that it was
prudent to have an outside party study the project.especially in view of the
fact Chat the project represented the largest application of the in situ
combustion process in the world and entailed a significan /technical risk.
Accordingly, the Sank engaged a consortium of LOR expertsz to review the
project design and expected production gains, as well as the monitoring system
for the combustion front and its effluents for operational and environmental
prote tion purposes. The experts agreed with the project concept and the
design parameters, and they made a number of useful recomendations regarding
the phasing of the fireflooding of the Videle reservoirs, the number and
configuration of isjection and production wells and the combustion monitoring
scheme. These recommendations were subsequently incorporated in the £OR
programo.
8.03     A Sank engineering panel reviewed the final projeit designs
(a) the choice of technology (in situ combustion) and basic design
parameters
(b) the reservoir data requirementst
(c) the combustion monitoring arrangements; and
(d) the investment phasing.
Except for recommending additional and better data acquisition through well
coring and logging during implementation, the panel found the project
acceptable with regard to these points. This recommendation was subsequently
included as a covenant in the loan agreemnt.
8.04     On the choice of equipment, the Rank engineering panel noted that
basing the air injection facilities on an exceptionally large number (22 per
compressor station and a total of S stations) of relatively small compressors
was contrary to Western practices of taking advantage of the economy of scale
principle. On the other hand, the panel accepted the fact that the lomenian

Romanian enterprise for international cooperation in the oiL and gas
industry.



- 16 -
injection design had the merit of being a tested working design familiar to
Romanian technical, operating and maintenance personiel and had the advantage
of ready access to spare parts and established mintenance services since che
compressors vere of Romanian manufacture. These considerations along with the
fact that the Bank loan could not cover the total cost of the compression
equipment which was consequently entirely excluded from Bank financing, caused
the panel to conclude that the Romanian choice of compressors was
acceptable. Also, reinforcing this conclusion was the fact that it was of
utmost importance to initiate the EOR program as soon as possible because of
the rapidly dectining production in the Videle and aalaria fieLds. It was
felt that any delays in developing a different air injection system could not
be justified because of the consequent production loss that would be
incurred. However, it appears in retrospect that an optimization study of the
air injection system would probably not have added significantly to the
implementation delays actually experienced and might have developed a more
efficient and cost effective air compressor installation not necessarily of
Romanian manufacture.
8.05     The Bank's rationale for participating in the project was to help
improve the quality and efficiency of project preparation and impLemntation
activities. Although generally successful in this area, events have shown
that the Bank should have opted for financing the air compression equipment
instead of the standard oil field items actually selected, even if It required
increasing the loan amount. It can be seen now that such an allocation of tte
Bank loan was particularly important in the absence of an optimization study
of the air injection system because the Bank's international competitive
bidding requirements would have provided cost, operating, delivery and other
essential data on air compressor systems internationally available. It is
possible that the Romanian air compressors would still have turned out to be
the best selection because of price, spare parts and other considerations.
However, not having investigated the international market, it is impossible to
know whether an opportunity was missed to install a better air injection
system-at less cost.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9e01     Results of the Balaris and Videle £01 operations indicate that the
ultimate oil recovery target of 392 of the oil initially in place will be
achieved, and in fact, the recovery could be as high as 421. These results
strongly support the conclusion that the project objective of recovering
731,000 tons per year of incremental oil over a 20-year period can be
realized. However, the long implementation pe^iod coupled with the fall in
international crude oil prices and higher than forecasted production costs
have reduced the economic rate of return to 132 which is still satisfactory
but falls short of the 291 return projected at appraisal.
9.02     The minimum financial performance objectives established for TP?
under the project were justified and have proved to be successful. As a
result of the increased crude oil price it now receives from the Government,
TPB has exceeded these objectives and is now in a much better financial
position to carry out future EO£ operations.
9.03     The project demonstrated that the  1OR technique based on in situ
combustion is highly effective and efficient in recovering oil which might



- 17 -
otherwise be abandoned in the reservoir. However, intensive study, tests and
pilot operation? are required to assure that the £0R process to be applied is
the correct one for the specific reservoir under consideration.  to this
regard, preparation of the Videle/Balaria W£ program was excellent and could
be used as a model for similar applications elsewhere, possibly with the
assistance of the Rommaian oil industry which is an internationally recognized
leader in IOR technology, especially where in situ combustion is involved.
9.04     The project also demonstrated that economic considerations are as
important as the technological factors in preparing an EOR investment. This
fact was amply emphasized by the sharp drop in crude oil prices, especially in
the first part of 1986, which essentially wiped out new EOR investments
everywhere. Since tebn, crude oil prices have recovered considerably and
reestablished the economic viability of the project. However, considering the
magnitude of the investments required for U0K projects, the need to pay
particular attention to the economics of these projects is still valid.
9.0S     As a corollary to the conclusions discussed above, it can be observed
that in contrast to the thorough and detailed preparation devoted to the
reservoir aspects of the £0R program, relatively less of an effort went into
preparing the rest of the project, as for instance, the surface facilities
which include the heart of the in situ process, the air supply system, and an
analysis of the economic costs and benefits associated with the possible
alternative arrangements. Although the EOB facilities actually installed
undoubtedly meet the design parameters established for the project, there is
no basis for concluding that they satisfy the least cost criteria for the
project from the standpoint of overall costs and benefits.
9.06     To complement its high degree of technical expertise in £0R
processes, TP8, and the Romanian oil industry in general, need to correct
three institutional weaknesses brought to light by the project:
(a) to stop relying exclusively on Romanian equipment and
technology; this is particularly important in the areas of
offshore petroleum activities and deep drilling where the
lomaian oil industry has not kept up with developments in the
international oil industry;
(b) to strengthen its project preparation performance, particularly
with regard to the analytical studies required to devwlop an
optimum project design aimed at achieving the maximum benefits
from the project at least cost in economic terms; and
(c) to strengthen its project implementation performance by
developing the project management arrangements necessary for
planning and executing a project expeditiously and in accordance
with an implementation schedule to be strictly adhered to.
9.07     The Bank should select items to be financed from its future loans
with the view to promote the introduction of more efficient technology and
provide an opportunity to assist in achieving optimum design and operational
objectives.



- 18-
9.08    Any future Bank lending operation in the Rommnian petroleum sector
should address the weaknesses discussed above. A rationale for such lending
would be the bedeficial changes and improvements in these areas which the Bank
could effect by its participation.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY (EOR)
1.       Oil reservoirs are initially produced using their latent energy in
the form of oil, gas and water expansion and reservoir rock compaction.
Depending on reservoir properties, the final oil recovery obtainable by this
technique (primary recovery) may be as high as 451 of the oil initially in
place (OIIP). However, in most cases, it is rather low, being on the order of
lS%-30X.
2.       In most reservoirs, the ultimate oil recovery can be increased by the
use of the so-called enhanced oil recovery techniques (EOR). OR techniques
essentially consist of introducing extraneous energy into oil reservoirs in
order to eztract more of the oil in place. The simplest and oldeit EOR
techniques are waterflooding and gas injection (secondary recovery) in which
additional energy is introduced into the reservoir in the form of injected
water and gas, respectively. Being the least expensive EOR techniques, water
and gas injection are usually the first to be considered towards the end of
the primary producing life of an oil reservoir. The additional oil production
from these simple and inexpensive secondary oil recovery techniques would
range from 5Z to 201 of the OIIP.
3.       The ultimate recovery of oil can be further increased by the
application of more advanced EO1 techniques designed either to improve the
performance of water and gas injection where they ere applicable or to
supplant them where they are not applicable, such as heavy oil reservoirs. As
such, they can be classified as both secondary (coming immediately after
primary) and tertiary (coming after secondary) recovery mechanisms.  Advanced
£0R methods which are generally accepted as proven by the petroleum industry
can be divided into three groups:  (i) improved waterflooding, (ii) miscible
displacement and (iii) thermal oil recovery. In improved waterflooding, the
efficiency of oil displacement by the injected water is enhanced by the
injection of chemicals (surfactants), viscous solutions (polymers) or
microemulsions of oil and water (micellar solutions) to achieve higher oil
recovery. Miscible displacement achieves the same goal by injecting into the
reservoir substances that are uiscible in both the displaced oil and the
displacing fluid, normally a gas. Carbon dioxide, high-pressure natural gas,
enriched natural gas, LPC and solvents are the most widely used miscibility
agents. In thermal EO techniques, extraneous energy is introduced into the
reservoir as heat in the form of either surface-generated steam (cyclic or

continuous steam injection) or high-pressure air which burns part of the
reservoir oil (in situ combustion).
4.       Although they are rather simple in concept, advanced EOR techniques
involve many physical and chemical phenomena which are not yet well
understood; have widely differing conditions of applicability: are expensive
and difficult to implement and monitor; and require extensive pilot-scale
testing before full-scale field application.

VIDELE/BALARIA  hbNAbCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT
(LOAN 2148-RO)
ASSUJPTIONS FOR ECONOMIC REEALUATION
1.       The economic reevaluation of the project is done on an incremental
costs and benefits basis, expressed in constant 1981 US dollar terms, as was
done in the economic analysis in the SAR. Likewise, a 20-year period of full
incremental production at 731,000 tons of oil per year is used, but starting
in 1989, three years later than expected in the SAR. Some small actual
incremental production during 1982 through 1986 is also used, which quickly
rises to the full level by 1989. This revised production profile, as
mentioned earlier, represents a two-year production response lag between the
completion of full-scale comencement of in situ combustion in 1987 and the
attainment of the full EOR-induced incremental production, which is normal for
this type of EOR technique.
2.       The economic value of the incremental crude oil production of the
project is derived on the basis of international crude oil prices (FOB)
adjusted ky a 102 discount for the lower quality (e.g., heavier oil at 18'API)
of the project output compared to the typical or reference internationally
traded crude oil and for the transport cost to Romania. Actual average prices
for OPEC oil exports during 1982-86, as well as World Bank estimates for 1987
through 2000 expressed in constant 1981 US dollars, are used.  The economic
reevaluation assumes prices will remain constant in real terms from 2000
onwards.  These are sumarized belows

8/    Based on the heavy oil produced by the project (6.7 barrels per ton)
being priced at IOZ below the typical OPEC crude (7.4 barrels per ton)
and a transport provision of US$1.00 per barrel (1981 ters).
b/   ,Deflated using the Wv indez (as of February 1987, see Table 1).
3.       The SAB made a distinction concerning the capital costs between the
financial cost to TPB (excluding interest during construction) and the
financial cost of the project to the Government.  The financial cost to TPB
estimated in the SM was based on the then prevailing 1981 Romanian catalog
prices (i.e., Government-set prices) for locally purchased items.  At that
time, these catalog prices did not generally fully reflect the cost of the
indirect import contents of locally produced or distributed items. In the
specific case of the locally procured items for the project, the SAM estimated
that on average, the financial cost to the Government would be about 12Z
higher than the financial cost to TPB, on the basis of the international
prices of their indirect import contents. This financial cost to the
Government was used in the SAR as the economic capital cost for the equipment,
materials and supplies used by the project. The SAR 4id use the financial
cost to TPB of laboi and services as the economic costs. Mowever, between
1981 and 1986, the Government revised the catalog prices three times and
adjusted the foreign exchange rate five times in order to eliminate these
indirect or hidden subsidies.  In the judgment of the PCR mission, the
difference between the financial capital cost to TPB and the financial capital
cost to the Government did iot actually materialixe. Thus, for tho economic
reevaluation of the project, the economic capital cost is based on the actual
financial costs incurred by TPB for the purchase of equipment, materials,

- 39 -                  ~~~~~ANNEX 15
Page 3 ofS
supplies, as well as for labor and services (there is no tax element in these
finaneial prices since the project was exempt  rcn  ales and import taxes).
4.       The foreign exchange resource cost of the project is taken as the
foreign exchange financing in the economic reevaluation. Siace this foreign
exchange financing has been recorded in current Lei by TPB, it was first
converted to current US dollars using the average exchange rate prevailing
during the year of disbursement, and then converted to constant 1981 US dollar
terms using the Bank's manufacturing unit value (NUV) index issued in February
1987. The domestic resource cost is taken as the local currency financing in
current Lei (or difference between the total economic capital cost and the
foreign exchange financing), first converted to constant 1981 Lei using the
Romanian producer price inflation rate during 1982-1986 as deflator, and then
finally converted to constant 1981 US dollars using the exchange rate
(Lei 15/US$1.00) prevailing in 1981 (Table 1). On this basis, the actual
economic capital cost of the project in constant 1981 terms is about US$331.8
million compared to about US$371 million estimated in the SAR. Finally,
recurrent annual capital investments to sustain the full level of incremental
production vilL be required from mid-1990 onwards at a revised cost of about
UMS24.5 million in 1981 terms (equivalent to Lei 420 million in 1987 terms)
which is almost the same as the SAB estimate of about US$24.6 million per year
but starting from 1986 onwards.
S.       The economic variable operating cost for the project is based on
technical input coefficients for energy, chemicals, labor, etc. experienced
during 1982-1986 and estimated by TPB for 1987 through 1989. These technical
input coefficients are expected to remain constant from 1989 onvards when the
project tdaches full incremental production.  The unit economic cost of the
variable operating inputs have been reestimated as follows:
(a)  For power, the economic cost is now revised at US$0.030 per kWh
in 1981 terms (Let S2/kVh in 1987 terms) compared to US$0.035
per kWh estimated in the SMA reflecting the real decline in
energy prices worldwide. This revised economic price is only
marginally higher than the financial price prevailing in 1987
(Lei SIAkMh in 1987 terms).
(b)  For diesel fuel, the economic cost is derived from the actual
(1982-1986) and projected crude oil international prices (FOS)
and the expectation that diesel fuel international prices would
on average be about 302 higher (on a per barrel basis) than the
typical or reference crude oil international pri.ces.
(c)  For natural gas, the economic cost is derived from the economic
cost of fuel oil on a gross heating value equivalent basis
(i.e., 1,192 cubic meters of gas is equivalent to one ton of
fuel oil). The economic cost of fuel oil in turn is derived
from the international crude oil prices on the basis that fuel
oil international prices would on average be about 202 lower (on
a per barrel basis) than the typical crude oil price.
(d)  The economic cost of all the other variable operating costs
(chemicals, consumables, labor, etc.), as well as the
incremental fixed costs, are taken as their actual financial

values for 1982-1986 and TPB's estimates for 1987 through 1989
deflated to constant 1981 terms as in the case of the local
currency capital costs. The economic costs from 1989 onwards
are projected to remain constant in real terms for these non-
energy operating cost items.
On these bases, the operating cost (before capital charges)
when full production is attained is now estimated at about
US$9.87 per ton or US$1.47 per barrel compared to the SAR
estimate of US$5.06 per ton or US$0.76 per barrel (all in 1981
terms). The higher revised incremental production cost is
primarily due to more labor, chemicals and other input
requirements and, to a lesser extent, the higher real costs of
these items. The comparison is shown below.

6.        The reestimated economic rate of return (ERU) of the project is about
13.2Z (Annex 15), compared to the SAR estimate of 29X. The lower revised rate
is due primarily to the tower revised price of crude oil compared to the SAE
estimate and, to a lesser extent, to the two-year delay in the project

benefits and the higher production costs. Nonetheless, the reestimted ERR is
still satflfactory. The lower capital cost, as a result of 8ood cost control
and engineering efforts on the part of TPB, mitigated slightly the adverse
effect of higher production costs and the delay in project benefits.
