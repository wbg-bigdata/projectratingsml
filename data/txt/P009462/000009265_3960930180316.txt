MEMORANDUM AND RECONNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS TRANSPORT AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to Bangladesh for SDR 49.8 million (US$67.2 million equivalent), on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would help finance a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) transport
and distribution project. The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) would onlend
proceeds of the Credit to the Project Beneficiaries at a rate of 1OS per annum
for a period of 15 years, including a grace period of 5 years, with the
Beneficiaries bearing the foreign exchange risk. Technical assistance
components of the project would be cofinanced by the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) for SDR 1.41 million (US$1.9 million equivalent).
2.        Background.  Bangladesh's only indigenous commercial energy resources
are natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), dwindling supplies of biomass
fuels, and possibly coal. The country imports all of Its petroleum supplies
and kerosene alone accounts for almost 30S of total petroleum products
consumption. Most of the pyopulation depends on biomass fuels, of which a large
proportion is sold at market prices that are almost quadruple the price of
kerosene on a useful energy equivalent basis. LPG (or bottled gas) recovered
from gas prodt tion could substitute for kerosene and comuercial fuelwood used
in cooking. Up to 100,000 metric tons per year (mtpy) of LPG could be
recovered from the northern gas fields when fully developed during the 1990s.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Project is part of the MY91-93
Priority Investment Program agreed under the Energy Sector Adjustment Credit
(ESAC/Cr. 1999-BD) for the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Minerals Corporation
(Petrobangla) and the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC). The Project is
consistent with the investment planning, pricing policy and institutional
reform framework of the ESAC. IDA's involvement ir the Project would build on
the pilot LPG component of the Refinery Modification and LPG Recovery &
Distribution Project (Cr. 1749-BD) by assisting GOB, Petrobangla and BPC In the
least-cost development of LPG supplies and the strengthening of their
capabilities in LPG operations. IDA would pursue LPG pricing refonms inLtiated
under the refinery project by assisting GOB in establishing economically and
financially sound LPG pricing policies. In support of GOB's policy, IDA would
play a catalytic role in encouraging private sector involvement, building on
the private LPG joint venture under the refinery project. The Project would
complement the Second Gas Development Project (SGDP/Cr. 1586-BD) by
establishing a joint Petrobangla and BPC planning perspective, since LPG
recovery and distribution need to be coordinated with gas production.
4.        Project Obiectives.  The main Project objective is to assist
Bangladesh in carrying out an economic and least-cost household and commercial
energy supply strategy through the substitution of LPG for imported kerosene
and coa ercial fuelwood. Domestic LPG recovery is the least-cost option
compared to LPG and kerosene imports. The Project would also promotes (a) LPG



-2-
prleing in accord with economLc efficiency and financial viability principles;
(b) a suitable institutional framework for efficient LPG development and
operations; (c) an environmentally and operationally safe petroleum industryt
and (d) private sector involvement in LPG transport and distribution.
5.        Proiect Description.  The SGDP is finaneing upstream facilities for
(a) gas dehydration and hence recovery of LPG and condensate by-products, and
(b) pipeline transport and fractionation of these liquids at a central products
terminal. The proposed Project would assist in the downstream storage.
transport, bottling and cylinder distribution of LPG. The Project
Beneficiaries would be the Rupantarita Prakritik Gas (or Converted Natural Gas)
Company Limited (RPGCL) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas Limited (LPGL), which are
operating subsidiaries of Petrobangla and JPC, respectively. The Project
components includes (a) for RPGCL -- (i) storage facilities for LPG and
condensates, (ii) an LPG pipeline from Ashuganj to Elenga, where LPG will be
bottled and delivered to the energy-deficient west zone, and (iii) directional
drilling for the pipeline's river crossings; and (b) for LOPGL -- (i) two LPG
bottling plants, rehabilitation of an existing LPG plant, and storage, and
(ii) LPG cylinders, valves and regulators. The Project's technical assistance
(TA) components includes (a) construction implementation supervision;
(b) training in the management and operations of the LPG facilities;
(c) preparation of an LPG market development plan, and an environmental and
operational safety assessment of the petroleum sector; (d) a Women in
Development (WID) program to promote the role of Bangladeshi women in the
retail distribution of LPG cylinders and energy-efficient cooking stoves; and
(e) technical studies related to further LPG recovery and compressed naturai
gas commercialization. The total Project cost is estimated at US$90.4 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$69.1 million, and includes
retroactive financing of US$5.0 million for urgent work to rehabilitate the
Chittagong LPG plant and undertake infrastructure design. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key Project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map highlighting
the Project areas is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9398-BD, dated
April 30, 1991 is being distributed separately.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The key agreements reached with GOB include LPG and
NGL pricing policy, the financial restructuring of RPGCL and LPGL, and measures
to ensure their future financial viability, as follows: (a) LPG transfer and
retail prices to be reviewed annually with IDA and adjusted to meet agreed
financial and economic criteria satisfactory to IDA; (b) NGLe to be priced at
levels that would allow revenues to cover RPGCL's and LPGL's operating
expenses, debt service, additional working capital requirements and a minimum
of 35Z contribution to investment; (c) all necessary actions to be taken to
facilitate RPGCL's and LPGL's financial restructuring; and (d) 10OS GOB equity
financing for RPGCL's compressed natural gas (CNG) pilot activities. The key
agreements reached with RPGCL and LPGL include their financial restructuring
and performance, as follows: (a) an action program to restructure the capital
of RPOCL's CNG-related operations and LPGL's Chittagong operations by FY92; and
(b) financial performance targets for both entities related to debtlequity
ratio, debt service coverage, achievement of their own financial requirements
before declaring any dividends, and annual review of capital expenditure
programs and LPGL's depreciation rates. RPGCL and LPGL also agreed on staffing



plans, training programs and terms of reference for the TA components. Board
presentation conditions includes (a) confirmation of the availability of CIDA
funding; (b) the SODP bid evaluation for the LPG-related upstream facilities to
have reached an advanced stage satisfactory to IDA; and (c) GOB approval of the
Project Concept Paper. Credit effectiveness conditions includes (a) execution
of RPGCL and LPGL Subsidiary Loan Agreements satisfactory to IDA; (b) contract
awards for the Project's implementation supervision consultancy services and
the LPG-related facilities under SGDP; and (c) GOB approval of the Project
Proforma.  Dated covenants apply to the TA studies, whereby the recommendations
and implementation action plans would be reviewed and agreed with IDA.
7.        Environmental Impact.  The environmnntal and operational safety
assessment for the Project (B rating) was prepared under the CIDA-financed LPG
Feasibility Study. Further IDA review led BPC to: (a) specify a safety limit
of 502 for the LPG's maximum propane content; and (b) request inclusion In the
Project of a repair and rehabilitation plan for the small LPG bottling plant at
the Chittagong refinery. The LPG plants will be located within Petrobanglas
and BPC's restricted and secure premises. The LPG pipeline will be laid on
already acquired land and right-of-way. LPG has been used extensively and
safely in densely populated developing countries. The Project design and
installation will ensure strict compliance with international safety codes.
RPGCL and LPGL will receive extensive management and operations assistance. At
the point of end-use, LPG (like natural gas) is an extremely clean fuel. LPG
substitution would also alleviate the negative environmental effects and safety
risks of kerosene and fuelwood use. To promote environmental and safety
measures in the petroleum sector, the Project includes an assessment of
necessary equipment, standards and practices, to be implemented by the time the
LPG under the Project comes on stream.
8.        Poverty Alleviation.  A primary benefit would be the creation of
income-generation opportunities through small-scale private retail outlets for
LPG cylinders and stoves. Through the VID component, an added social benefit
would be the specific targeting of a relatively disadvantaged group, namely
Bangladeshi omen, as retail marketing agents. There would also be cash
savings where LPG substitution for commercial fuelwood occurs.
9.        Women in Development.  The Project includes measures to involve
Bangladeshi women as agents of technology transfer and commercialization,
particularly in areas where women may have comparative advantage (e.g.,
management of credit schemes, direct promotion to housewives, networking with
non-governmental organizations). This component would set the stage for
distributing larger amounts of LPG during the 19908.
10.       Benefits.  The Project would assist in reducing the foreign exchange
drain from oil imports, alleviating biomass energy shortages and promoting
social equity between the country's eastern region and less-developed western
zone. Two of the Project's innovative TA components would also pioneer in
promoting environmental and operational safety in the petroleum sector, and in
enhancing the development role of Bangladeshi women. The Project's estimated
economic rate of return is 202, based on conservative assumptions regarding
petroleum prices and interfuel substitution rates.



11.       Risk.. Implementation delay is the main Project risk.  Construction
delays would be minimized by providing for effective implementation supervision
and project management for both RPGCL and LPGL, and careful monitoring of
suitable financial performance targets to address resource constraints.
12.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
wxecutive Directors approve the proposed credit.
