PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SOLOMON ISLANDS
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SOL ON ISLANDS PROJECT
(CREDIT 1115-SOL)
PREFACE
This is a Proiect Completion Report (PCR) for the Development Bank
of Solomon Islands (DBSI) Project in the Solomon Islands, for which Credit
1115-SOL in the amount of SDR 1.3 million was signed on April 30, 1981. The
original Credit Closing Date was Ju.re 30, 1985; the final revised Closing
Date was December 31, 1987. The account was closed on May 13, 1988, and an
undisbursed balance of SDR 602,949.40 cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by staff of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
with whom IDA cofinanced the project, following a project completion mission
to the Solomon Islands in August 1989.   Under an agreement between the
Association and the ADB, ADB was responsible for overall project formulation
and appraisal and for subsequent supervision of project implementation. The
PCR is accompanied by an Evaluation Summary prepared by IDA Staff.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department.   The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and Cofinancier for comments.  The com-
ments received from the DBSI and ADB have been taken into account in
finalizing the report and are reproduced as Attachments A and B, respec-
tively, to the PCR.

IDA'S EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Idantitv
Project Name:     Development Bank of Solomon Islands Project
Credit Number:    1115-SOL
Regional Unit:    Asia Region--Country Department V
Country:          Solomon Islands
Sector:           Financial Interrediation
Subsector:        Development Banking
I. Introduction
1.       The Development Bank of Solomon Islands (DBSI) Project was IDA's
first credit to the Solomon Islands.   As part of its general strategy of
cost-effective lending to the Pacific Island countries, the Bank Group had
decided to lend through cofinancing operations with the Asian Development
Bank (ADB).   The DBSI Project was one of the first of these cofinanced
operations.
2.       Under this cofinancing arrangement, ADB had the lead responsibility
for appraising and administering the project [including supervising and
preparing the respective project completion report (PCR)].  The arrangements
for the cofinanced DBSI Project were outlined in a "Letter of Credit Adminis-
tration" between ADB and IDA dated June 5, 1981.   The PCR, originally
scheduled for completion by end-1988, was deferred to June 30, 1989, due to
ADB's revised work program.  ADB subsequently informed the Bank Group that
completion of the PCR would be further delayed until the second half of 1989;
.A2's PCR on its Second DBSI Project (Loan No. 508-SOL [SF]), which was co-
'.nanced with IDA's Credit No. 1115-SOL, is provided in the Attachment.1
II. Background
3.       Expanding scarce opportunities for earning cash income in rural
areas and increasing the participation of the indigenous population in the
economy were the major objectives of the Government of the Solomon Islands'
(GSI) development policy.   Limited availability of financial resources for
small-scale agricultural and commercial activities, however, was perceived as
a major impediment towards achieving these objectives.  The DBSI, the only
1/ The PCR was prepared by an ADB mission which visited the Solomon Islands
August 18-28, 1989.

financial institution providing medium- and long-term funds for developmental
projects in the agricultural and industrial sectors (.articularly to
indigenous enterprises), was considered the appropriate financial inter-
mediary for implementing these objectives.
4.       The DBSI was established in March 1977.  Under a first ADB technical
assistance (TA) grant, it was recommended that the Solomon Islands' existing
Agricultural and Industrial Loan Board be converted into an autonomous
development finance institution (DFI).   A second and third ADB TA grant
provided five man-years of senior management (expatriate) support to the new
institution; ADB's first credit line of US$2.0 million to DBSI2 became
effective in July 1979.
III. Project Objectives and Description
5.       The objective of this cofinanced project was to assist the DBSI in
providing needed finance (US$3.5 million equivalent--US$1.5 million from IDA
and US$2.0 million from ADB) for productive investments in the agricultural,
industrial, commerce, transportation and service sectors during the period
1981-82.
IV.  Prolect Design and Implementation
6.       The DBSI Project was appraised by ADB in April 1980--slightly more
than two years after it was established as an autonomous DFI.  The DBSI's
main objective was to assist in the economic and social development of the
Solomon Islands within the Government's overall development plans and
strategies.   The DBSI was to give particular emphasis to (i) promoting the
participation of Solomon Islanders in economic and rural development, and
(ii) stimulating processing and industrial activities, by making available
medium- and long-term loans for such activities. At the time of appraisal,
DBSI's operational and financial performances were found satisfactory,
although in hindsight, this conclusion was based on DBSI's very limited
experience as a DFI, e.g., only one year's (1979) audited figures were avail-
able.   Moreover, there were already signs of declining profitability and
increasing arrears, two financial indicators that were to deteriorate
steadily over ensuing years.
7.       IDA's appraisal report clearly identified the risks associated with
the project: (i) DBSI's relative lack of experience in development banking,
including the lack of qualified and experienced local staff (especially in
light of the planned departure of expatriate consultants by end-1981); and
(ii) the already growing arrears and their implication to DBSI's future
financial viability.   One issue not directly analyzed by ADB and IDA, how-
ever, was the appropriateness of the DBSI's interest rate (lending)
structure, which is established by the GSI.  Although an  average interest
spread3 of 5 to 5.5% was anticipated, and endorsed, at the time of appraisal,
2/ The ADB/IDA cofinanced project was ADB's second line of credit to the
DBSI.
3/ The difference between the DBSI's average cost of borrowings and the
DBSI's average onlending rate to its borrowers.



DBSI's mandated interest rate structures during project implementation have
effectively constrained DBSI from adopting prudent onlending terms.  DBSI's
onlending interest rate structures (original and as later revised) have been
inadequate to enable DBSI to cover its cost of credit delivery (including
associated risks), never mind providing a reasonable profit margin.
8.       An ADB review mission, which visited DBSI in October 1984, and an
ADB special loan administration mission, which visited in July 1985, recog-
nized the rapid deterioration in DBSI's operations experienced since
appraisal, and recommended a coxtprehensive (external) "review of DBSI's role
and functions aimed at developing ar. action program to revitalize DBSI in all
areas of operation."   Unfortunately,  extensive delaye (primarily bureau-
cratic) were experienced in implementing this review, and the report was
finalized only in May 1988. Although a comprehensive rehabilitation proposal
based on the findings and recommendations of this review was expected to be
formally agreed and adopted by the GSI and the DBSI by end-1988, this has not
yet happened.   In the meantime, ADB and IDA have agreed that any further
assistance to the DBSI would be considered only after a viable rehabilitation
plan and action program, acceptable to ADB and IDA, has been formulated and
adopted by the GSI and DBSI.4
V. Prolect Results and Institutional Sustainability
9.       Project results have been extremely disappointing.   The DBSI is
facing very serious financial difficulties and its continued viability as an
effective financial intermediary is doubtful.   It has posted losses every
year since 1981.   As of December 31, 1988, arrears of twelve months and
longer continued to mount, and accounted for 30% of DBSI's total loan port-
folio, with approximately 70% of its total loan portfolio affected by such
arrears.   DBSI's  lending margins remain wholly inadequate--the average
interest spread in 1988 was only 3.9%.  (Also refer paras. 28 and 29 of the
ADB's PCR.]
10.      In addition to the issue of DBSI's interest rate structure discussed
in para. 7 above, there are a number of factors that have contributed to
DBSI's present unsatisfactory condition.   The most important has been sig-
nificant loan losses due to poor loan appraisal procedures, a situation which
has bcen compounded by the limited business experience of many of DBSI's loan
recipients. This has resulted in loans being made to enterprises that were
unlikely, or un.able, to generate sufficient cash flow to repay their debts,
and has been further exacerbated by other factors.  These include less than
adequate loan supervision procedures and the difficulty of collecting debts,
especially given the widely dispersed population and the extended family (or
"wantok" system) and its social and economic interrelationships, including
common property. Other important factors have bera. the lack of familiarity
of certain borrowers with handling relatively large sums of money, willful
defaults, and the dependency of many projects on the vagaries of commodity
prices. The lack of clearly defined policies for collecting arrears, as well
as for initiating appropriate legal procedures for following up on these
4/ DBSI notes that since end-1988, it has internally undertaken a number of
steps to implement recommendations prepared in this review; refer to
para. 39 of the ADB's PCR and to Attachment A.



- vi -
efforts, have further complicated these problems.  There does not appear to
have been an adequate transfer of knowledge from expatriates employed by DBSI
(both prior to and aftec 1981) to national officers; correspondingly, the
localization policy appears to have occurred too quickly for officers to
obtain the necessary confidence and experience to carry out their duties
successfully. As a result of these circumstances, DBSI management has been
unable to provide the leadership required and unable to gain sufficient
experience to ensure implementation of adequate financial controls and
management information systems.
11.      Regarding utilization of credit proceeds provided under the project,
only 54% of IDA's SDR 1.3 million was disbursed, despite a two and a half
year extension of the closing date as originally covenanted. An amendment to
tile Credit Agreement providing for the financing of local currency
exp;4rditures had no significant impact on increasing the level of funds
uti: zation.  This is attributed to several factors:  (i) a general slowdown
in the economy during 1981-82; (ii) the absence of larger-sized projects
which were anticipated at the time of appraisal (the Lungga Hydroelectric
Project, subsequently postponed, was expected to generate new business); and
(iii) a general slowdown, beginning in 1984, in credit demand as a result of
excess liquidity in the financial system. Another reason for the low utili-
zation of credit proceeds may have been due to misunderstandings and poor
follow-up within DBSI itself--DBSI's internal accounts showed that only 64Z
of subloan amounts approved by DBSI (and subsequently authorized) for
financing with credit proceeds was ultimately disbursed under the credit.
12.      A total of 809 subloans were financed under Credit 1115-SOL; only
eight subloans were above the free-limit of US$30,000.5 A detailed breakdown
of these subloans by sector, size, maturity and geographical distribution is
given in Section II.B of the ADB's PCR.   Information on the financial and
economic performance of these subprojects is limited, and a meaningful
asse3sment of the socio-econoric benefits associated with these investments
could not be made (refer para. 18 of the ADB's PCR).
VI. Association Performance
13.      The Association's direct involvement in this project was minimal--it
did not participate directly in project appraisal or in field supervision.
However, this approach was consistent with the agreed procedures with ADB for
cofinancing projects in the Pacific Islands. Although it can be argued that
IDA should have been more actively and directly involved in the project, it
is debatable whether greater involvement would have resulted in a different
outcome.   Hindsight suggests, however,  that much greater attention should
have been devoted to a more thorough analysis of the risks that were cor-
rectly identified at project appraisal:  the interest structure assumed for
DBSI at that time (para. 7 above), especially in view of its existing and
projected lending activities (and high delivery costs associated with such),
strongly indicated that DBSI would, in future, have difficulty operating as a
commercially viable financial intermediary.
5/ Under this cofinanced project, ADB allocated funds from the IDA Credit and
the ADB Loan, to the extent possible, on a pro rata basis against each
withdrawal application.

VII. Lessons Learned
14.      DBSI has legitimate developmental objectives of expanding productive
activities (which are primarily small-scale) in the rural areas and
increasing the participation of the indigenous population in commercial
activities.   Simultaneously with them, as stipulated in its Statement of
General Business Policies, it was expected that the DBSI would "carry out its
operations as a development bank in accordance with sound banking and
business practices".   Unfortunately,  given the constrained interest rate
parameters within which DBSI has operated and the high administrative coats
(and risks) normally associated with serving clients like those primarily
targetted under DBSI's (and GSI's) developmental policies, these objectives
seem incompatible.   It is imperative that, in a project such as this, the
Borrower, the DFI and the Association not only have clearly defined, but also
have agreed, beforehand, on appropriate, achievable institutional goals and
targets (a point th3t is underscored by the fact that DBSI, as a relatively
new institution at the time of appraisal, was operating in a small-sized
country already experiencing a severe shortage of qualified manpower). This
would have required that the agreed institutional goals and targets ought to
have been reviewed and assessed within the context of possibly conflicting,
and even incompatible,  institutional objectives.   Furthermore,  the cor-
responding financial implications (to both the DFI and the government itself)
expected to result under the agreed strategy should have been explicitly
recognized. This was done inadequately in the case of the DBSI, illustrating
the need in these cases that more attention and time be invested before the
Bank Group embarks on such a lending operation. Unfortunately, without such
a comprehensive framework for appraising DBSI-type lending operations, the
prospects for developing and promoting financially viable, sustainable
lending institutions are not encouraging.

I. BACKGROUND '
A.  Brief History
1.       The Development Bank of Solomon Islands (DBSI) was established as
a public authority under the DBSI Act 1977 and become operational on 1 January
1978 when it assumed all the assets and liabilities of Agricultural and Industrial
Loans Board (AILB), DBSI's predecessor institution which ceased to operate on
31 December 1977. DBSI is owned by the Government of Solomon Islands through
the Investment Corporation of Solomon Islands (ICSI) 1/ (84 per cent) and the
Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) (16 per cent). As of 31 December 1988,
DBSI's paid up capital was SI$7.98 n.illion. The Government assists DBSI through
share capital contributions, guarantee of external loans and compensation
against operating losses.  Under its Act, DBSI is exempt from tax.  The
Government appoints the DBSI's nine-member Board of Directors with the
Managing Director as an ex-officio member, with at least four members from the
private sector and the rest from the Government.
B.' Scope of Operations
2.       DBSI's operations are in line with the Government's economic
development plans and strategies and cover a wide range of activities such as
term-lending, equity financing, underwriting, issuing guarantees and providing
advisory assistance. Its main activity has been to make medium and long-term
loans for development projects in agriculture (including tree crops, logging,
fishery and livestock), commerce, mining, industry, construction and services
(including tourism and transport) and to conduct related promotional activities.
DBSI has also taken up equity investments to support local entrepreneurs set
up new projects and to help in the transfer of successful ventures from
expatriates to nationals.
C.  Relationship with Bank and Other Lenders
3.       By 31 December 1988, the Bank through the Government had provided
DBSI with three technical assistance grants amounting to $425,000 2/ and two
loans of $2.0 million each. The technical assistance facilitated the conversion of
AILB into a full-fledged DFI, helped established DBSI as the successor to AILB,
1/  In April 1988, ICSI was created by Act of Parliament to succeed the
Government Shareholding Agency (GSA) with the functions, inter alia, as
implementing the government's policy with regard to public sector
participation in commercial investments and managing and administering
the Government's commercial investment portfolio.
2/  These three TA are as follows: (i) TA No. 112-BRI approved 23 May 1974 for
$45,000 for the feasibility of converting AILB into a full-fledged
development financing institution (DFI); (ii) TA No.165-SOL approved 25
March 1976 for $250,000 for the preparatory work required in the
conversion of AILB as a DFI to DBSI including the formulation of the DBSI
charter and Policy Statement; operational procedures, staff recruitment and
staff training; and (iii) TA No. 289-SOL approved 19 April 1979 for $130,000
for the provision of a loan operations expert as chief executive of DBSI to
supervise DBSI's staff engaged in loan appraisal and foUow-up, train a
successor and conduct training programs to upgrade staff expertise.



- 8 -
deputed training specialist/consultant as DBSI's chief executive during its initial
years of operations and trained staff required for building up DBSI's
institutional capability. The two loans were for financing the foreign exchange
costs of specific development projects. A Project Completion Report on the first
Bank Loan (Loan No. 394-SOL[SFJ), which concluded that the objectives of the
loan had been achieved, was prepared in December 1984.
4.       The second  Bank  loan was co-financed  by the International
Development A.ssociation (IDA) for $1.5 million. In addition, financial assistance
was also provided through the Government, by the Rural Trading Centre (RTC),
European Development Fund (EDF) and the United Kingdom Aid. DBSI has also
obtained loans directly from the National Provident Fund (NPF) and the CBSI.
All these funds are intended to be committed by DBSI for financing development
projects.
D.  Rationale for the Bank Loan
5.     b At the time of the appraisal of the second Bank loan, the Solomon.
Islands was implementing its second National Development Plan 1980-1984, whose
major objectives were: (i) to ensure the continued growth of the economy by
developing the country's resources for the maximum benefit of Solomon
Islanders; (ii) to expand and diversify exports and promote self-reliance; (iii)
to encourage a wide geographical and social distribution of economic activity;
and (iv) to increase investment to create employment and cash income. The Plan
also placed emphasis on education aind training in order to increase the supply
of local skilled manpower. The second loan of $2.0 million, along with IDA's
cofinancing credit of $1.5 million, was envisaged to contribute towards the
achievement of the objectives, of the Plan by:- (i) augmenting DBSI's foreign-
currency resources for the purpose of making medium and long-term loans to
meet the foreign exchange cost of projects in the agriculture, manufacturing;.
transport and services sectors; and (ii) assisting DBSI in `ts efforts to continue
improving its institutional aspects.
6.       In October- 1984,. a. Review-cum-PCR  Mission found that DBSI's.
performance has progressively deteriorated- since, the- last Bank consultant- left
DBSL in.. November- 1981.. Problems. facing- DBSr were- wide-ranging, covering.
institutional,. operational. and financial aspects. The- Review-cum-PCR Mission-
therefore recommended. that the Government approved a technical assistance- to,
carry out a critical assessment of DBSI's operational performance and its future-
role and functions in the country's economy. The technical assistance identified
DBSI's internal and external constraints, and developed strategies and.
guidelines for making DBSI more efficient in developing and assisting the-
private sector. The technical assistance was financed under the second Bank
loan.

II. IMPLEMENTATION
A.  Lending Policies
7.       T)BSI's lending policies are governed by its Policy Statement which
was formulated in consultation with ttre Bank. It was adopted by DBSI in 1978
-nd amended in 1984. This statement provides prudent guidelines for DBSI's
scope of activities, development pelicies and operating principles. It prescribes
portfolio diversification, maximum exposure limits to individual enterprises,
financial guidelines and policies for setting up provisions and reserves.
B.  Characteristics of Subloans
8.       The second Bank loan was utilized to finance 809 subprojects,
amounting to $0.82 million net of cancellations (see Appendix 1). The main
characteristics of subloans financed in terms of their sectoral distribution,
subloan size, geographical distribution, purpose, and maturity are summarized
in-Part I - Basic Data, Section C (pp. ii-iii). Eight subprojects totalling $0.36
million, or 44.3 per cent of total subloans committed and disbursed, were above
the free limit of $30,000.
1.   Sectoral Distribution
9.       At appraisal, it was envisaged that the largest portion of the second
loan would go to agriculture, rural development and natural resources sector
(40.0 per cent); followed by the manufacturing sector, including small-scale
industries and construction; and commerce, services and transport sector (30.0
per cent each). Actual loan utilization showed that the commerce, services and
transport sector accounted for a large proportion (45.5 per cent) of the loan
proceeds because of the approval of five large projects totalling $0.23 million
or 28.0 per cent of the total amount utilized. The agriculture, rural development
and natural resources sector received the lowest portion - 24.3 per cent of the
total amount utilized. However, by number of subprojects, it was the largest,
accounting for 599 subprojects or 74.0 per cent. This sectoral distribution
reflects DBSI's policy of p-cviding assistance to the agriculture sector, the
mainstay of the Solomon Islands economy, where projects have a low foreign
exchange component [see Part I - Basic Data, page (ii)].
2.   Size Distribution
10.      The DBSI had agreed that in the utilization of the Bank loan, it would
give preference to smaller enterprises. DBSI actually financed 777 subloans
(96.0 per cent) of the smallest size range (i.e. up to $5,000) totalling $0.20 million
or 24.1 per cent of the loan proceeds. Also, the average size of subloan under
the loan decreased to $1,019 from $4,337 under the first Bank loan. Thus, DBSI
has satisfactorily complied with this covenant [see Basic Data, page (ii)l.
3.   Distribution According to Other Criteria
11.      Geographically, DBSI's lending  reflects the general pattern  of
population distribution in the country and the availability of better
infrastructure. Accordingly, under the second Bank loan, Honiara had the
largest share accounting for 64.4 per cent of the total amount disbursed;



- 10 -
followed by Guadalcanal Province, 13.1 per cent; and Malaita Province, 8.3 per
cent. By number, most of the subprojects financed were in the rural areas
which accounted for 643 subprojects or 79.5 per cent of the total number of
subloans (see Basic Data, page (iii)].
12.      By purpose, most of the subloans approved under the second loan
were for new projects (70.8 per cent of loan proceeds and 92.6 per cent by
number of subloans). This indicates DBSI's support to the Government's policy
of encouraging new investments to broaden the base of the economy which is
still in the formative stage of growth rsee Basic Data, page (iii)].
13.      Subloan maturities ranged from less than one year to over 10 years
with the majority of subloans by number in the range of up to one year,.
totalling 462 subloans or 57.1 per cent. This was due to DBSI's continuing
emphasis on the micro-loan scheme 1/ introduced by the Government to channel
credit to rural areas. By amount, $0.37 million or 45.0 per cent of the amount
disbursed. were accounted by subloans with maturities of over ten years [see
Basic Dat&, page (iii)].
C.  Impl2mentation and Internal Operation of Subi_rojects
1.  Implementation Status
14.      In view of the difficulty in obtaining data fro-a such a large number
of small subloans, the Mission focused its attention on evaluating the data from
larger subloans each amounting to over $10,000 as origiially sanctioned <see
Appendix 2). These subloans numbered 22, totalling $0.57 million or 69.0 per
cent of the amount disbursed. The actual cost of these subprojects amounted'
to SI$3.9 million, which was 6.6 per cent below the estimated cost of SI$4.19
million. DBSI financed 53.1 per cent of the costs, of which 18.9 per cent was met
by the Bank loan, 15.9 per cent from IDA and 18.3 per cent from DBSI's local
currency resources,. with the balance of 46.9 per cent by sponsors. Four
subprojects incurred cost overruns, totalling SI$4,409, while 18 had savings
amounting to SI$282,417. The large- savings was attributed to the decrease in
construction costs and cost of machinery.
15.      Of' the 22 subprojects, only five had available information on project
completion. Of these five subprojects,. only one was completed ahead of the
original time schedule, while the other four subprojects experienced delays of
up to 19 months. The main reasons for the time overruns were delays in the
delivery and installation of machinery and equipment, due to procurement
problems and delays in completion of civil works attributable to the sponsor's
lack of working capital.
1/  The Micro-Loan Scheme was implemented in 1978 to enable nationals in
rural areas to obtain loans not exceeding SI$1,000 on soft terms to
purchase ite-ms like tools, wire and fishing equipment. The terms are: 4
per cent per annum flat rate, maturities of six months to five years,
including on4 year grace period,, and minimal security.



- 1lJ -
2.  Procurement
16.      The DBSI's procurement procedures conformed  to the Bank's
guidelines and practices for the South Pacific countries. DBSI had adopted
reasonable competition procedure for larger commercial and industrial subloans
which accounted for 52.8 per cent of the amount disbursed. However, by
nuv.ber of subloans, most of the procurement *ias made "off-the-shelf" which
accounted for 793 subloans or 98.0 per cent. Procurement came from various
countries, of which Australia and Japan were the major suppliers accounting for
34.3 per cent and 29.5 per cent, respectively. Details of procurement are given
in Appendix 3.
3.  Financial and Economic Performance of Subprojects
17.      The details of the financial arid economic performance of the
subprojects financed under the Bank loan are shown in Appendixes 4 and 5. Of
the 22 subprojects above $10,000, only eight subprojects had available data on
financial operations. The aggregate sales during the first and second year of
operations of these subprojects amounted to SI$2.11 million and SIS1.79 million,
respectively, compared with the projected sales of SI$1.90 million and SIS2.74
million, respectively.  There were two subprojects for which actual sales
exceeded projections in the first year of operation while there was only one
project whose second year sales exceeded estimates. In terms of profitability,
two subprojects were profitable in the first and second year, one subproject
incurred a loss in the second year, two subprojects had losses in the first year
but were profitable in the second year. The remaining two subprojects incurred-
losses in both years of operations.
18.      In view of the paucity of relevant data and the limited scope of DBST's
loan supervision (see paragraph 14) a meaningful assessment of the socio-
economic impact of the second Bank loan could not be made. However, based on
the examination of 15i subprojects with available data on employment (Appendix
5), it was disclosed that additional direct employment has been created for about
174 people, compared with the appraisal projections of 143 people, wittl an
average cost per job of SI$16,953.
4.  Current Status of SubDrojects
19.      Details on the current status of the 22 subloans are given in Appendix
6. As of 31 July 1989, seven subloans have been fully repaid while 15 subloans
were outstanding. Of the outstanding subloans, repayments on five subloans
were on schedule. The remaining ten subloans were in arrears, four were of
less than six months, three between 3-6 months and three over 6 months. This
total arrears amounted to SI$0.15 million or 8.7 per cent of the total amount
outstanding. Arrears on these subloans were caused mainly by the subprojects
poor performance due to marketing problems (e.g. stiff competition), compounded
by technical and operational problems (e.g. frequent breakdown of machinery,
sharp increases in the prices of raw material-, lack of working capital, poor
management). The Mission is of the view that DBSI should intensify its project
supervision in order to reduce the number of its arrears.

D.  Operational Performance of DBSI
1.  Organization. Manaaiement and Staffins
20.      The nine-member Board of Directors is the main policy-making and
governing body of DBSI. Its composition, which has changed several times since
DBSI's establishment, is balanced with- four private businesb,nen, four
Government officers, and the Managing Director of DBSI. The Board meets at
least once a month to deal with policy matters and to approve loans above
SI$20,000. The four members from the private sector enhance the private sector
orientation of DBSI operations.
21.      DBSI's present organization structure (see Appendix 7), which was
modified in the light of the recommendations made by the Bank's consultant
under the second Bank loan is considered appropriate for its efficient operation.
It is characterized by a separation between the Honiara Head Office and seven
operating branches. At its Head Office, three Managers: (i) Financing and
Computing, (ii) Administration and (iii) Operations, report directly to the
Managirig Director.  The seven Branch Managers report to the Operations
Manager.
22.      The current Managing Director is an expatriate who was appointed for
a three-year period, from 7 March 1988, under a European Development Fund
grant. He is an experienced banker. He is assisted by three managers, one of
which is an expatriate whose services is funded under the Australian Staffing
Assistance Scheme. He is also assisted by another expatriate in the position of
Lending Advisor, which is funded under the New Zealand Aic Program.
23.      The numbez- of expatriates has been reduced from  five during
appraisal in 1980 to three at present- This development is in line with DBSI's
localization of positions previously held by expatriates.
24.      The DBSI's staff strength has decreased from  65 staff members
(excluding the Managing Director who was a local staff), including 24 officers,
four of whom were expatriates at appraisal in 1980, to 49 (excluding the
Managing Director) including 30 officers,. two of whom are expatriates at 31
August 1989.  The- reduction in staff strength was. brought about by the-
rationalization of DBSI's operations resulting from' decreased. lending volume,.
staff resignations.and redundancies.
25.      DBSI has benefited from various overseas training courses offered by
the Bank and other international institutions. It has also conducted several in-
house training programs for its staff which is one of the conditions under the
second Bank loan. In 1987, however. DBSI's in-house training was temporarily
stopped in view of staff and cash flow constraints. In 1988, in-house training
was resumed, on a limited scale, where a one-week training course on loan
arrears controli was conducted.. At the time of the Mission's visit to DBSI, its
Lending Advisor was conducting training sessions on the use of micro-
computers for word processing and spread sheets.
26.      The technical assistance financed under the second Bar-& loan for a
critical assessment of DBSI's performance and future role and functions (see
para 6), was carried out during the last quarte- of 1986 and the corresponding



- 13 -
final report thereon was submitted in December 1986. A meeting was held
between the Government/DBSI, the Bank and consultants in May 1987 to discuss
the report. The report was subsequently finalized, taking into account matters
covered during the meeting and was resubmitted to the Government on 16 May
1988. DBSI's implementation of the consultants' recommendations, however, has
been slow.
2.   Lending Operations
27.       The DBSI's lending during 1980-1988 is given in Appendix 8 and
summarized in Table 1.   DBSI's loan approvals have fluctuated between SI$2.2
million to SI$4.5 million during 1980 through 1986; dropped sharply to SI$0.4
million in 1987 and recovered somewhat to SIS0.8 million in 1988. The level of
approvals during 1980 through 1986 was possible because of the availability of
funds, including that provided by the Bank's first and second loans and the IDA
credit. However, loan approvals dropped in 1987 because funds resources had
dwindled and liquiditWeroded because of poor loan collections. Lending in 1988
improved on account of the Government's encouragement and support to resume
active lending with the provision of additional funds through equity infusion.
The agriculture sector was the largest beneficiary of DBSI's loan approvals,
accounting for a 42.6 per cent share in the total amount of SI$24.1 million
approved during 1980-1988.

E.   Financial Performance of DBSI
28.       Details of DBSI's financial performance during  the period  1980
through 1988 are given in Appendixes 9 to 11 and are summarized in Table 2.
DBSI's financial position has somehow fluctuated during the period 1980 through
1988. Total assets increased from SI$6.2 million at the end of 1980 to SlS13.2
million at the end of 1988, recording an average annual growth rate of 10.3 per
cent. This development is attributed to the increase in loan portfolio brought
about by an expanded lending volume, which showed an average annual growth
rate of 16.3 per cent during 1980 through 1986; lending volume, however, during
1987 and the level in 1988 was substantially lower than that achieved between
1980-1986. In addition, the pcor collection performance during 1980 to 1988,
which contributed to the mounting arrears, unnecessarily increased the loan
portfolio. DBSI's total assets during 1980-1984 were lower than the projections
made during appraisal in 1980 by an average of 14.4 per cent, due to loan
disbursements being slower than anticipated. The loan portfolio accounted for
a significant portion of total assets, averaging 58.1 per cent during the period
1980-1988. The current ratio remained at a satisfactory level, averaging 6.1:1
during the period. The debt/equity ratio was 2:1 as at 31 December 1988 and
was maintained at an average of 1.9:1 during 1980-1988, which was well below



- 14 -
the ceiling of 3:1 as covenanted under the DBSI II loan. However, this ratio at
31 December 1986 was 4.6:1, thereby exceeding the zovenanted ceiling due to the
impairment in DBSI's equity as a result of substantial losses sustained during
1984 through 1986.

29M              The DBSI's operating results have been dismally disappointing in view
of its continuing losses from 1981 through 1988. The losses were attributed to
the DBSI's inflexible interest spread, constrained by the Government's dictated
interest rate structure, and substantial provisions for bad and doubtful debts
booked during the period consequent on DBSI's poor collection performance and
mounting arrears. Under the present management, however, DBSI has shown
some success in its effoi-ts to control/minimize losses through better portfolio
management, improved portfolio recoveries, and measures designed to cut costs.
During 1988 losses have been somewhat contained.
F.  Covenants
30.             There have been a number of covenants under the second Bank loan
which have not been complied with satisfactorily by DBSI (see Appendix 12).
Among these covenants are: (i) delays by DBSI in submission to the Bank of
audited annual reports beyond four months after the close of the financial year;
(ii) DBSI's omission by not consulting the Bank in respect of its review and



- 15 -
change of its interest rates on commercial and industrial loans in 1987; (iii)
DBSI's delays in the submission of a report on the execution and initial
operations of the project and qualified projects beyond six months after the
closing date of withdrawal; and (iv) DBSI's inability to prepare the manual on
accounting and internal auditing systems and training of DBSI's staff in its use.
G.  The Bank's Performance
31.      The Bank loan was declared effective on 21 May 1981. The loan was
expected to be fully committed within three years and disbursed within four
years from the date of effectiveness.  However, DBSI could not complete
commitment of the loan within the stipulated time. The loan commitment was
closed five years after the date of effectiveness, while disbursements were
closed after seven years and seven months.  The Bank allowed several
extensions on the commitment and the disbursement closing dates. The time
taken for the Bank to process a subloan was, on average, 36 days for below-
free-limit cases and 101 days for above-free-limit cases, including the time
taken to seek additional information and clarifications from  DBSI.  The
significant amount of time spent by the Bank in subloan processing was mainly
due to serious weaknesses in some appraisai reports submitted by DBSI in terms
of presentation of data on the financial, marketing and technical aspects of the
subprojects.
32.      The Bank has made adequate efforts to review DBSI's operations by
means of review missions, loan administration and other missions. The scope of
the review missions and the quality of the reports have been satisfactory.



- 16 -
III. EVALUATION
A. Loan Avpraisal
1. Distribution of Subloans
33.      As mentioned earlier, subloans -to the commerce, services and
transport sectors exceeded the appraisal forecast, while subloans to the
agriculture, rural development and natural resources sectors were below the
appraisal forecast, because of the reasons given in para 9. Likewise, the
geographic distribution of subloans, which followed the pattern of DBSI's overall
loan approvals, was mainly centered in Honiara. The concentration reflects its
relatively better infrastructure and its proximity to markets.
2. Covenants
34.      The covenants in the loan documents were generally well-conceived
and appropriate in the circumstances prevailing at the time of appraisal and
taking inko account the operational growth and maturity- of DBSI. However,
there were instances of delays in compliance, partial compliance and non-
compliance of various covenants (see para 30). The delay in DBSI's compliance
on the submission of audited annual reports was due to DBSI's internal
discussions and the delay in decisions pertaining to the prudent level of
provision for possible portfolio losses. The training of DBSI staff had been
temporarily halteid due to staff and cash flow constraints. The PCR Mission feels
that, in future, the Bank should monitor DBSI's compliance of these covenants
more closely.  The status of- these covenants should be included in DBSI's
submission to the Bank of its quarterly reports.
35.      With regard to the preparation of a report on each subproject, DBSI's
non-compliance was attributed to its limited scope of project supervision. The
PCR Mission feels that in future loans, the Bank should include a covenant
requiring DBSI to submit a project completion report within six months after the
completion of disbursements for each subloan of $10,000 equivalent and above
(see Append Y .3).
3. Quality of Appraisal
36.      The Appraisal Mission's formulation of the- project was consistent with
the Government's plans and strategies for the economic and social development
of the Solomon Islands. The criteria of preference in the financing of projects
were made within the framework of the Government's policy of encouraging the
participation of Solomon Islanders in the economic development, rural
development and processing of industrial activities.   The sectoral and
geographical distribution of subloans were considered reasonable. However, in
respect of DBSI's financial and operational projections, the Appraisal Mission's
projections,. which were based on DBSI's operational trends and financial
performance in the preceding years, were not satisfactory. This was mainly due
to DBSI's poor collection performance and mounting arrears, which resulted in
the substantial increase in the provision for bad and doubtful debts.



17 -
37.      DBSI's project supervision was not satisfactory.  There were no
written procedures for the guidance of its staff to exercise closer supervision
of projects it financed. Regular follow-up visits on projects appear to occur
only when a loan goes into arrears.
B. Implementation
38.      The implementation of the second Bank loan was not satisfactory,
considering that only $0.824 million, or 41 per cent, of the loan amount was
disbursed. The loan commitment period was extended by two years, while the
disbursement period was extended by two years and seven months due to poor
utilization. DBSI explained that the utilization of the loan was affected by a
number of factors: (i) most of the projects which were then considered were not
eligible under the Bank loan because of their limited foreign exchange
requirements; (ii) at the stage of utilization of the second Bank loan, DBSI was
in financial difficulties with its limited resources committed to advancing funds
to provide bridging finance for subprojects for which subsequent
reimbursements would be sought from the Bank; (iii) certain subproject
proposals were disqualified because of the inability of sub-borrowers to provide
adequate equity funds consistent with the exposure limits specified in DBSI's
Policy Statement; and (iv) incomplete documentation to support loan drawdown
applications. DBSI further explained that the imprest fund system did not
facilitate disbursement because of reasons cited in item (iv).
39.      The technical assistance financed under the second Bank loan led to
several recommendations. The Mission noted that some of these recommendations
are now  being implemented.  The Mission was also informed that some
recommendations may be implemented at an appropriate time in the future, while
the rest may not be implemented. In this regard, the Mission suggested that
DBSI should make a list of all recommendations categorized as: (i) under
implementation; (ii) for implementation in the future, and reasons on their
implementations being deferred; and (iii) not to be implemented, with
explanations for not being implemented. The Mission further indicated that the
completion of this requirement is essential for the Bank's assessment of further
assistance to DBSI.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AN4D RECOMMENDATIONS
40.      It is concluded that the objectives of the Second Bank loan to DBSI
have only been partially achieved. DBSI's operational and financial performance
continue to deteriorate during the period 1981-1987. However, in 1988, certain
improvements in lending operations, portfolio management, staff administration,
among others, have been noted on account of measures initiated by the new
management.  DBSI needs further rehabilitation with the Bank's technical
assistance and Government's support to upgrade its status as a viable
institution for channelling Bank funds.
41.      From the review of the utilization of the Second Bank loan and of
DBSI's operations during the period 1980-1988, the following recommendations
are made:
For the Government/DBSI
(i)  The Government should encourage DBSI to operate autonomously and
DBSI should be allowed to fix its own lending rates to cover
adequately the cost of intermediation and profit objectives.
(ii)   DBSI should improve the quality of its portfolio through better
collection performance, project rehabilitation, loan rescheduling and
arrears reduction.
(iii)   DBSI should improve its project supervision procedures by giving
particular attention to problem projects.
(iv)   DBSI should ensure that collection and compilation of data on
subprojects, in line with the formats suggested by the Bank, be given
importance.
(v)  DBSI should continue to upgrade it staff capability through on-the-
job and structured training course to enhance its role as a vehicle
for-assisting the Government in its development objectives.
(vi)  DBSI should continue its diversification of subloan approvals to a
wider spectrum of industrial activities.
For the Bank
(vii)  The Bank should consider the provision of a technical assistance to
rehabilitate DBSI, upgrade its staff capabilities in project
appraisal/supervision and improve its management information system.
(viii)   The Bank should include in future Bank loans, a covenant requiring
DBSI to submit a project completion report of projects above-free-
limit financed by Bank funds within six months after compietion of
disbursement of such project. Likewise, DBSI's collection targets and
debt-servicing cove-rage ratio should also be covenanted.
(ix)   The Bank should continue to closely monitor DBSI's progress of loan
collection and arrears.

TO IMPROVE OUR PERFORMANCE IN ALL AREAS OF THE BANK'S LENDING
ACTIVITIES. DUE TO THE BANK'S SUBSTANTIAL ARREARS PROBLEMS UITH
MANY HARDCORE ACCOUNTS7 EFFECTIVE ARREARS REDUCTIONS HAVE NOT
PEEN EASY BUT WE ARE SLOWLY MAKING INROADS IN REDUCING ARREARS
TO A REASONABLE LEVEL BY LEGAL RECOVERY MEASURES OR THROUGH
WiITE OFFS IF ALL AVENUES OF RECOVERIES HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED.
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR LENDING ADVISOR THE BANK HAS
COMPLETED A LOANS MANUAL AND AN INTERNAL TRAINING PROGRAMME
IS UNDERWAY ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE LOANS MANUAL STARTING WITH
HEAD OFFICE STAFF TO BE FOLLOWElD BY BRANCH STSTAFF.
THE BANK HAS BEEN ACTIVELY IMPLEMENTING THE FINDINGS AND            Reflected in a

HOWEVER7 THIS REQUIREMENT WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 1989 AND.
A COPY WAS FORWARDED TO ADB.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE
REPORT RECOMMENDED THAT ADB PROVIDES A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE TO DBSI BUT TO DATE NOTHING HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING.

DIVISION CHIEF, POLICY-BASEDE' ENriDING

RE: UfiR RAFT PCR ON ObSI YDOJECT
THANKS FOR YOUR LETTER OF 13 JULY 1990. T'IR COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT PCR
ENCLOSED IN THE LETTER, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON IDA'S EVALUATI?N
SUMMARY (ES), FOLLOW.
'1) WE DO NOT AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT IN PARA. 13 OF ES THAT THE
INTEREST STRUCTURE ASSUMED FOR DBSI AT THE TIME OF APPRAISAL STRC!IGLY   .;  1) @
INDIGATED THAT DBSI WAS DESTINED TO FAIL AS A FINANCIALLY VIABLE DFI.                 . be_
THIS IS PROBABLY OVERSTATING THE CASE. THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF DPSI                  to
Reflect hl
IS THE PRODUCT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. TO FOCUS ON INTEREST RATES WOULD         abomo a
B TO ATTACH UNDUE IMPORTANCE TO ONE FACTOR. WHAT WOULD HAVE PEEN
USEFUL IS THAT DBSI SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED BYSIG TO HAVE THE
FLEXIBILITY TO FIX ITS OWN LENDING RATES TO COVER ADEQUATELY THE COST
OF INTERMEDIATION AND PROFIT OBJECTIVES, A POINT MADE IN OUR PCR.
(2) WE AGREE WITH THE OBSERVATIONS IN PARA. 10 OF ES AS TO THE
OTHER FACTORS THAT HAVE CON4TRIUTED TO DBSI'S PRESENT UNSATISFACTORY
CONDITION. THESE FACTORS WERE EXACTLY THOSE GIVEN IN PRICE
WATERHOUSE'S MAY 1988 REPORT ON AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF DBSI DONE
AS PART OF THE PROJECT.
(3) WITH REGARD TO LESSONS LEARNED (PARA. 14 OF ES), WE SUPPORT
THE CONCLUSION THAT UITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR APPRAISING
DBSI-TYPE LENDING OPERATIONS, THE PROJECTS FOR DEVELOPING AND
PROMOTING FINANCIALLY VIABLE, SUSTAINABLE LENDING INSTITUTIONS ARE
NOT ENCOURAGING. NEVERTHELESS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DFIS. DESPITE THE
LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE ON THE MAJORITY OF THEM UITN ONE EXCEPTION
(TDB), REMAIN SUITABLE INTERMEDIARIES FOR CHANNELING DEVELOPMENT
FINANCE UNDER A REGIME OF CLOSE AND CONTINUOUS SUPERVISION. WE TRY 'O
DO THIS BY ENSURING OUR CREDIT LINES ARE PRECEDED AND/OR ACOMPANIED
BY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING. ANOTHER
AVENUE WE ARE EXPLORING IS THE POSSIBILITY OF USING COMMERCIAL
BANKS IN SPDMCS AS INTERMEDIARIES.
