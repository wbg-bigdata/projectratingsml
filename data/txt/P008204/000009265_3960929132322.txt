MEMORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA
FOR A SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Venezuela for US$100.0 million equivalent is submitted for your
approval. The loan would be repayable over a period of 15 years, including
five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. It would
help finance a social development project, covering selected investments in
health, education and nutrition, within the framework of the government's
medium-term social sectors development and poverty alleviation strategy.
2.    Background.  Even though Venezuela's income per capita is above $3,200,
there is significant poverty, and, overall, living conditions have
deterior&ted over the last decade: indeed, from 1978 to 1988, per capita GDP
fell every year. Recent estimates indicate that the proportion of families
living in extreme poverty (households whose income is below the amount
required to cover minimum per capita food requirements) increased from 10.3 to
22.3 percent between 1982 and 1989. Standard social indicators are poor when
compared to other middle-income Latin American countries, with the infant
mortality rate (36 per 1000), annual population growth rate (2.7 percent) and
child death rate (five per 1000) comparatively high; while access to health
(73 percent of the population), and net secondary school enrollment (38
percent) remain comparatively low. In education, the primary school
attendance rate fell from 94 to 91 percent, and the proportion of a given
cohort reaching the sixth grade declined from 64 to 58 percent between 1978
and 1985. The proportion of malnourished children rose from 14 to 15.3
percent between 1982 and 1989; and the proportion of the population with
caloric deficiency rose from seven to 23 percent over the same period.
Substantial resources have been spent on the social sectors in recent years;
total public expenditure on education and health has averaged about 8 percent
of GDP, and 30 percent of central government expenditures. Deteriorating
social indicators, in the face of large resource allocation to the social
sectors, force the conclusion that programs have been poorly targeted and
*        inefficiently administered.
3.    The institutional organization of the social sectors is complex.  The
*        Central Planning Office (CORDIPLAN) prepares the country's five-year
development plans. The Ministry of the Family (MINFAM) chairs the
Presidential Commission for Poverty Alleviation (COPEP), and has overall
responsibility for formulating, coordinating, and monitoring social
development policies, which are implemented by various public and private
agencies and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). The Ministry of Education
(MOE) is responsible for planning and budgeting for the education sector and
for overseeing both public and private educational institutions. The private
sector has a significant involvement at all levels of education, covering 16
percent of pre-school enrollments, 12 percent of primary enrollments, 22
percent of secondary enrollments, and 19 percent of higher education
enrollments. The major public institutions in the health sector are the



- 2 -
Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Venezuelan Social Security Institute (IVSS),
although health care services are also provided by a large number of other
public and private institutions. The MOH is responsible for coordinating the
activities of the different institutions involved. The Government of
Venezuela (GOV) has had no experience with Bank projects since 1974, and
public sector agencies have a shortage of experienced staff to design and
implement foreign-financed projects.
4.    Within the GOV's economic program started in early 1989, the reshaped
policy for the social sectors is explicitly focused on poverty alleviation,
and has been designed to protect the poorest and most -i lnerable groups
(pregnant and lactating women, infants, and children under six years old) from
the recessionary effects of adjustment, with emphasis on health, nutrition and
education. Social policy in Venezuela represents a radical departure from the
past, when it relied heavily on untargeted programs such as general food
subsidies. By 1988, the GOV was spending about US$400 million annually on
food subsidies alone (two percent of GDP). General food subsidies have been
eliminated under the adjustment program, and will be used to finance targeted
social programs, such as nutritional programs for mothers and infants,
community day-care centers for poor children, and nutritional grants for
primary school children from poor areas. The GOV's efforts to increase the
effectiveness of social programs include improving the capacity of public
institutions to design, implement and monitor social programs, and
incorporating private sector delivery of some services.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Bank strategy aims to support the GOV's
efforts to shift the economy from one based on the consumption of oil rents to
one based on growth in productive activities, focusing on four main areas: (a)
reform of basic economic policies; (b) reduction of the external debt
overhang; (c) improvement of the efficiency and strengthening of the
institutional capacity of the public sector; and (d) development of the
physical and social infrastructure. Despite the recent oil-price increases,
the proposed operation continues to be of high priority, since: (a) it would
assist the GOV in sustaining appropriate targeting of social expenditures to
poor and vulnerable groups at a time when such targeting could be put at risk;
(b) the price increases are expected to be temporary; and (c) the GOV is
setting up a fund to save a major part of the windfall and to smooth out GOV
expenditures over time. In support of the adjustment process, the Bank's
strategy for the social sectors in Venezuela aims initially to assist the GOV
in its poverty alleviation efforts by expanding coverage of targeted social
programs, while improving institutional capacity and the efficiency and equity
of such programs. In the longer term, this strategy would encompass essential
decentralization of responsibilities for program implementation, and
establishment of managerial information and monitoring systems for decision-
makers; and would continue to focus on improved allocation of resources within
sectoral expenditure programs. The FY89 report on Public Policy Options for
Venezuela identified the main social issues that are being addressed by the
proposed project. Further recommendations for sectoral reforms will emerge
from ongoing sector work on poverty, public sector investment and the health
sector, and planned work on the education sector. The results of this work
will be reflected in future lending operations in health and education. The
Bank, under the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL), has provided technical



assistance to assist in the design of the new social programs. The proposed
project would support the first stage of implementation of selected social
programs of high priority. The Technical Assistance for Preinvestment Loan,
which has recently been approved, has been designed to strengthen the GOV's
capacity to select, prepare and implement sound investment projects (including
health and education) suitable for Bank financing over the next five years.
6.    Project Obiectives.  The objective of the proposed project is to assist
the GOV in developing a social sector strategy to redirect its social
expenditures into well-targeted and efficient programs, by financing high
priority activities, within the framework of the Social Sectors Action Program
(para. 8). It aims to: (a) improve basic health, nutrition and education
services for a large and poor segment of the population, especially pregnant
and lactating women and children under six years of age, while mitigating the
potential adverse impact of the adjustment program; (b) replace indirect
subsidies with targeted social programs, while improving their efficiency and
rationalizing their distribution; and (c) promote institutional development by
improving the planning and management capacity in the MOH and MOE, as well as
the capacity to target, develop and monitor social programs in the MINFAM.
7.    Proiect Descrittion.  The proposed project has four components: (a)
rehabilitation and development of the primary health-care network, including
provision of basic health and nutrition services for pregnant and nursing
women and children under six years of age (76 percent of total project costs);
(b) development and expansion of pre-school education, focused on the lowest-
income urban and rural areas (17 percent of total project costs); (c)
information, education and communications services for health, nutrition and
education promotion (five percent of total project costs); and (d) improvement
of the GOV's capacity to design, plan, and implement social programs and to
monitor the effect of such programs (two percent of total project costs).  A
technical coordinating office attached to the MINFAM would liaise with the
implementing agencies on project planning, budgeting, and implementation.
Autonomous agencies attached to the MOE and MOH would assist with day to day
administration of the project; technical supervision would be carried out by
regular ministry staff. Special attention would be given to strengthening
implementation and coordination capacity in the various institutions involved.
8.    The GOV has also drawn up a set of policies and actions to be
undertaken, which, together with the project components to be financed, would
support implementation of the strategy described above. These policies and
actions are ir the GOV's Social Sectors Action Program and would: (a) extend
the GOV's commitment to agreements reached under the SAL for the new social
programs--nutritional grants, primary health care, school feeding, and
community day care--by expanding coverage, setting annual targets, and
evaluating progress in their implementation; (b) increase the relative
budgetary share of the first two levels of health-care delivery out of the MOH
budget from 33 percent in 1990 to 40 percent in 1992 by, inter alia, improving
efficiency in public hospitals through reform of management and financial
policies; (c) expand pre-school coverage, by providing government funding only
for the poorest urban and rural areas, while expansion in middle-income and
upper-income districts would be undertaken exclusively by the private sector;
(d) encourage community and NGO participation in pre-school construction,



- 4 -
repairs, and operations; (e) design and implement a benefit package to attract
and retain adequate staff for the provision of primary health care; (f)
conduct periodic surveys to monitor the impact of social programs; (g) improve
the quality of record keeping and reporting at the local level; and (h) carry
out annual reviews with the Bank focused on social pulicy and program
implementation, and on budget proposals for social programs.
9.    The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$320.9 million,
excluding taxes and duties, of which US$99.7 million is expected to be in
foreign exchange. Cost estimates and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. The timetable of key events of project processing is
summarized in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations in Venezuela is
shown in Schedule D. A map of Venezuela is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 8941-VE, dated October 30, 1990 is also attached.
10.   Actions Agreed.  During appraisal, the proposed project management
structures and implementation arrangements were discussed and agreed,
including the organization and staffing plan for the project units. A review
of country procurement practices has been completed. Evidence has been
provided that managers for the project management units attached to the
MINFAM, MOH, and MOE have been appointed. At negotiations, the GOV: (a)
confirmed agreement to carry out the monitorable and dated plans in the Social
Sectors Action Program (para. 8); (b) agreed to undertake joint annual reviews
(covering both the previous and forthcoming years) of the implementation of
i.hoe policies and actions in the Social Sectors Action Program, including
project components and sectoral expenditures; (c) agreed that, if a situation
arises which makes it improbable that the Social Sectors Action Program (or a
sig.nificant portion) will be carried out, the Bank would be entitled to
suspend loan disbursements, either partially or totally; (d) agreed that the
financing by the Bank of incremental recurrent expenditures would be on a
declining basis; (e) confirmed terms of reference for studies; as well as
training and staffing plans; (f) submitted updated lists for equipment
procurement; and (g) provided evidence that sites for all civil works for the
first 24 months of the proposed project are ready and available for building.
The GOV has sent a letter to the Bank confirming the Social Sectors Action
Program agreed during negotiations. As conditions of effectiveness, the GOV
would provide evidence that key staff for the project implementation units has
been appointed; that appropriate arrangements for the carrying out of the
respective components of the project, including transfer of funds, have been
completed with the applicable foundations; and agree on model bidding
documents to be used for the procurement of goods (LCB and ICB) and works
(LCB). As conditions of disbursement for co-production activities with media
organizations, evidence of satisfactory contractual arrangements for securing
the corresponding rights would be provided to the Bank.
11.   Benefits and Risks.  The proposed project would help cushion the
negative effects of adjustment for the most vulnerable groups, while at the
same time improving the efficiency of resource use and the capacity to design,
implement and monitor social programs. It would have direct benefits on the
nutritional status of pregnant and lactating women, infants, and pre-school
children, and would provide improved associated services such as pre-school



- 5 -
education and primary health care. It supports the current govei.rment's
strong commitment to poverty alleviation. By 1995, the proposed project
would: increase health and nutrition service coverage from 200,000 to 420,000
pregnant women for pre-natal care, from 80,000 to 360,000 women for post-natal
care, from 245,000 to 640,000 infants under two years old for preventive
health care, and from 370,000 to 916,000 children between two and six years of
age for preventive health care; conduct information, education, and
communications activities for health promotion, through the use of mass media
campaigns and community participation; expand coverage of formal and informal
preschool education by about 116,000 children from poor and disadvantaged
families; improve administrative registers for health and education; establish
a management information system for the social sectors; and conduct periodic
household surveys to monitor the impact of social programs.
12.   The project would benefit women, especially poor women, in Venezuela.
*        Towards project completion, about 400,000 pregnant and 360,000 lactating women
(about 50 percent of pregnant and lactating women) would have access to
primary health care and nutrition services. This includes not only pre-natal
and post-natal care, but also food distribution, nutritional counseling,
health education, medical services for women's reproductive care, early
cervical and breast cancer detection, and family planning. In addition, the
expansion of the community day-care centers and pre-school system in the poor
and marginal areas would not only give girls from poor families better
opportunities for improved school achievement, after an adequate head start,
but would also allow women to pursue additional opportunities for productive
employment.
13.   The main risk derives from the lack of experience of the GOV in
preparing and executing projects of the rigor required for external financing.
The implementing ministries do not have project staff familiar with
international procurement or Bank guidelines. Since this would be the first
Bank investment project in Venezuela after a long hiatus, domestic
implementation capacity needs to be strengthened. The project would provide
technical assistance and training for this purpose. A country assessment of
local procurement practices has been completed, and a procurement seminar
would be conducted for project staff. The Bank would need to provide strong
support during project preparation and implementation. Frequent and intense
supervision would be undertaken. A project launch workshop to cover
implementation aspects such as Bank procedures, procurement, and disbursement
mechanisms, would be scheduled to take place soon after loan effectiveness.
14.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan of US$100.0
million would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
