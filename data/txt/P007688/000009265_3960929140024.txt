FOR THE DTSAIVANTAGED STATF-S
1. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
BoffQwer:     Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN)
Guaraator:    United Mexican States
Egecutillg  Secretariat of Planning and Budgeting (SPP), other Federal Entities, the Project
Ager1gy:      States of Chiapas, Guerrero, Hidalgo and Oaxaca, and Participating Municipalities.
Amount:       US$35G million equivalent
Tenns:        Seventeen y!ars, including five-year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate.
Beneficiarigs:  Target groups in rural poverty areas and groups of producers (about five million
persons) in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, Hidalgo, and Oaxaca. Public works under
the project would generate about 230,000 man-years of employment in the four states.
PuMogse.      To contribute to the reduction of poverty in Mexico's four most disadvantaged states,
through a program of decentralization and regional development; complementary loan
components include environmental preservation and the protection of archeological sites.
Backgund:   Of the 21 million people living below the poverty line in Mexico, two-thirds live in
rural areas. About one-third of Mexico's poor (seven million persons) inhabit Chiapas,
Guerrero, Hidalgo and Oaxaca. The poor constitute about 65 percent of the population
of these states. The four states have large disadvantaged Indian populations, and a
concentration of poverty among women and children. While poverty in these areas has
longstanding structural roots, it has worsened during Mexico's economic crisis
beginning in 1982. Between 1982 and 1988, public investment declined by about 60
percent. Cuts in rural, regional and social sectors were even deeper, reaching about
70 percent and leading to the collapse of poverty reduction programs in the four target
states. The reduction of investment contributed to a decline of about 20 percent in rural
real incomes between 1983 and 1988.
Past Government policies have hampered the economic and social development of the
four states: (a) exchange rate, trade and pricing policies have had an anti-agricultural
bias; (b) public expenditures on social services have favored the better-off states; (c)
despite the remoteness and dispersion of many settlements, infrastructure investments
have been less than the national per capita averages; (d) the excessively centralized
administrative, financial, and fiscal systems have not allocated resources efficiently to
the very heterogeneous and peripheral regions of the states; and (e) agricultural services
(research, extension, marketing) have been underfunded and poorly developed. Current
Government strategy and the proposed project are directed at redressing some of these
past policies.
Project       The principal objective of the project is to increase the access of poor and indigenous
Djcription:   populations in the four poorest states of Mexico to basic infrastructure, social services,
larger markets, and agricultural technologies. The specific project objectives are: (a) to



2 -
assist the states in developing, executing and financing investment programs with a
strong poverty adleviation focus, (b) to assist the Federal and State planning and
budgeting ministries in making their project selection, environmental assessment, and
monitoring and evaluation functions more efficient and the financing more flexible; and
(c) to strengthen the decentralized state and municipal institutions to identify, prepare,
build, operate, and maintain the investments in a more participatory manner.
Environmental preservation and the protection of archeological sites are complementary
project objectives.
T'e project has three components: (a) investment; (b) environmental and archeological
site protection; and (c) institutional development.
The inykmmne  component would finance a US$1.3 billion invement program in the
four target states. 'he Bank loan would allocate US$274 million to finance 50 percent
of the cost of projects in the core investment program. About 46 percent of the
program would be for infrastructure projects (rural roads and rural electrification), 30
percent for productive projects (agriculture, forestry and agroindustries), and 24 percent
for social projects (education, water supply and sewerage systems). Projects will be
selected on the basis of their targeting of the poor, technical feasibility, benefits relative
to costs, and beneficiary contribution and commitnent to operation and maint3nance.
The environmental preservation and archeological protection component of the project
would: (a) finance 100 percent of the eligible costs (US$43 million) of a program (the
Lacandona Protection Plan) which would protect the last remaining humid forest area in
Mexico; (b) strengthen the institutional capacity of federal offices, state agencies, and
municipalities in order to improve project assessment techniques and environmental
policy implementation; and (c) finance the restoration of selected archeological sites.
The institutional development component would allocate US$18 million of loan funds to
finance 100 percent of eligible costs for strengthening: (a) project executing agencies
(mainly in the agricultural and roads sectors); (b) state and municipal planning and
budgeting systems; and (c) the state and municipal entities to assume additional
administrative functions that they have and will be receiving under the Government's
program of decentralization.
US$15 million of loan funds are as yet unallocated and will be available for filture
allocation among the three components described above. The project provides funds for
civil works and materials; furniture and equipment; training, studies, and technical
assistance. Tne total cost of the project is esdmated at US$1,363 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$425 million (31 percent). Retroactive
financing of up to US$35 million for expenditures incurred after May 1, 1990 will be
made available. -A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
The loan would be made to the Government financial agent, Nacional Financiera
(NAFIN), and executed by the Secretariat of Programming and Budgeting (SPP), other
FeJeral Entities, the Project States, and Participating Municipalities. Loan fimds would
be passed on as grants and would only be available for investment costs and technical
assistance, but not for recurrent costs or credit. The project would be implemented over
a five-year period.
B             The proposed project would help decrease by an estimated 40 percent the gap in
and Risks:    access to roads, schools and other basic social goods of the populations in the four
poorest states, as well as improve economic opportunities to the mostly indigenous rural
populations. Public works generated by the project are estimated at about 230Q000 man-



3 -
years. Possible risks arise from the fact that some states and municipalities have
relatively weak administrative suctres, and that their geography and social
composition are quite varied. Environmental risks are important in some areas with
fragile systems. Investment decisions may be subject to political influences, and money
could be misappropriated. To mitigate these risks, the project emphasizes strengthening
existing safeguards and building new ones into subproject selection, monitoring,
evaluation, and audit. Decentralization would be carefully paced. The regional
development mechanism used in the project is the development agreement between the
Federal Government and each state called the Convenio Unico de Desarrollo (CUD),
which has been improved over many years and is designed tn solve interagency conflicts
in the design and execution of the investment programs. Institution building components
and technical assistance would strengthen administrative and implementation capacities
of the states and municipalities as they receive additional functions and revenmes. The
environmental component would strengthen environmental proetion capability at the
state level.

HI. REGIONAL AND RURAL DEVElOPMENTF PQO1U
*            ~~~~A. Intrgductign
2.01         Between 1950 and 1974, Mexico enjoyed a remarkable period of high growth, low
inflation and moderate external debt accumulation. Real growth averaged 6.4 percent, while the
poverty rate (percentage of households below the poverty line) declined by 15-20 percentage points.
The discovery of large oil reserves led to a public expenditure boom financed largely with external
debt. The Government's share in total value added increased by almost one-third, the real exchange
.ate appreciated, and Mexico's external debt increased from USS16 billion to USS86 billion between
1975 and 1982.
2.02         The situation changed dramatically in 1982 when rising world interest rates and falling
oil prices put an end to Mexico's expansionary policies. The gap between the real interest rates on
external debt and real GDP growth went from -6.3 percent in 1980-1981 to a full + 10.5 percent in
1983. A stabilization program reduced the fiscal deficit by one-half, international reserves were
rebuilt, and the underlying rate of inflation reduced. However, the earthquake in late 1985 and
continuing deterioration in the terms of trade led the authorities to Introduce a major adjusmnent and
stabilLation program centered upon trade liberalization and strong fiscal retrenchment.
2.03         A restrictive demand management policy reduced inflation significantly, but public
investment was strongly curtailed (from 10 percent of GDP in 1982 to 4.4 percent in 1988) and real
minimum wages fell by one-half. There was no cumulative real growth between 1982 and 1988,
leading to a severe decline in per capita income, and rough estimates indicate that there was no
further improvement in the poverty rate.
2.04         In March 1990, as the first case in debt reduction of the Brady initiative, Mexico and
its commercial creditors implemented an agreement to restructure USS52.7 billion of Mexico's
external debt that reduced the stock of debt by an estimated 30 percent. In Febmary 1990, the
restructuring of the agricultural financial system led to a cut in annual losses of as much as US$1.5
billion, while significantly reducing subsidies to poor farmers. Deregulation and privatization also
improved the efficiency of ,.a economy. Through a series of social contracts with labor and
entrepreneurs, complemented by anchoring the nominal exchange rate, inflation was kept under
control; but the use of price controls led to deterioration in the terms of trade to farmers. Then, in
May 1990, the Govermnent increased energy prices, removed some price controls, and announced
that negotiations on a bilateral free trade agreement with the United States were being accelerated.
2.05         Stabilization has been successful, with real interest rates dropping from 30 percent in
1987 to about 12 percent most recently. But economic growth slowed somewhat to a two percent
annual rate in 1990, reflecting the tightening of aggregate demand mwgement policies. With an
increasing primary fiscal surplus, the Government announced that more emphasis would be given to
social policies. In fact, throughout the adjustnent period, there was a substantial deterioration in
social conditions. Real per capita expenditures in the social sectors were cut by about 7 percent per
year, and public investment in rural and regional development dropped by 80 percent to 90 percent in
the last decade. Real incomes in rural areas declined about 20 percent between 1983-1988 from
levels that were already low.



1. Pove~rtvJn ae_ 1a ynmc
2.06         About 21 million people live below the poverty line in Mexico (currently US$925
equivalent annual household income in urban areas and US$830 oiv4   in rural areas). About
two-thirds of the poor live in rural areas; about one-third live in the four project states-Chiapas,
Guerrero, Hidalgo, and Oaxaca. The Bank's poverty and regional/rural development studies have
found that poverty in these states is structural, but the situation of the poor has been exacerbatot by
the economic crisis, particularly by the fall in real wages, the decrease in infrastructure and social
investnents, the increase in prices of agricultural inputs, and control of prices of some agricultural
outputs. Estimates show a decrease of real income between 9 percent and 16 percent due to the fiscal
retrenchment and external terms of trade deterioration.
2.07         Sixty-five percent of the population of the four states (about 10.3 million persons) fill
below the poverty line (below one minimum wage). Many lack access to high-quality agicultural
resources, and even where agricultural resources are good, productivity is low. Agricitural
endowments vary widely among and within the states. Lack of education also correlates strongly with
poverty; in rural areas completion rates for primary schooling are only about 30 percent. Settlements
are widely scattered and are often poorly served by roads. Communications are generally poor.
2.08         Indigenous populations predominate in poor regions and their cultures are very
diverse. Oaxaca has over one million Indians speaking more than a dozen native languages. Indians
live in the most adverse microclimatic regions and agroecological zones. Linguistic, cultural, and
ecological diversity also characterize Chiapas, Guerrero, and Hidalgo; together the four project states
have nearly 40 percent of the indigenous population of Mexico. The higher cost of providing social
and infrastructure services to the indigenous communities has put these states at a disadvantage. The
Bank project would improve aceess to services by targeting a major share of the investment to poorly
served areas. It would also strengthen institutional mechanisms to give indigenous persons better
access to public resources.
2. The Role of a Regional Investment Program in an Overall Strateg
of Poverty Alleviation
2.09         As elements of a poverty alleviation strategy, trade reform and agricultural policy
reform (supported by earlier trade policy loans and by the First Agricultural Sector Adjustment
Loan - AGSAL 1) are rapidly reducing urban bias. Financial Sector Reform (supported by the
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan - FSAL) and tax reform have virtually eliminated the subsidy of
capital-intensive production. Together, these reforms will increase urban and rural employment.
Second, equal access among states and microregions to basic social and productive infrastructure is
being pursued through this project. Third, the poorest individuals will be targeted directly by
enhanced primary health care (supported by the primary health project), and improved nutrition and
food subsidy programs (to be supported by AGSAL II).
2.10         Regional investment programs and targeted health, nutrition, and food subsidy
programs are not exclusive but complementary. Within the World Bank program, these
complimentarities will be exploited by including the four poorest states not only in this project but
also in the recently approved Basic Health Care Project, the proposed Primary Education Project, and
the pilot Nutrition Program to be supported by AGSAL II.

3. Why Focus out the Four Poprest States?
2.11         The Goverunen's investments in poverty alleviation under the National Solidarity
Progran. (PNS)' are not confined to these four states, but their choice reflects the desire of the
Mexican Government to provide special financial and technial support to these particularly poor and
administratively underdeveloped states.
2.12         Why concentrate effort on the poverty states? Why not concentrate investments at
growth poles and other areas of high economic potential and wait for economic de Jlopment and out-
migration to take care of the poverty regions? Mexico pursued such a strategy between 1950 and
1988, but the high national economic growth rates of that period did litde to alleviate the poverty of
many rural people.
2.13         Despite rapid outmigration, high population growth rates have persisted in the
marginal areas, and population will continue to increase in absolute numbers. During the last two
decades, with extreme urban bias in agricultural policies and social programs, the rural population of
the four states rose at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent. These growing populations must be given
access to basic social services where they live.
2.14         According to early 1980s da ., about half the population in these four states lacks a
primary education; about a third of primary school leavers have no access to secondary schooling.
Preschool mortality rates are three to four times higher than in better-off states. At least 40 percent
of the population lacks communications and 60 percent to 70 percent lacks acceptable housing. In the
richer states, only 5 percent to 10 percent of the population lives under such conditions. By
emphasizing social and infrastructure investments, the project would contribute significantly to the
improvement of these indicators.
2.15         Regional development policy will continue developing growth poles for
industrialization and for 'deconcent.-ation" of the largest congested cities. Growth poles are likely to
be located in major urban centers and in the northern regions. Migration from the poorest states to
those areas will help reduce poverty in the disadvantaged states. But unless those who leave have
acQuired human capital at home, they will swell the number of illiterate and menial workers in the
capital and in the north. The educational system must be able to provide that human capital. Health,
education, and nutrition are the foundations for human capital whether the workers remain in their
home regions or migrate for job opportunities.
2.16         While social services and the accompanying infrastructure should be provided on an
equity basis, productive investments will have to be concentrated in areas with a high potential for
economic success and a comparative advantage, e.g., agriculture and forestry, mining, tourism, and
cottage industry. This, of course, applies to potential growth poles within the four states. In some
disadvantaged ecological zones, where the ec3nomic potential is severely limited, it makes little sense
to force investments beyond the few high payoff opportnities that almost always exis4.. - Projects that
do not produce a sufficiendy high return cannot alleviate poverty and are quicldy abandoned by their
beneficiaries after the initial phase of investment. Selection criteria for production-oriented
investment projects will therefore screen out projects below a minimum level of efficiency.

4. Decentralization
2.17           Decentralization is an instrument for improving efficiency in project identification and
operation. An integrated strategy cannot be effectively coordinated in such wide and diversified
regions unless the populations are given control of their own resources to solve local problems. Some
functions, like technical norms and accountability, have to be exercised at the federal level. Others,
like expenditure control for statewide health and education, should be the responsibility of state
governments. Still others, like maintenance of local primary schools or rural roads, are better
performed by municipalities or local communities, provided that these are above the minimum size
necessary to conduct these funotions.
2.18           Mexico is a federation of 32 states with about 3,000 municipalities. The sweeping
constitutional reform of 1983 gave municipalities responsibility for administering water supply and
sewer systems, public lighting, municipal markets, security, streets, cemeteries, public gardens, and
slaughterhouses.' While some institutionally stronger municipalities have assumed all these
responsibilities, others are not yet capable of doing so (see Annex 10). The project, through its
institutional development component, would enable significantly more municipalities to assume those
functions. For the remainder, state agencies would have to continue providing these services, or
communities would have to continue to forego them.
2.19           In the last seven years, important steps have been taken toward administrative
decentralization. A decentralized planning system has been adopted, one that would be the backbone
of the present project (see paras. 2.38 to 2.45). In addition to state planning agencies, a development
committee (COPLADE), headed by the state governor, has been created for each state to coordinate
planning by state and federal line agencies. These COPLADEs effectively control the CUDs between
the central government and each state. Although the execution of the majority of large projects is still
the responsibility of the federal line agencies, through the Programa Normal,3 the Government hopes
to accelerate the process of transferring responsibility for projects with local or state impact from the
Programa Normal to the CUD.
2.20           Decentralization of health services is already under way in about 12 states. It has
been completed successfully in Guerrero and has significantly improved the primary health care
system.' Decentralization of education began last year and is an explicit objective of the Programa
de Modernizacion Educativa of the present administration. Construction and maintenance of state
(feeder) roads is now undertaken by state agencies, as is most of the construction and rehabilitation of
rural roads. States and municipalities are assuming ever-increasing responsibilities in mainenance of
infrastructure due to the financial retrenchmnent of the central government. The proiect would help
rationalize and accelerate administrative decentralization, concentrating on the priority sectors:
agriculture extension services and rural roads.
2.21           Federal officials are sometimes reluctant to transfer functions to their state
counterparts because their administrative capacity is weak, but the latter cannot mature except through

experience. To break this stalemate. the project includes dentralization timetables and a major
institutional development component to assist the four states in acquiring the necessary capacity.
2.22          Expenditure control. In federated industrialized countries, state and local
governments usually control 45 percent to 65 percent of public expenditures, but in Mexico they
control only 20 percent. In th, four poorest states, the federal and/or autonomous nationwide
agencies control about 80 percent of current expenditures, while the states control about 1S percent
and municipalities five percent; 75 percent of the investment trogram remained under central
government control in 1988. In 1989 investments through the CUDs increased to about half of the
federally funded investment. Moreover, a significant share of central government investment is being
coordinated with state governments (in the four states, approximately two-thirds). The C;overnment
expects to continue shifting control of public investment to the state and municipal go imunents.
2.23          Revenue raising. For efficient administration, states and municipalities should
mobilize sufficient local resources to cover their expenditures. nTat is not the case for Mexico
where, since the 1980 fiscal reform, states and municipalities have had little tax authority. The poor
states remain dependent on federal grants for about 70 percent to 90 percent of their total budgets.!
Most resources come through the revenue-sharing system as block grants. While the Salinas
government is giving top priority to improving tax administration, it does not plan to transfer
significant revenue authority to the states in the near future. States and municipalities have started to
increase collections from the few local taxes they do control, e.g., property taxes and water charges,
and will continue to do so (see Annex 3). However, the potential to generate revenues from these
sources is very limited. The reform of the revenue-sharing formula introduced in 1990 would
increase substantially the block grant available to finance the state share of investmnents and recurrent
expenditures for social services in these states. In addition. when functions are decentralized, the
transfer of additional resources has to be effecte through selective block giants specified in the
s      e    , as it was implemented in the health sector.
S. Equity in Access to Public Resources
2.24          Public resources are not allocated equitably across states and municipalities. Until
January 1990, the formula for reenue sharing (block grants) among states had no equity elements
and merely reflected revenues from the former state sales tax (replaced in 1980 by the federal Value
Added Tax). As a result, the Federal District and the State of Mexico, with 25 percent of the
population of the country, received 36 percent of the Fondos de Participacion, while the four poorest
states, with 12 percent of the population, received only seven percent.
2.25          In addition, most current ex2enditures in the states (about half of regionalized state
expenditures are channeled through the Programa Normal), are skewed toward the better-off
jurisdictions.
2.26          Finally, er caita pubic investment is highly inequitable. Of the total regionalized
public investment, the four project states received only 4.8 percent. In the 1985-88 period, Mexico
invested, on average, only US$77 per capita/per year in the four states, compared with US$118 per
capita nationally. However, the Salinas government's new emphasis on equity and poverty alleviation
is changing the distribution pattern. Revision of the revenue-sharing system, introduced in November
5.    In the poores jurisdictions that dependence is as high as 95 percent.



-9-
19E9, will increase the share for the poorest states by 20 percent to 30 percent in the next five years.
Investment funds for the poorest swes are now growing faster than the average increase in the
country.
-                    B. InaQrporating LessoN from Experielne
2.27         Mexico has long and wide-ranging experience with rural and regional development
programs. Bank assistance in rural and regional development began in 1975 with the first Integrated
Rural Development (PIDER) project. Two additional PIDER projects and the more agriculturally-
oriented National Assistance Plan for Rainfed Areas (PLANAT) and Program for the Development of
Humid Tropics (PRODERITH) projects provided additional experience. These projects fostered
improvements in administrative structures, mechanisms, and procedures at the federal, state, and
municipal levels that today are the backbone of federal-state investment planning and financing. For
example, the original PIDER operating manual has been continuously revised and updated. A cadre
of development professionals and administrators have lived through successful and unsuccessful
programs and have worked at the field level, as administrators of the projects and programs and as
evaluators. At the close of the PIDER III project in 1988, Mexico and the Bank conducted in-depth
reviews of this entire experience. Mexico surveyed PIDER MI subprojects (the survey of the National
Institute of Statistics, Geography and Information - INEGI) and commissioned a strategy report
(Estrategias para Areas MarLinadas v su Instrumentacion . The Bank assessed the entire regional and
rural development experience (Mexico: Strategy Proposal for Rural/Regional Development in the
Disadvantaged States, Report 7746-ME). Project completion reports of PIDER, PRODERITH, and
PLANAT provided additional insights. All these studies were largely completed when the Salinas
administration took office two years ago.
2.28         Many of the recommendations that emerged from these studies were incorporated in
the design of the PNS and the regional development program, components of which this project
would support. The following sections describe some of the key lessons learned in the review process
and applied during preparation of this project.
2.29         The rate of satisfaction with small social and infrastructure projects is high. The
INEGI survey of PIDER III found that about 65 percent of subprojects were judged successful by the
beneficiaries, with social and infrastructure projects rated above 70 percent. Experience with
productive projecs, on the other hand, is mixed and shows clearly that the public sector does not
have comparative advantage in such areas. For example, agroclimatic conditions were inappropriate
for some small tree crop projects, and marketing arrangements were undeveloped or technical
assistance was lacking for some small irrigation projects. Therefore, while the PIDER projects
unsuccessfully mandated that at least 61 percent of the projects financed should be productive
projects, the proposed project sets up no such rigid objective. About 25 percent of the overall state
investment program and about 26 percent of the programs designed by the communities,
municipalities, and states are productive projects. Many of the public investments will, of course,
support private productive investments and activities.
2.30         The PIDER III Project lost its poverty focus. Execution of PIDER m coincided with
the economic crisis that began in 1982. Investment budgets for regional and rural development were
progressively slashed. The remaining investment resources were spread thinly among many
communities and invested in highly visible, low-cost projects, such as development of community
stores. By focusing supervision narrowly on the subprojects, neither the Secretariat cf Programming
and Budget (SPP) nor the Bank had the means to evaluate the overall poverty impact of investments



on poor communities, municipalities, and stat. To increase the poverty focus of regional
development, four changes have been or would be made under the present project: (a) formulas
for revenue-sharing have been given greater equity weight (para. 2.36); (b) SPP and the Bank would
now monitor the poverty focus of each participating state's entire investment program rather than just
that of the subprojects (a major shift for both Mexico and for the Bank (Par Il, Section C.2.(a));
(c) a revised project appraisal system introduces a poverty weight into the scoring system of each
project (Part m1, Section C.2.(b)); and (d) grant eligibility rules and cost recovery requirements would
be more stringent for richer communities (Part Il, Section C.2.(d)).
2.31         Significant poverty impact is not feasible without greatly enhacd resource levels.
The reviews show clearly that projects such as PIDER m, which spread limited resources over a vast
number of beneficiaries (US$43 per beneficiary per year) have little impact on communities in which
they are carried out. In contrast, more intensive projects, such as the PRODERITH and PLANAT
projects that spent between US$1,000 and US$2,000 per beneficiary per year, achieved greater and
more lasting impact.
2.32         Between 1982 and 1988, public investment in Mexico declined by 60 percent. Cuts in
rural, regional, and social sectors were even deeper, reaching about 70 percent, leading to the
collapse of the investment programs for poverty alleviation in the four states where the core
investment program decreased from about US$1 billion in 1985' to US$240 million in 1989.
2.33         In view of the acute basic needs in the four project states, the investment program for
poverty alleviation urgently needs expanding. The core investment program to be supported by the
project increased by 20 percent in real terms between 1989 and 1990 and is projected to increase by
another 20 percent in the next two years. Although the expansion would be rapid, it starts from an
extremely low base and by 1992 would still amount to only 66 percent of the 1985 level.
2.34         Creating parallel administrative structures leads to unsustainable pro=am=s. By their
very nature, regional and rural development programs involve integrating components from different
sectoral agencies and different levels of government. They tend, therefore, to spawn parallel
administrative structures or executing agencies to carry out the programs. While this may enhance
coordination in the short run, it becomes disruptive when changes in administration or economic
circumstances occur. The most glaring example in Mexico was the collapse of the General
Committee of the National Plan for Depressed Areas and Marginal Groups (COPLAMAR),
administered out of the President's office during the Lopez Portillo administration, but quickly
abandoned when the new administration took office in 1982. PIDER Im, executed by the regional
development subsecretariat of the Ministry of Planning and Budget, was the first project that became
fully integrated into the regular regional planing system of the Mexican Government. Because of the
experience with COPLAMAR, the PNS of the Salinas administration is fully integrated into the same
regional planning system (described in the following section). During preparation of the proposed
project, further improvements were made to the regional planning system, and neither the project nor
PNS created any parallel structures.
2.35         Community participation reauires the transfer of real responsibility and authority to
lower-level jurisdictions and communitiea. All past programs proposed the goal of community
participation and carried out numerous microregion studies. However, highly centralized decision-
making, administrative procedures, and controls ovet spending, in fact, acted as barriers to
community participation in subproject selection, execution, and operation. Execution was often
6.    The first year for which data is available on a regionalized foQwt.



entrusted to federal line agencies operating from Mexico City, further increasing coordination
proMems. Achievng genuine community participation requires a shift of authority over subproject
selecion, execution, spending, and operation and maintenance to lowerlevel jurisdictions and
communities themselves. Reforms already carried out to accomplish this goal are discussed in the
following sections.
C. Recent Policy Reforms
2.36           Changes in the revenue-sharing formula introduced in November 1989 during project
preparation represent a significant improvement in equity (Annex 2 describes the old and new
systems). Starting in 1990, about half the revenue is to be allocated on per capita basis and the other
half on the basis of historical shares that change according to the rate of excises, property taxes, and
water charges collected in each state. The per capita component introduces an acceptable equity
criterion. Projections show that the four poorest sxates will increase their share portion of shared
federal revenues between 20 percent and 30 percent, thus increasing substantially their capacity for
cost-sharing in investment programs and for covering recurrent costs in the social sectors.7
2.37          The tables in Attachment 3 of Annex 3 illustrate the administration's major
reorientation of inveatment effort towards poverty alleviation. Nationwide, investments in social,
rural, and regional programs will increase at a faster pace than overall investment; by 1990 their
growth rate was already almost double that of total investment. Within the core program, the four
poorest states will increase their share of investment in the national total from 10 percent in 1989 to
14 percent in 1992. Within the overall investment program of the four states, the share for poverty
alleviation will increase from 38 percent in 1989 to 48 percent by 1992. These resources are starting
to become available, making a significant impact feasible.
1. Improving the Refional Planning System
2.38           Mexico has a very elaborate regional planning system based on the COPLADEs, the
state coordinating agencies that were created as a consequence of the PIDER projects (1975-1984).
Funds for investment are allocated to the states through the CUDs while fiscal resources for r
pnditure are mostly allocated through revenue-sharing arrangements.
2.39          The formulation of state p!ans is a programming exercise for pbic investmen. I
starts by the middle of the preceding year, when the COPLADE initiates the process through its
various sectoral committees (education, health, agriculture, infrastructure, etc.) with representatives of
all federal and state sectoral institutions.! The sectoral committee proposals are based on subregional
diagnostics and reflect priorities expressed in the state development plans. They also take into
account national sectoral programs, such as the Plan of Educational Modernization. The COPLADE
then formulates a first proposal. By December, SPP sends to all governors an indicadon of national
7.     Revene shading repres   18 percent of total federal taxes and between 60 pect nd 80 percent of toal mo
financing.

priorities, defines the aggregate allocation to the regional budget, and specifies what rules have to be
followed in its final formulation. DistribWion by state is based on last year allocation, demonstrated
implementation capacity and an overall needs assessment. Sectoral programs must be reviewed and
approved by the line secretariats. While this process is going on, the various sectoral agencies
prepare appraisals of the subprojects. Finally, the SPP and the states negotiate overall investment
allocaions, specific programs, and sources of financing. By February-March most of the
development agreements have been concluded. These CUD contracts between the federal and state
goverrnents specify the legal framework under which the matching grants and the investment
program will be administered. All investments to be carried out are included in the Programa
Operativo Atual (POA), which is an annex to the CUD.
2.40         In order for the POA to be approved, each investment must be supported by a
finalized appraisal report by the responsible sectoral agency proving that the investment meet the
appraisal criteria. The appraisal must follow established SPP guidelines (Guias para la Elaboracion de
Expedientes Tecnicos) and must contain a basic project description, evaluation of beneficiaries, a
budget and financing plan, a technical study, a feasibility and engineering study (with confirmation by
the federal line agency that it satisfies all technical norms and that such agency would supervise the
works and give technical assistance for its execution), an economic evaluation, an agreement between
the community and the implementing agency (through which the community guarantees cofinancing in
the fbrm of either land, labor, materials, or monetary contributions), and an environmental impact
assessment. Sectoral guidelines establish a basic appraisal format for each type of project. The
appraisals are reviewed by the federal line agency and then submitted by the COPLADEs for approval
by the SPP state delegate. The environmental impact assessment is done by the state delegation of the
Secretariat of Urban Development and Environment (SEDUE). The appraisal mission reviewed a
sample of appraisal reports and found them satisfactory.
2.41         The budgetary control of the CUDs is exercised through category XXVI (Ramo
XXVI) of the Mexican Public Administration Budget. The disbursement of funds to each state is
made through the correspondent banks of the Banco de Mexico, and is subject to quarterly statements
on physical and financial status of the investment programs by the states. Rules set down in the
Manual Unico de Operacion require that implementing agencies maintain proper accounting of all
programs and subprojects. The release of funds is controlled by means of accounts-payable
certificates (CLCs) that must be reviewed and approved by the COPLADE Coordinator and the SPP
state delegate. The procurement procedure for each project is specified at the time of programming;
it may be by direct administration, contracting through local or international competitive bidding, or
under agreement with the community.' Under the Cuernavaca agreement on procurement concluded
in April 1990, those rules generally conform to Bank guidelines. Sections on disbursement and
procurement lay down rules for operating the project (paras. 3.98-3.106).
2.42         The present monitoring and evaluation system has its origins in the PIDERs and is
broadly satisfactory in terms of physical and financial implementation. Financial control is further
exercised through public accounting and auditing systems of the General Secretariat of Comptrollers
of the Federation (SECOGEF). An overall agreement between SECOGEF and the Bank establishes
the rules for auditing of Bank projects. Subproject monitoring is based on timetables in the appraisal
report that establish targets for physical and financial implementation. Monitoring tools also include
all supporting documents as well as the project authorizations issued by federal agencies that enforce
technical and environmental rules. States send quarterly reports to SPP on the status of project
execution. State and federal line agencies also monitor the subprojects and raise with SPP any
9.    Thase procedures an reguleed by the Ley de Obras PubL;as.

problems that may occur in project opsertion. The projt would introduce an improved system for
analyzing economic and social impact and for processing information for policy decisions (see
Annex 12).
2.43         In the course of preparing the project, significant improvements in the planning
process were introduced. First, detailed diagnostics were undertaken at the state and regional
levels."0 Second, strategic state and regional five-year plans were formulated through an interactive
process. Third, communities' needs and municipal investment priorities were elicited through a
participatory process involving the Secretaria de Planeacion Estatal and every municipality. Fourth,
the program was screened on the basis of a new project scoring system designed for the states by SPP
and the Bank (Annex 4). Fifth, sectoral agencies in each of the states were involved in selecting
projects, studying the feasibility of communities' proposals, and proposing additional programs or
projects with interregional and statewide impact. Sixth, the planning mechanism was further
decentralized when SPP-federal shifted its focus from project analysis to program design, while the
screening of appraisal reports is carried out in SPP state delegations. Seventh, the role of
COPLADEs was enlarged with formulation of the POA that encompasses resources flowing through
the Programa Normal of the federal agencies, the Programa de Solidaridad Estatal (PSE), and the
state investment programs." This, for the first time, will permit monitoring the poverty impact of
the entire investmnent program of each state.
2.44         In the past, serious inefficiency resulted when most federal government funds were
disbursed only at the start of the rainy season. This problem has affected all Bank investment
projects. In the course of project preparation, new directives were issued by SPP ensuring a
smoother flow of funds to the states. All work in progress is now automatically reprogrammed into
the next fiscal year (oficio de secas) and thus is not interrupted because of a need to wait for the new
budget to be released; the closing of the fiscal year was extended to March.
2.45         Another serious inefficiency resulted from processing expenditure authorizations at
SPP in Mexico City. To ensure a smoother flow of funds, the CUD system now requires only that
expenditures be verified by the SPP delegate in the state. Once approved, each program is
immediately funded by SPP through a revolving fund amounting to 25 percent of the total cost. After
expenditures have been verified by Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), the fund is automatically
replenished. These reforms represent important steps toward improving project performance (see
Policy Letter, Annex 1, page 2).
2. Incrasing Flexibility in Resource Channeling
Municipal Solidarity Funds
2.46         To strengthen communities' social demands, emphasize beneficiary participation, and
introduce competition among agents that provide services to those communities, two additional
channels of resources have been created: (a) the Municipal Solidarity Funds (FMS); and (b) the
Development Funds for Indigenous Populations (discussed in the next section). In 1990 about 1,400
poor municipalities have benefitted from the FMS, whose funds will total about US$120 million. For
1991, the FMS will be extended to 2,000 municipalities with the doubling of the budget. These funds
10.     1r are 31 planning regions in he four maw.
11.   Progranu Nonnal Estatal.



- 14 -
are accounts created at the municipal and community levels to provide capital grant for small
community projets with budget fiaming. States and municipalities have been selected on the basis
of their willingness to participate and specific povert indices. The fiour poorest states would receive
about US$40 million. Te project would support this component through the financing of investment
programs; thus the creation of a special program of the social fund type is not warranted.
2.47         The FMS support microprojects for social and community infrastructure (with
emphasis on rehabilitation and maintenance), and microprograms to meet basic and social needs of the
community and to enhance employment. No individual project or program can exceed US$25,000.
The FMS would also finance technical assistance for implementing such programs. The technical
assistance would be provided by state or line agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) or
private firms. On average, each municipality received US$100,000 equivalent in 1990 and the double
is planned for 1991. The FMS are replenihed as the money is spent, rewarding successfil
implementation and satisfactory annual auditinglmonitoring/evaluation. This intoduces a mechanism
for competition among municipalities. In 1990 about 15,000 projects implemented through the FMS
have been completed.
2.48         The FMS aim at furthering the process of decentralization to municipalities and
encouraging local communities to participate actively in the identification, design, execution,
operation, and evaluation of government programs. The basic operational mechanisms are: (a) setting
up of the FMS by PNS,3 through agreement wIth the states and municipalities; (b) establishment
and operation of municipal councils within the organic municipal law; (c) creation of local committees
to participate fully in the programs funded by the FMS; and (d) coordination with organized social
groups that agree to participate in identifying, executing, maintaining, and operating infrastructure and
social programs.
2.49         States are requested to participate with 25 percent in the funding of the FMS.
Beneficiaries are required to contribute at least 20 percent of the total cost of individual projects,
which may be paid in kind with labor or materials. Project standards and operating procedures are
flexible enough to take into account existing municipal capacity and to help strengthen the planning
and administrative capacity of the weaker municipalities. FMS projects would be selected according
to policy priorities, efficiency, impact, and participation criteria developed by SPP, reviewed and
approved by the Bank, and already implemented in 1990.
eeloEmn    Funds of IndigeouM L   nm
2.50         Indigenous communities present special problems because of their cultural traits and
their experience with discrimination. Indian communities should benefit from investment programs
like all other population groups in each municipality. However, to avoid possible exploitation of
these programs by cacigues and other traditional power brokers, special funds have been created in
the last 10 years targeted to the Indian communities and handled by the National Institute of Indian
Affairs (INI), which maintains a network of specialists working with native communities.
2.51         Development Funds for Indigenous Populations have been strengthened and enlarged,
following rules similar to those governing the FMS. They provide recoverable capital to Indian
communities, landholding groups (ejidos), cooperatives, and civil associations for local production
and development activities. Each fund is administered by a board of directors composed of
representatives of the participating indigenous communities and organizations. The regional INI
12.   See discussion of PNS in Section D, below.



-  ~       ~~~ lS- 
cordinating center and other line agencies cooperating with INI wilt provide technic  assistance.
For FY90, SPP has committed Mex$500 million (approximately US$185,000) per development fund;
there will be 44 funds administered in the four project states and a total of 89 funds throughout the
country, amounting to about USS8 million. The norms agreed upon between INI and the SPP allow
for about 10 percent of these funds to be used for technical assistance and 5 percent for project design
support; the remainder would be used to finance capital grants for social and productive projects.
2.52         INI expects .it eventually each Development Funds for lndigenous Populations
would be able to meet its own technical assistance and institutional support needs without Govenmment
help. During the first three to four years, however, INI will need to provide strong technical and
institutional support to the Funds. For this reason, the project includes a technical assistance and
institutional support program for those Funds. DugrUg V2", INI agreed that specific investment
plans proposed for indigenous populations would be submitted to the COPLADEs in the states and
included in their annual investment plans. To ensure provision of resources, INI is represented at the
state level in specific sectoral subcommittees as well as in the COPLADEs.
3. Adninstrative Dexentralization
2.53         lThe aim of Mexico's decentralization program is to strengthen and speed up the
process of decentralizing administrative functions from the federal to the state and municipal levels,
consistent with implementation capacity. For all ministries, quality control and coordination are to
remain responsibilities of the federal administration. Priority areas for decentralization are education,
health, rural roads, agriculture services, and water supply systems. To prepare the decentralization
program, a working gr%up at the federal level, with representatives from all ministries and led by
SPP, carried out a detailed analysis of 14 main administrative functions. The agreements reached are
contained in the Decentralization Matrix presented as an attachment to the Policy Letter.Y The
agreements, to be monitored under this project, provide the basis for the project's instiutional
d-welopment component. The operational details of the agreements, as well as their corresponding
budgetary implications, have already been worked out between SPP, the ministry in charge of
coordinating public administration, and federal line agencies. The following decisions have been
made:
o    Agricultural Sectr. Parastatal agroindustries, livestock, marketing, and storage firms
are being transferred from the Secretariat of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH)
to producer organizations and the private sector, and the privatization program will be
monitored under the proposed AGSAL II. Most of the services of the former Mexican
Coffee Institute (INMECAFE) and fruit agency (CONAFRUT) have been transferred to
the association of coffee producers. Operation and maintenance of water wells are
being transferred from the Trust Fund for Risk-Sharing (FIRCO) to producer
organizations. Centers for livestock extension and marketing organizations of livestock
products will be decentralized to producer organizations. Control of forest fires and
natural resource management will be transferred from the Integrated Rural Development
District (DDRI) to state governments, and administrative control of producer
organizations will be transferred to municipalities.
13.   See attachmns to Poicy Leter in An=ex 1.



16
o    SItatend _rl Ro_0  Feeder road responsibilities have been decentralized
successfully to state road agenicies in all project states except Hidalgo. In 1991
construction, rehabilitaLioui, and maintenance of swe roads will be cozupletell
decentralized, witl the Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) maintaining
a supervisory role. In 1992 construction and rehabilitation of rural roads will be
decentralized from the 'rust Fund for the National Commission of Feeder Roads and
Highways (CONACAL) to state agencies, with the former retaining a supervisory and
technical assistance role. Decentralization of rural road maintenance began in 1990,
with Chiapas assuming responsibility for about 1,200 km supported by a rehabilitation
program financed under the CUD. Rural roads being built under the project will be
transferred to municipalities and their maintenance financed under the FMS. Transfer
of the rural road network to the states will be completed by 1992, and in 1993 routine
maintenance wilt start to devolve to municipalities.
In addition the following actions are being pursued under separate Bank projects:
o    Educatig. Management and operation of the primary and secondary school systems
within each state are already being transferred to the state secretariats and the process
will continue, monitored under the proposed Primary Education Loan.
o    Healt. The health system has already been decentralized to the state of Guerrero with
good results and the process will be completed in Chiapas, Hidalgo, and Oaxaca,
monitored -under the Basic Health Project (Report No. 8927-ME).
O    Water Supply. Construction, operation, and maintenance of water systems have been
decentralized to state water companies. This process will be monitored and
strengthened under the Water Supply and Sanitary Sector Project (Loan No. 3271-ME).
2.54        Within the four states, municipalities have been ranked according to their levels of
development. An all-agency working group has drawn up a program for strengthening state agencies
and municipalities. During the course of the project, functions would be transferred from states to
municipalities, in accordance with the constitution and laws, as local conditions and capacity allow.
For functions that require a minimum size to have sufficient technical and financial resources for
efficient operation, subregional centers would be established linking groups of municipalities. These
subregional centers already exist for road construction and agricultural extension; additional functions
would include technical and administrative support for municipalities, ope.ation and major
maintenance of water systems, and major maintenance of state and rural roads.
D. Government Strategy
2.55        The Salinas administration has accorded high priority to reducing poverty. Its debt
reduction and public sector restructuring policies have created conditions for resuming economic
growth. Its measures to reduce protection, restore an open exchange rate regime, and allow
agricultural prices to respond to international markets have significantly reduced the economy's urban
bias. Tax and interest policy reforms have sharply reduced subsidies to capital-intensive techniques.
More labor-intensive growth should result. The administration significantly increased public
expenditures in the social sectors in 1990 and sought the support of the Bank to improve efficiency in
those sectors.



- 17
2.56        Tli administration has assigned a centrai policy and implementation rotle in poverty
alleviation programs to the PNS. an operating agency of SPP. All mninistries in the prodiuctive and
social areas participate in a steering committee. Aided by state and municipal governmenv:, the
program seeks to channel health, education, nutrition, housing, employment, and productive resources
to the poorest groups and introduce a more equitable expenditure policy strontgly favorable to the
poor. In rural areas, the program focuses on indigenous populations and the poorer agricultural
zones, and in urban areas it concentrates on the urban fringes. PNS is a nationwide program. The
proposed project is not supporting the PNS program in its entitety. Inctead, it finances selected
investments in the four poorest states. These investments are also not part of the overall PNS
program. PNS also supports other programs, such as the rural stores which are excluded from the
proposed project. As in most of PNS programs, a large part of the subprojects under this proposed
loan are demand driven. However, in order to be eligible for Bank financing, subprojects would have
to conform to the conditionality described in this staff appraisal report.
2.57        In close collaboration with the Bank, the Salinas administration has initiated policy
reforms intended to improve the situation of marginal groups. The Baik report Strategy Pronosal for
the Development of the Disadvantaged States (Report No. 7786-ME) has been influential in bringing
about these reforms. The new strategy, pursued largely through the PNS, aims at channeling social
and infrastructure public expenditures more directly to marginal populations. Under the present
project, the Bank would assist the Government in carrving out these policy reforms and institutional
changes, and in implementing the investment programs against poverty, with special emphasis on the
four poorest states.
2.58        The Government has already substantially increased investment in poverty alleviation
programs, reversing the tertdency of the last decade. PNS resources were increased from US$400
million in 1989 to aimost US$2 billion in 1990. A significant part of the increase was slated for the
social sectors and poverty alleviation. The Government has accorded high priority to improving
conditions of the rural population through the Programa de Modernizacion del Campo. The proposed
AGSAL II will support elimination of remaining anti-agricultural distortions and expansion, and better
targeting of food subsidies, including a nutrition component in the poorest states. Meanwhile, the
Basic Helth Caue Projct (Report No. 8927-ME) and a T.roposed Primary Education Project support
reform and improvement in those subsectors.
2.59        The Government strategy for decentralization has been defined in the Plan Nacional de
Desarrollo 1989-1994. In each of the main administrative subsectors, the Salinas government has
continued the policy initiated by the previous administration in decentralizing state and local
administrative functions. Supported by the Bank under the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (Loan
No. 3085-ME), further decentralization of spending has taken place, but fiscal decentralization has
been subordinated to the more pressing aim of maintaining a tight tax administration for purposes of
macroeconomic stabilization.
E. Rationale for Bank Invol&gment
2.60        While the Bank has supported rural development, water supply, and low-income
housing in Mexico for a long time, a broad dialogue on poverty alleviation has only emerged since
late 1988. The strategy advocated by the Bank is fully consistent with the 1990 World Development
report: (a) sound macroeconomic management as a basis for restoring growth; (b) elimination of anti-
emplovinent biases in trade policies (as supported by Trade Policy Loans - TPL I and II), interest
policies (supported by General Interest Rat- Agreement - GIRA), ad tax policies; (C) elimination of



- 18 -
urban bias in agricultural, food, and hutrition policies (as supported by the agricultural sector
adjustmcnt loans, AGSAL 1, and proposed AGSAL 11); and (d) better targeting of public expenditures
and greater effort in human resource development.
2.61        Within this overall strategy, and at the request of the Government, the Bank will
concentrate regional development and social sector projects heavily on the four poorest states.
(Concentration on these four states does not, of course, imply that poverty is confined to these states
or that the Government is not attending to poverty issues elsewhere.) The Basic Health Project will
strengthen the Public Social Assistance Program (PASSPA) for delivering primary health care and
nutrition programs in the four states and in the Federal District. The planned Primary Education
Project will cover the four states. The Agricultural Extension and Applied Research Project
(PROCATI) will add rural development districts in each of the four states to those it covers in other
states. The Chiapas Rural Development Project will continue developing regions in Chiapas with
relatively high agricultural potential. And the four states will participate in nationwide sectral
investment programs supported by the Water Supply Project ard the proposed Irrigation Sector Loan.
The regional development project provides an umbrella for these actions by strengthening state
capacity to plan, finance, execute and monitor the state-wide investment efforts. The concentration of
action of a number of World Bank projects in the same states under the same strategy will enable the
components oi the development program to be supervised and monitored consistently by the
appropriate sector specialists of the Bank. This greatly reduces complexity of each supervisory task
and adds flexibility not previously feasible in integrated rural development projects. However, the
synergistic impact of multiple components which earlier rural development projects hoped to achieve
can still come about.
2.62        Within this concentrated effort on the four poor states, the specific rationale for the
proposed project is that: (a) the Bank can build on past experiences with regional and rural
development in Mexico; (b) in addition to providing investment resources for the poor states, the
project will allow the Bank to monitor the administrative and fiscal decentralization process; (c) Bank
involvement would maintain a poverty focus for the total investment program of each state and ensure
better targeting to Indian communities; and (d) Bank involvement would create better conditions for
balanced and sustainable development through preservadon of the environment and the cultural
patrimony.

A. Origin of the Project
3.01         At. > close of the PIDER III project in 1987, the Mexican Government asked the
Bank to continue its involvement in regional and rural development with special emphasis on the
poorest states. The Bank insisted that, prior to any further participation, both government and the
Bank needed to review past experience. These reviews lasted from July 1988 to about May 1989.
Incorporating lessons of the r.views, the incoming government launched PNS as a poverty alleviation
program and implemented marny changes in its regional development programs, as described in the
previous chapter. Preparation of the present project started with a workshop held in Oaxaca in July
1989, during which the reviews and ensuing strategy were discussed. Three more project preparation
workshops were held, one in each of the other three states. Appraisal of the project was concluded in
May 1990.
3,. PoectW ObWectir
3.02         The overall objective of the project is to increase the access of poor and indigenous
populations in the four poorest states of Mexico to basic infrastructure, social services, markets, and
technologies. The specific project objectives are: (a) to assist these states in developing, executing,
and financing investment programs with a strong poverty alleviation focus; (b) to assist the federal
and state planning and budgeting ministries in making project selection, environmental assessment,
monitoring, and evaluation more efficient and financing more flexible; and (c) to enable the
decentralized state and municipal institutions to identify, prepare, build, operate, and maintain the
investments in a more participatory manner.
3.03         To achieve these objectives the project would: (a) build poverty weights into revenue-
sharing formulas, project selection criteria, grant eligibility rules, cost recovery requirements, and
monitoring criteria for state investment programs; (b) support the gradual decentralization process
already initiated by the Mexican Government; and (c) improve the sustainability of investment
through increased financing of operation and maintenance expenditures from revenue generation by
the states, from enhanced federal and state budget allocations, and from beneficiary contributions in
cash and kind.
3.04         The strategy under the proposed project assumes that: (a) basic needs in poor regions
will not be met in the next 20-30 years without significantly increasing investments in infrastructure
and social services; (b) the required investment is well within the financial capability of Mexico,
despite budgetary constraints imposed by the present stabilization program; (c) regional development
programs shusu ,uport and strengthen fiscal, financial, and administrative decentralization; and (d)
the proposed state inN.- ftment programs already have a strong commitment from state governments,
use state plans to promote equity, and incorporate strong community and beneficiary participation.

C. PMn%jt e tsciition and CPwj"uo
3.05         The project would address three areas:
(a)   Inystment. It would finance a part of the investment programs for poverty
alleviation in the tour poorest states, based on regional and sectoral deve'-ment
strategies;
(b)    Environmental and cultural protection. It would help preserve the environmental and
cultural patrimony in these states; and
(c)    Technical assistance. It would strengthen state and municipal institutions to assume
additional responsibilities through decentralization; increase local fiscal effort and
improve the revenue-sharing system between states and municipalities; and support
more decentralized and flexible funding mechanisms through Municipal and Indian
Development funds.
3.06         The project will finance an investment program for poverty alleviation in the four
states, to be coordinated by a single ministry: Secretary of Programming and Budgeting (SPP),
although it will be implemented by several line ministries operating in the four states, state institutions
and municipalities. One single administrative mechanism would be used for planning, selecting, and
controlling the execution of investment subprojects: the Development Agreements (CUD) between
federal and state govermments. Through this mechanism of regional planning and budget control, an
annual investment program is agreed, sources of financing committed, and implementing agencies
defined. Operational Manuals regulate the flow of funds, the selection and execution processes as
well as procurement, disbursement and auditing. An extension of the cur '-as been created, with a
special Operating Manual, for operating Municipal Solidarity Funds that explicitly recognize
community participation and flexibility in planning and budgeting procedures. The project would
finance subprojects of the investment programs agreed under the CUD for the four poorest states that
satisfy eligibility criteria defined below.
3 )7         The investment component of the project (US$274 million) would help finance
investment subprojects with a major impact on poverty alleviation. These are part of the core
Investment program defined by the following categories of investment: agricultural promotion and
extension - section 3F1 (agricultural promotion and extension including forestation, plant nursery,
soil conservation, watershed protection, drainage, horticulture, animal husbandry, plant and animal
disease control and coffee plantation rehabilitation); irrigation - section EA (construction and
rehabilitation of small scale irrigation schemes); agroindustry - section FD (processing of fruits,
vegetables, fisheries and produce); education - section SF (construction and rehabilitation of public
primary and secondary schools); rural roads - section EK (construction, rehabilitation, modernization
and extension of rural, state and feeder roads and bridges; and maintenance of such roads); water
supply and sanitation - section EC/ED (construction, extension and rehabilitation of water supply,
drainage and sewerage systems and water treatnent plants); and rural electrification - section EU
(construction of electricity supply networks and transmission lines, installation of transmission lines,
and connection of rural communities to the electricity supply network).
14.   Section numbers refer l thc CUD Operational Manuel.

3.08           The enviroament and cultural site protection (US$43 million) would support: (a)
protection of natural reserve areas including the preparation of management plans, upgrading of
patrol services, and the carrying oult tif the Lacandona Protection Plan; (b) strengthening of the
institutional capacity of SEDUE delegations in the project states and of environmental agencies of the
proiect states and municipalities therein in order to improve project. assessment techniques and
environmental policy formulation; and (c) restoration of selected archeological sites, and
preparation of an inventory of archeological sites.
3.09           The institutional development component (US$18 million) would strengthen
executing agencies (mainly in the agricultural and roads sectors)," state and municipal planning
and budgeting systems, and prepare them to assume additional administrative functions received as
part of the gradual decentralization process agreed under the Decentralization Matrix (see Annex 1,
Attachment 1). The key actions, under this component, required to increase implementation capacity
of executing agencies are listed in Annex 1, Attachment 2, pages 3 to 9, and would be part of a side
letter.
3.10          The proposed Bank loan would contribute to the PNS program in Chiapas, Guerrero,
Hidalgo, and Oaxaca for the 1990-94 period, starting in approximately May 1990. The proposed
loan would be made to NAFIN, which would transfer the proceeds to SPP. The signing of
contractual arrangements between those two institutions, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a
condition of effectiveness. SPP would use the resources to finance the federal grant'
contributions to subprojects executed by state and federal sectoral agencies, municipalities, and
communities. The project uses grants rather than loans because it emphasizes social and access
infrastructure"' and targets its effects on the poorest states and regions; it would not finance
credit or recurrent costs.
I. The Development Agreements (CUDs) and the Regional Planning Mechanism
3.11          The Development Agreement (CUD) is an annual agreement between the federal and
each state govermment that establishes the overall framework for the matching grant investment
program. The federation contributes from 50 percent to 75 percent of program cost, the remaining
being contributed by the state and beneficiaries. The investment program agreed under the CUD is
called the POA. The formulation, selection, execution and control of all subprojects covered by the
POA is regulated by the CUD Operational Manual. By signing the CUD, the state undertakes the
responsibility to contribute with its financing and follow the Operational Manual. In addition, and as
a result of the project, the states would also undertake the responsibility of improving their resource
mobilization and distributing grants equitablv. The federal government (SPP) and each of the project
states would have to enter into a CUD and a project state agreement, annexed tc the CUD, to assure
15.    For a Ust of Executing Agencies see Annex 10.
16.    As described in Annexes 2 and 3 most of the taxes are collected by the fedeal governmn, and thc revew-harn
system as well as the matching grant sytem for investments is a way to redistibute fiscalrsc  to  t and
muticipalities. TIhs, contry to other Bank projects where loan poceedsc are used by the oetral govenment to
nmke loans to states for invesanert progammS, the proceeds are used for the matching grnt sysem among the fedald
and te govenments.
17.    The issue of providing grunts for some productive projects for poor communities would be addressd under fitur
operations, in view of the small share of thoe projects, and the fact tht they ar provided in a package with mixed
credit.

that all Bank and project rules will be respected, including the Bank's right to suspend disbursements
in case of noncompliance, as a condition of effectiveness.
3.12         Project implementation will take place through the established regional planning
mechanism described in the previous paragraph. The annual investment program (POA) results from
proposals by line agencies, state institutions and communities, properly screened and evaluated by the
respective technical ministries working in the state, coordinated through the COPLADES. The POAs
are then negotiated with SPP/federal. The Bank would review the POAs. All subprojects financed
by the project would have to be part of a Bank approved POA and satisfy the rules specified in the
Operating Manual. The CUD Operational Manual specifies rules for appraisal and selection of
projects, implementation, flow-of-funds, financing, cost recovery, and operation and maintenance.
The Manual has been thoroughly reviewed ar.d simplified in collaboration with the Bank, and has
been amended to reflect all the rules defined herewith for subprojects. Tle Manual cannot be changed
without Bank consultation. Annual reviews will also provide the opportunity to redirect institutional
development efforts to those agencies which reveal institutional weaknesses and investment resources
to those agencies which have shown greater implementation capacity. The Bank has the right to stop
disbursements to a noncompliant state and may, upon request of the Borrower and Guarantor,
reassign loan resources from a noncomplying to a complying state.
3.13         Within the CUD mechanism, a system of Municipal Funds has been created to allow
municipalities to undertake small community projects that will mobilize local labor resources and
would allow a more flexible and faster project selection and implementation. Rehabilitation and
repair of social infrastructure are already mobilizing a large effort and enthusiasm in the more than
800 municipalities in the four states, that have started to benefit from those Funds last year.
3.14         The following sections describe the specific mechanisms of the project. The first and
second section describe what criteria and rules are being used to focus the project in poverty
alleviation and maintain the sustainability and efficiency of subprojects, as well as the targeting
mechanisms. Since this is a regional operation that would complement some sectoral Bank operations
already underway in the Project States, Section 4 specifies the coordinating mechanism among those
projects, and Section 5 describes the content of the Investment Programs that have been drawn up
through a widely participatory process during project preparation. In view of the large investment
effort required by poverty alleviation and to assure good implementation and operation capacity,
Section 6 describes the institutional development effort to strengthen the agencies involved in project
execution.
2. Providijng Resources for Poverty Alleviation throug h
the Investment Prgams of the Four Poorest States
3.15         The national poverty alleviation strategy is being defined by PNS. To ensure
consistency of community preferences with national efficiency and distribution objectives, various
mechanisms have been specified in the project which include: (a) rules to strengthen and monitor the
poverty focus of the program and its subprojects; (b) an inproved appraisal and selection system for
subprojects; (c) a matching grant system that specifies how much federal, state, and municipal sources
will contribute to each type of subproject; (d) a schedule of beneficiary contributions in the form of
cash, kind, and/or credit; (e) cost recovery rules for operation and maintenance which, in the case of
utilities, require 100 percent recovery via tariffs; and (f) proper budgeting of recurrent costs of the
investment plans and of individual subprojects via financing plans. The poverty alleviation objectives
ef this project are summarized in Ta! '. '.1 in the form of performance indicators to be used for
monitoring progress in the annual in ;stment programs.

(a) Maintaining the Poverty Focus of Investent Subhrograms
3.16            The project wifl use five mechanisms to maintain its povert focus:'  (a) SPP and
the Bank will review the POAs to ensure a minimum average investment per capita and per poor
person in each region of each state;" (b) they will review the sectoral composition of the states'
overdl investment programs to ensure poverty focus, using such criteria as dominant share of
investment allocated to primary education, rural roads, potable water, etc.; (c) selection criteria will
favor projects that provide benefits to poorer groups, based on rough evaluation of beneficiaries"
income levels; (d) actual investments will be reviewed on completion to ensure that programs have
been implemented according to the above criteria; and (e) matching grant ru.es wiUl provide larger

grant components for projects in more marginal regions, as measured by the marginality index
developed by COPLAMAR/CONAPO.
(b) Project Appraisal and Selection
3.17           The system of project appraisal builds on long Bank and SPP experience in regional
planning, as developed by the PIDER project and the CUD regulations and as refined during project
preparation. Subprojects are classified as small-class A (under US$25,000) with local impact;
medium-class B (between US$25,000-US$200,000); and large-cl-ss C (over US$200,000) with
statewide impact. Subprojects of the first type, comprising about 40 percent of the total investment
program and 80 percent of the number of expected projects, are evaluated from a community
development perspective by a municipal commnittee and supervised by COPLADEs, using a scoring
method summarized in the next paragraph and described in Annex 4.2 Ctrtain exclusion criteria
also apply."' Class B and class C projects are subject to technical, financial, and economic analysis
by the state and federal line agencies. Large projects receive more thorough analysis and medium
projects an intermediate analysis. Rate-of-return criteria will be a2lied to all productive and large
infrastructure projects. In the case of road projects, the required eligibility criheria is specified in
Annex 4, Attachment 2. These criteria have been included in the CUD Operational Manual and
evidence has been provided to the Bank that instructions have been issued. During negotiations the
Government provided assurances that SPP will submit to the Bank, on a quarterly basis, a list,
satisfactory to the Bank, of all investment subprojects authorized during the prior three months by
SPP for financing under this project.
3.18           The system, described in Annex 4, permits municipalities and states to select projects
of high priority through a simple, systematic, and objective technique. Five quantifiable criteria are
aggregated into a project score: (a) technical feasibility and efficiency; (b) benefits relative to cost;
(c) minimum beneficiary contribution (cost recovery); (d) targeting to the poor; and (e) beneficiary
commitment to operation and maintenance. Projects must satisfy minimum requirements for each
criterion, and have a minimum overall score. Among competing projects those with the highest
scores are selected.
3.19           The proposed project cycle and rapid appraisal system constitute one of the most
innovative features introduced by this project. As explained in Attachment 1 of Annex 4, project
proposals are generally presented by community groups to municipalities. Th,e municipalities fill out
the basic project formats and apply the screening process. Once projects are selected, municipalities
aggregate them into proposals and forward them to the state planning agencies. These agencies
review the scores and aggregate the lists of all municipalities with the estimated funding required.
These state programs are then reviewed by COPLADEs and the SPP delegations and negotiated with
SPP federal.
20.    Scoring is based on a ystan of weighb for severel key objectives. The sysen is simple (decision-makem have low
educational level and information is limited); it has alrady been implemented and experience so far demonsttas its
effectivencu.
21.    Among othem, projects tht have an advese envirmn  impact or can damage the cultural patinony, or lead to
involuntary rlesment of populations, ar excluded.
22.    The form  required for its presnin is contaimd in SPP, Otiws 2ea la -elabomcion dc edientes tenicos
simolfcados, Mexico, December 1989.



-~~~~~~~~ -2S -
3.20         Technical feasibility and efficiency Is subject to the aorms and stdards established
by the federal and state agencies. For example, the CNA would follow the same technical rules for
fesibility studies and project screening for all projec, independently of the source of financing.
Every project has to be reviewed and approved by the televant sector agency (in Guias Kara I
jlaboracion de Expedientes Tecnicos Simnliflcados, Annex to the CUD Operational Manual) and the
sectoral committee of the COPLADE. The Bank reviewed the corresponding technical manuals and
found then. satisfactory.
3.21         The economic efficiency criteria require at least a 12 percent rate of return for
productive and large infrastructure projects and that social sector and small infrastructure projecs
must minimize costs and respond to revealed social demand, as well as being appropriately targeted to
the poor. In the case of social sector projects, basic technical norms, as defined by the Secretariat of
Public Education (SEP) or CNA, seek to minimize cost per social demand. These minimum costs are
incorporated into the guidelines for project selection and into the scoring system for small projects.
3.22         Operational manuals issued for the Municipal Funds already incorporate the system
for appraisal and selection of small projects described in Annex 4. The final draft of the CUD and
Municipal Funds Operational Manuals has been prepared in close collaboration with the Bank.
Formal approval of such documents has been provided to the Bank. The experience with the small
projects selection system of the FMS will be reviewed with the Bank no later than October 31, 1991.
TMe revised system for small project appraisal, agreed with the Bank, would be incorporated in the
CUD Operational Manual by November 1991, to start to be applied to the POA of 1992. By that
date the two systems for channelling monev (CUD and FMS) to small projects would have similar
rules for appraising small projects. In addition, and in order to monitor improvements in analyzing
all medium and large projects, a satisfactory appraisal report of two subprojects (one medium and one
large) in each of the eight program categories to be financed by the Bank, with at least four
subprojects per state, would have to be submitted to the Bank in order to comply with conditions for
disbursement in calendar years 1991, 1992 and 1993.
3.23         Environmental screening and monitoring of investment projects would be carried out
within the framework established by the national environmental law (Ley General de Equilibrio
Ecologico y Proteccion al Ambiente, 1988) and its regulations, as well as the Ley de Obra Publica
(art. 28, in particular). Projects below US$200,000 will be subjected to a simple environmental
screening process. Larger projects would require an envirownental assessment. Projects with ex-ante
favorable impact (e.g., sewerage, reforestation ) or without environmental impact (e.g., education,
training) would be exempt from this process.' Funds will be provided throughout implementation
to monitor compliance with environmental safeguards established during enviromnental screening and
assessment. SEDUE will be responsible for clearing the annual invesunent programs of each state
and individual subprojects with regard to compliance. The rules to be used for environmental
screening of subprojects are regulated by the above law. During 1991, SEDUE will prepare
guidelines to simplify and improve the application of the above law (see Annex 4, Attachment 3 for
the agreed rules).

3.24         The matching grant system used in the CUD has induced a better use of resources and
is an important instrument for ensuring the consistency of national and state objectives. Investment
grants from the federal government are given as matching grants to each project. According to the
CUD Manual, the state share varies from about 75 percent for a productive project in a rich state to
25 percent for a social project in a poor state. Ihis system is applied to the entire PNS (see Annex 5
for the cost sharing in the four states). Ihese rules would also apply under the proposed project.
fii) Own-state and municinal ro
3.25          1hrough the matching grant system, states are required to contribute at least 25
percent of their own resources collected through general taxation within their jurisdiction (Annexes 2
and 3). During project execution it is expected that a similar system, t ing into account the poverty
level of the municipality, will be designed and implemented between each state and its municipalities
for projects with local impact. According to projections presented in Annex 3, Attachment 1, states
will be able to finance the proposed investment program. The 1980 tax reform transferred to the
Federation most of the state and local taxes and introduced a revenue-sharing system through which
about 18 percent of federal taxes are devolved to the states in the form of a block grant. The block
grants represent 70 percent to 80 percent of total revenues of the four states. The remaining 20-30
percent will come from property taxes, water charges, and other minor service charges (derechos and
productos). Urban infrastructure projects also obtain credits from BANOBRAS.
3.26         The project states are being encouraged to improve state tax collection, as referred to
in the Policy Letter. The 1989 revenue-sharing formula between the federation and the states
introduced local taxes as an element in calculating each state's share. Last year, in anticipation of this
change, there was a significant increase in property tax collection (in Guerrero, collections increased
by about 800 percent, and in Hidalgo 600 percent). The project would further help enable the states
to collect revenues required for the investment program's matching grants and recurrent expenditures.
Te project would assist all four states to: (a) complete updating their cadastres by the end of
1991; and (b) reassess property values by the end of 1992. Several studies have been initiated to
codify and modernize their fiscal systems; a major study on fiscal laws and state budgets was
conducted in the course of project preparation. No new taxes are being proposed, but major
shortfalls in the operation and collection of existing taxes and levies have been identified. A
commission to review state fiscal laws and draft proposals will be established by June 1991 in each of
the four states. New state riscal codes will be drafted before the end of 1992 and the respective
bills presented to the state legislative branches. The Policy Letter (Annex 1) addresses the aims
regarding these issues, and the action programs agreed with each of the four states would be
incorporated in the Execution Annexes of the CUD Agreement.
3.27         As municipalities increase their institutional capacity, a larger part of the state
revenue-sharing (gartici=acionemw is passed on to them. Under the new Hidalgo Fiscal Coordination
Law at least 20 percent of the participaciones are transferred to the municipalities. When
municipalities are not yet capable of performing a special function as established by law, states retain
this function and charge municipalities for administrative services. It is estimated that, due to
decentralization, transfers to municipalities will increase by about 15 percent (Chiapas) to 100 percent
(Hidalgo) in real terms.



-27 -
3.28          Reform of the formulas for allocating revenue-shasing passed on by the state to
municipalities will be promoted during the project. In some states the formula is unclear; in others it,
poses problems of inefficiency and inequity. A reform is impotant since almost 80 percent of the -
revenue of municipalities in these states derives from those transfers. Hidalgo has taken the lead and
enacted a law containing a new formula based on population, local tax effort, and a marginality index,
in close agreement with Bank proposals. The other three states have initiated studies required for
moderniztion of their revenue-sharing formulas. It is expected that new draft laws would be
compieled by June 1991 and presented to state congresses in the second half of that year. This
action would also be reflected in the action programs of the project states as referred to in para. 3.11.
Lack of sufficient progress under the monitorable actions in this paragraph and para. 3.26, cggld
constitute a rean for suspending disbursements to a particular state. In such cases, funds could be
canceled or reallocated to other states.
(d) Benefrciary Contributions to Investment Cost
3.29          The CUD Operational Manual incorporates rules for beneficiary contribution.
Beneficiary contributions to investment costs are regulated through the CUD/PNS Manual Unico de
Operacion, table "Apertura Programatica y Estructura Financiera." Productive projects are financed
through a mix of grants (from 75 percent to a poor state down to 50 percent to a well-off state) and
loans (from 50 percent in a well-off state down to 25 percent in a poor state) that have to be secured
by the beneficiaries, prior to project execution. Part of the grant is federal (maximum of 50 percent
to a poor state), and the rest is a matching grant from the state. States also require municipal and/or
beneficiary contributions for such that are incorporated in the state matching grant. In a survey
carried out of subprojects during 1989, cash contributions represented from 1 to 9 percent of project
costs and materials, and community labor (provided free) from 10 to 15 percent of project costs (see
Annex 5). Social projects are financed by grants from the federal government (from 75 percent in a
poor state down to 50 percent in a well-off state) and the rest has to be covered by a state matching
grant. States also request municipal and/or beneficiary contributions. To build a prinury school or a
rural road, the beneficiaries are required to contribute local materials and construction work (as free
community work-1i2). These contributions represent 20 percent to 30 percent of the cost of the
project.u
3. Flnancing Recurrent and Operation and Maintenance Costs
3.30          For each sectoral investment program financed in a state under the CUD, the sectoral
committee of the COPLADE will provide a financing plan for recurrent costs. For each subproject
to be financed there must be a plan for financing recurrent and operation and mantnce (O&M)
costs, as part of the project file to be submitted to the COPLADE. Such a rule is included in the
CUD/PNS Operational Manual and applied to productive, water supply, and education sectors. For
example, the project will not fuiance construction of a new school unless provision has been made for
paing -its teachers. Such budgetary agreements and O&M plans wil be reviewed during project
supevision, as part of the annual reviews.
3.31          The estimate for major recurrent costs in Annex 8 shows that incremental recurrent
costs will amount to about US$7 million equivalent in 1991 and will rise by the end of the project to
about US$36 million equivalent. Maintenance of rural and feeder roads is accorded top priority in
24.   In large urban municipalities, like in Mexico City, these contributions ae not usually requested.

the CUD Operating Manual. Maintenance of feder roads built or rehabilitated under the project will
be financed through the CUD, under the FMS, and with state participation to be included in the
POAs. The planned expansion of educational infrastructure would add an estimated 8,000-12,00C
additional teachers to the 93,000 already working in the four states. The US$8 million to US$24
million required annually to pay them by the end of 1993 will be financed through the current budget
of SEP, which will be transferred to the state if the educational sector is decentralized. During
nejimbnsj assurances were obtained that the budgetary allocations of the respective agencdes for
education and roads will be confirmed at the project supervision review that takes place at the
beginning of each year, which should be satisfactory to the Bank if further Bank financing to that
sector and state is to be provided. For the expansion of the health program, recurrent costs will be
monitored as part of the Basic Health project. For agricultural and other production subprojects,
O&M expenditures wfli be the responsibility of the beneficiaries through ejidos and water user
associtions. To cover for administrative expenditures associated with O&M a flat 3 percent charge
of project cost would be collected per year. For utilities such as electricity and water supply, tariffs
must include 100 percent cost recovery for O&M (as well as partial capital cost recovery as discussed
in Annex 5).
3.32         For operation and maintenance, the community or group of beneficiaries would sign
an agreement with the executing agency under which the beneficiaries accept an obligation to fully
recover operation and maintenance costs. This agreement between the executing agency and the
community would be part of the "Acta de Aceptacion por la Comunidad' that is now included in
every subproject request to the COPLADES (expediente tecnico). An amendment in the Guia para Ia
Elaboracion de Expedientes Tecnicos Simplificados, in that regard, has been introduced. Institutional
arrangements for operation and maintenance proposed under the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
Loan would be extended to this project (Annex 6). Pricing and tariff policies for water supply and
irrigation are addressed under these respective sectoral loans. In electrification projects, the Federal
Commission for Electricity (CFE) has clear and reasonable guidelines that cover capital costs and
operation and maintenance. It requires a 50 percent previous deposit, of capital costs, by the
beneficiaries before it starts any electrification project. In the case of rural roads built under PNS,
after the road is built, it is formally transferred to the municipality and an agreement is signed
between the executing agency, SPP, and the municipality under which the executing agency will
provide technical support. SPP will provide resources under the FMS and the municipality will take
responsibility for maintaining the road (para. 3.49 and Annex 6).
4. Coordination with Sectoral Policies
3.33         Coordination between the proposed loan and the sectoral-specific loans is assured at
the state level through the CUD mechanism. First, the CUD Operational Manual will enforce the
same cost-recovery rules and project design and efficiency criteria consistent with Bank sector-specific
loans. Second, through the POAs and eligibility criteria defined in the CUD Operational Manual the
assignment of projects to the existing Bank loans would be coordinated. This project therefore
defines no separate sector strategies or rules. The following paragraphs, however, describe sectoral
priorities for the poor in the four states and the relevant sectoral rules. While SPP and state planning
agencies coordinate state investment plans and monitor execution through the COPLADE, sectoral
subcommittees coordinate sectoral investnents, and federal or state line agencies and municipalities
execute them. Technical and operation rules are the responsibility of the federal technical ministries.



- 29--
(a) Agialtu
3.34          The four project states have important agricultural potential. To develop this
potential, public sector investment in infrastructure, technical assistance, technological development,
and research is vital. While the Government continues providing limited credit for agriculture, the
supply of inputs and marketing are increasingly the responsibility of the private sector. The basic
strategy being pursued by the Government with Bank assistance in the four states is to: (a) concentrate
most agricultural services in regions with agroecological potential; (b) develop conditions for market-
oriented agriculture based on the comparative advantages of these regions for growing export products
(tropical fruits and off-season vegetables) and for supplying the domestic market (arge urban centers);
and (c) improve productivity in subsistence agriculture by using simple technologies for moisture
retention and soil conservation, appropriate seeds, and fertilizers.
3.35          For the poorest regions of the states, largely exploited by e}idos and other community-
based organizations, the Government has been providing grants for development of irrigation
infrastructure, livestock, forestation and some agroindustries. In the past, these projects have shown
varying rates of success, depending on many factors ranging from low-grade soils and poor climate to
lack of marketing initiatives.
3.36          The investment programs of 1990-93, for the four states, to be financed by the Bank,
amnount to about US$327 million for agriculture, livestock, and forestry. Of this total, about US$153
million is for primary production and productivity development; US$133 million for small irrigation;
and US$29 million for livestock.'s The Bank would finance the following categories of subprojects
of the CUD manual:2' agricultural promotion and extension including forestation, plant nursery, soil
conservation, watershed protection, drainage, horticulture, animal husbandry, plant and animal disease
control, and coffee plantation rehabilitation (category 3F); construction and rehabilitation of small
irrigation schemes (EA); and agroindustrial production and processing of animal products, fruits and
vegetables, and fishing products (FD).
3.37          In Oaxaca and Hidalgo, priority under the proposed project is given to small irrigation
projects worth about US$69 and US$48 million, respectively. Programs for Guerrero and Chiapas
call for no more than US$10 million each for the four-year program. In the primary production
subcomponent, almost US$50 million is allocated to coffee growers to increase productivity and allow
further vertical integration and crop diversification. Guerrero and Hidalgo are particularly active in
the livestock subsector. The latter state has extensive experience supplying Mexico City with meat,
eggs and poultry; the former relies substantially on this type of project to alleviate poverty among
rural groups. All four states have forestry projects, widt Oaxaca according them the most importance
and Chiapas the least.
3.38          The following types of subprojects ar, emphasized in the proposed project: small-
scale forestation, nurseries, soil conservation, watershed studies and protection, plant and animal
disease control, zero tillage efforts, small drainage, minall-scale horticulture, and small husbandry.
The projects are being developed on a community-based framework with proper technologies and
technical assistance.

3.39         Agriculture potential and ecological and climatic conditions are extremely diverse in
the four states. Thus, technologies for improving productivity must be developod locally, with on-
farm experiments and denstrations, and rural extnsion must be baed on local models. Such
decentralization of iostitutional activity is being pursued forcefuly. The SARH has begun
transferring resources and functions to rural development districts, and more than 100 agreements
have been signed between SARH and producer groups, giving the latter resources to hire technical
assistance directly.
3.44         The Bank is now financing an agricultural extension project (PROCATI) under Loan
2859-ME. Beginning in 1987, with Bank financing of US$20 million and a project cost of USS13.8
million, and to be completed on December 31, 1991, PROCATI aims to improve the efficiency of
extension services in 25 rural development districts (DDR) and to raise the capacity of SARH to
furnish such services in the future. It is important to continue improving extension efficiency for
small farmers in the four states with the same approach used in PROCATI. This will be done by
replicating PROCATI activities in technical assistance, farmer and staff training, research project
evaluation, and producers' organization in nine DDRs in the Decentralization and Regional
Development Project area. The districts selected by SARH and agreed by the Bank, based on
agricultural potential, are: Comitan, Tonala and Tuxtla Gutierrez (Chiapas), Altamirano, Atoyac
(Guerrero), Valles Centrales, Costa (Oaxaca), and Mixquiahuala and Pachuca (Hidalgo). SPP
provided assurances during negotiations that an estimated US$3 million will be allocated to SARH in
1992 for the proposed districts. In 1993 an equivalent amount would be allocated to SARH, possibly
under the proposed Agricultural Technology Loan, under preparation.
(b) Social Services
3.41         TMe main social sector component financed by the project is education. A parallel
project (Basic Health Care Loan) hac been recently approved by the Board. The Bank is also
preparing with the Government a Primary Education Loan, possibly starting in 1992, to finance
investments in the four project states. Notwithstanding this, some urgent action is needed in the
education subsector, particularly in rehabilitating and completing some long delayed infrastructure.
All the above projects cover the four poorest states.
3.42         The education sectoral programs for the four states were designed based on the
Government's Educational Modernization Program (PME) for 1989-94 which is defined at the
national level and in the state sector diagnosis. PME stresses developing primary education in
marginal areas and extending it to all populations; completing the education cycle for schools that lack
six years of primary education; and providing specific education programs for indigenous
communities. Consequently, the strategy is to: (a) reduce the gap in the coverage of primary
education in the four states by two-thirds by the end of the program; (b) upgrade the quality of social
services statewide; (c) develop and expand secondary education to respond to increased demand; and
(d) expand the educational models to foster and preserve the indigenous cultures.'
3.43         The Government's PME targets for primary education in the four states are to: (a)
bring terminal efficiency up to the national average (about 55 percent); (b) extend the number of
grades in at least 80 percent of the schools; (c) decrease the drop-out rate by at least 20 percent; and
(d) reduce to one-third the rate of failures. In addition, in Chiapas, it would seek to reduce the
number of multi-grade schools by eight percent.
27.   The project will not fnace any recurren costa.



-31 -
3.44         'Me project's investment program in education totals US$131 million over tour years
(1990-93) and would finance infrastructure imnvments through PNS. Of that amount, about halt
will be spent on primary education and the other half on secondary. The Bank would finance
subprojes in category SF of the CUD manual covering construction and rehabilitation of public
primary and secondary schools, but with priority in primary education. Ihe proposed P'rimary
Education Loan would finance the software component as well as infrastructure subprojects
coordinated by the Management Committee of the Federal School Construction Program (CAPFCE).
In order to better coordinate training and hiring of teachers, the Bank will discuss with SPP and the
Education Ministry the appropriateness of restricting new construction for primary schools to the
Primary Education Loan, once it becomes effective. Such arrangements would be incorporate in the
CUD Operational Manual for 1992.
3.45         Priority will go to rehabilitating and renovating existing schools. The school
expansion plan covers about 58 percent of the education infrastructure needs in Oaxaca and about
onetird of the needs in the other three states. In view of the significant population flows among
regions, each state will finalize its master plan for the school system by the end of 1991. The
plaaming of the system is the responsibility of the Education Ministry, and in case of any expansion,
evidence would be provided by that Ministry that the teaching position has been created and
appropriately bud4.geted.
3.46         Important initiatives for improving the quality of education and for providing teachers
to indigenous and remote communities are already being taken in some states under the PNS program..
For example, INI is heavily involved in programs of bilingual education.
3.47         While PNS is in part responsible for increasing and improving physical infrastructure,
the Ministry of Education is responsible for developing the 'software". The latter component
includes developing training programs, revising institutional functions, and reforming delivery of
services.
(c) State and Rural Roads
3.48         Between 40 and 50 percent of the population of the four states lack regular road
communication, using mostly dirt tracks with irreguiar accessibility. An additional 17,000 kn of
roads are needed, based on the agricultural potential and social needs of communities with more than
500 inhabitants, which amounts to about 40 percent of the national gap according to estimates of
SCT. The minimum standard used by SCT is that all communities of more than 200 people should
have a road link, up to a reasonable cost. From 1973 to 1983, about 1,500 kn of new roads were
built each year. With financial retrenchment, that rate has fallen to about 100 km in the 1986-88
period. In addition, funds for maintenance and rehabilitation have been sharply reduced. A recent
assessment of the Oaxaca road network showed that only 15 percent was in good condition while 40
percent could only be of service if totally rebuilt. All four states sustained substantial road damage
from tropical storms in the last two years.
3.49         The investment program to be partly financed would: (a) extend the routine
maintnance program to about 70 percent of the rural road network; (b) permit major rehabilitation
and reconstruction of the rural road network in order te increase the share of roads in 'good
condition' from 21 to 77 percent of a projected 22,000 km network; and (c) provide feeder and rural
road links for the first time to about one mrilion people, once the construction of about 5,000 km of
new feeder and rural roads is finished. Those roads are needed to foster agricultural potential of these
regions and to link communities with at least 500 inhabitants with the health and education systems.
About US$107 million would be spent on rehabilitation of rural roads; US$194 million on



- 32 -
cviLstructitn of new rural roads; and US$9 mnillion on maintenance of these riads. For state feeder
roads, about US$5 miton would be spent on rehabilitation; US$81 milion on upgrading; and US$3
million on maintenance. Priority will lie given to completing roads already under cotstruction M..e
total progran would benefit about 3.6 million people. It represents an ambitious program, even by
pre-crisis standards' (about 1,250 km of new roads built each year). By the end of the four-year
program, an estimated 30 percent of the road gap would be elimnated. The project would finance
subprojects in category EK of the lC slD corresponiding to construction, renovation, and rehabilitation
of state, rural, and feeder roads and bridges, and maintenance of such roads.
3.50         Mexico has the capacity to implement the pioposed road program. Virtually all
project preparation is being subcontfacted to consulting engineering firms, and about 80 percent of the
projects are being executed by the private sector thr(ough local competitive bidding. The program of
rural roads implemented in 1989 already approaches 900 km. Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Hidalgo have
also acquired a significant stock of road equipment, which is being utilized to establish subregional
equipment centers for rehabilitation and major maintenance work. Some municipalities (Hidalgo) and
communities (Oaxaca) have participated in rural road construction. The result has been a significant
increase in implementation capabilities and in the share of costs borne by the communities. During
the project, such experiences would be consolidated and evaluated.
3.51         In Chiapas, the program is being executed by two state agencies: the Comision Estatal
de Caminos and the Secr_tariat of Urban Development and Communication (SDUC) in equal shares.
In Guerrero the state agency MAQUlNOP manages road equipment depots and incorporates the Junta
Estatal de Caminos. In Hidalgo most of the program is being carried out by the state Junta de
Caminos. In Oaxaca the program is being executed by SCT with increasing participation from the
state agency (Caminos y Autopistas de Oaxaca - CAO). In all states the construction program is
closely supervised by SCT, through CONACAL, the recently formed fideicomiso in charge of feeder
and rural roads.
3.52         The eligibility grid for Bank financing of roads is presented in Annex 4,
Attachment 2, to be incorporated in the CUD Operational Manual. For rural roads (caminos rurales)
the economic and social evaluation are basically based on the cost per persoin served that should not
exceed US$500. Whei.. the cost is greater than US$500, a full economic analysis would be carried
out and present an economic rate of return (ERR) higher than 12 percent. The US$500 threshold is
based on economic analysis of past projects v:ider similar conditions. In addition, only construction
of type E or F (roads/track) is eligible. For the construction of new feeder roads (carreteras
alimentadotas), a full economic evaluation generally based on transportation cost savings would reveal
an ERR not less than 12 percent. Paving works would not be eligible. For routine maintenance,
rehabilitation, and spot improvement, an economic evaluation would not be required for rural roads.
For feeder roads, the rehabilitation subproject, including spot improvement, would be eligible only
for unpaved roads. A threshold of US$15,000/km would be established. Under the threshold no
economic evaluation would be required; over the threshold, an economic evaluation would be
required showing an ERR not less than 12 percent. In order to coordinate with other Bank projects,
only types F and E roads (rural roads), following SCT terminology, would be accepted for financing,
plus unpaved D and C categories (feeder roads).
3.53         State agencies maintain feeder roads. SCT closely monitors budgets and
implementation capacity. Under current institutional arrangements, SCT is responsible for
maintaining rural roads, but maintenance has been poor due to lack of resources and low priority. In
28.    About 30 percent above the 20-year historical average.



- 33 -
almvst all developed countries, municipalities own r(ads and are itt chafge ot their maintenance. In
1990 SCT began transterring responsibility for maintenance to the states. as roads were rehabilitated;
and in 1993 it will begin systematically transterring responsibility to municipalities." Rural roads
const.ucted or relhabilitated under the prciject will be transferred mofre quickly. During 1991, SPP
and SCT will prepare a model contract (Annex 1, Attachmentt 7). Before presenting the 'expediente
tecnico", municipalities will sign such a contract with the executing agentcy assuming tesponsibility
for routine mainteniance as described in para. 3.32 (see Annex 6). Financing tor this task will be
channeled throtugh the EMS.
(d) R-tural Inrrtr
3.54          Shortages in water supply, sewerage, electricity, housing, and other basic
infrastructure arc widespread in the four project states. Although the Government recognizes such
needs, some priorities have been established. Such priorities depend to a large extent on benefit/cost
elements and are revealed by social demand through the participatory planning process.
3.55          Shortages of safe water are more serious in Oaxaca and Hidalgo, and Hidalgo is also
seriously affected by pollution from the discharge of Mexico City sewers. About 60 percent of
Qaxaca's population lacks piped water. In Chiapas the proportion is about 40 percent, but with large
regional variation. Only 23 percent of Guerrero's population lacks piped water, but of this group
two-thirds depend upon very poor quality water. Poor administration and lack of adequate water
treatment are among the main causes of the poor quality of water services.
3.56          The investment program to be financed by the Bank for water and sewerage totals
about US$127 million and benefits a population of about 2 million. Most of the investment will occur
in localities with 500 to 10,000 inhabitants. The Bank will finance CUD categories corre.sponding to
construction and rehabilitation of water supply, drainage, and sewerage systems and water treatment
plants (EC); and extension of water supply, drainage, and sewerage systems (ED). The Gzvi-ri'nent
agreed to cause the CNA to provide technical support as required to the state water agencies in the
preparation of such subprojects and in the development of institutional strengthening programs.
3.57          Systems of water supply and sewerage would be built only if the community
(municipality) establishes satisfactory arrangements for collecting user fees from beneficiaries to cover
operation and maintenance (Annex 5). Operation of water supply and sewerage systems will be
subject to guidelines established in Annex 6 which have been included in the CUD Operational
Manual.
3.58          Mexico has made an enormous effort to extend electrical service to rural areas.
About 72 percent of the rural population now has access to service. However, according to the CFE,
about 556,000 people in Guerrero lack electricity (39 percent of the state's rural population), 537,000
in Chiapas (34 percent), and 241,000 in Hidalgo (23 percent). Oaxaca has already been able to
reduce significantly the number of people without electricity, despite the large gap at the beginning of
the last decade.
3.59          The investment program for rural electricity for 1990-93 amounts to US$91 million,
benefiting an estimated I million persons. Oaxaca and Guerrero requested about US$33 million each,
Hidalgo US$21 million, and Chiapas US$4 million. The Bank will finance category EU of the CUD
29.    Hidalgo is already encourmging municipalities to maintsin their ru-ni rade by gupplying tools and ptoviding wvages in
kind (food-for- work) to community membera.



- 34 -
ctrresiuonidng to construction and installation of transmission lines and electricity networks to rural
communities
3.60          Since the rate of access is already high in some regions of the project states and the
goal of total electrification is too ambitious at this time, projects costing more than US$93 per
benet-iciarv will he excluded. Such eligibility criteria has been included in the CUD Operational
Manual. Furthermore, to ensure minimum efficiency, beneficiaries will be required to make
matching payments equal to 40 percent to 50 percent of the total cost for all projects executed by the
CFE.
(e} EtUngJL the Envi=anzn
3,61         lTe four states include some of the most delicate environmental areas, including the
last remaining tropical rain forests in Mexico. The project therefore includes specific measures for
ensuring more balanced development and for protecting critical reserves.
3.62          The Lacandona Reserve is part of the second largest tropical humid forest on the
North American continent. The Lacandona covers about I million ha and has a population of about
70,000, mostly Indians. It is extremely rich in rare wood species, animals, and cultural sites.
According to data from the Forestry Subsecretariat of SARH, from 1969 through 1982 about 40
percent of the forest was destroyed and 14 percent of the biosphere was lost due to wood extraction,
slash-and-burn agriculture, and excessive grazing (Landsat of May 1988). The Lacandona Reserve
includes: (a) the Montes Azules biosphere zone, designated by President Salinas as a human
patrimony under the UNESCO pro6ram, which is also referred to as the core; and (b) the buffer zone
constituted by five subregions that surround the biosphere zone. The area has also been subject to
population pressure caused by conflicts in neighboring Guatemala.
3.63          Significant progress has aleady been made in consving the Lacandona Reserve.
Logging has been prohibited in the zone and has effectively come to a halt last year. The area
affected by slash-and-burn fires has decreased by about 80 percent In 1989, relative to the
previous year. The state government has created a special conmittee within COPLADES to
coordinate all institutions working in the are. The Lacandona conservation program, drawn-up by
the state and cleared by SEDUE, defines an integrated strategy for the biosphere zone and buffer
areas for the next five years. An institutional framework has been designed with multisector
subprojects, with a horizon of about 10 years. The total cost of this subcomponent is about US$40
million for the 1990-93 period and would be pardy financed by the present project. The main
element of the plan forbids any logging in the biosphere zone of Montes Azules (331.000 ha) and
includes strict regulations and policing of the reserve to protect it from additional human
encroachment.' The Government is already undertaking a major effort to resolve land conflicts in
the reserve, and halt land titling, and prohibit road construction in the core zone. To decrease
pressure on the biosphere area, productive and social actions would be undertaken in buffer zones to
provide alternatives to resource exploitation (e.g., reforestation, using rubber and coffee plantations;
incentives for using areas with high agricultural potential more effectively; and disincentives to such
damaging activities as livestock grazing and slash-and-burn agriculture). Finally, regulations to
discourage migration into the buffer zone would be implemented (e.g., severe limitations on land
titling for new migrants and on human settlements). The Wlan. d%-,ibed in greater detail in Amiex 9.

has been agreed with thnk. The Government has provided assurances that no road construction
will be undertaken inside the Montes Azules Reserve and that for any large road (type D or higher) to
be constructed in the rest of the Lacandona Reserve (buffer zones), the Government would submit to
the Bank an en0'ironmental assessment satisfactory to the Bank prior to initiation of construction. The
1991 operational program according to the- Lacandona plan formulated by the Government has been
already presented to the Bank. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the 1992, 1993
and 1994 operational programs would have to be presented to the Bank each year by January 31, to
be part of the annual project review. Lack of agreement on protection plans and progress in the
implementation on the agreed plans would constitute sufficient reason to suspend disbursements to the
state of Chiapas. In that case, funds could be reallocated to other states.
(f) Protection and Rehabilitation of Cultural Patrimony
3.64         The four project states include some of Mexico's richest and most famous pre-
Colombian archeological sites. To protect these sites, the National Institute of Anthropology and
History (1NAH) has designed a systematic cultural property component as part of the project. The
cultural property component will use local labor and materials to restore 10 pre-Colombian
archeological sites and one colonial-era convent (the Augustine convent of Actopan in the state of
Hidalgo). The archeological sites to be restored under the project include the classical Mayan ruins
of Palenque in Chiapas, the still little-known but monumental Xochipala site in Guerrero, the Toltec
city of Tula in Hidalgo, and the famous Zapotec ceremonial center of Monte Alban in the Valley of
Oaxaca. The subcomponent would also support INAH and INI in the establishment of a state
inventory of archeological sites in Chiapas and Oaxaca.
3.65         A major aspect of the cultural property component will be to mobilize local labor and
use local materials for the restoration work, under the professional supervision of the INAH
archeological staff. Thus, of the total budget of US$2.6 million for the cultural property component,
INAH estimates that 85 percent (or US$2.2 million) will benefit local communities in the form of
wages, and 10 percent (or US$0.26 million) wIll be spent for local materials such as lumber, sand,
rock, and cement. The reforestation projects would also produce indirect social and economic
benefits in the form of increased tourist revenues for local communities. Monte Alban, for example,
threatened by neglect and by population pressures on its periphery, receives nearly 300,000 tourists
annually but lacks basic sanitation facilities.
S. A FourYear Investment. Pognl
3.66         The proposed Core Investment Program in Annex 7 results from the screening of the
municipal and state proposals and an interactive planning process among municipal, federal, and state
governments. The programs would be subject to annual reviews by supervision missions and
negotiated between SPP and the states based on budgetary resources, technical and econoic
appraisal of the proposed packages of subprojecs. the annl reviews will also assess
implernentgu    .gesIn ea!ch state and sector during fth previosm Iea and prnose remnedial

Bank the 1990 and 1991 POA, and on January 31 of the remaining years of project execution, will
present the respective POAs per state, in a format acceptable to the Bank, to be the objea of the first
quarter annual reviews of the project. Performance indicators contained in :' nex 1, Attachment 2,

would be used to monitor pertormance in the investment programs, in conjunction with equity
indicators of investment allocation (para. 3. 16).
(a) Preiration -of Investment Prrans
3.67          The investment programs were prepared with Bank participation from the very start
using a 'bottom-up" approach with wide popular participation, in the following way:
O At a first seminar in Oaxaca, state officials and federal government representatives
defined the basic strategy, discussed sectoral priorities, and fixed criteria for program
formulation. They also agreed wide democratic participation was required to identify
needs and formulate projects.
O   Between the first and second seminar, state governments carried out detailed regional
studies based on existing surveys and defined subregional strategies for development
and poverty alleviation. State officials met with all municipal councils representing
the beneficiary population (about 70 per state, each representing about 100,000
persons) and asked them to enunciate the most urgent public investment needs for
each community and rank them by priority. These were computerized (in Hidalgo
there were about 20,000 project proposals) and then subjected to an initial screening
based on guidelines approved by the Bank and SPP.
o   Next, project packages were compared with sectoral/regional strategies and studied
from a technical perspective (technical feasibility and quick economic and social
analysis). Modular projects (like schools or health centers) were screened with the
same technical rules to minimize costs.
O   At a third seminar, in Hidalgo, a budget ceiling was given to each state and
allocation rules were agreed among regions within the states. Between the third and
the fourth seminar, an iterative process took place among municipalities, states, and
the SPP to choose a final investment program. Line and technical agencies and
ministries played an active part to assure the efficiency of the basic program. Simple
new criteria for analyzing investment programs were introduced: sectoral
composition, sectoral strategy compatibility, investment per person, and investment
per poor person per region (the last two indicators permitted monitoring the poverty
orientation of the program).
(b) Proposed Investment Programs
3.68          The total investment programs in the productive sectors (agriculture, forestry, and
fishing only), social sectors, and physical infrastructure average about US$620 million per year for
the four-year program, covering 1990 to 1993, and add up to about US$1,860 million'; (Mex$5,023
million). The result would be to increase investment in the four states over recent levels by about
20 percent in real terms in 1990 relative to 1989, and about 10 percent in real terms annually in
the following 3 years. The program represents a recovery to about 80 percent of the investment
program of the early 1980s. To facilitate disbursement, the Bank only finances the coe progam,
31.    The total public inveFfment program of the four mtes, including all sectors, is estimated to teach abut US$4 billion
in the 1990-93 period.

closely related to poverty alleviation, defined by the seven progranunatic categories of the CUD
Operational Manual, as shown in Table 3.6. lines (l){7). The core program should be regarded only
as illustrative, since it would be adjusted according to actual implementation capacity and available
financing.

3.69            Table 3.2 shows the initial distribution of the proposed overall program by state.
Investment per capita is lowtst in Guerrero. However, if investment is divided by the estimated
number of poor in each state (a rough measure of needs), Oaxaca has the lowest investment per
capita, followed closely by Chiapas and Guerrero. Hidalgo stands out with the highest, due to its
high implementation capacity.
3.70            Infrastructure building and social sector improvements account for almost 75 percent
of planned overall investment (see Table 3.3). This is understandable in view of (a) the needs
articulated by the communities, (b) the role of the public sector, (c) the large lags in infrastructure
building, and (d) the remoteness of most communities. The proposed road infrastructure has the
double appeal of giving communities access to social services (linking the community to the health
system or allowing school teachers to commute to villages) and permitting farmers to transport
surplus products to local mariets.

3.71          At subsector level, agriculture accounts for the largest share of productive projects
with 82 percent, and agroindustry accounts for most of the remainderO Roads comprise 78 perceat
of infrastructure projects, with rural electrification and storagelmarketing systems accounting for
about eight percent each. In the social sectors, education accounts for 46 percent, urbanization
(mainly housing) 25 percent, and water supply and sewerage take most of the remainder (health
investments are financed under the Health Sector Loan).

3.72     Table 3.4 shows investment per person in the different sectors based on total population
and on estimated numbers of poor per state. Hidalgo has the largest program in all sectors, whatever
indicator is used, in view of its having the largest implementation capability.
(c) Ipnu on Cat
3.73          A description of project management and organization is provided in section D, and
Annex l1. No new institutions would be created to implement the state investment plans.
Coordination would be carried out by SPP and the state planning secreariats, under the CUD
mechanism, one of the more sophisticated regional planning systems with the longest experience in
Latin America. Through this system, that started with the PIDERs and was followed by the PDRs of
the last Administration, investments even larger than those proposed have been implemented in the
early 1980s, before the fiscal retrenchment. Through the introduction of state COPLADEs, the
Operation Manual, and a Monitoring and Evaluation System, the regional planning system has clearly
reached maturity. Nevertheless, under the institutional development component discussed below, and
highlighted in Annex 1, Attachment 2, the project would continue to improve CUD medcanisms
(para. 3.79); strengthen Commissions for Municipal Development Planning (COPLADEMs) at the
municipal level (para. 3.83); improve project appraisal and selection (para. 3.17); improve the rules
for revenue sharing (paras. 3.26 and 3.28); introduce a quantum leap in monitoring and evaluation
(para. 3.94); and add environmental criteria (vara. 3.23).

3.74         As detailed in Annex 10, an analysis of execution capacity exists for building the
proposed infrastructure. Federal and state agencies were largely underfunded due to the fiscal
retrenchment in the investment program that, since 1983, has been cut by over 60 percent in most of
the sectors to be financed. The analysis of the 1990 investment program showed that about 8Q
percent of the construction activity was carried out by contracting to the private sector. Road
construction investment, for example, almost doubled in 1989, and last year the program represented
an increase of about one third, with dozens of private construction firms engaged in the program.
Almost all project preparation and technical feasibility studies would also be subcontracted to
consulting firms. There is no guarantee, of course, that implementation capacity is adequate for the
increased responsibilities that lower-level jurisdictions would have to assume. Therefore, plans for
hiring additional staff, mainly professional and engineers, have been formulated and started to be
implemented (see section 6 below).
3.75         Under the present CUD rules, if there is a serious slippage in the execution of an
agreed investment program, the state is penalized by reducing the floor for negotiating the following
year's investment programn to the amount that was implemented. In deciding on the levels of the
investment program, SPP and the Bank, would take in consideration the demonstrated institutional
capacity and the proposed institutional development program agreed with the state, including the
expansion of technical and engineering personnel required for an efficient implementation of the
investment subprojects.
S. PoectSupgorted Institutional PDevlogmmt
3.76         The project-supported Institutional Development Component aims at strengthening
existing organizational structures. The only new units created, the federal and state Special
Coordinating Groups, will become part of the permanent institutional structure. Extensive
institutional analysis was carried out of key federal and state agencies as well as of all
municipalities. Federal and four state groups were set for identifying institutional capacity gaps,
given the objectives of the project. Those groups reviewed interinstitutional relationships, and
analyzed, task by task, all functions currently assigned to each agency, and estimated what each
agency would require if decentralization were carried out. Municipalities within each state were
surveyed to define their stage of development.3 A detailed Institutional development program
was drawn up and cleared by SPP for each state and fedeal agency that would be involved in
project implementation during 1990-93 (para. 3.81). Institutional development in the health sector
would be financed and monitored through the Basic Health Care Project, in the water and sewerage
sector under the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Loan; in agriculture it would be monitored
through PROCATI; and in education through the Basic Education Project, after it is approved. The
present project coordinates those action programs by fimancing institutional development programs for
subproject preparation, appraisal, and design across sectors and for state and regional planning. It
also supports institutional development in the road and environment sectors. Detailed annual
operation programs will be drawn up, specifying actions, training, and technical assistance. These
programs will be reviewed by the Bank during the annual reviews and will be included as annexes to
the POAs. Prior to effectiveness, consultants with qualifications acceptable to the Bank will be hired,
under agreed terms of reference, to assist in the management of the institutional development
programs, and the first year institutional development program will be presented to the Bank. No

later than January 31 of 1992 and 1993, SPP will present to the Bank the proposed anual
institutiona development programs for the first quarter annual project reviews. These programs will
be monitored using the performance/progress indicators of Annex 1, Attachment 2.
Deeentralization of Public Expenditure Control
3.77          In 1990 the Government increased its allocation to regional investment programs by
about 17 percent nationwide, in real terms, compared to 1989. This included an increase in the CUD
budget of about 12 percent plus a transfer of investment resources from the federal line ministries to
regional programs under state control. The Policy Letter (Annex 1) summarizes the Government
actions proposed on: (a) decentralization in agriculture and roads described in the Decentralization
Matrix; and (b) state action programs for fiscal modernization and resource mobilization as well as
for improving equity in distribution of revenue-sharing among municipalities. The Banlk would have
the right to suspend disbursements if these programs are not satisfactorily implemented. In addition,
the following commitments of the Mexican Government are part of the Policy Letter:
(a)    a substantial increase in the investment for poverty alleviation. The federal
contribution under the CUD for each of the four states will be increased by at least
five percent in real terms per year during the 1990-1993 period over the federal
contribution given in 1989. By the end of FY93 the federal contribution under the
CUD for the four states combined would be at least 50 percent above the 1989 level,
in real terms;
(b)    a considerable transfer (nationwide) of investments controlled by federal line agencies
under the Programa Normal Federal to the CUD, over the 1991-93 period, carried out
through the PNS, that in 1991 was allocated 15 percent of total public investment; and
(c)    an increase in the federal allocation to the municipal funds (FMS) by a minimum of
5 percent a year, in real terms, during 1991, 1992 and 1993, in the four project
statesNs.
3.78          Nationwide, current and capital expenditures associated with the activities to be
decentralized account for about 10 percent of federal expenditures. These will be gradually
transferred to the states, implying a decrease in federal control from 80 percent to 70 percent, with a
yearly decrease of 3.3 percent in the 1990-93 period. To effect such transfers, functions being
decentralized will be costed state by state, and the amounts will be transferred to the states from the
respective sectoral ministries through the federal budget. Ihe annual operational institutional
development programs will specify the actions required in the gradual decentralization process.
(a) Strengthening State Institutions
3.79          The program for improving state administration involves: (a) reinforcing the state
capabilities for strategic planning, project evaluation, and resource management; (b) improving the
system of budgeting, controlling, and auditing public accounts; (c) increasing the capacity for
technical assistance to municipalities; (d) improving technical assistance for agriculture and rural
35.   In 1990 about 10 pevent of the CUD was executed by municipalities in the four states through the FMS.

extension; (e) increasing implementation capacity of state and road agencies;T3 and (f) increasing the
capability for designing social sector programs.
3.80         Interinstitigonl relatignshis have been defined clearly at the different levels of
government and among all involved federal and state agencies as well as municipalities. Particular
attention has been paid to the elimination of parallel structures. Functions analyzed include planning,
budgeting, execution, and monitoring. Disaggregation of those roles into more precise functions and
tasks took place. A committee In each state will supervise the administrative reform during the
r.ext four years. That committee will make recommenaations to the state governments at the
end of each year for possible readjustments and fine-tuning.
3.81         Institutional capacity gps were identified for every implementing agency or
administrative unit with some project involvement in terms of projet functons and tasks, including
deficiencies in legislation and interinstitutional and internal organizational problems. The project
would help to bridge or mitigate these gaps through the following subcomponents (detailed cost tables
are in Annex 10, Attachment 1):
(a)    Tecnical Assistance, including (i) 22 staff months of organization and financial
management specialists for the central level and as many more for each of the four
states, for a total of 110 staff months; (ii) 50 person-months for each state road
institution, for a total of 200 staff-months; and (iii) assistance in the development of
an updated SCT manual for the feeder roads. This assistance would help install
modem project management procedures and review norms, inter-institutional
relationships, and internal distribution of functions so as to establish, as early as
possible, a smooth flow of management functions at the federal level and between the
federal, state, and municipal levels. Thereafter, they would help launch and deliver
training activities accordingly. The total cost of this subcomponent is US$5.9 million.
(b)    Skill Uperading Activities, including over 200 training activities, informative
meetings, courses, seminars, fellowships, and others. These training activities would
help bridge gaps in (i) management skills such as overall project management and
coordination functions; (ii) professional skills such as planning, programming and
budgeting, public finance control (auditing), and supervision activities; (iii) technical
skills such as systems operation, monitoring and evaluation, budgeting, and project
appraisal; and (iv) engineering design and supervision. Total cost of this
subcomponent is estimated at US$5.5 million.
(c)    Equipment, providing for purchase of office equipment, furniture, and technical
equipment; and printing information and diffusion material. The cost of this
subcomponent is included in the state investment programs.
(d)    Technical Assistance and other support for the operation of the Indian Development
Funds. Total cost of this subcomponent is estimated at US$3.2 million.
3.82         Four studies will be undertaken, along with a living standard measurement survey, to
improve the knowledge of social conditions in these states. Topics to be studied are: (a) project
identification in the four states; (b) rural employment and specific needs of poor migrant households,

(c) marketing of basic staples; and (d) Indian Development Funds-socioeonomic monitoring and
evaluation. These studies will help to better monitor the implementation and impact of the program
and provide information for further policy refom (e.g., on marketing of staples and on obstacles to
enterprise development). Terms of reference are provided in Annex 14. Estimated total cos is
US$4.2 million, including about US$2 million for the base line study of living standards.
(b)    gthuing MunicigaiLi
3.83         Municipalities in the four states are at extremely varied stages of development. While
some municipalities in major cities already enjoy relatively sophisticated administration, others are not
able to perform simple administrative functions. A typology of municipalities developed within the
project groups municipalities into four stages of development. For each group a development strategy
has been formulated in terms of instinal development, training, and technical assistance.
Subregional offices, coordinated by COPLADEs, have been set up to provide technical assistance to
municipalities. Increasingly, funds are channeled from states to municipalities through Development
Agreements between States and Municipalities (CUDEMUNs), with federal participation, that are part
of the annual negotiated programs.
(c) Shrnthening lmtitutions to Implement Environm_ntal PoliHde
3.84         Mexico has an adequate legal basis for environmental protection, but it lacks the
institutional capability to enforce the law. The environmental objectives of the project are to:
(a) ensure that the investment program pursued in the project states does not cause further degradation
of the enviretiment; (b) support the protection of natural reserve areas, particularly the Lacandona
Reserve, th last tropical humid forest in Mexico; and (c) strengthen state institutions that work on
environm  Wal issues. Annex 9 provides an analysis of the environmental component.
3.85         The project would seek to strengthen environmental management instruments in the
four states by providing additional higher- and medium-level staff, training, operational support and
equipment, improvements in subproject assessment, support for drafting state and municipal
environmental legislation and regulations, agroecological zoning, and other support activities as
needed. It will support SEDUE state offices as well as environmental services to be provided by state
and municipal agencies.
3.86         The project would help to pro   natural areas in the four states by upgrading patrol
services, preparing management plans, consolidating land tenure as needed, organizing community
action programs in buffer zones, and other measures. It will give priority to protection services for
the most threatened sites.
3.87         The institutional development component described in sections (a) to (c) would be
monitored through the performance and progress indicators in Annex 1, Attachment 2.
D. Project Organization and Managent
3.88         Structure and Functions. SPP, as the executing agency, would have primary
responsibility for the project. The PNS Unit within SPP coordinates the national program. PNS
finances projects for poverty alleviation nationwide according to evaluation criteria similar to those
used in the four states. The PNS, at the federal level, would have a Special Coordinating Group
(SCG) with a core staff assigned to support the project in the four disadvantaged states. Similar



-43 -
SCGs would be designated within the sate planning office in each sat. SCG members would
include staff from budgeting and pro g, financial ad an, n n  and evaluation,
and technical support. The functions of the SCGs and a project organIzational chart are provided in
Annex 11.
3.89         SPP at federal level would coordinate implementation of the project through the CUD
system, with state and federal line agencies working in the states providing the actions and technical
assistance required. Ile baic oeratinal instpment to be uSed for proxect ilmlmentation would be
hie CUD Operational Manual for the CUD. and the Oerationa  anual for the FMS. SPP will
apply the project appraisal and selection systems, as well as other guidelines of the CUD Operational
Manual (M  uln Unico de          , which incorporates the Ugiig g   lat g il n X
Exeines Tecncos SkJiticzdX to subprojects other than those financed though the FMS, for
which a specific manual has been implemented. These opeational manuals would not be changed
without Bank's consent. Executing agencies of the investment program are described in Annex 10.
All executing agencies including states and municipalities would be coordinated through the CUD
mechanism. ITe Municipal Funds projects would be executed by the municipalities under the control
of state governments.
3.90         State governments, through the planning secretariats, are responsible for defining and
coordinating all development strategies, plans, and state-level institutional efforts. To define financial
responsibility clearly, a separate account for each state will be mainned. Thus, if a state is non-
compliant, the Bank can stop disbursements to that ste alone.
3.91         Decentalization is coordinated by SPP as part of its responsibility for formulating
expenditure policies. The line ministries of agricuS.re, health, education, and communication and
rtanspor are responsible, in coordination with the state secretariats, for the process of decentralization
in their sectors.
3.92         Project implementation and supervision would be enhanced through seminars,
organized at state level, where representatives from the four states, the federal level, and the Bank
would be present. Such seminars would take place twice a year, rotate among the states, and cover
preparation of state investment programs, comparison of experiences, ad evaluation of progress
achieved under each project.
3.93         Fund Flow Progeutes (Annex 11, Attachments 2 and 3). Once SPP authorizes a
state's annual plans and agrees on financing, it requests the Treasury to open a revolving account for
each state at a correspondent bank through Banco de Mexico. NAFIN, with Bank funds, opens a
special account at the Central Bank. After agencies execute their projects, they prepare SOEs and
submit them for payment at the designated bank. The SPP regional delegate office prepares summary
sheets of expenditures which are first aggregated at the state level, and overall, subsequently, at the
project level to be submitted as summary SOEs by NARIN for Bank disbursement, under the Special
Account.
1. Projeet Monitoring and Ezaluaion ME)
3.94         The project would introduce rigorous and systematic monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) methods including an improved data collection system and expanded electronic capacity
(Annex 12). Procedures have already been adopted to allow tracing of subproject costs and execution



-44 -
over a umMber of years. Additional monitorable variables,X3 besides those related to financial and
phyical progress, would be intrduced to address the performnce and achievemen of subproject
objectives, completion status, ex-post utilization of works or outputs, and status of participation in
cost recovery and operations and maintenance. Extensive improvements are expected, for example,
in more appropriate and timely feedback, in project implementation hough the use of simplified
formats, and in more efficient task distribution between federal and state levels. A draft manual
outlining definitions, functions, and procedures proposed for federal, state, and project levels for
M&E has been agreed with the Bank and formally approved. The unit to carry out those functions has
also been appropriately staffed. That the Monitoring and Evaluation System be established and
operational would be a condition for effectiyness.
3.95         Macro-indicators to measure overall project progress and performance are included
in Annex 1, Attachment 2. For the subcomponents involving indigenous areas and environment,
separate indicators are being prepared. For the investment program, investment expenditures per
capita and per poor, by regions, will be used as the main indicators of progress and performance.
State poverty ind--es as well as executing agency and NGO monitoring databases would provide
baseline and supplementary information for evaluation. Additional information would be provided by
introduction of the proposed living standard minimum survey.
3.96         Monitoring the progress of the project at the state level would be the responsibility of
the M&E section of the state SCG and quarterly progress reports would be submitted to the federal
SCG Unit. The federal SCO Unit would then consolidate these reports and submit an annual project
progress repoft to the Bank no later than the end of the second quarter of each year, which would
incorporate the recommendations of the annual project reviews. The format, as agreed with the
Bank, would reflect the information provided through the above M&E system.
3.97         The M&E system is being improved by cross-fertilization among states and with Bank
assistance. The system to be introduced under the proposed project would make it possible to
monitor improvement in the quality of public services, especially in the area of institutional reform.
The system would permit classification of projects by agency and thus clarify agencies'
responsibilities in project activity. It would also guide impact analysis at the community level and
help in formulating regional and sectoral policies. The use of the new appraisal techniques will
improve routine monitoring and provide more precise information on causes for shortfalls that may
arise. The application of expert systems for certain M&E functions would be developed. The
Government agreed that an annual evaluation of the project would be carried out by the federal M&E
Unit by January 31 of each year to provide conclusions and recommendations simultaneously with the
SP/Bank annual project review in the first quarter of each year.
2. Procurenent
3.98         The figure below gives the distribution of subprojects by size. It shows that about
US$180 million of total project costs would be executed through the FMS in projects that in size
cannot exceed US$25,000. It also shows that about half of the total project. cost would be spent in
subprojects costing less than US$150,000 individually. Civil works under the project would consist
mainly of a large number of small and scattered subprojects for construction and rehabilitation of
rural roads, small-scale irrigation, rural electrification, water supply systems, and primary and

secondar schools. A large number of individual construction works will be spread over the four
states and will be mostly sma and labor-intensive. Mexico has a competitive construction industry
capable of carrying out this type of project work. Many social community investments would be
carried out by the beneficiaries themselves under written agreements (convenios) with the
municipalities, through the FMS or federal supervizory line agencies. This would be the case for the
many small civil works and maiatenance projects carried out by communities, ejidos, small producer
organizations, and NGOs under the FMS, where quantities of works cannot be well defined in
advance and where works are small and scattered in remote areas with no local contractors interest
or available. In the case of the many small community subprojecs carried out by the FMS,
communities are required to provide free unskilled labor and local materials. Since those works are
scattered throughout more than 800 municipalities, and expected to be very small in size, in many
cases only one or very few suppliers in the area would be able to supply the goods or materials
required. Ihus, in order to recgn1ize the poverty alleviation and community participation efforts,
direct contracting is allowed, but restricted to purchasing of construction materials and small goods
for the FMS.
3.99         For subprojects to be financed under the CUD, procurement for civil wort contracts
costing below US$5 million and above US$150,000 and for goods costing less than US$250,000
equivalent and more than US$50,000 would be done through local competitive bidding (LCB), under

procedures acceptable to the Bank. This is expected to account for US$1,030 million, or about
76 percent of project costs. Procurement of civil works costing more than USS5 million and for
god costing more than US$250,000 equivalent would be done through international competitive
bidding (ICB) in agreement with the Bank's guidelines. This is expected to account for US$90
million, or about seven percent of project costs. Procurem.ent for civil works costing US$150,000
equivalent or less and for goods costing US$50,000 or less could be done through local shopping.
Local shopping would not exceed an aggregate amount of US$100 million for civil works and
US$20 million for goods, or about 8.8 percent of project costs. Recognizing the special
characteristics of the FMS, direct purchasing would be allowed, when carried out by the Funds, for
construction materials costing US$15,000 or less per contract and goods costing USS5,000 or less per

contact for an aggregate amount not exceedi  US$80 million for contuction matcrials and US$20
million for goods. In no case shall more than US$5,000 of goods and US$15,000 equivalent of
contruction materials be pcred through direct contract  for any particular subprojet.
3.100          In order to ensure tbat procurement procedures under the FMS have been followed, a
procurement audit would be carried out under the general auditing discussed below. Such auditing
would review on a sample of subprojects: (a) the procurement method used; (b) the unit prices paid;
and (c) the physical location of the materials and goods utilized. The scope of such audit would be
reflected in the terms of reference to be agreed with SECOGEF.
3.101          Standard Bidding Documents for Mexico, agreed to by Mexican authorities and the
Bank in Cuernavaca (Cuernavaca Agreement) in April 1990, will be used for procurement during
project execution. The selection and apponment of consulta   for stdis and wehnical assistance,
estimated to account for US$18 million, would follow the August 1981 Bank Guidelines for the Use
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency.
3.102         Table 3.5 shows the procurement procedures for the project. Prior review of
procurement documentation by the Bank would include all contracts for civil works over US$5
million, all contracts for goods over US$250,000 under ICB, the first three LCB contracts for works
and goods in each state, regardless of size, and all LCB contracts for works over US$2.5 million.
The balance of contracts would be subject to random post review by the Bank after contract award.
All procurement documents would be kept by the executing agencies and made available for Bank
review on request. The Bank has agreed on sample bidding documents that would be used.

3.103        The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed at a me of SD percent against the eight
specific categories defined in Table 3.6 that correspond to the program classificaion used by SPP for
the state investment programs. At this rate, there is a                     = ere  Ua  Main fo colltin SOEs
an sqmitting them to Bank dsbument, a difficult task in a project with predominantly small
subprojec. 'Me proceeds would be used to finance civil worlcs, equipment, and materials.
Technical assistance, cultual site restoration, and environmental protection expenditures would be
financed at a rate of 100 percent. All disbursements ta do not have prior procurement review
would be made against SOEs prepared and certified by SPP. Those contracts that have prior
prcurae_t review (see para. 3.12) would be disbursed att full  cn ti. SOEs
would be consolidated mnonthly by the state PNS unit on the basis of supportive documents received
frvm the executing agencies.
3.104        Tle Government provided assurances that the SPP regional offices would be
adequately equipped, staffed, and operated in order to provide technical and management support for
project execution and processing of all required documentation. Supporting documents would be
retained by the state planning secretariat and line agencies and made available for examination by the
Bank during supervision missions. All SOEs would be transmitted through NAFIN. SPP would have
to submit to the Bank, for all subprojects, prior to submission for disbursement, a form describing the
subproject and the results of the financial, social, and economic analysis carried out.
3.105        To facilitate Bank disbursements, a special account would be opened in the Central
Bank with an initial deposit of US$35.0 million, equivalent to about four months' disbursements.
Withdrawals from this account would be supported by the required documentation. Separate project
acounts would be established and maintained by SPP in each state.
3.106        To enable SPP and the executing agencies to support the already ongoing PNS
program as soon as possible, project expenditures incurred prior to loan signing but after May 1,
1990 (time of appraisal), but not maore than 12 months prior to signature, would be eligible for
reimbursement up to 10 percent of the loan (US$35.0 million). Claims for retroactive expenditures
would be made not later than six months after loan effectiveness. Disbursements, estimated to be in
line with past experience with PIDER HI and in accordance with the Government's strong political
and budgetary commitment, are expected to occur over five years (see estimated disbursement
schedule in Annex 15). Completion date for the project would be June 1995, and the closing date for
disbursements would be December 31, 1995.

4. Audit
3.107          Prior to submiss.on to the Bank, all financial statements and documents, including
SOEs for which reimbursement would be claimed from the Bank loan, would be subject to
independent review and approval by SPP in accordance with its established control procedures.
Records and accounts maintained by Project States would be audited by private firms designated in
accordance with the Bank's current understanding with SECOGEF. Each participating agency,
including the Central Bank and the participating banks, would maintain separate accounts for project
expenditures. These accounts, and the Special Account, would be audited every year by independent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations assurances were provided from the federal and
the state govermnents that: (a) the Special Account and the project accounts would be maintained and
audited annually according to practices satisfactory to the Bank; (b) terms of reference for the auditors
would include, inter alia, audit of the SOEs for the project accounts (NAFIN and SPP); and (c) copies
of all annual audit reports would be submitted to the bank within six months of the close of each
project fiscal year.
3.108           Auditing of SPP and other federal agencies would be framed within the general
agreement that exists between the Bank and Mexico and taking into account as much as possible the
availability of audit skills at the state level. For those projects executed by states and municipalities,
SECOGEF would prepare the terms of reference, stratify the sample of projects to be audited, plan
the audits, and designate acceptable private state audit firms to be agreed before loan effectiveness.
Agreement on these arrangements were reached during negotiations. The terms of reference for such
auditing would have to be agreed with the Bank prior to loan effectiveness. The private audit firms
may count on the cooperation of the technical staff of the State Control Secretariat and would perform
the audits under the coordinatior. of SECOGEF. They would issue individual audit reports for each
state and for Bank purposes accompanied by an adherence opinion by SECOGEF no later than six
months after the close of the fiscal year. The fee for hiring private auditing firms would be charged
to the loan funds, financed under technical assistance.

5. BainSuorsion
3.109        The proposed project would require extensive and close supervision. Besides Bank
normal supervision of all Bank procedures, two seminars will take place, annually. The first
SPP/Bank annual projxct review, to take place in the first quarter of each year, and beginning in
1991, with the participation of the states will assess: (a) progress of the implementation of the
investment program (Annex 1, Attachment 2); (b) the proposed POAs for each of the four states,
using the criteria indicated in para. 3.16, and adjust them to the implementation experience; (d)
progress of the institutional development programs for the four states would be monitored with the
program contained in Annex I, Attachment 2 and developed ir project file documents state by state;
and (d) progress on decentralization and other policy measures agreed in the Policy Letter (Annex 1).
The second seminar will take place by mid-year and will assess implementation issues that have a
commonality to all the states and are of importance for the success of the project. In order to
supervise the large number of civil works, to help the task manager in screening individual projects
that are required to be presented under the loan, encourage and facilitate procurement and
disbursement procedures and help in the implementation process, LAC Country Department II is
planning to station a rural engineer in the Bank's Resident Mission in Mexico.
E. Proiect C:osts
3.110         Total project costs are estimated to be US$1,362.7 million, including US$1,301.6
million for the investment program, and US$61.1 million for technical assistance and conservation of
the environment and cultural patrimony. Annex 7 gives the sectoral and regional composition of the
project components that have been chosen for cost-sharing by the Bank. These estimations have to be
taken as indicative, since revisions could be made in light of implementation capabilities. About 46
percent corresponds to infrastructure projects (roads and power systems), 30 percent to productive
projects (agriculture, forestry and agroindustries), and 24 percent to social projects (education, water
supply, and sewerage systems). These subsectors have been chosen because they are spread over all
regions in the four stes, the poverty orientation of the project and the partition of investment
projects between this project and the Health and Basic Education projects. Oaxaca would account for
about 32 percent of the project with US$431 million, Hidalgo 25 percent (US$334 million), Chiapas
24 percent (US$331 million), and Guerrero 19 percent (US$260 million). The investment program is
composed of about 17,600 subprojects.
3.111        Foreign exchange costs represent about 31 percent of the total project base costs,
representing all direct and indirect costs, and total US$352.7 million. Bank financing of US$350
million would cover about 26 percent of total project costs or 31 percent of the total base cost
CTable 3.7), but equivalent to 78 percent of the foreign exchange costs.

3.112          Costs are based on March 1990 prices and converted at the exchange rate of US$1 to
Mex$2,700 pesos. Costs for civil works and equipments are based on the technical norms of the
sectoral agencies. Fees for technical assistance and other professional services were based on the
Bank's experience with similar locally and internationally recruited experts in the region. Physical
contingencies were computed as 10 percent of the total investment programs, since a large part of the
program is composed of standard projects in which the technical agencies have great experience.
Price contingencies were calculated on a dollar inflation rate of 4.9 percent p.a. and assuming that the
Mexican peso would be adjusted following the purchasing power parity.
F. Benefits and Risks
3.113          Major benefits are expected from (a) improvement in the efficiency of public
administration associated with the effort at furthering and rationalizing decentralization; (b) greater
equity in the financing and provision of public goods to various population groups, sustained by a
permanent change in the formulas for resource allocation; (c) increased capability of the states and
municipalities to carry out development efforts on behalf of the poorest populations; and henceforth
(d) improvement of the welfare of the marginal groups.
3.114          The state programs have been designed clearly under the basic orientation of PNS as
poverty alleviation programs. Since the percentage of people below the absolute poverty line in the
four states is above 50, and rural poverty in most regions exceeds 80 percent, most investments in
rural infrastructure and social sectors will clearly benefit the poor. Moreover, public works under the
proiect would generate an estimated 230.000 man-years of employment in the fur states.

3.115          It is difficult to measure the number of beneficiaries without double counting.
Although the projects have identified the number of beneficiaries-this type of information was
collected for the first time during project preparation-the same community may benefit from a
school, a road, and/or a small irrigation project. With that in mind, Table 3.8 refers mainly to
projects with a local impact. Statewide or regional projects, such as agricultural technical assistance
or an animal sanitary project, have been exduded. Table 3.8 shows that the rural infrastructure
projects, where most investment is concentrated, have a wider impact and would benefit from 1
million to 1.5 million people in each state (lowest number in Guerrero, largest in Chiapas). The
number of beneficiaries from productive projects ranges from about 150,000 in Chiapas to about
700,000 in Hidalgo.
3.116           Risks. In a project of this complexity risks may arise in the implementation of
different actions and programs. One of the main risks is that the decentralization policy may not be
carried out as forcefully and efficiently as required. To mitigate this risk during project preparation,
detailed and realistic decentralization programs were sought from each of the line secretariats. A
concerted effort between SPP and each of the line secretariats has been agreed upon. However, it is
possible that the states might not accept additional responsibilities. In order to mitigate this risk (a) in
the proposed investment program there are sufficient resources to rehabilitate deteriorated
infrastructure before it is transferred to the states, and (b) institutional development activities would
strengthen the state institutions to receive those tasks. That is the case of rral roads, for which the
states require that the network be transferred in a reasonable state of maintenance, requiring important
investments from the federal government. The Bank would continue to seek through the general
policy dialogue to increase resources for maintenance nationwideP.
3.117          Because the administrative structures of the poorest states are the most deficient, the
institutional ucvraument component is an important instrument for strengthening their capacity.
First, decentralizatiokA -ill be carried out under monitorable conditions and would be accelerated only
in cases that is required for a substantive improvement in services or project operation. Second, the
expansion in the investment programs will be largely dependent on the private sector and contracting.
Third, to strengthen state agc:ies that would either receive additional functions from line agencies or

that represent a bottleneck for subproject success, annual institutional development programs would be
developed. Finally, municipalities would be assisted through various programs of administrative
strengthening by the National Institute of Public Administration '(NAP), their capacity for project
formulation by BANOBRAS and state offices to directly provide technical assistance. More details are
provided in Annex 10.
3.118        Another risk could arise from conflicts of interest between the federal and state
governments in the implementation of the state development plans. The CUD mechanism has been
designed for resolving such conflicts, and a high degree of congruency was manifest during project
preparation. Disbursement for the project may not be as fast as desired in view of the enormous
dispersion of subprojects and the need to gather such a large number of CLCs. Project preparation
has streamlined as much as possible the guidelines for aggregation and justification of expenditures in
compliance with Bank rules. Furthermore, decentralization from states to municipalities is being
strongly encouraged by the municipal funds. There is also the risk that some investment decisions
become subject to political influence and money might be misdirected or misappropriated. Most of
the investment program (in terms of specific subprojects) has already been programmed (Annex 4)
using a set of agreed upon guidelines and selection criteria. The audit procedures, carefully designed
for the project, would combine federal, state and independent audits as well as informal methods in
local communities to control the use of funds.
3.119        There is a risk that population pressure and social conflict in the Lacandona Reserve
may impede implementation of the protection plan. Project preparation assisted in the design of
detailed programs and sought actual commitment from the agencies involved. In case such a plan is
not satisfactorily implemented, the Bank would reserve the right to suspend disbursements to Chiapas.

MEXICO
DECENTRALIZATION AND REQIQNAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
FOR THE DISADVANTAGED STATES
Policy Lete
February 27, 1991
Mr. Barber B. Conable
President
World Bank
Dear Mr. President:
Within the context of its development policy, the Govermment of Mexico has attached
special priority to the fight against extreme poverty, an issue that has become more urgent for a large
number of Mexicans as a result of the economic crisis of the last decade.
The National Solidarity Program is the framework for State and community efforts to
confront the symptoms and causes of the poverty affecting
the poorest groups in Mexico.
The Decentralization and Regional Development Project for the States of Chiapas,
Guerrero, Hidalgo and Oaxaca is part of the efforts being made to improve the living conditions of
the population in these jurisdictions, which are among the poorest in Mexico. The project includes
actions in the area of decentralization and institution-building and a substantial increase in the public
expenditure allocated to the development of these States and their Municipalities.
The Federal Government has carried out important functions and resource decentralization
actions in the four project states in sectors such as education, health, agriculture, and agroindustry.
In addition, it has strengthened the decision-making capacity of its offices in the four states.
The Federal Government will continue to support the decentralization policy, mainly in
areas such as transfer of basic health and primary education functions, increasing the states' and
municipalities participation in the operation and maintenance of rural roads, agricultural extension
and transfer of agroindustry infrastructure to producer organizations.
The decentralization of responsibilities towards the project states will be accompanied by
adequate budgetary resources. The Federal Government will continue to support indigenous
populations with resources allocated for these purposes and the budget of the Municipal Solidarity
Funds will be increased to strengthen the management and development .apacity of local governments
and communities.
In order to strengthen the decentralization process to municipalities, the Federal
Government and the participating states channeled Mex$I 10,000 million during 1990 to the 840
municipalities of the four states.



-57 -                               Annex IL
Page 2 of 3
The Government, through the PNS progran, will continue the policy o; decentralization
of the investment program and of transferring support from the federal budget to the states. In 1991
the PNS program will amount to Mex$5. 1 billion, representing 1S percent of the total public
investment program.
To provide impetus to the decentralization strategy and the fight against poverty, the
Mexican Government is taking significant steps in the following areas:
(a) Fiscal Deentralization and AdiusMIeMt ofl thg Tax Receipts System. All the states
included in the project are reviewing their systems for the distribution of tax receipts to
the municipalities, through the system of revenue-sharing. The aim is to make revenue-
sharing more efficient and equitable as well as more transparent. In all states not less
than 20 percent of the General, Complementary and Municipal Funds would be allocated
to municipalities within the agreements of the Fiscal Coordination Law. The state of
liidalg has already reformed its revenue-sharing system. Ihe formula for resource
allocation is contained in the new Fiscal Coordination Law published on December 30,
1989, which came into force on January 1, 1990. ThIs law establishes the new factors
governing the distribution of the Single Receipts Fund to municipalities, as follows: 45
percent of the Fund in direct proportion to the population of each municipality; another
45 percent as a function of the degree of backwardness of each municipality; 5 percent in
line with the amount of Federal tax receipts collected by each municipality; and 5 percent
in line with the number of communities in each municipality. These factors heavily favor
the poor communities. The other three states have initiated the studies required for
modernization of their revenue-sharing formulas in order to achieve the objectives
enunciated above.
(b) Expendiure Planning ana Control. The activities undertaken by the present Federal
Government to strengthen coordination arrangements among Federal, state and municipal
bodies are designed to enhance the machinery and instruments of state, regional and local
planning. Decentralization, simplification and deregulation are fundamental to the
efficient redistribution of functions, responsibilities and resources, and the actions taken
have led to more efficient and flexible management of programs.
(c) Modernization of State Fiscal Systems and Improvement in Tax Collection. In order to
codify and modernize the fiscal systems of the four states, studies have been initiated. In
this area significant progress has already been achieved in the collection of property taxes
ranging from 300 to 800 percent increases during the last fiscal year. In order to
continue improvement of tax collections, all states have already launched programs of
cadastre updating. Ihese programs would start in the most important urban areas where
there is more potential for revenue increase. The states intend also to achieve significant
improvement in collection of water charges.
The Federal Government agrees with and supports the above aims. To further such aims,
the Federal Government commits within the course of the Project to promote, through negotiations
with each of the Project States:
(a) the establishment of an appropriate fiscal framework including codes, collection and
operation of local taxes,

(b) through SPP and in   ction with SHCP,           ins thm  sn hemes f  alocatWion of
developmen rCes      of the fur Ptoject Stat, by revewing the fomula with the

to make it more tasp       and equitable.
Target for lbi 2ecntaliz  ati    OmWa Ded  M kc=
To ensure that project objectves are achieved in the projet states, the Mexican Govern-
ment will:
(a) Ensure tha tfe fedeal coniutin under the CUD for each of the four states separately
will be incaed by at least five percent in rea terms per year during the 1990-1993
peid over the base (base 1) which sall be the federal contrition under the CUD for
each such project stat, in Fiscal Year 1989, and that by the end of Fiscal Year 1993, the
totl federal contribution under the CUD for all tie projet sta  combined be icresed
by no less than 50 percent in real terms over the base (base 2) which shall be the
combined federal contribution under the CUD for all project states in Fiscal Year 1989.
(b) Increase the municipalities' fund by a minimum of 5 percent a year during 1991, 1992,
amn 1993 in the four project states.
(c) Continue, through the PNS program, the policy of decenralization of the investment
program and of transferng support from the federa budget to the states.
(d) Review pemanenly the reguations goveming the expenditure of the resources thus trans-
ferred, in order to further simplify the process.
Sincerely yours,
Lic. Ernesto Zedillo

El Gobierno de la Republica ha asignado dentro de su poiftica de desarrollo, una alta
prioridad al combate a la pobreza extrema, en nuestro pais.
El Programa Nacional de Solidaridad constituye el marco que orienta los esfuerzos quo
realizan el Estado y la Sociedad Mexicana, para enfrentar las manifestaciones y causas
de las condiciones de pobreza de los grupos menos favorecidos.
El Proyecto de Descentralizaci6n y Desarrollo Regional para los Estados de Chiapas,
Guerrero, Hidalgo y Oaxaca, es parte de los esfuerzos que se vienen realizando para
mejorar las condiciones de bienestar de la poblaci6n de esas entidades, las cuales fl9uran
entre las mas pobres de Mexico. El proyecto comprende acciones en matena de
descentralizaci6n y fortalecimiento institucional, asf como un incremento sustanfivo en el
gasto publico asignado al desarrollo de esas entidades y sus municiplos.
El Gobierno Federal ha iniciado un importante proceso de descentralizaci6n de recursos
y funciones hacia esos Estados, principalmente en los sectores de educaci6n, salud,
agricultura y agroindustria. Adicaonalmente, ha reforzado la capacidad de toma de
decisiones de sus delegaciones en estas entidades federativas.
El Gobiemo Federal continuara apoyando la politica de descentralizaci6n, principalmente
en relaci6n a los servicios de salud basica y educaci6n elemental. Propiciari ademas una
mnayor participaci6n do los estados y municipios en la operacion y mantenimiento de los
caminos rura7es y on los sorvicios do extensionismo saola, y facilitar4 la transferencia

La descentralizaci6n de responsabilidades hacia los Estados del proyecto ser6 sustentada
en adecuados recursos presupuestales. El Gobiemo Federal continuarf apoyando el
desarrollo de las comunidades ind(genas asignando recursos para este proposito. Los
Fondos Municipales de Solidaridad seran incrementados para reforzar la capacidad
administrativa y de desarrollo de los gobiemos locales y de sus comunidades. En este
sentido, en 1990, a las 840 municipalikades existentes en los cuatro Estados del proyeco
se canalizaron 110 mil millones de pesos.

SECIETAARiA OE PROGRAMACION
Y PRESUPUESTO
El Gobierno, a trav6s del Programa Nacional de Solidaridad continuara la poliftica de
descentralizaci6n de los programas de inversi6n y de transferencias para et desarrollo
hacia los Estados. En 1991 el Programa Nacional de Solidaridad cuenta con un
presupuesto autorizado de recursos federales de 5.1 billones de pesos, que representa
el 15% del total del gasto de inversi8n publica federal presupuestal en el pa(s.
Para reforzar la estrategia de descentralizaci6n y el ataque a la pobreza, el Gobierno
Mexicano esti avanzando en las siguientes dreas:
a) DescentralIzacl6n Fiscal y Ajustes en el Slstema de participaclones.
Todos los Estados incluidos en el Proyecto estan revisando sus sistemas de distribuci6n
de participaciones a sus municipios, con el objetivo de hacerlo mas eficiente, equitativo y
transparente.
En todos los Estados no menos del 20% del fondo general y complementario de
articipaciones sera asignado a los municipios, de conformidad con lo establecido en la
Ley de Coordinaci6n Fiscal.
El Estado de Hidalgo ya reform6 su sistema de ingreso-participaci6n y la f6rmula para
asignaci6n de recursos estA contenida en la nueva Ley de Coordinaci6n Fiscal publicada
el 3 de diciembre de 1989, que entr6 en vigor a partir del primero de enero de 1990. Esta
Ley establece los nuevos factores quo regirAn la distribuci6n de las participaciones
generales a los municipios del Estado como sigue: 45% del Fondo en proporci6n directa
a la poblaci6n de cada municiplo; otro 45% en funci6n del grado de marginalidad de cada
municipio; 5% en relaci6n al numero de localidades en cada municipio y 5% en relaci6n
con los impuestos federales captados en cada municipio.
Estos factores favorecen mayormente a las comunidades mAs pobres. Los otros tres
Estados han inicdado los estudios requeridos para modernizar sus f6rmulas de
ingreso-distribuci6n a efecto de alcanzar los objetivosd antes enunciados.
b) PlaneacI6n y Control del gasto.
Las actMidades realizadas por la presente Administraci6n Federal para reforzar la
coordinaci6n entre las estructuras federales, estatales y municipales han sido disefladas
para ampliar la maquinaria y los instrumentos do planeaci6n estatal, regional y local. La

descentralizaci6n, la simplificaci6n y la desregulaci6n son los elementos basicos para una
eficientre redistribucid6n de funciones, responsabilidades y recursos, y las acciones
realizadas han propiclado un manejo de programas m6s eficiente y flexible.
C) Modernizacl6n de los sistemas flscales estatales y mejoramlento de la
recaudacl6n de Impuestos.
Se han iniciado estudios para codificar y modemizar los sistemas fiscales de los cuatro
Estados. En este sentido se ha logrado un progreso significativo en relaci6n con la
recaudaci6n del impuesto predial con incrementos que van del 300 al 800 por ciento en
el utltimo aiio fiscal. Para continuar mejorando la recaudaci6n fiscal, todos los estados
han iniciado programas de actualizaci6n catastral. Estos programas se iniciaran en las
areas urbanas mas importantes donde existe mayor potencial para incrementar la
recaudaci6n.
Los Estados tambien esperan alcanzar un mejoramiento sustantivo en maeeria de
recaudaci6n por cuotas de consumo de agua.
El Gobierno Federal esta de acuerdo y apoya los objetivos anteriores. Para fomentar tales
objetivos, el Gobierno Federal se compromete durante el desarrollo del proyecto a realizar
negociaciones con cada uno de los Estados para que:
i) Se establezca una estructura fiscal apropiada que comprenda c6digos y reglamentos
para la recaudacion y operaci6n de los impuestos locales.
ii) A trav6s de la SPP y con la participaci6n de la SHCP, se realicen ajustes en los
esquemas de asignaci6n de recursos en los cuatro Estados del Proyecto, revisando
Ia f6rmula a efecto de cumplir con los lineamientos de la Ley de Coordinaci6n Fiscal
y hacerla mis transparente y equitativa.

A.    P     9
1.            In 1980 a mejor fi  reform occurrd. Staes bad to  mdeor most of their own taxes to tdo
fedraio and in compesat  rmived a lIugr oshr in the federll collected mevenue.
2.            A major overhaul of fiscal ar  Ige Bets betwee fedal, sate and municipal govenments was
intoduced by the Ley de Coodinaddn Fiscal of 1980. Ihe main objectives of the reform woe to: (a) reorder
and simplify the overall fiad system of the diffeet governmens eliminat  conflicts in the previous
legislation and the distntion bween saed and non-shaed taxes; (b) ationali the system by reducing the
number of taxes, concentrting collection aon thse with mor reveanu potential and eliminating some local
goverment taxes with high admiistraive casts; (c) introduce objective critaria for shing revenues tbrough
formula,based indicators nWt sbjet to disncrtionuay Cange by the federl government; (d) expedit the
process of calculating and sending funds; and (e) ensue thategi   with low fiscd caaity have an acceptable
level of basic sewVices, thus promotng national unity and horizontal eqmuty. To a largo extent the first and
second objective wero fily attined but the otr tree maied largely unataned.
3.            An imortant positive impact of fiscal centraion was the elimination of distortios in the
tax ystems across dates, but in a fedatd state it created an overly oenrhzed fiscal system. The
centrlization did not solve the ptoblem of tho existing large gap betwee the taxpayer and the beneficiary.
4.            When we compae 198S with 1980, and despite the stabilization effort, there was some move
to pursu the decentraliation. Expendihtues of the subtional governments rmained cotant in real terms,
while the genel government no-inteest expeitues decreaed by about 17 percet, an a per capita basis.
While stas had a decse in the weighbted averae per capita expenditure of 4.2 peent, municipalities had an
crse of about 25 percent.
S.            However, t  weighted aveages of the icr       in total budget incmes between the bottom
half (poorer) with the upper half (richer) sate shows a larger growth rate for the igher th  for the poorer
sttes, which mens that the intended improvemeat in redistribution did not take place.
6.            The federal shares that are shared with the states are:
(a)    tax On foreign 
(o)    income taxes
(c)    the valse added tax (VA or VAT)
(d)    production and services taxes
(e)    derechos (fees on mining, oil, etc.)
Coetain percentages of the collection of thse taxes feed three  Ins. The Fondos are allocated among stats
in thr  components-the Geneal Fund, the Compe oy Fund, and the Municipal Fund.
1. Mm Genend Fun
7.            The Geal Fund coprise 17.3 prcent of federd tae,  or about 90 peent of all revene-
sharg funds. Its distibution is basically determned by the shares of own-revenues from stae taxes that were
replaced by the VAT in 1980.

son that uneqWl tAo access to rusour  revens attacts facto  of production to dt  sate for ressons tht do
not rlect productivity! It is anomlous because it builds into the pwmt bs a alocaio baed on stae

deade ealier and prubly hige than they would hae bea a decdoe latr. In a    , a temporry
anomaly was built into the system perman y.
9.             Stating in 1988, the alocato of the Geeal Fud waso amended to rewad ses wbose VAT
collections incresed most rapidly. Each slat rtained 30 pornt of tho VAT it collected immdty (thus
providing imedat liquidity) plus an adjustment fund designed to provide in tho aggregate n allocation of the
17.3 percet of federal taxes among states according to te prvious y8ea ('historical) location augmened
by the ise in VAT collected durig the year. Thus, staeWs whose VAT collects gew relative to the
averae (either due to bigher consumption growth ates or more dilihgt tax adminstion) would have
increased 8baes.
10.           This addition of tax effort no doubt did induce some diligent ta administai    It also
inuced unsavoty competition among stats to attract ame of the VAT bas to their jTaisdiction.
2. no <>_brv Fud
i1.           The Compeatory Fund compised only about 8 prcet of genrl reven-sharing, or about
1.4 percent of federa tax collecdons. It was the only explicitly redistributive co _mp   lhe share of eah
stte in the grts from the Compensatory Fund was in inverse proporo  to that from the Gener  Fund. This
goes some way to equalizng the fiscal capacities of different stats, but not very far. For example, for the
Compeyntory Fund combined with the Genera Fund to result in equal per cpit tansfis, it would be
necessary to allocate One half of the Eondos to the Compensatory Fud. Te fac that only 8 percet is so
allocated indicates how ineffctive this Fund is as a equalizing device.
12.           Furhmore, its potential for equalization is diminished further by the fact that the grants from
it ae not highly selective. That is, they are made to al sttes. Given the small amonxt of funds involved,
effective assistance to the neediest saes would  qire much more dict tatig on the basis of tax capacity.
One would have to conclude that the extent to which the system addresd fiscal iequity was extremely limited
indeed.
13.           One of the main functions of the fiscal anrgements between the federd govennt and the
stes is the redistribution tht the revenue shaing system should peform  One simple rule at bas been applied
by quite a number of federations is to alow each state to have acces to resoces not less than a natioal norm.
Let us suppose that such a norm is defined by the avera  own eources plus all _ ci on a per capita
basis, and the complementy fund is used to fil the gap of the poor states. Table shows the dimension of the
gap. For 1985 such gap rches a maximum for Hidalgo, Michoaa, Oaxaca, Gueiero, Puebla and Zacaltcas
that ae among the pooet ste in Mexico. Tho complemntay fund imdly covers 10 pct to 20 pecnt of
such gap. it is cear that the revenue   ing formulas onstitute one of the main eons why the poorest ss

3. Sg Munic9 Fund
14.               'Me Municipal Fund comprised the remaining 2 percent of revenue-hing funds. It is
intAed to be passed thugh the sttes to the municipalies. However, the extent to which it serves a distinct
purose as a  uns for helping municipalities is obscure. It was allocated essentially lie the Genewal Fund so
it neither has any chaacteiic of municipalities built into it, nor does it have any component of fiscal need
built in. Given that the states can themselves affect municipal finances more directly using other means, it is
not clear that this fund should be considered as other than as another compto t of general federa-state revenue
saring, esstially supemtary to the General Fund.
1S.               1be pre-19       system had a number of shortcomings. Clearty, it had little redistributive
component built into it. It divetged from an equal per capita allocation in favor of an allocation which is close
to one basd aon per cpita consumption lvls with one major exception. That mnjor exception was that the
1980 petroleum revenues accruing to the states receiving them is permanently built in. Thus, the system did
little to address the inefficiencies and inequities resulting ftom a federal system in which different states have
different financial capabilities.
The 1990 Axtaeements
16.               The amendments to the revenue sharing arrangements introduced in November 1989 represent
a significant change in the allocation formula, and one which clearly improves the system."
17.               The proportionat amount of federal tax revenues to be shared would remain the same in
aggregate-18.1 percent. The previous General fund and Compensatory Fund are amalgamated into one fund
with a completely new allocation fonmula. Fifty percent of the fund is to be allocated on a strict per capita
.        The nraw Ly de Coordinacidn Fisal defines the new revenue-sharing criteria, which, for the General Fund, has two major
componnts   follows  (a) 50 percet shall, by 1994, be distributed in propottion to the number of people in a given state; and
(b) the other 50 percent shll be distributed using a coefficient based on the conribuciones asinables (c.a.) for each state.
(hese include federal tax on new cats; state charges and taxes on the use of vehicles, prm'iction and service charges on
petroleum products, bottled water, alcoholic beverages, beer, and tobacco products; and n micipal property taxes and water
charges.) The coefficient is calculated in this mauer: firtt, the amount received in the previous year by the state from this
portion of e Genetal Fund is multiplied by a fraction, the curreat c.a. divided by the cs. from two years previous. Obviously
this fraction would be greater than one if tax collections have increased, lesa than one if it declines. Call the products of these
ftations and the previous yeats General Fund allocations for each state X]. Then, the figures XY obtained in the first step are
summed and the perceatsge contibuted to that sum is calculated for each state. Tis percentage is the proportion of the second
50 percent of the Geteral Fund the tate will receive. 'n. amount available in the General Fund is 18.1 nercent of all federal
restoures from all taxes and chaes. Twenty percent of the allocations are earmaked for the municipalities, but the states
choose how and where to distribute this pottion.
The Municipal Fund is now distributed to the sta, also earmarked for municipal disbursement at each state's discretion, in a
mfn    smiba to the way Compenaory Fund previously waSt   receive funds from the Municipa Fund in the invers
propoton of the mwnt given to the state per capita out of the General Fund. The Municipal Fund repesents 0.42 pe.ceat of
all f6deral Inconsw with the exception of that derved from ome 'derecho extrordinario' levied on minerals and hydrocarbons.
One might nome the the net effect of this method is the earmarking of federal asisance to municipalities in some inverse relation
to both tat and municipal revenue collections ad state populatio. This is considered reditibutive.
The law also provides for the tfr-.ition period 1991-1994 as follows, where Pat I and Pan 2 refer to the portion of the General
Fund mentoned at the top of thi aote:
YEAR       Pa I       Panrt 2
1991      20%          90%
1992      30%          70%
1993      40%          60%
In 1994 the proportions sall match the S50-S mentioned above.

basis gradualy after a four-year transition period in which the proportio allocated per capita rises by 10
percent per year starting from an initial 10 percent. Correspondingly, that allocated by historic shares, as
discussed next, falls from 90 percen to 50 percent gradually.
18.           'Me remaining 50 percent is to be allocated by a method which again resorts to the historic
shares of the existing General Fund. In the initial year, the allocation is detrmined precisely by the allocation
of the General Fund. Each subsequent year the share of each state rises according to the relative rate of
increase of a variety of taxes collected within the stte. The taxes used include the excise taxes on peeroleum,
water vehicles, alcohol and tobacco, as well as water levies and property taxes. The excise taxes are all
federally admnistered. The later two sources of revenue are iacluded to provide some incentive for states (and
their municipalities) to improve revenue-raising efforts in these areas. Each year the share of a state rises or
falls in proportion to the extent to which state revenues from these sources rise or fall relative to the national
average.
19.           This method of adjusting the shares corresponds with the method that was used under the
General Fund except that, instead of basing the adjustment on VAT revenues co11ected in the state (by the state),
it is based on excise and property taxes within the state. Thus, the deleterious administrative competition for
VAT revenues was eliminated. Stats did, however, retain an audit function under the VAT alongside the
federal government. As an inducement to fulfill this requirement, they are to receive a share of the audit
procees.
20.            The Municipal Fund will remain, but its allocation formula is to change. Intead o, using the
General Fund allocation as before, the allocation is now to be based on the inverse of hie allocation described
above CIris is the formula previously used under the Compensatory Fund). As before, the Municipal Fund is
of relatively small size and importance. Though it incorporates some redistributive component, it is relatively
ineffective because it is not targeted to the most needy states.
21.            The sharing of import taxes and petroleum export duties continues to be shared with the states
containing petroleum refining and exporting cities.
II. Between States and Municigalities
22.            The rules to define revenue-sharing from states to municipalities are set by each state
legislature. Under the Ley de Coordinaci6n Fiscal states must transfer to municipalities at least 20 percent of
their revenue sharing in the General and Complementary Funds and the total of the Municipal Fund. Allocation
rules have been set each year and sometimes change significantly, making revenue projections by municipalities
quite difficult.
23.            Most of the states seek to distribute the part of the General and Complementary Funds to the
municipalities based on tax collections of VAT and some use the Municipal Fund for redistributive purposes.
The state of Mexico uses the taxes collected by each municipality as a basis to allocate the General Fund. Both
the state of Mexico and Nuevo Leon use population as a basis for allocating both the General and
Complementary Funds.
24.            This is an area which merits further improvements aiming at: (a) making revenue sharing to
municipalities more tnsparent and predictable; (b) using a combination of rules to allocate funds based on the
fiscal basis and an equity criteria to bring poor municipalities up to a minimum standard for provision of local
public goods.

STE ADMUNICIPAL FINANCES
SItme Finnce
1.            The four sources of finacing of stdae expitrwes ae:
O          Revenue sharing through fedeally coUlected taxes.
O          Locl rsources obtined throu  local taation.
O          Recumrrent expendiures (presupsto noml) tansfefred from the federal budget.
o          Transfers through the Conveoio U      for rual invesments, social sectors, and other
infratre; negotiated every year with SPP.
2.             Curent state budget expenditures are covered mainly by participation in VAT collection, of
which 30 percent is transfeed to the ae. The system has some similarities with the West German fedeml
sysem, but in the latter case almost 75 percent of VAT is distributed to states, which also share a large amount
of personal and company income taxes. In Mexico, the major proportion of public expenditures (current and
capitl) in the states stil belongs to the normal program of federl agencies.
3.             The grant system for investment (conditional and specific grants) through the CUD is similar
to the US system in certain aspects, but in the US investment planning and budgeting are decentalized
completely. In most of the federated indusalimzed countries, the states share revenues with the central
govemment, but there are no distinctions between transfers for sate investment and current expenditures.
4.             The structure of state revenue financing has changed sbstatally in the last six years. After
the 1979 fiscal reform the share of state taxes decreased from 25.3 percent to 9.1 percent, while revenue-
shig increased from 24.8 percent to 43.3 percent its contribution to state financing, as state taxes were
replaced by fedenl taxes. The ttansfer of property tax from the staste to municipal govemments further eroded
the tax capacity of states, as its hae decresed 9.1 in 1981 to 2.0 pert in 1984. The role of business
licenses and other smilar taxes has also decreased by about 4 pcentage points in the same period, while fees
for public services incresed by about the same percentage. Revenues frm state enterprises and other property
has also been reduced by about four perctage points (from 1980 to 1985).' The share of borrowing has
remained at about 8 percent of the total. Federd subsidis to cover state budget deficits run at about 2.5 percent
of the total financing, but they are concentmted in 7 of the 31 states.
S.             As it would be expected, richer states have a higher tax capability. In the richer four states,
local taxes represent about 2.1 percent of the total financing in 1985, cost wecovery from public services 3.7
pet and property income about 10 percent. For the four poorest stes aUl those sources are negligible,
except pwperty income in Guemro, due to Acapldco (7.5 pet of the total). Quite puadoxically, federal
subsidies have benefitted more the ncher than the poorer states, while stat borowmg has been more important
for tho poorer.

6.             On-a pet capt basis, staic incomes fiom their ows  sourcs, i.e.,- local taxes and fees from
provision of local servics, vary slufii.ntly among states (data for 1985). Four types of states have a larger
tax capability. The richust states am the Northern industrial states where the muquiladora has had a major
impact like Baja California and Nuevo Laon. The states with oil exploitation like Tabasco, Tamaulipas,
Camipeche and Veracruz. The states with large conminercial and administrative urban centers like the DF and
alisco. And, finally, the states with large tourism complexes like Colima and Quintana Roo. The poorest are
Hidalgo, Michoacan, Oaxaca and Nayarit. A very low correlation exists between per capita income and actual
tax revenues per capita, which confirms studies done for other couatries and reflects differences in tax basis and
differences in the preferences for public goods.
7.             There was a deterioration in the redistributive capability of the state budgets. In fact, total
incomes of the upper half states (richer) increased by 24.6 percent, on a weignted average, while the lower half
increased only by 10 percent.
8.             Empirical research on the US revenue sharing system has demonstrated that about two thirds
of the revenue sharing appropriations is used for various substitution purposes: more than one half was used for
cutting local taxes and borrowing and the rest used to maintain existing programs and prevent budget cuts.3 An
econometric study has also shown that increases in revenue-sharing were associated with a deceleration in
collection of taxes locally controlled like property taxes and service fees, on the revenue side and increase in
capital expenditures on the expenditure side.'
9.             Similar results are observed for Mexico. First, the reduction of 1980 in own taxes was part of
the agreement between the federal and state governments. However, the erosion of the state own resources
continued. In our view, is the result of two factors, besides the ones noted elsewhere. First, that there was not
enough decentralization of services and responsibilities from the federal to state governments that could take the
additional res-;rces. Second, that state govermments preferred to decrease local taxes instead of augmenting
local expenditures. In the 1980 to 1985 period, only four states (Campeche, Colima, Aguascalientes and Nuevo
Leon, all rich states) increased their own resources, in real per capita terms.
Municipal Finances
10.            The structure of municipal financing changed also significantly in the first half of the 1980s.
Revenue-sharing from the federal government increased from 26.3 percent in 1980 to 45.8 percent in 1982 and
further to about 60 percent of the total municipal incomes after 1983. That increase was mirrored in a decrease
in all categories of own resources. In 1985, local taxes financed about 12 percent of the budget, licenses about 6
percent, sevice fees 5 percent, property income 11 percent and borrowing covered 4.5 percent.
I!.            The weighted average of total revenues of municipalities, on a per capita basis, and at 1980
prices, increased from Mex$395 in 1980 to about Mex$492 in 1985. The redistributive impact did not change
during the period, since both the upper and lower half of the states had a similar increase.
12.            There was an almost perfect correlation between the increase in revenue-sharing and
expenditures by the municipalities in the 1980-85 period. In that period, the municipalities with the largest
growth were in the states of Zacatecas, Colima, Oaxaca, Campeche, Puebla and Tlaxcala. However, there was
again, significant substitution between revenue-sharing and own resources. Own resources decreased from
Mex$282 per capita in 1980 to about Mex$189 in 1985. Except for four states, municipalities in all other states
decreased their own resources. The pattem of own resources shows an increase with income per capita, with

some outliers referring mainly to oil states or states with tourism comnpexes. The largest drops and increases in
own resources were observed for richer states, reflecting again mainly difterences in preferences for public
goods.
Property Taxes
13.            The yields of the property tax have declined dranatically during this decade. In real terms,
property tax revenues diropped by 60 percent between 1980 and 1984. More recent figuires from individual
municipios suggest this trend has continued. This decline is attributable to two factors. First, the high inflation
of the 1980s has not been reflected in property tax assessments. Since 1980, the rate of inflation in Mexico has
totalled nearly 1005 percent. Property assessments, based originally on prices of the 1970s--have been adjusted
erratically, and at level far below the rate of inflation. Second, states have been lax in updating changes in the
physical characteristics of they tax base--new construction, subdivisions, and changes in land use-particularly
since the property tax was decentralized to the municipal level. As a result, major gaps in the coverage of the
tax base now exist.
14.            From a technical standpoint, Mexico is relatively well-position to revive its property tax.
Compared to other countries at similar levels of development (Brazil), the adnministrative apparatus for property
taxation is in good condition. States invested heavily in urban tax mapping and the mass appraisal during the
1970s. These maps and property records, while outdated, would provide a sound basis for a general resurvey
and revaluation of properties. Financing for such revaluations is currently available from BANOBRAS and has
been used, with apparent success, in Merida (Yucatan) and San Luis Potosi.
i5.            The present institutional arrangements discourage such efforts, however. Any mayor wishing
to undertake a general resurvey, adjust assessments, or increase tax rates, must obtain the approval of both the
state governor and the stage congress. All three political actors must agree: any one of them can exercise a
veto. Such a convergence of views likely to be rare. From the state's perspective, the political costs of
authorizing an increase in property taxes are high, and the political benefits are few, the tax provides the state
with no additional revenue.
16.            One means of reducing the political constraints on the property tax would be to permit
assessment to be indexed to inflation. Automatic inflation-indexing would permit assessments to remain
constant in real terms, witheut requiring any deliberate action on the part of the govemor, mayor, or congress.
The State of Yucatan has already taken this step: beginning January 1990, the pricing factors used in
calculating assessments will be automatically increased at half the rate of increase in the minimum wage.
17.            There may also be merits in decentralizing the administration of the property tax. Municipal
governments would presumably take a more active interest in administering their principal source of
discretionary income. Opinions differ on this issue, however. Earlier Bank studies have suggested that smaller
munici2ios would not be technically capable of administering the tax. Some municipal officials argue that a
decentralized tax would be too vulnerable to local politics. Experience in other developing countries shows that
both centralized and decentralized administrations have succeeded in some instances and failed in others. The
choice of administrative arrangements does not appear to guarantee either outcome. In general, however, the
incompetence of local govenmment appears to be more easily mitigated thaa the indifference of central
authorities.
18.            Municipal governments should also be given greater latitude in setting tax rates. If the
property tax is to serve as the means by which local taxpayers express their effective demand for municipal
services, local governments must have the power to adjust local tax levels accordingly.

19.           Fees and charges contribute about ten percet to total municipal revenue. Roughly half of this
is produced by fees, the remaider by charges. Fees-imposed for plawing and building permits, regisratn of
births and maniage, etc.--should not be viewed as a potential source of municipal revenue. Any atlempt to ue
these adnunstratve charges as sources of genera revenue would discourage compline with reguao
procedures.
20.            There are strong arguments for increasing the yields of user chawges, however. At prsent,
the level of these charges-for water supply, markets, saht s, ad other municipal facilities-are wel
below the costs of service delivery. In 1987, water charges on industri and comerci consumes wee
estimated to cover only 30 percent of the costs of sevice delivery. Subsidies take the fonn of transfes from
state or municipal general revenues (to cover operatng losses) and below-markt or gant financing of capital
investments. This implies both an inefficient level of services provision and an inequitable pattern of subsidies:
from general taxpayers to those with access to subsidized services.
21.            The constraints on increasing the yields of charges are similar to thse confionting local taxes.
Approval must be given by swveral different political entities, any of which can exercise a veto. Inflation has
made the task more difficult, by requiring a major annual increase if tariffs are to keep up with increases in the
costs of service delivery. The solutions may also be similar increasing loca latitude in tariff-setting and
indexing user charge levels to infation.
22.           In the case of water supply, increasing local atitude over tariffs could also reduce a second
source of inefficiency in water pricing. At present, s_ta-detemined water tariffs do not refect vaiations in the
costs of delivenng water in different mnicigi: tates are uniform for eatire states or for groups of m  unicip
within a state. As a result, water consumption is subsidized in those locations where it is most expensive to
deliver.

I.            The states have to provide cost sring of about one quitter of the Invesmet progrm, il
case investments take place through the CUD. Decentiion of expenditure control implies that either the
federation transfer the funds in the form of a block grat or the stae has the possiliq to ase its own reveaUe.
As discussed in this Annex, there is room for improvement in the collection of property taxes and water charges
at the state level, but most of the additional recurrent expenditures in the four stat  are to be provided through
a transfer in the current budget (prognama normal). nTe recurent expenditure implications are presented in
Anntx 8.
2.            This Annex presents estimates of the four state budgets for the years 1985, 1988 and 1989,
and projections for the 1990-92 period. Projections show that the four states have capacity to finance the
investment program, and sets some estimates for own resure   mobilization required for mainaing balanced
budgets.
3.            In 1989, revenue-sharing with the Federation, represented 85 percent of totl teveoue in the
state of Chiapas, 70 percent in Guerrero, 76 percent in Oaxaca and 83 percent in Hidalgo. By 1992, it is
estimated that Chiapas would be able to cover about 78 percent of total revenue with revenue from the Fondos
de Participaciones, but the fall in that harel will be larely compensated by sharing in federa revenues of
electricity generation'. Guerrero will broady maintain its share in the revenue-sharing. ITh  e increse
already registered in 1989 in state tax collection would be followed by an expansion of about 70 percenP. The
new revenue-sharing formula will clearly benefit a populous sbtte like Oaxaca that will see the revenue-shaing
revenue increase to about 80 percent of its total revenues by 1992. Finally, Hidalgo will also see the revenue
sharing increase by 2 percentage points.
4.            While current expenditures would be mintained under reasonable levels,  creasing on avenge
about 2 percent to 4 percent in real terms, two items will have significant increases: transfers to municipalities
as the decentralization proceeds and investmet expenditures in the state. Transfers to muncipalities are
asmed to increase in 1989-93 by 41 percent in Chiapas, 102 pWert in Guerero, 110 percet in Oaxaca and
138 percent in Hidalgo.
5.            The financing of nvestments by the states will aso expand sgnificantly: in Chiapas by 119
percent, in Guerrero by 50 percent, in Oaxaca by 87 percent and in Hiddgo by 132 percent, in the 1989-92
penod. However, despite the  cras in investment durng the period of the ptoject, the money spent by the
Federation in each of the four sates in 1992 is still below the vels reached in 1985 (and 1988 in the anof
Oaxaca). Since the estimates are in cumaut dollars, tht gap is still lage ta what the Table indicates.

ECENTRALZATION AND REGIONAL DELOPMENT PROJECT
FOR THE DISADVANTAGED STATES
CRITERIA FO  INVESTMENT ALLOCATION AND PROJECT SELECION
A. Procedures and Criteria for Selecting Investments by StIts
1.    A project can arise from a "felt noed by the community througb a process of consutation or a 'project
id-a proposed by any adnistratin, commuity or individuals. Once those aro assembled, the pocess of
project formulation and selection stas.
2. First, 'felt needs' or 'project ideas' are put in a simple summary project propos. The proposal should
contain: (a) identification of project; (b) objectives; (c) location; (d) technical feasibility; (e) e_std  coa; (M)
estimated benz.its; and (g) comtment of the interested parties to the project
3.    Second, projects are classified according to size and spatial impact.
O Ir_.A. Small (less than US$18,000) with municipal impact.
o II B. Medium (from US$18,000 to US$200,000) with municipal or regional impact.
O  DU C. Irge (more than US$200,000) with regiloal or state-wide impact.
4.    Type A projects are to be evaluaed basically from a community developmnt prspectivw, and as suh,
they ae the responsibility of municipalities. This annex describes a new system to be intrduced for this type
of projects.
S.    Type B projects have to be submitted to the normal screeing by the Nonmtivas nd COPLADEs, USing
an intermediate level of economic analysis.
6.    Type C projects have to be evaluated by a full-fledged analysis: (a) technica feuaibilitr; (b) finaial
analysis; and (c) economic analysis of rate of rotumn and distributive impact.
7.    The first catgory will include about 6,000 projects, the second about 2,000, and the third about 14.
8.   In the case of the road abc   t, project appraisal would follow condition outlined in Attahme  S
of this annex.
Oveaal Exclusion Cdteai
9.    The investmet proga  will exclude all projects that:
(a) can damage the patrmony of historical, archeological and cultural heritage;
(O) dme the envonment or do not respect the biosphere or ecologicl reseres legaly define; ad
(c) imply major forced resetdement of populatios without an agreed reuettletme  prgra.

10.   The Regional Detralization and Development Pvoject will not fiance projects.
(a) financed by other Bank projects that imply double financing;
(b) financed by other donors that imply double finacing; and
(c) of line agencies with a national impact.
11.  In addition, the Decentralization and Regional Developmeat Project cannot fiance the fo'!owing CUD
programs:
(a) BA.02. Seguridad PublUa Nacional;
(b) SJ. Infraesructura Social 410-412; and
() churches, cemeteries and religious facilities.
B. Allocation of Investment Funds by Municipaliq
12.   The present system of allocating investnt funds by region (groups of municipalities and by
mnunicipalities while using some considerations of efficiency and equity, sem  often to be susmed by
political considerations. While the COPLADEs are to coordiate and det e pnonty of public sector
investments within the state, there is concem that the allocation among regions and municipalities should be
based on clear and objective criteria.
13.   Presently, for revenue-sharig puposes, some states use a combination of cdrteia based on populion
and the value-added tax collected by a municipality, while others use no formal criteria.
14.   Under the Decentralizaion and Regional Development Project, the four states would use some formal
crteria that take into consideration efficiency and equity. The date investiWt e 'it would be divided into
different financing groups at municipal, regional sad state level. The relative prportions of size of these
groupigs could vary from state to state with the mniipad funds being i _nca    over time.
15.   Funds for municipalities and regions should be allocated on a nogd basis, i.e., independently of the
investment pakage, but based ot a formula, to set a budget consnt on regions nd municipalities.
16.   The municipal and regional financing groups woud be distributed first, by rgioons, based on the
following formal criteria:
(a) population of each region;
(b) the inverse of a povery indicator or income per cqa    masure; and
(c) density of human settlements and a factor for type of teain.
17.   Ihe firt is an efficiency cteria, the sond taes into account equity and the third is a meas   of the
unit cost for providing public senrices.

18.   The municipal fund group could only finance small projects of local impact (Type A projects). The
municipal resources would be distributed using the same criteria that would apply to regions.
19.   The regional fund group would finance medium-sized projects (Type B). It would be allocated among
regions/municipalities using the following criteria:
(a) population of each region/municipality; and
(b) indicators of needs assessment.
20.   The state investment group would finance Type C projects (lage with a state-wide impact). It would be
distributed according to the following criteria:
(a) economic rate of return of the project; and
(b) income distribution impact.
That is, if there are two projects with the same rate of return, the one in a poorer area would have priority over
the one in a richer area. The one in the richer area could be undertaken if the financing ftom the beneficiaries
compensates for the redistribution effect.
21. For equalization purposes the municipal fund group would be distributed among municipalities on a
matching basis, with a larger municipal contribution from the richer municipality: e.g., a poor one would
contribute with 25 percent and a rich one with 75 percent.
22. While revenue sharing is a block grant system, the cu.-rent system of investment grants is mainly
composed of matching and selective grants. Since the system of revenue sharing is supposed to be improved
simultaneously, municipalities would be able to cover most of the curseat costs that investment projects will
generate. Besides, they would also have the capability to match part of the project costs. Such a rule is also
important to ensure better project efficiency and tax effort.
23.  In the short term, the formula would provide the budget consttaint for municipalities so the matching
shoul( be only on an overall basis with the proportion of the municipality contributing proportional to a poverty
indicator. Over time, the needs may arise to introduce in the municipal funds some selective matching grants
cnteria to guide the muicipal preferences towards state objectives. However, in the short term, the system
mrst be simple.
C. Proosd System for Processing Small Proiects'
Introduction
24.    The present SPP syhem of processing small projects focuses primarily on technical feasibility and
provides little guidetines on how to pnoritize these project requests. This results in great variation in project
screening, proect design quality and in almost all projects aving equal priority. Under such circumste,
planners often resort to cutting resoures in not the most optimal manner. TIese weaknesses will be greatly
reduced once appraisal procedures are standardid to include cetain policy and efficiency consideradons and,
for productive projects, the use of abbreviated benefit/cost analysis are required.
25.    This paper outlines steps for improvng the processiag of small project rqus   submitted to PNS for
fincing. It defines the objective, required modifications in the project cycle, the project selection process,
use of proposed seection criteia, and how the evised system could assist p    invesments. It

incorporates certain features already in practice in some of the four stes and provides a few cas studies which
apply the proposed forms and seleetion criteria.
Objective
26.     The purpose of the project selection system is to permit states to deine a prgram of priorities
through a simple but more systematic and objective technique of selecting projects before they reach the
COPLADEs and SPPlMexico.' Exclusion and prioritization criteria designed specifically for PNS programs,
and if necesary sub-programs, would be used to screen and ultimately select projects. The states would
construct their respective programs based on project ranings and submit to SPP/Mexico these programs as
opposed to the detailed project lists.
27.     Advantages of the system would include: (a) a quicker, easier way of identifying projecs which qualify
for PNS financing (b) a basis for ptiority ranking and programming such investments; (c) application of
uniform screening by municipalities; and (d) improved quality of project design. Communities would know the
criteria by which their requests would be lassesed, the reasons for de-seection, and the options that are open
for submitting reformulated or new proposals. Eventually, a certain knowledge base and expertise would be
developed at the local level of many municipalities. This would reduce the workload at state level and permit
more attention to be devoted to in-depth analysis of medium and larger projects (i.e., those above USS18,000
equivalent). PNS is curtly examining how to screen projects electronically using an appropriate expert
systems (artificial intelligence) package.'
Proiect Cyvgle
28.     Project identification and preparation would continue to be the responsibility of communities and
municipalities, as under the present system. The proposed changes focus on  ect aggtial when
municipalities, state planning agencies and SPPADelegations would be the main actors. Their functions and the
proposed steps for appraising project requests am summrized in Attachment 1. If municipalities lack the
capacity to screen projects, assstance could be provided by state planning agencies, SPP/regions or other
technical assistance arrangements. Other phases of the project cycle, (i.e., preparation of the exgedientes
telnicos, project approval, execution, supervision, monitoring and evaluation) emnain unchanged and follow the
steps outlined in the PNS Operations Manual.
Basic Project Form
29.     To ensure conformity in data prstation and enhance the appraisal of project proposals, a simple form
similar to the Hidalgo PIH-01 would be used, adapted for productive, social and infrastructure projects.
Ptoject Selection
30. The project appraisal process would begin with municipalities determining the appropriateness of
project requests according to the selection criteria. If projects meet any one of the exclusion categories, they
would automatically be returned to the submitting community(ies). If minor omissions exist, projects would be
4.      These agencies sdare the project approval function: the former determine project priorties; the tatter assesses and authorizes fiuids
for sate programs.
5.      An expert sysem is a computer-based systm that uses knowledge, facts and  asoning techniques to olve problems that normally
require the abilitie of human expert. Expert systm can be desgned for specific hardware and software configurotions, or they
can be softwate systms thda are designed to amn on a general-ppwposecomputer. The knowedge the expert qstm uses is made up
of eithr nul (e.g. seetion critea) or e.xperiene infomsto. Rle gen_lly gie descriptions of a conditon folowed by
implications of that condition. The reasoning technique often used by expe systems s inferencing. An anwer to a question posd

31.    If projects peas    excluion ct   and  nk well in the pronti ao cnteria, they would be seat to
State Planning for review. Proects found to conform to the pntnioition criteria with scores above the cut off
point would be ready for COPLADE onsderatioi. A propoul which scores less than a total of 40 points on
the pnontizton criteria wolWd be automatically excluded.
32.    It is assumed tho diffent actors at wui:ipd, ngionl and stat level will be able to carry out to
simplesreeing steps. Initidly. SPP/Mexico will need to xpotdcec the proc. In keeping with the policy of
decetraliztion, this appraisal funcin would remain at stat level.
SeleOt Critnia
33.    Each type of project will be apprised according to excluion and priortization cntera taiored to the
various progrms finnced by PNS. Both cntera will have four components: policy concerns, proect
efficiency, targeing and prticipation. By 1991, policy concer  would become MoDe sectot specific. Each of
these four components is further sub-divided into differet program/su-prograim concemns. The exclusion
critena ensures the conformity of projects to nationl and sate development plans, efficiency considerations,
emphasis an the poor, and requirm t for beneficiay dsing in projct execution functons. Prioritizatiou
criteria allows ranking proects in a simple but firly objective mer acording to the fur components.
34.    Additonal critena would have to be designed for sector-spcific concr. The critera shees can be
use also as score sheets to record the    _s   being made and facilitate their  vwiew by state level staff.
The Basic Project Form and the Scorng Sheet ilustuate what additional information woud be required for
calculating the abbreviated benefit/cost ratio for productive and infrauctur (roads) projects.
35.    Ihe quality of the sdection process will depend on: ka) the clarity vith which sectoral stategies and
guidelines for the selection criteri are defined; (b) knowledge and uw  policy makers have of these;
and (c) the extent to which such steges wre communicated to municipalities and incorporated by them into
their own decision-maing.
36.    The pruject selection system will be tried for six months in the four states with a limited number of
pogram categories for the Municipal Solidarity Funds (see Annex 8). Adjustments in the basic project form
and criteria would need to be made in light of this experience. After six to eight months, an appraisal should be
ccnducted of the effectivees of the system and how it might be further steadmlined, e.g. gradual introduction
of electronic processig and development of a tailored expert system  lhe system's tngger points (scores
assigned to each component [sectorad piority, efficiency, Urgeting, etc.]; minimal score rle; and the guidelines
regarding program/subrograim and type of projects [productive, social infrsuctul distribution) would
especialy need careful attention. The system should hen be used for prepaing the FY91 and PY92 investment
programs.

DECENTRALIZATION A4ND REGIONAL DEVELFOPMENTPR
FOR THE DISSDNA S6IE{
RULES EQR MMMR2JQ= ANwOMENTALS ASSESSMENT
1.            The legal framework for environmn  assesmeat (EA) of subprojects is provided by the Ley
GeCeal de Equilibrio Ecologico y Proteccion aI Ambiente (1988). This federal law lagely reflects the Bank
opetion  dectives on envirnmnt assesmet. A study was caued out durig prMect preparation and its
recommdations were approved by SEDUE and SPP (CQ,ngente Ambientbl: Provecto de Dewentralizacion v
Desoollo Regional) which lays down the nres for screening and conducting eavironmental assessments under
the Decentralization and Regional Development Project. Moreover, it defies an institutional strngthening
program to assure satisfactory quality for the analysis and poLicies proposed in the four states.
2.             The initial screening of projects by type of EA required is canried out by the Ecology
Subcommittee of COPLADES. For subprojects requiring an intermediate level of EA, the subcommittee would
inform the respective executing agency. For subprojects requiring a specific and more developed EA, the
subcommittee would subcontract to local consulting firms, universities or other recognized institutions
previously approved by SEDUE. SEDUE, through state delegations, is the agency that would give final
aprval of the EA to be carried out.
3.             According to article 5 of the Reglamento of the above law, the following subprojects are
exempt ftom EA: (a) construction and demolition of buildings in urban zones; (b) conservation and
rebabilitation of buildings; (c) dams of less than 500,000 cubic meters; (d) irrigation systems of less than 100
ha; (e) wells and systems to store water with less than 10 percent of annual precipitation; and (f) conservation
and rehabilitation in general.
4.             The following re minimum environmental rqirements to be applied under EA:
(a)    Preventing and Controlling Water Pollution and Rational Use of Water: construction of
systems for treatment of residues in water, recycling of treated water; storage of water from
rainfall in small dams or reservoirs; control of use of agro-chemicals; control of expansion of
urban areas to fertile soils, forests and natural reserves; soil conservation; appropriate
sewerage and treatment of wastes; reforestion; preservation of natur reserves and
endangered species.
(b)    Rural and Feeder Roads: adequate the use of materials with the degree of run-off
precipitation; works for soil conservation in the area bordering the road; avoid changing
naturl water flows; avoid deforestation; avoid intensive exploitation of materials.
(c)    Water Sunoly Systes: planning and implementation of the coexisting sewerage systems; re-
ue of treated waters; monitoring of water quality.
(d)    Rural Electrification: avoidance of deforestation or other distrance to ecological systems.

DECENTRALZAnON AND REGIONAL DEVLOPMENT PROJECT
FOR DM MADVATAGE  TA
COST RECOVERY RULES FOR SROJECTS FINANCED BY THE PROOED PROJEC
1.    The Bank will only disburse, under this proposed project, for subprojects which follow the cost-recovery policies
(of both investment costs and operations and maintenmace costs) already agreed with the goverment in other opeiations.
These cost-recovery policies are those agreed with in the water supply sector (proposed Water Supply and Sanitation
Sector Project), irrigation subsector (proposed Irrigation and Dainage Sector Loan) and the government's poverty
strategy (for which PRONASOL is the implementing arm) and are as follows:
(a) Water supply projects wiU follow cost recovery mles detailed in the proposed Water Supply and Sanitation
Project.' The GOM bas agreed to link PRONASOL lending in the water and sanitation sector to the same criteria
and norms designed for that loan; a similar condition has been included in this loan for the provision of project
funding. For investment costs, these rules are based on CONAPO's povety index (PI) which is used to
determine both the maximum federal and state assistance and the minimum participation of credit component and
internal cash generation in the financial mix of funds of each subproject at the municipal level. Total intel
cash generation will, in average, range from 15 percent in 1990 to 25 percent of cost in 1994. The PI clifies
municipalities into three poverty categories: High, Medium and Low, and the ceilings for federal and tat
participation and floors for internal cash generation (with credit being the residual) are as follows:
?L               Fdergl and Sat            Bmneficianis               GOdiA
High                   80                     20                       0
Medium                 50                      15                       3S
Low                    35                      15                       50
Exceptions to the above rules are made in the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector loan, but they refer to sectoral
policies and therefore do not apply to thi- proposed project. The annual Sector Review in November of each year
redefines limits to be applied the next year. For O&M costs, the rule is 100 percent recovery (except depreciation)
from the first year.'
(b) Irrigatjon projects will follow cost recovery concepts as contained in the CUDIPNS schedule of the next table.
One hundred percent of O&M cost recovery would be required for all projects financed by the Bank.
(c) Other Proiects (mainly agricultural, agroindustrial, marketing and housing subprojects) will follow cost recovery
guidelines indicated in the SPP Manual Unico de Qoeracion. Promrama de Solidaridad. It is estimated that
beneficiaries' participation in investment costs (cash, labor and materials and credit) will range between 25 and
70 percent, depending on the sector and location of the subproject. Table 1 expands on the Manual's annex A
'Programas con recuperacion' for these subprojects, and indicates the percentages of coverage of investment costs
expected from the federal, state and participants' contribution in the form of credit. Participants' expected
contribution, besides credit (or cash equivalent) is requested by the state to the beneficiaries groups. It can be in
cash, local materials and community (free) labor. If it is in the form of cash or local materials it can be
discounted towards the state contribution.4

2. For low income communities (3igh PI), community participation for constrotion is accounted as internal cash generation.
3. For community selcction crieria, see SAR, Womcn. Water and Dveclooment, pages 7-8 and Annex I.
4. Th historical averages are broken down between cash (estimated according to haitorical averages in Guencro, Sinloa, Yucsun, and
Zacetecas) with labor and materials being the residual between cash and the total beneficiaries' financing included in the project costs
table.

DECENTRALIZATION AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENI PROJECI
FOR THE DISADVR       GED STATES
OPERATION AND MAINTENACE GUIDELINES
1. Maintenance of Municrial Roads
Legal Asts
1.    Responsibility for construction and maintenance of terdary municipsl roads and feeder roads should be
shifted from federal to municipal authorities. Therefore a legal definition of municipal roads consistent with a
functional -jurisdictional classification of roads is required. Presendy, no such definition exists. An inventory
then should be undertaken to determine the functional-jurisdictional road classification for all networs other
than federal highways or state highways. Finally an inventory of the characteristics of roads in physical tenr
should be carried out at municipality level. This last exercise would provide critical information for drawing up
a program for developing local capacity and for shifting fill maintenance and mangemet responsibilities to
municipalities within a realistic time frame. However tranusitional prognmmatic measures would be taken under
the Pwogram.
2.   Under the program assurance would be provided at negotiations that prior to the initiation of any
municipal road project, SPP would enter into agreements with the municipality, defining the provisory transr
of such roads to the municipal road network and defining road maintenance responsibilities and sources and
level of funding for the maintenance of municipal roads undergoing improvement or construction.
Routine Maintenance
3.    Appropriate technology is as important to maintenance as it is for constuction. The feeder road have
been built with low technology as to cause minimum obstruction to the elements, primarily rain water. The
alignments adapt to the terain and do not have expensive protective featrs of bigh cass roads to withstand the
elements. Routine maintenance consists of simple work items regularly performed througbout the year. Theses
activities consist in maintaining the drainage system (ditches, culvert, ford, v igetation) and the running surface
(flling potholes and ruts, maintaining the surface camber).
4.   The program would support a labor based strategy to handle these routine maintenance activities.
Among the different possible system, maintenance by force account with permanently employed laborrs, would
be discouraged. Three other systems would be encouraged: (a) the communlOy contst  signed ben
the municipal'ty and a legally constituted association; (b) the   that involves a contract between
a local individual and the municipality, whereby the individual receives paynent to carry all routine maintenance
over a fixed length of road using municipal-fumnised hand tools and were payment in contingent to satisfctlory
performance; and (c) self-hbelp maItenance system with expenses limited to supply of hand tools whvre the
residents bave a strong sense and history of community betterment activities and were the population perceives
the benefits from maintenance as accruing specifically to themselves.
Fundin? and Organizational Aspeas
S.    The Municipal Fund would be the main channel to finance routine maintenance under type A or B
projects (small- or medium-sized projects). A set of typical contract agreements between municipalities and
constituted associations or lengthmen woldd be signed with the _mitance of the Federa/State highway ageci
resposible for the tutelge of the municipalities. These contracts would follow the ageed nrle set  for type
A or B projects.

6.   It is estinated that the expeaditur  for routine mAintenaee of municipa nu  rwads under the prgam
would be annually of about US$300 per km, equivalent to about US$10 million over a four-year period.
7.    The labor-based maintenance strategy based on contract through the Munmipal Fund and the principle of
financing routine maintenance of muoicipal roads improved under the progrm would be agreed at negotiations.
Periodic Maintenance
8.    Periodic matntenance consists of more extensive maintenuace operions that are required only every
several years such as reshaping running surface or rgrveluig.  he objective of these maitenance activities is
to restore a facility more or less to its original condition but appropriate to the currt level of traffic which
may be much larger than its original desig level; these activities can therefore be coosdered as capital
improvement. Spot improvement programs may well fall under this category of periodic mtenamnclapital
improvement. Therefore, thie Program in fact alteady takes into consideration some form of periodic
maintenance for a scheduled equivalat of US$15 million.
9.    A system would be progressively established to institutionalize and develop periodic maintenance. A
strategy would be designed considering the various alternatves (a) to assess maintenance requirements in terms
of necessary capabilities and funds and to modify or not existing instituions to meet the needs; and (b) to
implement periodic maintenance by cop-tract through simplified contracting procedures whenever the possibility
of developing small contractors exists.
10.   The progrm, through its various proposed mechanisms, would help the definition of the above strategy,
and in particular through the decentralization program the possibility to set up a specific unit within the road
maintenance services of the state/federal highway agencies to assist municipalities. T!e implementation of the
spot improvement program would also constitute by itself quite a training exercise from which lessons to
promote use of appropriate periodic maintenance technology would be derived.
11.  It would be agreed during negotations hat SPP would prst to the Bank the draft of a comprehensive
maintenance strategy for municipal roads by January 15, 1991, a detailed plan of action to develop specific
actions on periodic maintenance by June 30, 1992, and starting the implemetaton of the plan by Sepmber 30,
1992.
II. Institutional Arranuements for O&M of Rual Waw SUD1V projects
12.         The proposed loan would have the same oprations and maintenance (O&M) cost-recovery
requimments as the Water and Sanitation Sector Loan, namely 100 percent cost recovery from the fitst year.
For this reason, it is importnt to put in place efficient and adequate insttutional argements to carry out the
O&M to ensure sustainability of these services once the systems are in place. This Annex details the institutional
arrangements (criteria and process for community slection as well as community's responsibilities) to attain the
sustainability goal.
13.         The capabilities of the vilages to opeate and main ther watr and santatio systems is not
totally adequatL o. & re sustainability of the work. For this reason, the communities sould be carefully
selected, the State WaL- Agency (SWA) should provide training to alow the community to carry out its
responsibilites, and the community should assume its responsibilities and pay the water tariffs needed to
maintain and operate the systcm. Since the community cannot acquire all the specialid tainng necessty to
carry out the more technical aspects of O&M, it would contract either with the State Water Companies or with
private firms to carry out this morm intricate O&M works, and the community would defray the cost of these
contracts with the proceeds of water tariffs.

14.         The community selection follows the metbodology included in the ptoposed WomeQ, Water and
Development Project (WWDY. This methodology reflects both: (a) the recognition ofthe importace of
community panicipation, encouraging self-help and promoting incred community responsibilities; and (b) the
Government's strategy to change the generalized perception that improvemeots in living standards can only be
achieved through public spending. Therefore the selection would consist of two steps:
(a)   Screening of potential communities, based on secondary data, according to the following criteria:
(i) estimated cost of bringing the wa oased on chaacteristics of the water source; (ii) degree
of community marginality; and (iii) Ia <.n participatory experiences in the conununity; and
(b)   applying selection criteria based on: (i) the estimated cost of the respective water supply and
sanitation subprojects (a maximum per capita investment cost of US$150 for both water and
sanitation systems); (ii) community's oommitment to the prject's activities.
15.         In the same spirit of PRONASOL of mustering community organization to constitute a
Development Committee, the water supply subprojects will constitute water committees as indicated in the
paragraph below. SPP/COPLADES staff should, like the SWA staff in the WWD project, be trained in
community mobilization techniques and facilitate the community to participate and assume the responsibilities
that go along with the execution of the investment.
16.         The community, with the help of the SPP/COPLADES agent, would be responsible for the
following: (a) organizing the water committees and selecting the local water careaer and (b) paying lhe water
tariffs. The local water committee would be responsible for, in agreement with the community: (a) assessing
the availability of its own financial and non-financial resources; (b) defining local preferences, abilities and
willingness to commit its resources; (c) agreeing with the State Water Agency on the level of service to be used
for their water and sanitation systems; and (d) contracting with the SWA or the private sector for O&M work
that they cannot carry out themselves. The water caretaker would: (a) carry out minor maintenance works; (b)
inform the State Water Agency on major problems requiring their involvement; (c) collect water tariffs weekly
(to take into account their low-saving capability of the beneficiaries) and deposit the payments in an account
earmarked for water system needs; and (d) promote community meetings to evaluate the operation of the system
and suggest future extension and/or upgrading.

ZgENTRALIZATION AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
FOR THE DISADVANTAGED STATES
REiCKUKE   CQUS IMPLICATIONS OF INVESTMENT PROGRAMS
1.            This Annex estimates the recurrent costs with budgetrry implications of the proposed
investment programs in the four states for the 1990-94 period. The investment progrms with larger irLact on
the  current budge. mvould be the roads component for the maintenance required for newly conructed roads
and the education component for the personnel required to staff the indiaucture to be bWult under the prqject.
For agriculture projects, the maintence is to be financed by the beneficiaries and the impact on recurrent costs
in terms of extension and technical assisne can be easily absorbed by the delegations of SARH. For water
supply projects, maintenance is also to be financed by beneficiaries. The cost for operaton and mintenance in
small water projects is estimated at about US$5 million per annum, representing about five percet of
investment costs and equivalent to about US$25-35 per beneficiay and per annum.
2.            In the case of roads the total estimated impact would be in the four states US$7 million per
annum, after the five-year program. Such estimates are based on technical parameters, asmLig a continuous
maintenance plus a five-year period major maintenance work, taking as a base the total cost of now and
significantly rehabilitaed roads. Under the program of decentraizion to be undertaken i the course of the
project, the financing required for the road maintenance would be budgeted in SCT Progam  Normal,
repesenting about 10 percnt of that budget, and transferred as a block grant to the state that than would
transfer to the regional and municipal executing agencies the required amounts.
3.            The increase in oducational infrasture requires the creation of new posts for teachers as
well as some iieae in administratve and superdision costs. It is esimated that the increase in in6fratucture
would require the creation, at the end of the five-year program, of about 13,000 new posts in the four state, at
a cost of about US$29 million per annum, using an average of present salaries, in dollars, and representing
about nine percent of the SEP budget. Under the financial aangements of the project, such amount has to be
inscribed in the budget of SEP, that is still currently in charge of financing salaries of teachers.
4.            The institutional development program to be carried out in association with the environmental
component requires the expansion of the number of environmental specialists and associated staff that would
cost about US$1.2 million per annum at the end of the program.

FOR THE Dl5ADVANTAGED VM,TS
ENVBQNENT COMPONENT
Objectives &al Strategy
1.            The envirowne.w compent has the objectives of. (a) supporting dIe decentaition for tbe
envroment sector; (b) assing satisfactory envionmental featues of all projects suppored by the PNS
program; and (c) providing for a Special Protetion Progam for the Selva Lacandona, Mexico's nos
significant remaining tmopical ran forest Biosphere Reserve. lTe component would support an evrnmena
program for all four states in support of the first two objectives, and, in the case of Chiapas an additional
Special Protection Program for the Selva Lacandona.
A. Envronmtal Prot        in the PNSP
2.    This subcomponent would support the implementation of the   vironmtal screening and assessment
measures, and contemplates the following activities:
- Considenng the specific PNS project related requiemtents and environental priorities in each
State, the struturing of technical teams and admiunstrtve support to state agencies and
SEDLJE;
- As a background and support to the screening of specific projects, support for studies essential
for the definition of environmental strategies in key aeas and subsectors, such as local or
regional master plans for water supply, drainage, saitation, micro or macro zoning plans,
management of forest resources, protection of watersheds, etc.. To the greatest extent
possible, these studies should be cared out with due participation of the interested public,
universities and research institutions, environmental associations, etc.
Decentralization and Institutional Strengthenine
3.            The PNS program seeks to consolidate the process of decentralization, delegating to the States
and Municipalities the tasks of planing and of establishing their priorities for program  and projects in all
technical areas, including the envionmental and natural resource management one. To operaionalize the
environmental protection measures, the environment component would support a set of activities aimed at
gradual decentralization for the States of Hidalgo, Guerro, Oaxaca and Chiapas. Specifically,
(a)   The State Coordination mechanisms (COPLADES), State envirmental agencies and SEDUEs
in charge of implementing the PNS program, would receive the necesry technical support to
optimize the PNS contributions for the envionment sector, and to minimize any undesirable
impacts of the projects supported by PNS;
(b) the State agencies and SEDUEs would receive installations and equipment essential to the
monitorng of PNS supported lines of action and for related environmental proebtion;
(c)   strngthening of the system of proteted areas ia each State, through better protection of
existing areas and possibly also through desgnation of additional areas necesauy for the
conservation of ecosystems-with the objective of miniming negative impacts of econoic
development; and

6.            This subcomponent would contbute to the consolidaton of the system of protected ares in
each State, (with major emphasis on the Sttss of Chiapas and Oaxsa), as needed tho :
- field level demarcion, and land tenure rogulation progams;
- establishment and implementation of management plans, including isearch progms, zoning.
gatherng of field data, eco-tounsm development, environmental education, administraion aad

- support the consolidation of the system of protected areas, as needed, through studies and
establshment of additional federal, state or lcal level proectd ares (identification studies,
elimitation, creation and initial implaatation and equipment of additional conservation units);
- upport, whore appropriate, the implementation of eco-tourism in the surrounduigs of Protected
Arem.
7.            This sbcompont would complement and consolidate as eded fedral and state legislation
rdated direcy or indiectly to envuonmna protection, water management, protection of bio-diversity and
specid natual sites (watersheds, protection zovas along watrcouses, estuares, mangroves etc.), soil
conservation, managment of forest resources and others, in order to assure: (a) the continuity and efficiency in
the process of           of the envim t sctor; (b) the participation of the public at large in the
protection of the envirment; (c) the introduction of statef-the-at conepts, such as the principle of pollution
reldted tariffs and taxes, penodic environment audits and the application of progrms to minmize the generation
of residuals (in-plant controls), recycling, intervention in the definition of technologies of processes (low-waste
tecologies). Th component involves the following activities:
- training of local professonals (lawyers, academics, administrators, tecbnical specialists, etc.)
through a program of international exchanges in the area of enviromental legislion
(including aspect of civil and administrative law, criminal and tax/tributary law).
- prepare, as needed, ptoposals for further harmoning federa ad state level evironmental
legislation.
- elaboratoe/rvise legislation, if needed, related to the environntal protection-including urban
land use m the states of Oaxaca, Hidalgo, Guerro and Chiapas-with paricipation of the civil
society/pubic at lae.
- consider support to academic programs in environmental law.

B.                    EMig   feciD th frs lacandonn
8.            The Selva Lacandona of astern Chiaps is tbe last significant tact of tropical forest in the
northern hemisphoe. In recent years, its contigowus core has been reduced at a very rapid pace to some
199,000 ha (out of a totl of some 580,000 ha) located in the Biospher of Montes Azules. The remaiing
sgnificavt st tacts which stl exist in the lger Lacandona region,are located mainly along the higher
dtitde. of mountain  ngws, and to the south in Marques de Comillas.
9.           ITe prest  size of the Landona core forest must be considered as the minimum size
necssy to prevent a prtid collaps of its highly endemic and exceptionally diverse eo-system. The concept
of Biosphero umdetlines the wodd wide importance of the Mont Azles reserve, and est h8es cerain
principles for its consevation; however, the Biosphere stus is not one of strict preservation.
10.           In all, estimates ae that the Lacandona forest may have been reduced to about 10 percent of
its origina size, as a result of large timber and rubber concessions sine the turn of the century until the 1920s
to more t   200 North American and British firms. Between 1930 and 1980 arge timber and rubber
concessimos were given to national firms (one of which had a conesion for 10 yeare to extract annually
90,775 m3 of timber per aum). While these concessions were grdually withdrawn over the last 20 years,
this did not result in any sigficant rduction of timber extraction and deforestation, as long as the two most
ntorious saw mills-th CompaNia Forestal de la Lacandona (COFOLASA) and the Compaflia TRIPLAY of
Palenque (TRIPSA) continued to operate a concession of 1,308,312 ha. Their operations were finally
discontinued in 1986.
11.           Whilo the last two decades saw a gradual decline of timber extraction, they also saw the
pallel iso of in the development of extensive livestock schemes, and of migration to the region for purposes
of a mdimentary slash and bun subsistence agriculture, and of Govemment settlement schemes, most
importantly in the frontier area of Marques de Comillas. According to data provided by the Chiapas
govemment, deforestation accelerated at an alarming rate: In 1875 tho region had 1,245,000 ha of pnmary
fores; in 1969 only 800,000. Between 1970 and 1975, 314,000 has were destroyed; between 1976 and 1980,
nother 128,000 ha; and between 1983 and 1988, another 143,000 ha-leaving a total of 580,000 ha of primary
forest cover in 1989. In summary, of the 665,000 has of foret cover destroyed over the last century, 585,000
were destoyed within the last 18 years.
12.           The Andona region has been a histoncally highly significant center of Mayan culture, and
comprises some 12 important archoological sites, all of them only partially excavated or not yet explored at all.
Today, the region is home to several Indian groups (some 400 Lacandones (who are believed to be a subgroup
of Mayans who migrated to the zone some 2 centuies ago), some 42,000 Tzeltales, 13,000 Tojolabales, some
8,000 Choles, and some 600 Tzotziles, and to Mostizuis/ migrant settlers from other parts of the country). In
1986 the total population of the Lacandona Region was estimated around 150,000. The Lacandona region at
present is relatively sparsely settled, with some 12 inhabitants per sq km, 35.4 percent of the area are under
ejidt land tenure, 47.2 percent are communal lands (of the Lacandona Indians), 9.2 percent are private preperty
and 8.2 pet are nationa lands. Successive legislation defined the Lcndona Indian, Forest and Biosphere
areas respectively: (a) a forest protection zone of 2,600,000 ha; (b) Forest Region for the Lacandona Indians of
1,300,000 ha; and (c) the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve of 331,200 ha. In addition to agriculture-based
development, the Lacandona region has been in racent years characterized by exploratory activities for oil
drilling by PEMEX, by refugee problems and other national security concerns associated with its bordering on
Guatemala. Major hydro-power development on the Usumacinta and several other rivers has been proposed in
the region-but, because of its highly controversial nature, for the time being postponed.

Recent Measure
13.           Because of the drastically accelerated deforetation rate and the growing threats of losses of
bio-diverity, the national and state govermets have take a series of measu  over the last two years to
break the pevailing trend, most importantly a presidential prohibition of futher timber extracfion and
agricultual land clearing. Increasing efforts have been made, among them:
- increased patrols and inspection to avoid illicit timber extraction;
- permits for the withdrawal of wood in 1989 were only given for timber felled prior to the 1988
prohibition, and need prior inspection by SEDUE, SARH and the State government;
- in 1990  l imber withdrawal has beea interdicted. Titmber companies have not been allowed
to tow already felled trees. While some contrand may still persist in the Guatinalan border
zone, this restriction has had a significant impact and saw mills in the region have been closed
down;
- promotion of protection against forest fires, and organization of farmnes for prevention
putposes. This has resulted in a virtual halt of forest fires in the Lacandona region and an 85
percent reduction state-wide;
- under the statewgovernment's coordination (acuerdo SARH/Gobierno Estatal), inter-institutional
integrafion of activities related to the forest sector. This state-level arrangement substitutes for
the previous federal Lacandona Forest Commission, given that the federal level has delegated
its responsibilities for the Lacandona Forest to the state;
- suspension of large scale catle schemes;
- a campaign of meetings and information to raise the level of consciousness regarding the
importance of preservation of the Iaandona Forest among local communities (the largest one
in August 1989 in Ocosingo);
- the cancellation of a variety of agricultural expansion authorization processes;
- a control of forest clearings (clearing of secondary growth (fallow))to the extent that several
ejidos have declared a disposition to relocate, provided they would be given altemative lands
elsewhere;
- workshops and meetings have been carried out in each community to establish farmers' needs
and joint programs of farmers and government authorities to attend to them;
- formulation of the medium term 'Programa de la Selva- (still being finished for the Cafadas
region);
creation of the Rural Development District of the Selva Lacandona, which began to function in
July 1990 as the single, collegiate entity for the planning, integration and evaluafion of
development activities;
initial implementation of programs and action plans for the development of the communities,
specifically, since 1989 programs in all sectors, with the objectivc  employment generation,
food production and income generation for the local populations without negatively affecting
the natural resource base. The projects initiated in 1989 include the construction of class
rooms, rehabilitation of rural roads, construction of the regional Hospital in Marques de
Comillas, electrification, construction of latrines, improvements in the supply of merchandise.
However, the most important changes have been introduced through the productive projects

(rubber plntations, cocoa production improvemets, coffee replantings, a coffee proessing
(dying facility, installation of smal scale irigation equipment, insalation of Stoa
facilities, seasonal credit for annual crops (bes, com and chili), pig and poultfy units. animal
health/inoculation cmaigns, etc.). These projects all air at an intensification of land use in
already deforsd  eas, in order to elmin ate th need for new additional land clering;
- the first two watch posts have been constuct  (a total of 12 are planned) for the control of
timber logging and other floa, fauna and agnculture related items, at critical road
intersections;
- a natural esoue inventory has begun, but due to cloud cover conditions the aerial
photography could not yet be completed; a related semiar was held in San Cristobal de las
Cam in July 1990 and
- creation of a single state-level coordination Channel: the COPLADE subcommittee for the
Selva Lacandona.
14.            In 1990, new land clearings and burnings have been drastically decreased compared to the
levels of previous years. The 1990 investment plans call for an amplification of the types of programs initiated
in 1989, as well as the initiation of additional schemes (e.g., sheep units, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, plantains,
forest seedling production for afforestation purposes, bees, kitchen gardens), as well as stepped up patrol
programs in the Caiadas area.
The Proposed Special Proiect
15.            The Specid Project for the Lacandona Forest would support the ample program developed by
the Chiapas State Government for the protection of the Lacandona Forest. It would have the dual objective of
strict protection of the Montes Azules Biosphere and of promoting the conservation of remaining forest tracts in
the larger Lacandona Region through appropriate land use, social and economic development, protection,
research, communication, and inter-institutional coordination programs, and funding mechanismb. This program
would extend to the subareas of the Biosphere Reserve (331,200 ha134.6 percent), the Lacandona Community
(252,631 ha/26.4 percent), Marques de Comillas (203,999 haW21.3 percent), Zona Norte (87,867 hai9.2
percent) and Canadas (81,542 ha/8.5 percent). The project is smmarized in the following tables:

DECENTRALIZATION AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMEN1  JJECT
FOR THE DISADVANTAGED STATES
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS. CAPACITY AND THE
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
A. Introduction
1.             The purpose of this annex is to provide an overview of the institutional arngements and reated
capacity issues and describe the objectives, approach and activities of the institutional development component.t
The analysis is first presented of four of the components of the project: rural roads; water supply; agriculture; and
education. The major issue in these is the capacity of the line agencies and local governments to implement the
planned works and to maintain them, especially given the context of increasing devolution of responsibiility to state
and municipal levels. In the areas of water supply, agriculture, education, and health, institutional development
activities will be conducted though the involvement of other Bank supported projects.2 In rural roads, capacity
issues are to be addressed through a program of technical assistance and training provided for within the project's
institutional developmtent component.
2.              It is important to note that in each of three of the sectors (roads, water supply and education);
project investments in infrastructure will primarily be contracted to the private sector. In these areas, concem for
institutional capacity rests with assessing the public sector agencies' ability to handle the more limited functions
related to planning, contracting and supervision of works.
3.             The institutional development component focuses on developing institutional capacity at the state,
municipal and community levels to plan, prepare, implement and operate and maintain development efforts. The
component will provide management and organizational development assistance to the inter-institutional planning
bodies at each level, the Sectetaria de Programacion y Presupuesto (SPP), and the municipalities and communities.
The assistance designated for the road sector will also address specific technical as well as organizational issues.
B. Proect Imglementation Arran_tmets and Capacity
Rual Roads Comoonent
4.             The program of rehabilitation, maintenance and construction of new rural and feeder roads in the
four states is the largest single component of the project.  In each of the four states, the Secretaria de
Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) centers,5 through the Comision Nacional de Carreteras Alimentadoras
(CONACAL), have primary responsibility for supervising the implementation of project activities. In each state,
however, there is one or two state agencies which, through an agreement with the SCT at the state level, will
execute portions of the work either directly or through contracts to the private sector. In addition to their role
during project implementation, the state agencies will be responsible for the ma;eance and continued construction
and rehabilitation of the rural road system following project completion. Annex 1 identifies the steps to be taken
in devolving responsibility for both construction and maintenance of rural roads from SCr to the state agencies and
to municipalities during the project.
1.         Specific targes for the institutional development component ae preented in Annex 1.
2.         In agrculbure the project is ongoing (PROCATI), in water supply and health the projects have been presented to the Board,
ad in education the project is under preparation.
3.          The SCT-Centers are directly responsible to the scr headquatters at the federal level.

S.            As the nural road component is the largest, representing 43 percmt of Bank financing, the capacity
sf the SCT and the state roads agencies to improve and then maintain the mrgul road system is crtical. Table I
presents the growth in investment by each agency in Chiapas, Guerrero and axwac fom 1989 to 1990 and relates
that data to the projected annual rate of investment to be undertaken during the project. As illustratd by the table,
changes in the levels of investment during the project by each *&ency is projected to range from -W percent (vCT
Oaxaca) to 128 percent (CAO Oaxaca). The average increaso of investment during the project is 33 peont per
year from 1990 to 1993.

6.            Ensuring adequate institutional capcity for the implementation of this cmponet will be addred
in the following manner:
(a)    increasing the use of consulting eng    for desig work in addition to increasg contcting
for constmetion works;
(b)    incresing the number of professiond engie  in the state agencies to strengthen capacit for

7.             Significantamounts of new road constructionand rehabilitationofexisting roads will be contracted.
Initial plans for the states of Chiapas. Guero and Oaxaca, inckude the folowing: 68 perct of rural rd
construction and rehabilitation will he contracted, and 88 percent of feeder road construction and tehabilitation will
be contracted. Much of the maintenance activities will also be contracted. Forty-two percent of the rural road
maintenance will be contracted, as will 52 percent of the maintenance for feeder roads.
8.             According to the reports provided by each sktae, significant increases in state agency engineering
staff ..t planned. In Chiapas, the SDUC has increased its engineering staff from 7 to 40 from 1989 to 1990, an
inccease of 470 percent. In the next year it plans a further increase of 22, bringing the total to 62 (an aggregate
increase of 785 percent). Also in Chiapas, the CEC has increased from 15 to 19 engineers over the last year (an
increase of 27 percent). Over the next year it plans a funher increase of 15, bringing its total to 34 (au aggregate
increase of 127 percent).
9.            In Oaxaca, the CACU nas 32 engineers, copard with 24 in 1989. Over the next three yeas, it
will increase engineering staff by 42 (a total increase of 175 percent ftom 1989 to 1993), with 18 of those new
engineers being added in 1991. In Guerrero, MAQUINOP wiU increase its staff of 9 engineers by 32 in 1991 (an
increase of 355 percent), giving it a total of 41 engineers. The figures for curent and projected increase in
engineering staff for Hidalgo are not immediately available, but can be expected to also be significant.
10.           Institutional development activities will include tecbnical assistance and taining for each state
institution and for the municipalities to which some functions will be devolved. Over the four years of the project,
this will involve: (a) 50 persontmonths of TA per state, including two professional engineers and a training
specialist; (b) assistance for the preparation of updated SCT manuals and for the creation of a model for road use
cost/benefit analysis; and (c) 10 to 12 training activities per state. See Annex I for a list of targets for the
implementation of this institutional development program.
11.           Table A10.2 reviews the implementation arrangements in each of the states and identifies particular
elements of the institutional developmnent program in support of each.

responsible for the prepatation of the Master Guide for Road Development for Chiapas.
The state SCT office wiU supervise and assist the state agencies involved in the
implementation of project activities, and will only be directly responsible for execution
(mostly by contracting) of 11 percent of the investment.
STATE               Comision Estatal do  Caminos (CEC) and Dirctorato of Public Works, of the
AUTHORITIES         Secretaria de DesaroUlo Urtbno y Commicaciones (SDUC): lhese two state agencies will

B. GUERRR
FEDERAL            SeCretaria de Comunicaciones v Transporte (SCT): The SCT office at the state level,
AUTHORITY          on behalf of the federal SCT, is currently responsible for both federal roads and rural roads.
It will have primary responsibility for supervising and assisting the state agency in its
implementation role. Although responsibility for construction and maintenance of ural
roads will be devolved to the sta:e agency by December 31, 1992, SCT is responsible for
executing approxinately 57 percent of the planned works.
STATE              The Maguinaria para Obras Populars (MAQUINOP), has been primarily
AUTHORITY          responsible for the use and maintenance of highway equipment. Through the project the
role of MAQUINOP in constructing as well as maintaining roads will be expanded. It wilt
be responsible for the execution of approximafc ty 43 percent of the invesnt in roads
during the first year of the project. By 1993, it will be responsible for both construction and
maintenance of the rural road system.
INSTITUTIONAL    In order to effectively decentralize responsibility for rural roads in Guerrero, a
DEVELOPMENT    a state regulating aaid planning organization is required. During implementation, the state
TA team will assist in the identification and developaent of the an appropriate form of
organizational arrangements for the institutional management of the sector. In addition,
municipalities will receive assistance through MAQUINOP to develop their capacity for
m.naging the maintenance functions.
C. MM"ALGO
FEDERAL            Secretaria de Comunicaciones I Transuorte (SCT) and the JUt LA    de Caminos
AUTHORITY          (JLC): The SCT office at the state level and the JLC are currently responsible for both
federal and rural roads. By January 1, 1991, however, the staff of the JLC wiU be
transferred to the state.
STArE              General Directorate of Communications and Trnsuort (DGCT), of the Sectde
AUTHORITY          Desarrollo Urbano. Comunicaciones y Obtas Publics (SEDUCOP): SEDUCOP curently
has regulatory, construction and maintenance responsibilities for the state road system only.
In the project, SEDUCOP will participate, under the supervision of SCr, in the executioa
of construction, rehabilitation and maintenance works.  By December 31, 1992,
responsibility for construction and maitenance will be devolved to SEDUCOP, with further
devolution of maintenance occurring to the municipalities.
INSTITUTIONAL    SEDUCOP will be strengthened during project implementation in order to be able to
DEVELOPMENT    wmintain and continue developing the rua  road system  improved during project
implementation. (It is possible that instead of strengthening SEDUCOP, the state
government -ill decide to establish a semi-independew body to take ovet these functions.)
In additon, municipalities will receive assistsae through SEDUCOP to develop their
capacity for managing the maintenance functions.

FEDIRAL              Secetana de ComuniWaciones v Transoe (SCfl: The SCT office at the state level,
AUTHORITY            on behalf of the Federal SCT, is currently responsible for federal and mrl roads. As of
1989, however, it has begun to transfer responsibility for rural r'nds to the Oaxacan state
road agency, the Caniinos y Autopist  de Oaxaca.  SCr will have the primary
responsibility for supervising and assisting in the project's roads compoleat, with
responsibility for construction and maintenance completely devolved to the state by
December 31, 1992. SCT itself will execute, almost completely through contracts, 43
percent of the project road investment in the state.
STATE                Caminos y Autopistas dg Oaxaca (CAO): The CAO is responsible for the state road
AUTHORITIES          system, and its main activities to date have been in the maintenance of thWt system. CAO
will continue assuming responsibility for rural roads from SCI, as indicated above. In the
project the CAO will be responsible for executing 57 percent of the project road investment
in the state. It is planned that approximately 20 percent of its work will be contracted, and
the rest directly executed by the CAO.
INSTITUTIONAL    Given the expanding role of the CAO, institutional strengthening of CAO is a priority.
DEVELOPMENT          In order to design an institutional strengthening strategy, the TA team will need to assess
the overall institutional needs of CAO, and specifically, ways to improve the management
of the highway equipment CAO possesses. In addition, municipalities will receive assistance
through CAO to develop their capacity for maging the maintenance functions.
Water Supply Component
12.             The three year project plan calls for an investment of US $101.6 million in 1,893 drinking water
works and improvement projects in the four states over three years. Of this, Bank financing is for US $26.7 million
(on a 1:1 rmatching basis). These investments will serve localities with a population between 500 and 10,000
inhabitants.
13.            In Mexico, responsibility for the design, construction and operation of local water supply systems
has been devolved to state water agencies. In the four states participating in this project, these agencies are DAPA
(Chiapas), Comision de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado (CAPAEG-Guerrero), Cornision Estatal de Servicios
Publicos (CESP--Hidalgo), and the Comision Coordinadora de los Sistemas de Obras y Servicios de Agua Potable
y Alcantarillado del Estado (COCSOSA-PAEO--Oaxaca). Of those four agencies, thre (in Chiapas, Hidalgo and
Oaxaca) are line agencies of the state, and one (in Guerrero) is a state pstatal.
14.             These state agencies rarely do design or construction work themselves, depending upon private
sector contractors and the technical assistance of the federal Comisi6n Nacional del Agua (CNA). Thus CNA has
a significant technical and oversight role with regard to state water works.4 Tbese agenci  will receive technical
assistance and review from the CNA and will contract both design and construcion of works to the private sector.
Given this defined role of the public sector, the required capacity of the state agencies is Iimite to the following:
4.  The CNA: (a) applies, modifies, and monitors wector-developmentpolicies; (b) prepa  technical standard; (c) cass_t imnplemnn
agencies in project prepartion, construction, and works supervision; (d) provides technical assistance to operating egencies;
(e) participates in each State Water Supply and Sanitation Subcommiitee (SWS) as technica cretri; (t) develops and inmlements
the National Training Program, in coordination wih the Institto Mexicao de Tecwotoga del Agp (UrA) nd the Asciacion
Nacional de Orpnisms Opendores de Agua Potable (ANOAPA); (g) monit  and pubiShe the  nual per1ormance indictors of
the operating agencies; (viii) preparw annuat action plans to improve the perfomiance of the operting agencies; and (h) implenmwu
the Water Pollution Contol Prograni.

on esblihed cdita) to be fmvwded for appra by CNA;
(b)    contctg and supevising private sector consultant in the design ad constucto  of the

(d)    providing technical assistace to small municipalities and communities to develop matenance
regimes (this function may be contrcted by the community itber to stato or privat agencis).
15.           The project requi  that users pay sufficient watr tariffs to cover teo os of opeaos and
maintenan, and that communities ond  unicipalities either provide these services dirtly or contrt them. An
operations and maintenance plan, including a plan for the charging of taiffs, is required for the approval of any
subproject. During prject preparation, the capacity of the commities themselves to opewte and maintai th
war supply system was aems to be low or nil in 92 percet of the cases. Nevertals, it is anticipated that
with the charging of water taiffs, those communities will be able to hire the required expets.
16.           Technical assitance and trang to strengt  these state agies will be an inporat iput to
mcrse their implementation capacity. This assistance will be povided through the Bak supported Wter Supply
and Saatio Sector Project (WSSP). Assistance will include an institutional _ot in each sate and the
conduct of an institutioald development program tailored to that assessment.
Education ntMg
17.           Authority for the education sector in Mexico is highly etalized, with the federa Se_etaria de
la Educacion Publica (SEP) responsible for promugating national policy and admis g the education system,
through its units at state level. However, a gradual prncess of doecetralization has begun, and responibility for
the admiation of the system has, in pat, been deconcentrated to the state offices of SEP, while responsbbiity
for the consmuction and maintenance of schools has, in part, been devolved to sate agecies.  Under the
govemmet's decentralization policies, it is anticipatod that further decentaliation will occur over the net four
years.
18.           Cumady, with the exception of Oaxaca, the constuction of secondary schools in the other three
states is the responsibility of the federal Comite Admindor del Progrms Federal de Consuccion de Escuelas
(CAPFCE), while the constuction of primay schools has been recently du.xlved to stt agenie. In Osasca,
CAPFCE constucts pre-sh     and technical schools, ad the stao agency Secrtaia de Desario Urbeo,
Comunicaciones y Obras Publics (SEDUCOP) constucts both primay and seconday schools. Te project contns
an investment of US$131 million for inasrcure for primay and seconday education Th Bnk financd portio
of this is US$35 million (on a 1:1 matching basis). Only financing for increasing and improving inrstuctr will
be included in the CUD as pat of PRONASOL
19.           As in the other aeas of the prect, plans for the constuction and rebabiliton of schools he
been developed through the stat plannig process involving the COPLADE and the COPLADEMs. Durig the
thrie years of the project, a totd of 3,517 new scbools will be built, including a taet of 793 for Chiqs, S04 for
Guaro, 840 for Hidalgo, and 1380 for Omxaca
20.            Te constrction and ehabilitation of school ficilities will be coaied out by priate sector
contator, under the upervi    of CAPFCE (secondary school) or th state agncies pm y schools). Given
the elative inexperine of state  cies with th costuction of prmary schools, CAPFCE wiU maintain ovesight
tesosibility for their work. In any case th  stts ae having difficdt me     thidr panned tages, CAPFCB
wil reftin t  autty to ite         direcy to support the c at activities.

21.            Nevertheless, tchnical capacity isue we not expected to hinder the schievement of project
targets, In,1989 in Oaxaca, for example, the stae agency SEDUCOP planned io constnuct 750 carooms (i.e.,
53 percent of the three year target established by the project). It comploted 234 of the 750, with the deficit being
explained as due principally to lack of financing. Under an agreed stategy, any planned school construction that
Is not being implemented by February of each year by each state, will be transferd to the federal agency in charge
of consttuction and awarded as contract in order to be ready for the upcoming school year.
Agriculture Component
22.            The project budget for agriculture development activities in the four stdes over three years is
US$327 million. Of this investment, Bank fmancingwillbe US$41 milionforaricultualpromotionandextension
(including forestry and livestock), US$36 million for small scale irtigation, and US$11 million for agroindustry (on
a 1:1 matching basis).
23.            Govemnmental asistance to agriculture development is prinaily a fedea responsibility in Mexico.
The national Secretaria de Agricultura y Recursos Hidtaulicos (SARH) is the prinipal public sector institution
providing agricultural services to farmers in all states. SARH's operatios have been e5fectively deconcenate
to the state level, which operates the program through its offices at the district level (Distritos de Desarrollo Rural
Integrado-DDRI).s Within each district, there are three to five 'nural dvelopme support centers (CADERs).
The responsibilities of the DDRI, through the CADERs include: (a) technical assisnce in crop, animal and
foresty producton; (b) organization and training of farmers; (c) water resource management; (d) credit and crop
insurance; (e) artificial insemination and animal heath; (f) collection of agriculture statistcs; and (g) a range of
social progrms (e.g., nutntion, health, and family planning).
24.            The National Institute of Crop, Animal, and Forestry Research (INIFAP) is responsible for
agricultural research throughout Mexico. In each of the four states there is a state director of research, fumded
directly from the national INIFAP headquarters. Research is conducted from expeiment stations (e.g., Oaxaca has
three crops research stations, one forestry rescArch station and one livestock research station). The State Comnuittee
for Progammig and Evaluation of Research (COEPEI) provides overal guidance and review of the research
program. This comnmittee is made up of INIFAP and SARH representatives as well as representatives of the state
university and farmers organizatioDs.
25.           Irrigation development is handled by two federal agencies, the Comision Nacional de Agua (CNA)
and the Fidoicomiso de Riesgo Compartido (FIRCO). The CNA is responsible for public sector irrigation, and
focuses on the design, development and operation of medium and lage scle systems. Small scale irrigation
assistance to low income producers (i.e., mainly dug wells) is provided through FIRCO, a special fr's" providing
a mixture of grant, credit and technical asistance. Imgation assistance under the proect, as it is focused on small
community run systems, would be provided maiuly through FIRCO.
26.            As is the case with the other sectors, agriculture investments will be identified both by communities
and line agencies, and reviewed and approved by the COPLADEs. Once approved, work on the projects may be
contracted to the private sector directly by the communities or may be executed by the line agencies. Built into each
project budget is an additional five percent which is given to the executing agency (most likey SARH) to cover
_ohreimbursable costs.
27.            Ihere is evidence of a significant level of unused capacity in the SARH and INIFAP that can be
tapped by the project. In 1988 there were cuts in the investment budget for SAR! and INIFAP, without cuts in
personnel of a corrsponding number. For example, in Chiapas the authortzed SARH budget of US$27 million was
reduced to US$17 million. In the same year, budget cuts in DiNFAP/Chiapas' prognrm forced a reduction of
research activity by 50 percent.
J.  In Owaca thrm are swven DDRI, in Chapas nine, in Guroo six, aed in Hidalgo six.

Institutional Devt.onment Component
28.           The purpose of the institutional development component of the project is to support the effective
planning and implementation of project investments and to contribute to the long term capacity of state and local
entities to continue directing their own development efforts.
29.           Overall responsibility for guiding project implementation is assigned to the federal Secreiriat of
Programming and Budgeting (SPP) and its four state offices. The project uses existing decentralized institutional
arrangements for the planning, budgeting and review of the investment program. This system has been established
under the guidance of the federal SPP, and involves the use of inter-agency and beneficiary planning commissions
at the state (COPLADE). regional (COPLADER) and local (COPLADEM) levels. Proposals that arise through this
participative planning procers are reviewed at the state level and then matching federal grant funds are provided to
the state through the Convenio Unico de Desarrollo (CUD).
30.           The SPP's state and regional offices provide direct support to this planning process by acting as
a secretariat to planning commissions at each level. In order to effectively implement project investments, Special
Coordinating Groups (SCGs) will be established by SPP at the federal, state and regional levels. Those Groups will
be responsible for providing administrative and technical support for project implementation. The federal SCG will
be staffed with eight professionals providing expertise in the areas of budgeting and progrmming, financia
administration, monitoring and evaluation, and technical support. Each state and regional SCG will also be staffed
in the same manner. Plans for the addition of other staff by federal and state institutions appear in Attachment 4.
31.           The state SCG staff will be dedicated exclusively to project activities, since the average workload
for each state for procurement, supervision, accounting and disbursement, would be about 300 projects per year,
with invoices for about US$21 million. In addition to providing technical assistance to the COPLADE in the review
and processing of project plans and disbursements, the state and regional SCGs will be responsible for providing
training and technical assistance to the 840 municipalities in the development of project proposals. Because of the
key role of the SCGs in project implementation, the creation and staffing of the SCGs is a conditidon of negotiation.
32.           The institutional development component will provide training and technical assistance in
management-related areas, primnanly focused on the planring commissions, the SCOs, and local govenmnts
(municipalities and localities). The component is budgeted for a total of US$11.35 million for technical assistance
and training, plus an additional US$3.2 million in assistance for the Indian Development Fund and US$4.2 for
studies (identified in pars. 34 below). Tle US$11.35 million will finance:
(a)    institutional development technical assistance (22 person months for each state and for the federal
SPP/SCG office, 50 r3rson months for each state road institution, the development of an updated
SCT manual for feeder roads, for a total of US$5.9 million), and
(b)    the design and conduct of on-site training courses addressing specific areas rehlted to project
implementation (e.g., project planning and appraisal, budgeting and expenditure control, and
project reporting and monitoring, engineering design and supervision, for a total of US$5.45
million).
33.           Central to the approach to institutional development will be the use of regular planning
workshops/seminars to provide an opportunity for operational level planang, the identification and resolution of
implementtation problems, and identification of specific training and technical assistance needs. In workshops held
twice a year, representatives of the four stats and the federat government (with Bank participation) will assess the
progress and current status of the project, prepare and re;we state investment programs, and cc -.re experience
among states. Similar workshops will also be held annually within each state for staff at state ana regional levels,
providing an opportunity for the SCG and the members of the COPLADEs and COPLADEMs to conduct similar
reviews.

34.           A major task of institutional development technical assitance (TA) will be to assist the SCOs in
the orgaization and conduct of these workshops, and the documentaon and follow-up of their results. Specific
institutional development and sector-reated tcchnical assistace and training will then be prog _tmmed to address
identified problem areas.
35.           Management-related taining TA will focus on the following areas: planning, finance, and
budgeting, project prepaation and appraisal, operation of management information systems for project monitoring,
and evaluation of project impact. Institutional strengtheni  activities for the water supply institutions will be
provided through the Bank supported Water Supply and Sanittion Sector Project (WSSP).
36.           Furthermore, in addition to the institutional development component, a provision has been made
for A series of studies, focused on: (a) compartive advantages and project identification, (b) rual employment and
specific needs for poor migrat households, (c) muketing of basic staples, and (d) socio-econic monitoring and
evaluation of the results of investments thugh the Indian Development Fund. The total amount budgetd for these
studies is US$4.2 million.

DECEUXRMljZATION ANp U         OGIO,AL DEVFLO?4ENT PROJECT
FOR THE DISADVANTAGED STATES
PROIECI INPUTS: INSTITJTIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
1.            The project would help to bridge or mitigate institutional capacity gaps as identified against project
tasks during project pparation. For this purpose the project would finance a technical assistance and training
program of a combined budget of US$11.35 million. The creation of new administrative units has been limited as
much as possible to strengthen the capacity of existing organizational stuctues. The new units to be created (the
Federal and State Special Coordinating Groups) would be integrated in existing structures in such a way so that they
can become part of the permanent structures at the end nf project.
2.            Technical Assi    includes: (a) 22 staff months of organization and fimncial management
specialists for the central level and as many for each of the four States, for a total of 110 staff months; (b) 50 person
months for each state road institution for a total of 200 months; (c) assistance in the development of an updated SCT
manual for feeder roads. This assistance would help install modemn project management procedures; review norms,
inter-institutional relationships and internal distribution of functions so as to establish as early as possible, a smooth
flow of management functions within the Federal level, and between the latter and State and Municipal levels. The
specialists would work on necessary management tools (inter-institutional linkages) for making it explicit and
tansparent what project objectives (including evaluation indicators) resources and tasks (including monitoring and
organizing the reassessment of dsills especially at municipal level). Thereafter, they would help launch and deliver
training activities accordingly. The total cost of this sub-component amounts to US$5.9 million. These technical
assistance services would be acquired through a combination of ICB and LCB.
3.            Skill Ungradinu Activities include over 500 training activities, informative meetings, courses,
seminars, fellowships and possibly others to reach virtually all project tasks implementers at all administrative levels.
All trining activities have been identified against tasks. Skill gaps would be further identified and refined before
final training plans are designed. Most of the training activities are to be delivered by SPP and other Federal
Agencies' administrative and professional staff. Some specialized courses, especially to enhance municipal level
administrative skills, are to be delivered with the support of the Mexican Institute of Public Administration and
others with the assistance of technical assistance specialists. Training activities are to be evaluated through
interviews of trainees' supervisors to check on the bridging of their previously identified skill gaps. These training
activities would help bridge: (a) management skill gaps such as overall project management and coordination
functions; (b) professional skdll gaps such as planning, progrmming and budgeting, public finance control
(auditing), supervision activities; and (c) technical skill gaps such as systems operation, monitoring and evaluation,
budgeting, evaluating investment proposals sector-related skill gaps and others. Emnphasis would be on courses for
State and Municipal level staff and to a certain extent, for communities organizations' personnel and members.
Training activities at the municipal level should allow municipal capacity to move from the curret level to next
higher-capacity ranking by the end of project implementation. As this should be the States' responsibility, the
Federal level should ensure adequate transfer of technology at the State level before they can possibly strengthen
the municipal capacity. Total cost of this subcomponent has been estimated at US$5.45 million of which 30 percent
would be in foreign currencies.
4.            Eqgipment and Vehicles. The project would provide for the financing of office equipment,
furniture, technical equipment, the printing of information and diffusion material, computers and vehicles. This
would help equip State and Municipal offices up to their new responsibilities requirements. Detailed description
of this category of inputs is in the Component Workdng Papers. The cost of this sub-component would be included
in the state investment programs.

(b) saary iwrmets and salay of akdidonal saff (US$40 milion); and (c) internal travel and subsistence costs
(US$1.1 million). These costs would not be fianced by the Bnk loon.

repotig, ao weln undestood, put into pbce and activated as  o as possible. At the stae level, a siitlar
stucture would be organzd simultaneously. However, asstance to the mmuicipaities should be orgnized from
the stat Ivel where tcbicd assistance would aso be made avlable. As edy as possible in that prcess, an
asessment should be made as to how to deliver tchical aistace to rgon grouping of municipalities in every
state and consequenldy, whetier resident assistance mus be povided by thde stat govenments to deliver these
services efficiently.

and evaluation requirements and arrangements for the project. The project data ollection system
would integrate information from subproject selection through evaluation. Data gathering would
be coordinated with INEGI activities in Living Standards Measurements Survey (LSMS) and
organized to meet routine, semiroutine and special focus monitoring concerns for each of the
three project components;
(d) defining the analytic M&E agenda to determine subproject and component implementation
progress and performance (analysis of service delivery, feedback mechanisms, coordination of
inputs and policies, follow-up for corrective action);
(e) designing and managing the project M&E training program;
(f) managing overall project reporting requirements and preparing reports on progress, performance
and impact; coordinating these projects with the Financial Administration Section; and

(by  as.sss the capacity of the Section to deliver the required assistance and suggest any additional
measures to be taken by management to ensure the delivery of efficient and titmely assistance
including the identification of other sources;
(c) establish norms and procedures for the delivery of technical assistance services included in the
pltn;
(d)  organize the management of assistance to the municipalities from the state-based assistance group;
and
(e)  carry out sectoral studies to review state and mnwicipal capacity to implement them and formulate
recommendations accordingly.
7.            The State Level: Organizational Framework. At the state level, a special coordinating structure
similar to the federal one would be created in the office of the State Planning Secretariat, in addition to the
existing overall policy and fuiancial responsibilities of the state Coordinating Boards (COPLADEs) where the
Secretary of Planning is the chairman. The Project State Special Coordinating Group would be staffed with a
chief and four sections, each having two professionals, except for M&E. The state M&E Section would be
staffed by a minimum of three and preferably four professionals. The functions would encompass stte level
M&E: planning, data base development, monitoring according to the three levels of the system (see Annex 7),
arranging for, carrying out training, reporting and executing subproject evaluations carrying out evaluations.
The state M&E Section would develop with technical assistance, a single data base for subprojects and for
monitoring indicators of decentralization and institutional development activities. This section would also
benefit from the design and establishment of an expert system for project selection and monitoring. The state
technical support sections would draw upon the state M&E Sections to provide technical assistance and support
to the munic'palities, NGOs and beneficiary groups as and when needed. These sections would organize,
channel and even directly deliver assistance needed at the Municipal level for subproject generation, monitoring
and the assistance to beneficiaries' organizations functions. In cases where intensive assistance should be
delivered to groups of municipalities, state authorities will get organized in subregional assistance bases with
support from the federal authorities, to increase efficiency and follow-up activities. This may be the case in
Oaxaca where municipalities are very numerous. The state Special Coordinating Groups would be staffed as
much as possible with existing staff thereby increasing cost-effectiveness and sustainability of Project benefits as
it is implemented.

DECENTRALIZATION AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJEC
FOR TME DISADVANTAGED STATES
PROPOSED MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM
IntroductUon
1.          The first question a manager or decision-maker wants to know is: 'Was the project successful?
and if yes, 'What made it a success?" and if not, 'why?' A monitoring and evaluation system aims to address
these and siniilar kinds of questions.
2.          As stated in the objectives of the project, success would be the improved pubiic service delivery
and well-being of the target population in the four states. These improvements would be brought about
through the Policy Change, Institutional Strengthening and Investment Program components. Tb. project will
be judged a success or failure by the degree to which changes in these components are reflected in better public
service delivery and poverty alleviation. Improved public service delivery would be determined by increames in
coverage, access to and use of such services. Changes in well-being would be measured by improvements in
the poverty index, for which base line data exists. A basic proposition of the project is that great
decentralization, revenue sharing, and investment targeting would produce the conditions expected to exist at the
end of the project.
3.          Project success criteria for the three project components would be: (a)  _   measumnt
(indicators) related to increases in decentralized public expendituiw, block grants (revere sharing, and
investments to the four states; (b) institutional strengtening measurements related to increased capacity in
perfonming critical planning, management and monitoring and evaluation functions at the different levels
of public administration of the four states (see Annex 3); and (c) iovesttnmeasures related to greater equity
in financial distribution among the four states and programs and in accordance wi satisfactory executiog
agency performance.
4.          Determination of progress and performance according to the success criteria wil not be an easy
matter. Three different leveis of information gathering and analysis will be required. Level  would focus on
progress and performance in terms of basic monitoring requirements: financial and physical achievements as
compared to project plan. Disbursements viul be especially importnt to monitor given the annual disbursenme
conditionalities.
5.          This level of analysis would be similar to activities already carried out but it would be amplified
to incorporate variables related to sub-projects' objectives, completion performance, utilization of project outputs
and beneficiary participation (not only regarding inputs [labor, materials, funds] but especially for operations
and maintenance and cost recovery). At present, SPP/Mexico carries the dominant share of this wodrkoad. As
it is the most basic level of analysis and one which requires fumiliarity at closer rnge than is possible from the
federal level, major aspects of this function would be shifted to the states as part of the decetralization effort.
This will permit SPP/Mexico to devote more attention to tasks related to the second and third levls of analysis.
6.          Level 2 would determine the extent to which program/sector targets are being accomplishod.
Targets have been established to indicate thi extent to which the project expects to contribute to imprOVing
infrastructure (social and productive), social sorvice coverage and access, and the sustainability of productive
investments. Asssent of these contributions will require data collection and analysis somewhat beyond
presently performed activities. It would draw upon information souraes which are already in place but ae not
often integrated into normal project monitoring.
7.          Level 3 would examine project impact on service delivery and poverty alleviation. This wwld
involve sorting out what variables would be the most directly and indirectly related to project investment and

implementation. It would require application of anaytic techniques, generlly associated with apphed research,
but tilring the to the present prject. It would also bring into consideration certain theoretical models of
poverty alleviation to help refine the analysis and guide its orietation. Among te questiona which would be
examined would be changes in agricultural production levels and adoption of new technologies; use of and
access to ad quality of water nd oducation services; operation and maintenae of itrigation systems; and
changes in agricultural commerialization. The proposed Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&E) defines
how information gathering and analysis for the thee levels would be caried out.
8.         TIis paper proposes a Monitorng and Evaluation System for the Regional Decentalization and
Development Project. It is based on a review of past experience with M&E under PIDERs 1, II, and mI and on
a cetain depth of understanding of the present SPP system. Furthermore, it builds on the project seection
system, proposed in n earlier paper. Three ar, weak in the past and pmeseat, would be improved: daft
collection on project execution beyond the financial and physical dimensions; analysis of project/progmm
progress, performance (especially in relation to investment outlays), and impact; and more rapid feedback for
planning and resource allocation. Given the policy changes expected in this project, M&E would also include
measures for monitoring and evaluating the effects such changes have on public service delivery and tesource
ail' ation as related to PNS fiaced projects.
9.          Specifically, the proposal defies: (a) the objective of the sysem; (b) information needs and
analytic activities at federal, state, and municipal/community level; and (c) opeational functions and procedures
of the system  It provides certain features to facilitate M&E execution. A M&E gstaty for data collection
and analytic work has been developed to permit a phased approach to extending the M&E coverage. All
proects would require monitoring accordig to Level 1 analysis described above; between 10-25 percent of the
projects would be monitored in relation to Level 2 analysis; and a smaller, but repreenative, proportion of
prects would be examined in terms of the Level 3 analysis. More details are provided on ndicatots according
to which progress, performance and the project's ultimate success (or failure) wwuld be determined Attamnt
1. A simple PrjA Monitog sheet would be introduced to ensute that data gateing includes information on
project objective, inputs (financial, matoeral and human resources), oututs (me4s), completion, utilization, and
beneficiary participation, i.e. the basic data reurements for Level 1 analysis. A       ecoim g
svstm is proposed whereby it would be possible to determine which kinds of ptojects are the most swcessful or
problematic.
10.        TMe proposal also envisions the comDuzeriaion of the system and its linking with the proiect
selection svstem. Subprojects could then be traced from initiation to completion over the entire project life,
including multi-year finncig.
11.         However, the overall success of the proposed approach will require a      andd and
penodic assessment. To ensure rapid geaing up and captue of data on as nwch of the 1990 program as
possible will men providing tcclincl assisae as soon as possible to help desgn the detailed aspects of the
proposed system. Therafter, technical assistance would be anually needed to help asss the effectiveness and
efficiency of the system and help redesign features as found necesay (see Attahment 1 for terms of
refeteQcs). A well defined ttbillig gm   woud be required which is sufficietly financed to cover SPP and
executing ageny staff, especially at sate and regional levels.
12.        ITe purpose of the M&E system would be to provide accwate, timely and useful inormation on
program progress and performmnce at key dacsion-malang levels of adminiton to ensure ptojects are
implemented as desiged, to peramt cofrective action and improved planning and resource allocaion. Indicators
for M&E success would be:

features. The main changes would result in a more inverse pyramid of infomion detal where the greast
d _sauregtion is at project level and the raest arqW _i is managed by SPP/Mexico. The existing four
levels of information _magement would be stamlned to provide a broader anmge of data on subpject

14.           The information reqwurements for each monitoring level are descnbed below. The basic unit
of data collection would be the subproject on which the following kinds of information would be obtained:
(Note: subitems are not in priority order)
(a)    Static factors
o Restatement of project objective and indicators which will determine success
o  Prior experience with this type of project
o  Land or other disputes
o Previous attempts to resolve the problem
o  Priority score received by Municipality/COPLADE
o  Commitment to project as per planned participation
o Expected profile of project returns on investment
o  Project cost milestones (if more than 1 yr project)
(b)     Imtlementation factors
o   outs: planned and actual financial, technical, and material resour   by source and
executing agency, including beneficiary; identification of discrepancies from plan during
execution by time, place and amounts; specification of follow-up action required and by
which agency;
o  Outputs: physical, other objectively verifiable target or conditions/ being achieved as a
result of the project compared to project plan; plarned and actual beneficiary participation:
changes in access, service/client relations; technical quality achieved; supervision during
execution by normativas and ejecutoras, and corrective action recommended if expected
outputs do not meet technical requirements; likelihood of Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
follow-up.
(c)   Environment or  ,cEto, a Extena to the Project
o Evidence of continued community pior.ity;
o Changes in economic situation which might negatively affect project results;
o Likelihood of end-user interest (eg buyers of products or services, water-users in view of
charges)

1S.         Thes information requirements would be collected on a Project Monitoing Sheet and would
constitute b main record of projec execution and sowue of iormation to monitor the projet. Pat m
outlins some of the operations and procedures that would be followed. In gerad, mitoring would focus on:
(a) comparisns of actua implementation  d outputs with prqoct design, O) ahiovemet of techical
standd/requirements; (c) processe of implementation followed (i.e. ppr3priate participation and coordination
by all elevant parties); and (d) examination of intoma and extaml issuos relvant to the project.
16.         The second levd of infonnation requirments would be Wareated data on project execution by
program sector and community, collected most probably by SPP/sbate  giond offices or municipalities, where
the capacity exist. To the existing financial and physical data gathering activities would be added information
on    investments by gM                   (mmary of project ratings)and ke WU of         by
municipality. Information geneated at this level would be presented in tabulr fonr similar to that reired by
the 1990 CUD Manual (i.e. forms SOL-15 to 19).
17.         At the third (SPP/Delegation and state) level of infamation collection data would be
aggregated from all the municipalities along much the same lines as at present (i.e., financial/physicallf) with
the following additions and modifications:
o     state-wide investments/disbursements by progress in outputs by program by municipality or
region;
o     state-wide investments by sector development Wm= igoal (for specific state) by program by
region (e.g. cbanges in literacy, school retention or dropout rates; changes in water-bore
diseases as reported from health center sources; changes in cropping patterns-greater
diversification; changes in commercial traffic on improved roads; changes in product availabiit;
at regional markets);
o     state-wide identification, categorization of key iyplemf pblem  by program by region
and by executing agency and generating conclusions an priority areas requiring corrective action;
o     state-wide linking infonMZWMon nn imwmDIm groblb                  _ with gQ    chantsexpected under
the project to determine impact of these changes and progm execution at state level.
18.         M&E work at state level would involve much more analytic activities than at present. The aim
would be to provide infonmation for managers and deision-makers in more useful form rather than aggregate as
at present and presented in lengy and difficult to assimilate tables. Hence, emphasis would be given to data
processing, cataloging, various kinds of analysis, intetpretation and relating it to state development goals.
19.         From the results of this work would come the identification of sp implementation and policy
related isues which could be further examined with the apulication of sidme and Mapid infotion athering
techn    . It is at state level that it would be decided to undertake such additional data collection which g2
beyond routine monitoring. Staff would need to be trained in these techniques. The main benefit these
information collection activities would provide would be to identify csl factors and relationships contributing
to success or shortfalls. Information generated from the routine monitonng system and these rapid, more
focused data collection activities could then be combined with data from other sources, extemnal to the program.
I/    Serious econideation of the contined requirement of aggregaed program or even project by prqeAct liHti of physica results for
an types of projects is remd  to determ  how this dt is uwefW or meaniN. As this data can easiy be retrved from
SPP/R&egl quattedy submissions, it dbould be pouible to requie a more diwrimite eporting on this vaiabb.
If    The nature and fequency of cerain probtems may lead to the need for more detiled data gathering at project level.

Instiute for Statistics, Goograhy and Informatn (IEGI) ad sctra aearias Dat from thr wurv
would be ilegrated and coordted with pje  td  infodmation ad wmade morD  m ngful and useble to
managemet.
21.         At SPP/M[ec tevel the four stat prgram woud be m tored according to much the sor
geneal financial varbles. The chan  from the prosmat information collection would be greater enhasis on
the integrtion of progam perfomce data and compason to overal program goals and pans. The states'
analytic information by progm, rteon, executing    cy, etc. would be , main inputs for overall progess
reportig sad performane     nt. At dbs levd poli. gm&=  d ovonl nomo allaion and
utilization isues would donuato monitonng activities. Th oxistg financid ptogram and budget  system as
well as progrm performance (e.g. distibution of financial allocatis, veification that resources went to tget
population, works complton, service delivery, etc.) would be te main deminants of infmation
requirements.
Anatic Activitaes
22.         In geal analytic activities would encompass three domains: (a) analysis of data generted by
Levels I and 2 and aggregated at LAvel 3 according to certain standd guidelines;S/ (b) analysis of data
obtained from special, nonroutine, rapid appaisal activities; and (c) analysis of data from PNS and non-PNS
sources to determine a broader undeanding of ptogress, performance and impact.
23.         The hiearchy of informatio management would also apply to cetin analytic activities. Ihe
aim woultd be to build at state-level sufficient experts to carry out many different basic analyses and to allow
central staff to concentrate on the broad performance and impact of the program.
Strater for Information Collction and Analysis
24.         It is evident that carryig out the proposed information and analysis activities will require training
as well as a grdual, phasing in of forms and procedures. CUD reporting forms aleady include aggregation by
SPP/Regions of project by project financial and physicai data. Most of this work (probably 90 percent) is
carried out manually. Therefore, a fundanental reqmmnt of implementing the M&E rgnopsal would be the
Porvision of a minimum computer cagacitv at SPP/Dolenation and state level.
25.         The second dimension of the str   to develop the information co1lection and analysis
capabilities would be to phase M&E activities over the life of the project. There are several options how to
phase operationalization of the proposl:
o     introduce tasks gadually but acoss all PNS financed projects (e.g., Year 1, achievement of
traning and using Prtect Moitoring and Scoring Sheets and analysis of these data sources by
state offices for determining progress and performance; Year 2, achievement of analysis of
progress/performance in relation to plans, implemenatsion problems/shortfalls by states with some
decentralization of simple proess and performaone data aggregation by sat-regions; Year 3.
achievement of full aray of analytic activities envisioned by proposal by end of project.
o     introduce tasks over a smal universe of projects, 50 per state, and carry out all the analytic
activities envisioned in a thorough and detaled mamner on these ptojects; by the end of the
project a weUl formulated and operating system should be in place at least for the sample projects
and a certain progress would be made in institutionaling the system across the four states.
O     attempt to combne certin aupects of both of these options, concenating on feedback ftom the
sample projects to improve the system'6 approach and design.

Monitoring Sheet each time they visit a subproject. On the bass of their findings, supervisors would scw
progres and perfonnance on the Project Monitoring Sheet afte consulttion with boenficies and ote
relevant puaties. Subsequently, these scores would be aggregated and profiles could be established on progre
and perfonmance by various categories as may be needed (e.g. progm, soctor, regions, municipalities, etc.).
Cain rues would be establishoed to trgger action when shoralls reach differeat levels of severty. This
informaton would become part of the routine reporting outputs required by SPPIMexco on a monthly basis and
comped in greater summay form for quatrly repors.
29.         Smiroutino monitonng would involve review of progress, performac soores and an analysis of
problems which surfce. The focus would be to examine project executtin  i ation to progra/sector tugets.
hese activities would be carned out on a quartly basis to feed into the quartely reports. ITh results would
lead to fudher investigstiOn of the nature of these problems and their causes. lTh seumro     monitoring
would provide the main feedback to decision-makers on th kinds of execution problems whicb require attention
as weUl as information on what activities are proving to be most successf and why.
30.         spe[ial    monitonng would emerge from the nature of issues arsing duing execution. Ihose
would involve questions related to senrice delivery and poverty alleviation. Projects would be selected with
certa sampling toechiques and monitored more closely for this purpose. A monitoring program wuld be
deied for capturig the data. Special focus monitoring would be undertken only after the rouine and
semiroutine monitoring is well established.
(b)  E _
31.         Evaluation functions would be organized according to the three levels of andysis described in
Part I above. The project would be annually evaluaed in terms of Level I analysis (i.e. progress and
performance of routine monitonng concers as woU as overall progress in decentalztio, institutional
development and investment program components). By the second annual ealuation, Level 2 analysis would
be added: pogress and performance in meeting program/sector tgets. Ihe finl project evauaion would
focus on Level 3 analysis, project impact On service delivery and poverty alleviat   In addition to this
hierwahy of evaution functions, subcouponents would have their own evaluatio exercise: the enviromment
program, the program for indigeos groups, and the technical assistae pfam
32.         Given the complex project sttucture, the large diversity of ptoject elements and the considerable
istituon streagthening required to carry out the monitoring and evaluation t , it will be necessary to
devieop dotaied Lmd    monom  and vdaMig       OMa for SPP/Mexico and each stte. This would become
part of the annual program review with the Bank to ensue full agreement on its content. The plan would
include a clear statement of expected institutiona capacity; activities (routine, sew , etc.), spocial studis,
and training to be undertken; and resource needs (financial, electronic, transport, specialized technical

madn i goals and trgets ad ay chags it woud requ
33.         The UMUNg fbr establishing the M&E sydem in full operation would be as follows: (a)
subprojecA mntoring would be designed and in pla by offctve and the eptd analytic capacity
for utilizig this data would be in pice witin three months thrafler (b) montorng and anaysis of progms
and perorman  in rlati  to progmm and sectr targets wowd be rady for the second nwalI project
evlution, by then an expet system should also have beon developed for M&E and be operating on a limited
basis; and fially (C) pject impact analysis would be well developed at leas five months before pject
compledon in ordor to m t an effective and efficient evaluation effort for the overall project s6sessment.
34.         Omc the dails of the M&E system have been elaborated, a truning program would be
deloped to tranit the changes in the existing system which are to be introduced. Participants in the ttaining
program would be: QGrop 1: SPP/region and municipal staff, Gu Z: SPPlDelegation, state M&E and Mexico
staff. and  Group : executing ageocy staff and beneficiuies. Basic trning should be completed after the first
yoar of imptation.
35.         Much of this traing could be contracted to reduce a1; worlcoad on PNS staff. However, the
desi and initial implementation of the training program should be part of the tasks of M&E technical
Assistance.
36.         A substantial amount of detail is required to complete the design of the project M&E component.
All tak related to routine subptoject monitonng, aggregation and processing of data and basic progress and
pfomance nalysis need to be ready by project effeciveness. Baseline data to be complemented with LSMS,
hcialized sampling, and rapid appraisal techniques are a second major undertaking that should be weU
undeway after six months following effectiveness. Developing an expert system for M&E and linking it with
project slectiaon constitte another major area for technical assistance.

DECENTRALIZATION AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENI PROJECT
FOPR THE DISADVANTAGED STATES
SUPERVISION PLAN
1.            In view of their innovative nature and complexity the supervision of the project requires a continuous
and high Bank staff input. Two workshops with SPPlBank paiticipation would take place. per year for a mnajor periodic
assessment of project implementation. Besides, it is planned that a staff position be created within the Bank office in
Mexico City to provide full time supervision to subproject execution in terms of civil engineering and economic
evaluation. The workshop that will take place in the first quarter of each year will provide an annual review of: (a)
investment programs; (b) technical assistance programs; (c) progress in policy measutes; and (d) review of recurrent cost
budgets comwected with the investment programs. In addition, we have agreed that a workshop will takc place in
September-October of each year to focus on specific points of policy implementation. Such workshops would also take
place in each of the states with the participation of all project states and federal agencies with responsibility for project
implementation. The workshops would have a duration of about three to five days. Bank missions would carry out field
supervision which would be defined by each sector specialist. It would include on-site visits to a set of projects,
interchange with executing agencies, review of disbursement, appraisal, procurement and auditing tules on a sample of
projects.

DECENTRALIZATION AND REGIONAL DEVEIOPMENT PROJECT
FOR THE DISADVANTAGED STATES
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR STUDIES TO BE UNDERTAKEN UNER THE PROJlCI
Com2arative Advantages and Project Identification
Qjective: The study will provide information: (a) to improve the fonmulation of a strategy of development; (b)
to clearly bottlenecks to productive investments and policies to improve the environment of business activity;
and (c) to identify packages of investment projects in productive sectors that show a promising rate of retun.
The study will concentrate on the project states of Chiapas, Guerrero, Hidalgo and Oaxaca.
Problem: Despite the efforts done in the projr^t preparation and in the formulation of curent development
plans, there is an urgent need to identify types of productive activities at the farm and non-farm level that could
ehnce productivity for the populations of those poor states. These studies will help to identify the
comparative advantages of these regions and translate them into concrete project ideas. Furthermore, while
productive activities are the realm of private sector initiative there is an urgent need to build a bank of
productive projects that could be used in enterprise development by the different banking and entbepren'
associations.
Pbe: The study will comprise three phases: (1) a preliminary phase that will define a common methodology
(comprising standardized questionnaires) to survey local businesses and identify suces stories and bottlenecks;
(2) field work will comprise a set of case studies that would study some successful enterprises and subsectors
with the view of identifying the crucial human and location factors that explain such success; (3) a final report
would integrate the above substudies and indicate avenues for policy action in order to create a climate inductive
to enterprise development.
imwmgm tation: The implementation of the above study will require for phase (I) a business conslting firm or
a team of highly qualified and experienced specialists (perhaps a business school) that would study each of the
sates. Phases (2) and (3) could be implemented by groups of university sudents closely monitored by buainess
administration professors in the state universities with some guidance from one or tWo business experts. The
last phase could be implemented also either by a consulting firm or a team of experts. Thesa  busines
associations should be invited to participate as sounding board and possible users of the pret packages.
Cost Phase I - US$400,000; Phase 2 - $500,000; Phase 3 - US$400,000. Total - USS1.3 million.
Rural Enplovnent and Specific Needs of Poor Miarant Households
Objvey~: To provide information on: (a) socioewnomic groups that due to lack of assets and difficulties in
findig gainfil opporunities are etemely vulnerable;  ) problems of seasonality, droughts or other natural
calamities that can result in extemwe human sufferance; and (c) the design of public employment programs tht
wouldd help to absorb temposrar unemployment or raise incomes for populatons under permanent
underemployment. In addition, the study will provide information within originating areas on: (a) the patterns
of belivior (specially migration) of the different socio-economic gtoups and identify their sources of income;
(b) the potential impact on intrahousehold welfare (wife and children) and on the conducting of productive
activities; and (c) progams to improve the welfare of poor households in those gwps and ways to provide
them with basic social services.

Problem  In quite a number of studies in different coutnes one of the major cause of extreme povety is the
lack of ginful occupations between crpping seasons. SeverlW countries have implmented program  of pubic
employment specially for maintenance of mral infrastuctu  with some succes. Given the widesprad lsck of
mainteance in Mexico in that infraructure desigaing some public works progran  could help solve thes
problems. Furthermore, several studies have indicated that a lare part of the popuations (with a large
participation of indigenous populations) in the four poor states have sevl members that migrate for part of the
year either to the north of Mexico or the US/Caiada duing the cropping SeSoD. Sometims the whole
household moves temporarily, other times the absoece of the men originates that the women have to take over
the farming or other eonomic activities. The needs of those populatios are quite different and very few
welfare programs targeted to them exist.
Pha:  The study wiU comprise four phases: (1) review of studies on the Mexican rura labor mdets and
social progmms that have been itmplmted in Mexico and design of a household suvrey (perha  based on the
LSMS) to characterize its functionig in some regions of Mexico; (2) implm on of the surver, (3) final
report comprising analysis of part (1), intepretation of results of survey and rs   for programs to
help these populations increase their income and provide them with minmum soci services.
QW: Phase I - US$150,000; Phase 2 - US$1 million; Phse 3 - US$250,"00. Total - US$1.4 million.
Markeftg of Basic StaVles
Q fbikti: To provide information on: (a) the fuctioning of regional markets of maize and beas, price
fluctuations and market stucture; (b) the role of parastatals in regulating the markets and the emergence of
farmes' associations; and (c) the existence of market-power and market imperfections.
Ploblem: Maize and beans continue to be a major staple for Mexican poor households living in mral areas.
The impact of the recent adjustment measures mainly in prices (and exchange rsAes) and wages on the income
and welfare of the poor runi households have not boen sfficiently studied. Finally, a major resistance
cinues to exist for deregulating the makets for naize and beans and there is not enough knowledge on the
role of some makdet intermediaries.
Pbae: the study will comprise four phases: (1) review of the literate; (2) study of the impact of the
adjustment umsu   on such fanmers using a simple simulation technique; (3) study of the reponal madkets of
maize and beans in four slected regions and simulation of the mpat  of regulatory meaures in prices and
farmers' income; and (4) repot mmarizing the main findings of the above and policy r ons.

Problem: Access to credit, the design of cultlly-aptopriate technica assistsnee and trining, and excessive
paternalism have be  pesistent problems in the delvey of sevices to Mexico's relatively large and poor
indigenous population. To remody this situation, the National Indian Institute (INIM, with tihds from the
PRONASOL program, has initiated an Indian Development Fund program. 1he program has established a
number of Indian Development Funds (IDFs) in each of the regions where there ae large concentats of
ladian population. Each fund is an autonomous entity; comprised of indigeous communities, ejidos,
cooperatives, and artisan groups; administered by a democrally-elected Board of Dirctors; and provided
with technical assistance and training by special technical support teams.
As a new institution, there is still relatively little known about the functioning of the IDFs and their capacity to
increase the organizational capacity and productive potenti of the indigenous population. For this reason, a
systematic monitorig and evaluatiou study wil be designed by researchers contcted by INI. Four
independent research teams will be organied for eah of the pm*ct states Te research teams wil use a
common anthropologica and paticipatory methodology for mtonioring, evluating and improving the
performance and outreach of the IDF program.
EPae  The study will be caried out in three phases over a three year period: (1) design of the study,
conttacting of the four research teams, and testing of the research methodology (six months); (2) conducting of
fieldwork, household and survey research, preliminary data analysis and writing of interim project report (24
months); and (3) writing of final project report (6 months).
Cod: Approximately US$600.000.
