INTERNATIONAL BANK FQR RECONSTRUCTION ANM DEVELOPMENT
NIENIORANDUNI AND! RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESDENt TO THE EXECUTIVE DIECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA. S.N.C..
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES,
FOR A DECENTRALIZATION AND REGIQOAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
FOR THE DISADVANTAGED STATES
1.           The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to Nacional
Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN) for US$350 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 17 years maturity and would contribute to the reduction of
poverty in the four most disadvantaged states, through a program of decenitralization and regional
development. Complementary loan components include environmental preservation and the protection
of archeological sites.
2.           Background. Of the 21 million people living below the poverty line in Mexico, two-
thirds live in rural areas. About one-third of Mexico's poor (seven million persons) inhabit Chiapas,
Guerrero, Hidalgo and Oaxaca. The poor constitute about 65 percent of the population of these states.
The four states have large disadvantaged Indian populations, and a concentration of poverty among
women and children. While poverty in these areas has longstanding structural roots, it has worsened
during Mexico's economic crisis beginning in 1982. Between 1982 and 1988, public investment declined
by about 60 percent. Cuts in rural, regional and social sectors were even deeper, reaching about
70 percent and leading to the collapse of poverty reduction programs in the four target states. The
reduction of investment contributed to a decline of about 20 percent in rural real incomes between 1983
and 1988.
3.           Past Government policies have hampered the economic and social development of the four
states: (a) exchange rate, trade and pricing policies have had an anti-agricultural bias; (b) public
expenditures on social services have favored the better-off states; (c) despite the remoteness and
dispersion of many settlements, infrastructure investments have been less than the national per capita
averages; (d) the excessively centralized administrative, financial, and fiscal systems have not allocated
resources efficiently to the very heterogeneous and peripheral regions of the states; and (e) agricultural
services (research, extension, marketing) have been underfunded and poorly developed. Current
Government strategy and the proposed project are directed at redressing some of these past policies.
4.           Rationale for Bank Involvement. The rationale for the Bank's involvement is based on
the following:
O     The project fits within the Bank's country strategy. The success that the Government has
had in managing its economic adjustmnent program and improving its balance of payments
has shifted the focus of the Bank's assistance program from adjustment and policy lending
to one which would finance investment programs for physical and social infrastructure
that would support renewed growth, have benefits for the poor and would aid the
Government's efforts to overcome problems of environmental degradation. The project
fits within this strategy.
o     The policy framework is consistent with the 1990 World Development Report criteria for
successfully undertaking poyvei reduction programs. Mexico has adopted an economic
policy framework which includes: (a) sound macroeconomic management as the basis for



-2-
restoring growth; (b) the elimination of anti-employment biases in trade policy, a market
based interest rate policy and tax policy reform; (c) the elimination of urban bias in
agricultural, food and nutrition policies; and (d) the better targeting of public
expenditures and subsidies towards poor regions and poor people.
The project incorporates the lessons learned from 15 years of Bank experience in rural
regional deve1onmJlnt in Mexico. The Bank has undertaken five projects supporting rural
regional development since 1975 and has made a careful assessment of these efforts.
These projects have strengthened administrative structures, mechanisms and procedures
at the federal, state and municipal levels that today serve as the basis for federal-state-
municipal planning of rural regional development projects. The principal lessons learned
are the following: (a) the importance of community participation for successtlu regional
development; (b) the need to transfer real responsibility and authority to lower level
jurisdictions in order to achieve community participation; (c) the imp-rtance of using
existing administrative structures for project implementation and of avoiding the creation
of parallel structures; (d) significant poverty alleviation impact is not feasible without
significant resource allocation; (e) the importance of infrastructure investment to support
private sector growth; and (f) the poverty focus of investment programs and projects must
be carefully monitored.
O     There are sufficient control mechanisms in place to manage successfully a large multi-
sectoral investment proram.  Procedures and operational manuals which were
strengthened under earlier Bank financed projects and during project preparation are in
place and operating for selecting and implementing projects. The project will be
managed through special coordinating groups at the federal level and in the four project
states. Annual reviews will be undertaken with the Bank to assess progress in the
investnent programs. The annual reviews will provide the opportunity to redirect
institutional development efforts to those agencies which reveal institutional weaknesses
and investment resources to those agencies which have shown greater implementation
capacity. The Bank has the right to stop disbursements to a noncompliant state or to
reassign loan resources from a low performing to a higher performing state. Appropriate
procurement arrangements under the proposed project recognize the large number of
small community-based projects. Monitoring and evaluation and auditing procedures
have been designed with great care to take into account the large number of
municipalities which will be involved in project execution.
o     Sustainability of the investments has been enhanced by central and state public finance
decisions. The federal government has already committed significant fiscal resources to
the four states and the states will improve their own revenue generation. The share of
poor states in central fiscal revenues has been increased, and revenue-sharing between
states and municipalities will be made more equitable.
O     The project provides an umbrella for monitoring and ,cariyin out projects in the target
sxai. The Bank has approved and is planning other projects directed at poverty
alleviation including or specifically directed to the target states. These include projects
for basic health, nutrition, agriculture, water and sanitation, and basic education. The
proposed project strengthens the capacity of the states to plan, finance, execute and
monitor their investment programs. The Bank projects in the states will benefit from this
increased capacity. The concentration of Bank projects will also facilitate the Bank's
supervision and monitoring of the components of the state development programs by



-3 -
appropriate sector specialists.  The proposed project provides a framework for
coordinating investments and sector policies.
5.           Projiet Qbiectiyes. The principal objective of the project is to increase the access of poor
and indigenous populations in the four poorest states of Mexico to basic infrastructure, social services,
larger markets, and agricultural technologies. The specific project objectives are: (a) to assist the states
in developing, executing and financing investment programs with a strong poverty alleviation focus; (b) to
assist the Federal and State planning and budgeting ministries in making their project selection,
environmental assessment, and monitoring and evaluation functions more efficient and the financing more
flexible; and (c) to strengthen the decentralized state and municipal institutions to identify, prepare, build,
operate, and maintain the investments in a more participatory manner. Environmental preservation and
the protection of archeological sites are complementary project objectives.
6.           Project Description. The project has three components: (a) investment; (b) environmental
and archeological site protection; and (c) institutional development.
7.           The investment component would finance a four-year US$1.3 billion investmnent program
in the four target states. The Bank loan would allocate US$274 million to finance 50 percent of the cost
of projects in the core investment program. About 46 percent of the program would be for infrastructure
projects (rural roads and rural electrification), 30 percent for productive projects (agriculture, forestry
and agroindustries), and 24 percent for social projects (education, water supply and sewerage systems).
Projects will be selected on the basis of their targeting of the poor, technical feasibility, benefits relative
to costs and beneficiary contribution and commitment to operation and maintenance.
8.           The environmental preservation and archeological protection component of the project
would finance 100 percent of the eligible costs (US$43 million) of a program (the Lacandona Protection
Plan) which would: (a) protect the last remaining humid forest ared in Mexico; (b) strengthen the
institutional capacity of federal offices, state agencies, and municipalities in order to improve project
assessment techniques and environmental policy implementation; and (c) finance the restoration of selected
archeological sites.
9.           The institutional development component would allocate US$18 million of loan funds to
finance 100 percent of eligible costs for strengthening: (a) project executing agencies (mainly in the
agricultural and roads sectors); @) state and municipal planning and budgeting systems; and (c) the state
and municipal entities to assume additional administrative functions that they have and will be receiving
under the Government's program of decentralization.
10.          US$15 million of loan funds are as yet unallocated and will be available for future
allocation among the three components described above. The project provides funds for civil works and
materials; furniture and equipment; training, studies, and technical assistance. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$1,363 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$425
million (31 percent). Retroactive financing of up to US$35 million for expenditures incurred after
May 1, 1990 will be made available. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. The loan would be made to the Government financial agent, Nacional Financiera (NAFIN), and
executed by the Secretariat of Programming and Budgeting (SPP), other Federal Entities, the Project
States and Participating Municipalities. Loan funds would be passed on as grants and would only be
available for investment costs and technical assistance, but not for recurrent costs or credit. The project
would be implemented over a five-year period. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map shows
the location of the states. Staff Appraisal Report No. 8786-ME dated March 4, 1991, is also attached.

It.          Agreed Actio. Among the conditions of loan effectiveness, it has been agreed that:
(a) the Bank and the Government agree on the first year institutional development program. (b) that
project state agreements shall have been signed between the Secretariat of Programming and Budgeting
(SPP) nd the participating states to assure that state policy actions on fiscal reform and revenue-sharing
are b- ing implemented and that all Bank and project rules will be respected and include the right of SPP
to sn.spend disbursements in case of noncompliance; and (c) that the agreed monitoring and evaluation
system be established and made operational.
12.          Among the conditions for disbursement, it has been agreed that for calendar years 1991,
1992 and 1993, two project appraisals for medium and large projects, covering two program categories
per state, % ill be submitted to the Bank prior to disbursement for medium and large projects within each
state.
13.          The Government has agreed to the following principal actions: (a) that by February of
each year, during the project review, evidence would be provided by the respective state and participating
agencies, that recurrent expenditures associated with investments in education, roads, and agriculture are
included in the sectoral or state annual budgets; (b) that it will apply the project appraisal and selection
systems, as well as other guidelines of the Operational Manuals; and (c) that by January 31 of each year
during Project execution, SPP will submit to the Bank for its review, the Annual Operative Programs
(POA), including the state action programs in resource mobilization and revenue-sharing with
municipalities, the Annual Conservation Programs for Lacandona, and institutional development
programs.
14.          Benefits and Risks. The proposed project would help decrease by an estimated 40 percent
the gap in access to roads, schools and other basic social goods of the populations in the four poorest
states, as well as improve economic opportunities to the mostly indigenous rural populations.
Employment in public works generated by the project is estimated at about 230,000 man-years. Possible
risks arise from the fact that some states and municipalities have relatively weak administrative structures,
and that their geography and social composition are quite varied. Environmental risks are important in
some areas with fragile systems. Investment decisions may be subject to political influences, and money
could be misappropriated. To mitigate these risks, the project emphasizes strengthening existing
safeguards and building new ones into subproject selection, monitoring, evaluation, and audit.
Decentralization would be carefully paced. The regional development mechanism used in the project is
the development agreement between the Federal Government and each state called the Convenio Unico
de Desarrollo (CUD), which has been improved over many years and is designed to solve interagency
conflicts in the design and execution of the investment programs. Institution building components and
technical assistance would strengthen administrative and implementation capacities of the states and
municipalities as they receive additional functions and revenues. The environmental component would
strengthen environmental protection capability at the state level.
15.          Recommendato. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
