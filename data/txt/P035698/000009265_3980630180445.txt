A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The main objective of the project is to alleviate power shortages in Hunan by providing efficient, reliable
and environmentally sound power supply.
Progress toward the project development objective would be monitored according to quantifiable
performance indicators developed during project preparation with the assistance of the Beneficiary.
These mainly include the high availability of Leiyang II generating units, improved reliability of
transmission network, reduction in load shedding, improved fuel efficiency, and reduction in overall
specific emission rates (gms/kWh) of air pollutants (SO2, NO,, TSP) (see Project Design Summary in
Annex 1).
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
The project supports the CAS objectives to alleviate the infrastructure bottlenecks in interior provinces to
foster integrated economic development, as noted in the CAS (Document No. 16321-CHA, February 25,
1997) discussed with the Board on March 18, 1997, and reaffirmed in the CAS Progress Report to be
discussed with the Board on May 28, 1998. Hunan, where the proposed project is located, remains one of
the poorest provinces in China. In 1996, its per capita GDP was 4,118 yuan, 27 percent lower than the
national average. Electricity consumption per capita was 530 kWh, about one third less than the national
average. Hunan's economic development has been constrained by acute power shortages, estimated at
about 3 TWhb in 1995. The project linkage to the CAS objectives would be achieved directly by the
physical and institutional components of the project. The physical components of the project will
strengthen/reinforce the power supply infrastructure and improve the environment by (a) developing two
300 MW anthracite-fired thermal units; (b) reinforcing critical transmission infrastructure to improve
overall system reliability and ensure delivery of generated power to end-users; and (c) retiring a number
of small, inefficient, aging, and polluting generating units, and avoiding further proliferation of
inefficient and more polluting small plants. The institutional component of the project will increase the
commercial orientation and the efficient operation of the provincial system by (a) unbundling the system
(generation separate from transmission) and increasing competitive procurement of long-term power
supply; and (b) developing and implementing efficient wholesale generation tariffs.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Despite the progress achieved during the last decade, China's power sector still faces the following
technical, financial, and institutional constraints:
1. Inadequate Financing of Power Infrastructure. Adequate electricity supply in China requires
annual additions of more than 15,000 MW of generation capacity, an investment of about $15-20
billion per year. Despite the government's efforts to develop innovative financing schemes through
joint venture, BOT and multiple domestic joint investment projects, the sector is still facing severe
capital constraints and difficulties in channeling domestic savings to meet the investment needs of
the sector. Further efforts are required to broaden and mainstream power sector financing. Moreover,
development of private and nonutility projects is constrained by the lack of a commercial framework
for power trade and the weakness of transmission networks.



Page 3
2. Transmission Bottlenecks. Transmission infrastructure in China has not been adequately developed
to allow for efficient system operation and minimization of supply cost: (a) plants are not optimally
located to minimize supply cost and ensure environmental sustainability. For example, some of the
large plants constructed in areas close to load centers requiring the transport of large quantities of
coal on an overextended transport system were not economically and/or environmentally justified;
and (b) about half of the added capacity is in small inefficient units (100 MW and less) built close to
the load centers to minimize upfront capital costs and minimize transmission investments. The
transmission bottlenecks continue to contribute to investment inefficiencies (untapped economies of
scale), location inefficiencies (overburdening of the railway system), environmental inefficiencies
(heavy pollution burden on densely populated areas with limited local absorption capacity), and
operational inefficiencies (uneconomic dispatch, higher losses).
3. Inadequate Wholesale Electricity and Transmission Pricing Systems. There are two significant
shortcomings of the pricing system in the power sector in China. The first relates to the pricing of
wholesale/bulk capacity and energy sales/purchases from generating plants. The second relates to the
inadequate recognition of power transmission as a separate service that needs to be accounted for in
electricity tariffs. The inadequacies of wholesale electricity entail operation of old and/or small and
high operation cost coal-fired plants in lieu of modern, more efficient plants. The nonrecognition of
the importance of transmission service hampers utilities' ability to recover costs and invest in
transmission. Both problems are slowing the implementation of the purchasing agency model, and
progress toward competition at the generation level.
4. Unclear Corporate Relationships between Power Sector Entities. Currently, power companies in
China operate at three main levels: provincial/municipal, regional, and national: (a) the provincial/
municipal power companies are responsible for generation and transmission within a province or
municipality; (b) the regional power entities hold the central Government's ownership stakes in
provincial power companies in their territory and are responsible for interprovincial power transfers;
and (c) the national power entity holds the central government's ownership stakes in the regional
entities. However, unclear ownership rights and not fully commercial relationships between different
power entities still impede: (a) full corporatization of power entities to meet the requirements of the
new Company Law; (b) financial independence, and profit orientation of the sector entities; and (c)
sector and especially transmission financing.
5. Heavy Reliance on Coal. China's heavy reliance on coal (especially for power generation) is
expected to continue over the next two to three decades. There is, however, a growing recognition of
health impacts and air quality deterioration due to extensive coal use. Recently, the Chinese
Government initiated serious efforts to curb air pollution related to utilization of coal in the power
sector. In June 1994, the Government announced that it would spend about $2 billion over seven
years to keep SO2 emissions at 15 million metric tons per year. An SO2 emissions tax (from Yuan
0.15 to 0.2/kg of SO2) is being experimented with in several provinces and municipalities and a
penalty of Yuan 0.04/kg of SO2 is being applied to all emissions exceeding the 1982 standards in all
provinces. More stringent air quality and emission standards have been issued at the national level in
January and March 1996. Several provinces and municipalities, followed up with local
environmental regulations. A recently issued regulation in Shanghai requires the use of flue gas
desulfurization on all new coal-fired power plants. However, enforcement and adequate
implementation of these standards require greater attention and continued efforts.
6. Low Efficiency of Electricity Supply and Use. China has over 10 years of experience in the active
promotion of electricity conservation, with a solid record of achievement. The strength of its
program lies in the well developed institutional framework. The success is clearly indicated by the
sustained low ratio of elasticity demand to GDP growth of 0.86 during 1980-95. However, energy/
electricity conservation programs have always been based on centrally designed policies and heavily
subsidized administrative programs. Faced with constrained fiscal revenues, the government is now

promotinig programs to reduce losses on the supply side and market-based initiatives to improve
electricity use.
The Chinese approach to reform encourages experimentation with different reform options and
institutional forms. This gradual approach permits the Chinese to examine the relevance and applicability
of specific reforms and also to fine-tune reform implementation for broader dissemination or replication
in other parts of the country.
(During the last few years, the Bank's technical assistance program for the sector has focused on helping
the Chinese in assessing reform options, defining implementation strategies, exploring options for
mobilizing domestic and foreign private funds to meet the capital needs of sector development and
developing a regulatory framework. The study entitled "Strategic Options in Power Sector Reform in
China," 1993, sector report entitled "China Power Sector Reform: Towards Competition and Improved
Performance," Report 12929-CHA, 1994, and discussion paper entitled "China: Power Sector Regulation
in a Socialist Market Economy", 1997, which summarized the latest reform emphasis, provide vehicles
for dialogue between the Bank and Chinese institutions. Another discussion paper, No. 377 entitled
"Mobilizing Domestic Capital Markets for Infrastructure Financing: International Experience and
Lessons for China," was prepared based on a seminar held in November 1996 in Beijing on the subject.
The Bank is now assisting the Government to examine institutional structures to develop power markets
in China. The intention is to facilitate increased power exchange between regional and provincial power
systems to economize resource utilization. This assistance is being provided through an IDF grant.)
The Government's future reform agenda includes:
* At the institutional level:
-  Dissolution of the Minister of Electric Power (MOEP) and transfer of its regulatory
functions to the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) and the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC) and its commercial functions to the State Power Corporation
(SP). This decision made by the State Council was recently confirmed by the National
People's Congress. In parallel, the Government is gradually developing rules to more
efficiently regulate the sector;
*  Corporatization and commercialization of the SP which has been established to hold the
State's ownership interest in the subordinate regional and provincial power companies. It is
expected that the SP will access long-term international and domestic bond markets for
sector financing;
*  Gradual implementation of regional power markets to facilitate economic power exchange,
trade between provincial systems, and competition at the generation level;
*  Rationalization of power tariffs particularly at the wholesale generation and transmission levels;
and
*  Continued focus on increasing the domestic and foreign equity participation in newly formed
generation enterprises. (By end-1997, there were at least 25 power generation companies in
China that had been publicly listed in domestic and international markets.)
* At the technical/operational level:
* Achievement of economies of scale in thermal power production, through expanded
development of large and efficient generating units;



Page 5
*  Promotion of conservation technologies and introduction of market-based incentives for
electricity conservation;
*  Development of renewable energy technologies, especially wind power; and
*  More adequate enforcement of environmental protection standards.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
* Infrastructure bottlenecks (investment components for power plant and transmission network)
* Inadequate wholesale electricity pricing systems (wholesale contractual arrangements under TA
component)
* Unclear ownership rights and lack of commercial orientation of power entities (HEPC's restructuring
plan under TA component)
*  Inadequate financing of transmission projects. (pricing principles agreed between HEPC and the
Hunan Provinical Government for the transmission component)
The project will indirectly address the following sector issues:
* Development of private power projects (transmission component to support Changsha BOT project)
* Improving local air quality by replacing about 10 small polluting generating units operating in the
provincial power network (300 MW total) with a large efficient plant utilizing local anthracite fuel
(alleviating pressure on coal supply and transportation and reducing transportation cost) and modem
environmental control systems
There are several reasons why the decision to undertake this project as a Bank-financed public project
has been made:
* The project will through separation of generation from transmission and distribution help in: (a)
setting a more predictable and transparent commercial framework; (b) establishing a sector structure
that will allow for the competitive bidding for power purchases; and (c) encouraging investment in
transmission and distribution. This will ultimately lead to the development of fully competitive
markets.
-  Leiyang II will be the first thermal power project in Hunan with a double-arch downshot designed
boiler using 100 percent local anthracite and avoiding transfer of coal over long distance.
Technically, it is more risky and less attractive to private investors. For example, the BOT Changsha
power plant has been designed to use a mix of bituminous coal imported from Shanxi (60 percent)
and local anthracite (40 percent) and to use conventional subcritical boilers.
* Without the involvement of the World Bank the above technical and institutional improvements are
likely to be delayed by three to five years.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
* Unbundling of generation from transmission and distribution: This will lead to the implementation of
a purchasing agent structure (a) allowing limited competitive bidding by generator to minimize cost



Page 7
of supply; (b) encouraging investments in transmission and distribution; and (c) easing the transition
to a fully competitive market in the longer term (see Annex 5).
* Development of efficient wholesale generation tariffs: A revised system of wholesale power pricing
will be introduced to facilitate systemwide economic dispatch and ensure optimal utilization of
resources.
* Corporatization and Commercialization of power companies: HEPC would be restructured and
incorporated into one transmission/distribution company, one thermal generation company, one
hydro development company, and Leiyang Power Generation Company in accordance with the
Company Law. In addition, the accounting and financial management systems of HEPC would be
upgraded to facilitate the commercialization process.
3. Benefits and target population:
The project would have a marked impact on the economic development of Hunan Province. The direct
benefits attributable to the project are: (a) reduction in the value of lost production due to power
rationing and load shedding; (b) improvements in quality of supply in terms of reduced interruptions and
recognized but difficult to quantify service parameters, such as, more stable frequency and voltage, and
(c) improvements in local air quality with retirement of older polluting generating units (generally
located in urban and populated areas).
The other major benefit of the project is the implementation of the sector reform plan and increased
commercial orientation of HEPC. The development of a competitive commercial framework for
purchase of power from all generating units on the system will be conducive to economic dispatch and
overall generation efficiency. The clear separation of the generation from transmission and distribution
will provide a framework to promote competition at generation level and private investments in power
generation.
The proposed project would therefore benefit all power consumers in Hunan Province.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation Period. Five years, from December 1998 to December 2003
Executing Agency. HEPC is the beneficiary of the proposed loan and the executing agency of the
project. The overall management of the project would be carried out by HEPC, which would be
responsible for project preparation, implementation and operation, including procurement, construction
supervision, and disbursement of funds. HEPC has been operating the Hunan provincial grid for more
than 20 years and has had operating experience of anthracite fired units (200 MW and below) for more
than 10 years. It has the organization and key staff required for project and construction management.
The detailed arrangements are presented in Chart A1-A3 of Annex 6.
To facilitate effective project implementation according to the planned timetable, HEPC has established
a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with full-time staff, headed by the Deputy Chief Engineer
(reporting to HEPC Management), to carry out the project preparation and construction management.
Hunan Provincial Electric Power Design Institute has been appointed to assist HEPC in carrying out
engineering, procurement, and project implementation. HEPC and its PIU will also be assisted by an
international consulting firm and a local expert group.



Page 8
Project Oversight and Policy Guidance. The institutional reform elements of the proposed project will
be supervised by SP, SETC, and SDPC (SP in particular). SP will be responsible for obtaining the State
Council approvals on major reform issues. The concerned provincial government agencies will oversee
the planning and implementation of resettlement.
Onlending and Auditing Arrangements. The proposed Bank loan of $300 million will be made to the
People's Republic of China represented by the Ministry of finance (MOF) at the Bank's standard interest
rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans, with a maturity of 20 years, including a five-year
grace period. Proceeds of the loan will be onlent from the Borrower (MOF) to HEPC on the same terms
and conditions as the Bank loan with SP as the guarantor.
HEPC agreed to maintain and provide the Bank with semiannual progress report, with unaudited project
accounts to reflect project expenditures for the period under report compared with the original project
cost estimates. Moreover, HEPC will furnish the Bank with the audited accounts for the project,
statement of expenditures, and financial statements within six months of the end of each fiscal year. In
this regard, HEPC will also implement any changes to its accounting practices as recommended by the
financial management consultants, require the auditors to comply with international auditing practices
and provide an audit plan prior to each audit.
The proposed project will be audited by the representative office in Hunan of the State Audit
Administration (SAA). This office has prepared audit reports in connection with other Bank financed
projects in the province in accordance with Chinese audit principles and standards, which are generally
consistent with international practices.
Finally, HEPC will furnish to the Bank by June 1 of each year, a rolling eight-year financial plan
including projected income statements, fund flow statements, and balance sheets.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
A least-cost study was carried out by HEPC, with the assistance of local consultants, covering the period
1998-2025 and focusing on 1998-2010. The study was carried out using an optimization model that
determines the optimal capacity and generation mix to meet the demand with the minimum cost (net
present value of investment and operating costs), given a predetermined reliability criteria. It considered
all potential (technically feasible) candidates including: extension of existing hydropower plants, new
hydropower plants, thermal power units using local anthracite, thermal power units using bituminous
coal from other provinces, combined cycle units using distillate and imports of power from neighboring
provinces. The proposed project remains the first investment of the optimal (least cost) power
development program under various scenarios. In the without project case, the new development
program remains based on greenfield 300 MW units using local anthracite.
System reliability in terms of loss-of-load probability will also benefit from the addition of thermal
capacity. The present power generation system has substantial hydro capacity (about 55 percent of total
capacity) with relatively little storage capacity and generation is thus highly dependent upon
hydrological conditions.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
*  Limited and Achievable Objectives of Power Sector Reform. Setting specific and achievable
reform goals in the two latest projects (Waigaoqiao and East China/ Jiangsu Power Transmission)
proved to be more effective and better understood approach by the beneficiaries. International
experience shows that even in countries with strong legal systems and open economies, the time
needed to build consensus on the reform decisions, establish a new regulatory framework, and
implement structural changes can be very long. In the UK, the pioneer country in implementing
power sector reforms, it took about 10 years for consensus building and laying out the reform
options, and two more years for drafting the law and the licenses, and another two for designing the
mechanisms to introduce competition. It is clear that the power sector reform agenda in China is far
reaching and can be achieved only gradually. It is important to avoid the broad brush reform
approach and define clear priorities and focus on specific and limited areas of reform for each
project.
* Better Preparation of Procurement Packages. Procurement of transmission component features
numerous small packages in comparison with generation projects. Each package requires very
specialized technical knowledge. Inadequate project management caused significant delays of



Page 10
procurement and hence delays of project implementation; noncompliance with the Bank
Procurement Guideline due to a lack of awareness, and poor quality of evaluation report have
required excessive amount of time for clarification and resulted in delays. Learning from recent
experience, the Beneficiary has: (a) established a procurement management group within the
organization of the implementing agency from the inception of the project. This group will be part of
the project management team and will be responsible of management and coordination of all
procurement activities; (b) organized a one-week training course on Bank Procurement Guidelines
and a study tour to other Bank financed projects in China to learn from their experience. Experienced
procurement specialists from the leading tendering companies in China and staff of the Resident
Mission assisted in designing and carrying out the training sessions; and (c) involved independent
international consultants to improve the quality of the bidding documents and bids evaluation.
*  Need for Early Government Approval of Project. In the recent Tuoketuo and Waigaoqiao thermal
power projects there were delays in project processing stemming from delayed internal Government
approvals. These delays were due to the fact that while the Bank has shortened the project processing
period significantly (about six months) under the streamlined operations procedures the government
internal approval procedures remain unchanged. The approval process for the proposed project has
been closely monitored and special efforts were made by the Beneficiary, MOEP, and MOF to have
secured all necessary government approvals before project negotiations. Moreover, the CMU in
Beijing has started discussions with the relevant government agencies on how to synchronize both
sides' procedures.
*  Phased Approach to Resettlement. Following the identification mission and in coordination with
LEGEA and ASTHR, it is clear that most of the detailed engineering, the routing of the transmission
line and siting of transmission towers and substations will not be finalized until early 1999 (which is
after the implementation has already begun), two years before the power plants scheduled for trial
operations. The agreement with the Borrower, therefore, is that the project will be implemented in two
phases. As a result, the Beneficiary should prepare RAP in two phases. The Phase I RAP, submitted to
the Bank in February 1998, included: (i) the relevant resettlement policies and regulations, the
institutional arrangements and implementation procedures governing all resettlement actions to be
carried out under the proposed project; (ii) detailed resettlement action plans for the power plant
component, and three substations and two transmission lines under the transmission component; and
(iii) a preliminary sample census survey for the second phase. A second-phase RAP, to be submitted
to the Bank for approval by March 1999, would include the same policy framework and detailed
action plan for the remaining six substations and 18 sections of transmission lines.
*  Supply of coal with consistent quality. Following a serious boiler accident at Beilungang due to
uneven coal quality and start up problem in the Yanshi project, particular attention was given to the
boiler design and specifications, coal specifications, and "check coal" specifications, and intensified
coal monitoring. A complementary coal study has been prepared by HEPC on coal sampling and
analyses.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Beneficiary's commitment and sense of ownership for the proposed project is very high. HEPC has
been actively consulting with the relevant government agencies at central and local levels on the required
approvals. The approval by MOEP for HEPC's restructuring plan required for the Bank to issue
invitation for negotiation of the proposed project was received in March 1998. Contract for consulting
service for preparation of detailed reform implementation plan was signied with an international
reputable firm on May 1, 1998. Feasibility studies have been submitted to SPC by MOEP. Bid
documents for boiler and turbine generator are being prepared with assistance provided by HEPC's



Page 1 1
international engineering consultants and expected to be submitted to the Bank kor review and clearence
in June 1998. Final report for the least cost study was received by the Bank in November 1997. The EIA
report has been finalized with the assistance of HEPC's international consultants and submitted to the
Bank.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project.
World Bank Involvement in this project, the first power project in Hunan, is designed to address the
technical, financial, and institutional issues by taking into account successful international experiences.
The Bank's participation in the project will add value by:
* Contributing to the economic development in Hunan to help address the issue of uneven
development and widening gap between the coastal and inland areas in the country.
* Facilitating implementation of a single buyer market structure in Hunan. The restructuring of HEPC
will avoid excessive fragmentation of the sector while setting a framnework for competition at the
generation level through: (a) creation of two major generation companies; (b) consolidation of
Leiyang Phases I and II into a single generation corporation; and (c) incorporation of HEPC into a
transmission and distribution company.
* Deepening ongoing policy dialogue to address the institutional aspects of wholesale electricity
pricing which are critical to the implementation of the power purchasing agency model. Power sales
to the transmission and distribution company will be based on adequate contractual arrangements.
* Developing a modern environmental management program for the Leiyang power plant, which will
serve as a model for other new thermal power plants in Hunan.
* Strengthening HEPC's corporate governance, and management capacity through (a) upgrading the
financial management system; (b) incorporating the to-be-created companies according to the
Company Law; and (c) implementing an intensive training program.
* Supporting technology transfer in the construction and operation of 300 MW units using local
anthracite resources. Since the project is the first with the design of double arch downshot boiler in
Hunan, Bank's participation will help ensure the quality of implementation.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 13)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 7):
[xl Cost-Benefit Analysis:
Leiyang Power Plant:              NPV = US$191.2 million; IERR = 19.4 percent
HEPC's overall Investment program:   NPV = US$246.8 million; IERR = 13.6 percent
Generation
A least-cost study was carried out by the Beijing Research Institute for Water Resources and Electric
Power (BERI), in conjunction with the Hunan Electric Power Company (HEPC), using a planning model
that determines the optimal capacity and generation mix to meet the demand in the most cost effective
way (minimum net present value of investment and operation costs). The study covered the development
of the system during 1997-2025, study period, with special focus on the investment required during
1997-2010, planning period. The detailed report, "Economic Analysis for Leiyang Coal Fired Thermal
Power Plant" (November 1997), prepared by BERI and HEPC is in the project files.
A cost benefit analysis was carried out to confirm the economic viability of the project. The analysis was
carried out based on the economic cost of the project and the revenues generated by power sales valued



Page 12
at the bulk price of 29.1 fen/kWh (1997 prices), based on existing policies for pricing of power output
from new power plants and fully passed on to the consumers. The calculation yielded an IERR of 19.4
percent. A risk analysis was also carried out to confirm the robustness of the project. It yielded an
expected IERR of 14.8 percent (with a standard deviation of 4.2 percent). The possibility of the expected
IERR to be lower than 12 percent is 26 percent.
Transmission
The strengthening of the transmission system is imperative. The load flow and stability analyses carried
out by HEPC show that the need and timing of the proposed lines and substations are justified. The
design parameters of the proposed lines and substations has been optimized to ensure that transmission
services would be provided in the most cost effective way.
To complement the cost-effectiveness approach, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out on HEPC's entire
investment program. It yielded an IERR of 13.6 percent. A risk analysis was carried out and yielded an
expected IERR of 12.4 percent (with a standard deviation of 4.2 percent). The possibility for the
expected IERR to be less than 12 percent is 40 percent.
2. Financial (see Annex 8): Leiyang Power plant:   NPV = US$ 2.4 million; FRR = 12.11 percent
Transmission investment: NPV = US$27 million; FRR = 14.86 percent
Leiyang Power Plant
The financial rate of return for the proposed power plant investment is estimated at 12.11 percent based
on pricing principles agreed by the Pricing Department of Hunan Provincial and determined as follows:
*  Prior to the retirement of domestic debts (from 2002 to 2012): full debt service requirements; O&M
cost (including depreciation not used for debt repayments); taxes related to the proposed project; and
an annual return of not less than 15 percent on the funds invested by HEPC for the proposed
component.
*  After retirement of domestic debts (from 2013 to the end of the life of the project): full debt service
requirements for the Bank loans; O&M cost (including depreciation not used for debt repayments);
taxes related to the project; and an annual return of not less than 18 percent on the funds invested by
HEPC for the proposed component.
The estimated average tariff for the proposed power plant component over the life of the project would
be 59.71 fen/kWh in current terms and 29.05 fen/kWh in 1997 prices.
Fiscal Impact. The proposed power plant investment is expected to generate tax revenues in a total
amount of about $694.2 million equivalent during the project life, of which $89.9 million duties, $286.1
million VAT, $28.7 million surcharges, and $289.5 million income taxes. Based on a discount rate of 12
percent, the net present value of the tax revenues generated by the proposed investment is estimated to be
$123.9 million, of which $7.8 million duties, $51.3 million VAT, and $9 million surcharges, and $55.8
million income taxes.
Transmission Component
The financial rate of return for the proposed transmission investment is estimated at 14.86 percent based
on the pricing principles agreed by the Pricing Department of the Hunan Provincial Government and
determined as follows:



Page 13
* Full debt service requirements; O&M cost (including depreciation not used for debt repayments);
taxes related to the proposed component; and an annual return of not less than 15 percent on the
funds invested by HEPC for the proposed component.
The estimated average tariff increases for the proposed transmission component over the life of the
project would be 0.55 fen/kWh in current terms and 0.32 fen/kWh in 1997 prices.
Fiscal Impact. The proposed transmission investment is expected to generate tax revenues in a total
amount of about $409.7 million equivalent during the project life, of which $16.5 million duties, $182.7
million VAT, $18.3 million surcharges, and 192.2 million income taxes. Based on a discount rate of 12
percent, the net president value of the tax revenues generated by the proposed investment is estimated to
be $143.8 million, of which $1.4 million duties, $62.4 million VAT, and $6.2 million surcharges, and
$73.8 million income taxes.
Assessment of HEPC's Financial Management System. The project team reviewed HEPC's financial
management system, including accounting standards and internal control and audit policies/practices,
and the accounting arrangements for the proposed project and found them satisfactory. Technical
assistance and training provided under the proposed project will upgrade HEPC's financial management
capabilities, introduce modem financial management practices, and strengthen the financial and
accounting staff skills.
3. Technical:
The Feasibility Study for the Leiyang Thermal Power Plant, prepared by the Hunan Provincial Electric
Power Design Institute (HPEPDI), has been reviewed by the Central Electric Power Planning and Design
Institute (CEPPDI) and approved by the MOEP. A follow-up review of the Leiyang Plant boiler island
conceptual design, especially on the coal analysis and boiler selection, has been carried out by Black and
Veatch of USA (Engineering Consultants for HEPC). The review confirmed successful burning of the
local very low volatile anthracite requires a furnace design that provides adequate residence time for the
char particle in a high temperature combustion zone. The recommended arch-firing combustion system
(downshot furnace) is the proper technology for the Leiyang power plant. Studies for strengthening
Hunan transmission system were also reviewed by CEPPDI and MOEP. The studies concluded that
reinforcement of the existing 220 kV transmission system is essential to the supply of increasing energy
demand in a reliable, economic and efficient manner. The reinforced 220 kV system would integrate
planned and under construction large size power stations especially the proposed Leiyang thermal power
and the Changsha BOT plants. Load flow, fault level and transient stability analyses were performed for
the Hunan Provincial Grid at the voltage level of 220 kV and above including the 500 kV AC tie line
linking the Hunan Provincial Grid to the Central China Power Grid. Both steady state and transient
stability criteria can be satisfied. The above studies, including environmental impacts and mitigation
measures, were reviewed by the Bank and found adequate. The project's technical design is appropriate
to the needs of Hunan Provincial Power Grid and conforms to required standards. HEPC has been
operating the Hunan Provincial Grid for more than 20 years and has had operating experience of
anthracite coal fired units for more than 10 years. It has the capability to successfully carry out the
implementation of the proposed project. Post-engineering works, including the balance of the
engineering, design, preparation of equipment specifications and tender documents, and interface with
the contractors will be performed by HEPC and HPEPDI, assisted by the Consultants Black and Veatch,
International.
Cost estimates for components of generation and transmission facilities were defined based on studies
and engineering designs carried out by HEPC and HPEPDI. The cost estimates reflect end-1997 prices



Page 14
and are based on the latest international tendering information available for similar equipment and
works, which are realistic. Physical contingencies are calculated at 5 percent for foreign costs and 10
percent for local costs. The price escalation for costs expressed in terms of foreign exchange is calculated
according to anticipated international price movements of the price escalation for costs expressed in
terms of foreign exchange is calculated according to anticipated international price movements of 2.5
percent per year for 1998, 3.1 percent for 1999, 2.9 percent for 2000, 2.8 percent for 2001, and 2.7
percent for 2002, and 2.6 percent for 2003. The price escalation for costs expressed in local currency is
calculated according to projected inflation rate for China of 2 percent for 1998, 4.8 percent for 1999, 5
percent for 2000 and 5.5 percent for 1999-2003. The allowances for physical contingencies and price
increases during implementation are deemed to be adequate.
4. Institutional:
As a new beneficiary of a Bank project, HEPC is not familiar with the Bank procedures, particularly the
procurement procedures. Therefore, a project management unit was established based on the Bank
mission's recommendation with full-time staff. Furthermore, a procurement group was organized and
trained by the Bank procurement specialists. International consultants experienced with power project
procurement has been engaged to assist HEPC in procurement of major equipment.
To strengthen the institutional and managerial capabilities of HEPC, a comprehensive technical
assistance and training program is included under the proposed project and described in details in the
PIP. The program, initiated during project preparation, includes technical assistance and training in: (a)
preparation of detailed reform implementation plan; (b) development and implementation of modern
accounting and financial management system, and (c) development of wholesale power purchase pricing
methodology and contractual arrangements between the restructured HEPC and generation entities.
5. Social:
The resettlement for the proposed project will be carried out in two phases. The first phase includes: (a)
policies and regulations, institutional arrangements, implementation procedures that would be applied to
all components of the proposed project; and (b) detailed resettlement plans for (i) Leiyang Power Plant;
(ii) four 220 kV substations (Furong, Dongfenghu, Hengbei, and Wangcheng); and (iii) two sections of
220 kV transmission lines (Huaneng Power Plant to Dongfenghu, and Macha to Hengbei). The second
phase includes resettlement activities related to five 220 kV substations and 18 sections of 220 kV
transmission lines. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared for the first phase. The RAP for
the second phase will be prepared by March 1999 following the completion of the design of routing and
siting of these subcomponents.
The Bank carried out full review of the RAP and the assessment found that the resettlement needs and
PAPs are well analyzed and mitigating measures of adverse social impacts are thoroughly formulated
and adequate. The second phase RAP and any unforeseen resettlement associated with the project will be
carried out according to the policy and procedures established in the Phase I.
Minimization of the scope of resettlement was, and will continue to be a high priority throughout the
planning, design and implementation of the proposed project. Where land acquisition and demolition are
unavoidable, the resettlement plans provide for replacement of housing, alternative employment
opportunities, infrastructure, services and other resources to improve, or at least restore, the living
conditions and income of the project affected persons (PAPs). Special attention was given to the most
vulnerable groups (household headed by women, senior people, and poorest households).



Page 15
The project (including two phases) would (a) require acquisition of 1,097.5 mu (about 73 ha) of land; (b)
affect 396 persons due to land loss; (c) demolish 100,145 square meters of floor spaces in rural and urban
areas; and (d) relocate 266 households or 1,418 persons. The first phase components require acquisition
of a total of 438.5 mu land area, affecting 108 people; demolishing 15,941 square meters of floor spaces,
and relocating 175 households or 993 individuals. Based on a preliminary estimate, the remaining project
components will require acquisition of 659.0 mu land area, affecting 289 farmers, removing 84,204
square meters structures, and relocating 91 households or 425 individuals.
In order to effectively implement the resettlement program, resettlement offices were established at the
provincial, city, county, and power supply bureaus levels. To strengthen the resettlement offices'
implementation capabilities, a resettlement policy and implementation workshop was conducted for staff
involved in the resettlement activities in May 1998.
6. Environmental assessment:
Environmental Category     [x] A  []B    []C
In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the project has been assigned Category A. The
Environmental Assessment (EA), was prepared as two separate reports: Part A the Leiyang Power Plant,
and Part B the Transmission System. Both Parts were prepared by a team consisting of international
consultants specializing in environmental issues related to thermal power plants and transmission lines
and the Nanjing Electric Power Research Institute (NEPRI). For the power plant, the international
consultant took the lead role in EA preparation and for the transmission line, NEPRI assumed the lead
role. The EA document has been approved by the National Environmental Protection Administration
(NEPA) and has been reviewed and approved by the World Bank; it is considered that all environmental
aspects of the project are satisfactorily addressed and in compliance with all Chinese and World Bank
environmental policies and procedures. Because of the unusual characteristics of the fuel to be used,
some exceedance to existing World Bank nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission guidelines will occur.
Additionally, a variance to Chinese NOx emission standards was established by NEPA. Thermal
discharges from once through cooling water also exceed World Bank Guidelines, but comply with
Chinese standards. However, the EA analysis determined that the environmental consequences of these
exceedances were insignificant. A monitoring program will be incorporated into the project to ascertain
and verify these conclusions on a sustained basis. Should additional mitigation be required, the Borrower
has agreed to take the appropriate measures.
The power plant is located in the southeastern part of Hunan Province in Xinhe and Luqi villages on the
right bank of a meandering section of the Leishui River. The plant is the second phase adjacent to an
existing (2x200 MW) power station. Alternative locations were not considered practical, since the
existing site could take advantage of the available infrastructure (cooling system, ash disposal system,
etc.) and would not involve any resettlement.
Modern pollution control technologies will be incorporated into the design of the power plant, such as
high efficiency electrostatic precipitators. The plant site has sufficient space to accommodate additional
pollution control systems if required as a result of future changes to Chinese standards and/or
technological developments. Annex 11 provides a summary of key environmental issues associated with
the project and their anticipated impacts, the mitigating plan to assure that these impacts are minimized
to acceptable levels, and the monitoring program with which environmental impacts will be measured to
compare to EA predictions. Further strengthening of HEPC is included in the project design. It will
include both training and acquisition of appropriate environmental monitoring equipment (see Annex
I1). Mitigation measures identified in the EA and included in the project design for the transmission
component include: appropriate routing to minimize exposure to sensitive receptors, a 50 m corridor and



Page 16
sufficient height of the line span to avoid interference with traffic (highway, navigational, and air) and
communications and sufficient height to maintain Chinese public health and safety standards for ground
level electric field intensities.
Environmental issues associated with the project (power station and transmission line) and addressed in
the EA included all concerns expressed by affected parties in a series of public meetings. Local public
and local authorities support the project and the recommended mitigating measures presented in the EA
reports. the mitigating and monitoring plans presented in the EAs (see Annex 11) will be fully
implemented.
Key issues addressed in the EAs included: air pollution (dust, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides), water
pollution (primarily thermal pollution impacts to aquatic ecology in the Leishui River), ash management,
worker health and safety (including the mine supplying the coal), electric field, noise, losses in land
productivity, interference with communications and bird flight patterns, and influences of construction
and operational labor forces on the local infrastructure. Furthermore, the proposed project (2 units of
300 MW each) is the second phase of what might be a three phase program at the Leiyang site. To avoid
future adverse environmental consequences, the EA examined both the immediate impacts of the subject
project (600 MW) as well as cumulative impacts including a possible third phase (2x600 MW).
Mitigating measures for air, water, and solids management (coal, ash) are designed to meet appropriate
Chinese requirements and/or World Bank guidelines whichever is stricter. In the absence of either,
international codes of practice will be used (as is the case for nitrogen oxides emissions). For the cooling
water discharge the exceedance of World Bank temperature guidelines was determined to have
insignificant environmental impact, and was within Chinese environmental standards.
7. Participatory approach [key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced; if
participatory approach not used, describe why not applicable]:
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
-  SP and the Central China Electric Power Group Corporation (CCEPGC) as HEPC's
parent/holding company, they have been involved in some key decision making process,
such as the restructuring plan of HEPC and investment strategy of HEPC, for the proposed
project.
* Hunan provincial government has also been involved in policy issues, including tariffs,
resettlement, environment, and coal supply.
*  Leiyang community has been consulted on the resettlement plan through interviews and
public meetings.
b. Other key stakeholders:
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The financial sustainability will be achieved through suitable financial covenants to ensure full cost
recovery and modest profitability. The existing pricing policy in China warrants that project costs will be
passed on to the consumers. Given HEPC's operating experience with the first phase of anthracite fired
units in Leiyang, the operational sustainability should not be a problem.

ANNEX 2: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
PROJECT COMPONENT 1
Leiyang Thermal Power Plant-US$463.37 million (excluding IDC)
The component is the expansion of the existing Leiyang thermal power plant, located on the bank of
Leishui River and at the Baisha coal mines area, about 3 km south of Leiyang city. The plant is being
developed in two phases. When completed it will have a total installed capacity of 1,000 MW. The
layout provides possibility for further expansion in the future. The Phase I , consisting of two generating
units of 200 MW each, became operational in 1988-89. The Phase II development of 2x300 MW is
proposed to be financed by the Bank loan under the proposed project. The target dates for the
commercial operation will be June 30, 2002 for the first unit and December 31, 2002 for the second unit.
The feasibility study and the conceptual design for the project component have been completed by the
Hunan Provincial Electric Power Design Institute (HPEPDI), in April 1997 and September 1997
respectively, and reviewed by the Central Electric Power Planning and Design Institute of the Ministry of
Electric Power. The plant is located near the major load centers of Hengyang, Zhuzhou and Changsha,
which have experienced acute power shortages. It is also situated close to the coal mine areas, reducing
both transmission and fuel transportation costs. The infrastructure such as site development, access
roads, housing complex, construction facilities, has already been completed in Phase I. Coal
transportation facilities, coal handling equipment and circulation water pump house have all been
constructed in Phase I. The adjacent mines already supply coal to the First Phase development. The
greenfield site for the Second Phase Development has been leveled and the geological condition is
favorable. The plant will supply a major part of the power requirements for south Hunan.
Coal Supply. The second phase development is designed to bum entirely local anthracites containing of
about 24.9 percent ash, 8.1 percent of moisture, 6.2 percent of volatile matter and 0.3 percent of sulfur,
and with a heating value of 5,070 kcal/kg and a grindability index of 68 (HGI scale). It is estimated that
about 1.53 million tons of anthracite will be consumed annually by the two units of the Phase II
development. The anthracite coal will be sourced from the Baisha, Jiahe and Xifengdu three mines,
which are adjacent to the plant. A total of 1.67 million tons of coal is available from these three coal
mines per year for the project. The coal will be transported from the mines by train to the plant. The
existing railway system is capable of delivering about 2.7 million tons of coal per year to the plant for
both first and second phase development.
Boiler. The local anthracites are dense and homogeneous coals with a relatively higher heating value.
However, these coals are difficult to ignite since they consist almost entirely of fixed carbon with the
very low volatile matter. The options for burning this kind of coal are limited to circulating fluid bed
(CFB) combustion technology furnaces and pulverized coal combustion using a special furnace design
known as arch-fired combustion system (downshot furnace). A key parameter to successfully burning
anthracite is a furnace design that provides 3 to 4 seconds of residence time for the char particle in a
high-temperature combustion zone. Both CFB and arch-firing designs provide the residence time
required. Because of the limited operating experience with large capacity CFB steam generating units,
CFB combustion technology is not recommended for this project. The selected boiler design is an arch-
firing furnace, subcritical, single reheat, balanced draft, and outdoor. The boilers are rated at 284.7 kg/s
continuous output at a superheater outlet pressure of 183 Bars and 540C temperature. The boiler is
designed to function at full rating with anthracite coal with heating values as low as 4,550 kcal/kg
without using supplemental fuel(oil). The minimum net caloric (lower) heating value boiler efficiency is



Page 23                                 ANNEX 2
90 percent. Four-ball tube mills will be specified for each unit. Three mills should be capable of carrying
full load with the design coal. High efficiency electrostatic precipitator (ESP) will be used for the project
with a minimum guaranteed efficiency not lower than 99.7 percent. The flue gas volume passing ESP is
1,800,000 m3/h. Steel structure would be provided for the boiler building. One common concrete stack
will be constructed for the 2x300 MW units. The stack will be 210 m high with an outlet diameter of
7m.
Turbine/Generator. The generating unit size would be 300 MW. The 300 MW turbines are to be
subcritical, once intermediate reheat, steam condensing, single shaft, combined high and intermediate
pressure turbine with double steam outlets, double steam outlets for low pressure turbine, and water-
hydrogen cooling for generator. Regarding the thermodynamic system, each unit is designed as an
independent system except for the auxiliary steam system. The steam turbine has eight uncontrolled
steam extractions. The first three steam extractions supply steam for three high pressure feedwater
heaters; the fourth steam extraction supplies steam for the deaerating heater, auxiliary steam system and
boiler feed pump turbine; the remaining four steam extractions supply steam for four low-pressure
feedwater heaters, the last two low pressure heaters will be located at the neck section of the condenser.
The high pressure extraction steam from high-pressure turbine will also be used as the backup steam
source for the auxiliary steam system and feedwater turbines. For each unit, two 50 percent feedwater
pumps driven by steam turbines will be used in normal service and one 50 percent motor-driven
feedwater pump with a variable speed coupling will be used as the startup and backup pump. The
condensate from the condenser will feed the condensate polishing system, gland steam condenser, four
low-pressure heaters to the deaerating heater through two 100 percent condensate pumps, one in
operation and one as standby. For each unit, the closed cycle cooling water (CCCW) system includes two
CCCW pumps, two CCCW heat exchangers, and a CCCW head tank. The steam turbines are designed
for a 255 kg/s steam flow at a 167 (175) Bar pressure at 537C steam temperature. The reheat section is
designed for 209 kg/s flow at 32 Bar pressure and 537C. The generator is rated at 353,000 kVA with
0.85 power factor. The unit will generate 300 MW at rated output. The generated electricity will be
connected to the network at 220 kV level. There will be three groups of power transmission cables. The
wiring style for the main cables shall be of double-bus, double-section with bypass. Steel structure would
be provided for the turbine /generator building.
Circulating Water System. The water source for plant use will be from the Leishui River. For 97
percent of the time during a year, the minimum daily water flow in the river section where Leiyang
power plant can take water from is 46.3 m3/s, 46.7 m3/s from July to September and 48.5 m3/s from
December to February. The pump house at the river bank constructed for Phase I, with new filtering
equipment, three additional circulation pumps and associated pipelines to be added, will be used as the
water supply system for phase II project. One-through circulating water system will be used with the
projected water consumption to be 21.4 m3/s in the summer and 16 m3/s in the winter during dry season.
Other common facilities such as water pretreatment, wastewater treatment, and demineralized water
facilities are designed to incorporate the needs of the Phase II development. Minor expansion is required.
Fuel Handling. Minor expansion is required for coal and oil reception, railcar unloading, and coal
handling and storage facilities. A new coal yard will be constructed in parallel with the existing first
phase coal yard. The outdoor coal yard will have a storage capacity of 86,000 tons and the dry coal shed
43,000 tons. The railway station within the plant area will be renovated and expended so that the
effective length of rail lines will reach 700 m to meet the requirement of coal unloading.
Ash disposal. Fly ash and bottom ash (slag), will be hydraulically conveyed to an existing outdoor ash
disposal site located in the Yenpenchong Valley about 3.5 km away from the power plant. The site is



Page 24                                ANNEX 2
currently being used for disposal of ash from the Phase I operating units. It consists of a valley in which
an earth dam has been constructed. Ash slurry is deposited behind the dam. For Phase II development the
height of the earth dam will be raised for 10 m to increase its ash handling capacity and slurry waters will
be recovered and recycled.
Instrumentation and Control.. The instrumentation and control would be Distributed Digital Control
System (DDCS). Display of plant-specific equipment status and operating parameters on CRT installed
in the main control room will provide real-time interface between operators and plant systems. CRT will
also provide facilities for retrieval of plant operating data, as desired. Data loggers and sequence of
events recorders will automatically record plant performance on a periodic basis, and display operating
problems as they occur on a first-out basis. A replica simulator will be provided for operators training.
PROJECT COMPONENT 2
Transmission Reinforcement-US$204.9 million (excluding IDC)
With the additions of new generation capacity and increase in demand for power, especially in major
load centers and city center, the Hunan provincial power system needs to be strengthened. As part of the
proposed project this component would include the reinforcement of the existing 220 kV network and
entail the construction of about 794 km of 220 kV transmission lines and a number of substations with
1,920 MVA of load transfer capability. It has three discreet subcomponents: (a) reinforcement of the
transmission network associated with the Leiyang Power Plant Phase II development; (b) reinforcement
of the transmission network associated with the construction of the Changsha BOT Power Plant; and (c)
construction of the Furong substation in the heart of Changsha city to serve the heavily concentrated load
center in that area.
The transmission reinforcement component was based on feasibility studies carried out by HPEPDI.
Load flow, fault level and transient stability analyses were performed for the entire Hunan provincial
grid at the voltage level of 220 kV and above including the 500 kV AC tie line linking the Hunan
provincial grid to the Central China Power Grid (CCPG). System planning and design is based on the
"N-i" reliability criterion. Both steady state and transient stability criteria can be satisfied. The
transmission reinforcement is being financed by HEPC from its own resources. The only segment that is
to be financed under the Bank loan is the Furong substation, along with the underground cable
connection.
Leiyang Power Plant associated transmission would comprise about 411 km of 220 kV transmission
lines, four new 220 kV substations and the extension of one existing substation, having a load transfer
capability of 720 MVA (Table I A and Table 1 B)

ANNEX 4: BACKGROUND ON CHINA'S POWER SECTOR
REFORMS
Power sector reform in China is based on the staged implementation of a series of structural, pricing,
regulatory and financial reforms. There is broad consensus amongst policy makers on the objectives and
direction of these reforms. Coordination of these reforms is critical to ensure that the expected efficiency
gains are built on strong foundations of administrative capacity to manage the new market structure and
institutions created through this process. In general, reforms have been progressing at a remarkable pace
when viewed in the context of command-and-control administrative structure that China is gradually
emerging from.
Structural Reform
Although the power sector structure and ownership arrangements in the Chinese power sector vary
greatly, the purchasing agency or single buyer model has been widely accepted as a useful intermediate
structural model for most parts of China. Under this structure, the purchasing agent or single buyer owns
the transmission facilities within a specific geographic area and is the only buyer of power from
independent and affiliated generators inside and/or outside this area. The single buyer is also the only
seller of power in the specified geographic area to affiliated and/or independent power supply entities at
the county, prefectural or municipal level.
There are four main advantages of this transitional structure: (a) it is not a totally new structure, first
steps have been taken towards this structure in many parts of China; (b) it can easily accommodate
competitive bidding for the purchase of power with or without joint ventures; (c) it will encourage more
investment in transmission and distribution which have traditionally been underinvested in; (d) it can
serve as a transition step toward a more fully competitive market.
A number of provinces/municipalities have begun to implement the single buyer structure formally,
including, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Hunan and Henan.
Diversification of Financing
Evolution to the single buyer structure with the increasing separation of generation from transmission
and distribution has created unique pressures for diversifying financing sources. Based on the legal
affirmation of the Electric Power Law (December 1995) to allow private sector financing of generation,
generation enterprises separated from transmission are now increasingly seeking private portfolio capital.
There have been at least four public equity offerings of formerly state-owned generation enterprises.
Even public-sector generation projects financed by the Bank are being included in generation enterprises
that are being publicly listed (e.g. Zouxian Thermal Power Project, Touketuo Thermal Power Project,
and Waigaogiao Thermal Power Project). Diversified ownership in generation is expected to
significantly accelerate the reform effort particularly in the development of economic regulation of the
power sector.
Pricing Reforms
At the level of producer prices (i.e. generation tariffs), China introduced in 1985 the now famous "new
plant new price" policy that while extremely successful in attracting large volumes of capital in
generation has also distorted incentives for efficient capacity utilization. Under this policy prices for
power purchased from plants not financed by the central government from 1986 to 1992 and all power



Page 32                                     ANNEX 4
plants built after 1992 are set at levels sufficient to cover debt repayment, depreciation, and operating
costs. Lower producer prices from old state financed plants are used to mitigate the impact on final
consumer tariffs during the transition to market based tariffs.
There are two significant shortcomings of the pricing system in the power sector in China. The first
relates to the pricing of the wholesale/bulk capacity and energy sales/purchases from generating plants.
The second relates to the inadequate recognition of transmission as a separate service that needs to be
separately accounted for in electricity tariffs. These inadequacies of wholesale electricity pricing are
reflected in the inefficient utilization and dispatch of generating capacity. Inefficient resource use stems
from operation of old and/or small inefficient and therefore higher energy cost coal-fired plants in lieu of
modern, more efficient plants. The non recognition of the importance of transmission service is reflected
in the inability of utilities to include costs related to transmission in sale tariffs and to secure adequate
investments for the transmission infrastructure. This is also impeding the implementation of the
purchasing agency model, and progress towards competition at the generation level. At the retail level,
prices have generally been able to recover the cost of generated energy and adequate margins for
distribution.
Pricing reforms envisage the gradual elimination of the "new plant new price" policy with a price set at
levels established through contracts with the purchasing agency. The main thrust here is to establish a
two-part tariff structure which maximizes the incentives for efficient plant operation and dispatch. The
prices for transmission services based on reasonable cost plus basis are being developed on a pilot basis
in the Eastern coastal provinces. The transmission pricing experience gained in East China will be
considered for wider application in other regions.
Regulatory Reforms
China enacted the a new Electric Power Law in April 1996. The Law provides a broad framework and
advances key principles to be followed in the power sector. The significant features include: (a)
affirmation of the principle that the power sector should be run on a commercial basis, involving
negotiated transactions between enterprises driven by market signal and competitive pressures; (b)
commercial autonomy of power enterprises and the right of investors to recover invested capital and earn
a reasonable return; (c) general guidelines for the determination of power tariffs based on cost recovery;
(d) definition of certain rights and responsibilities of the central and provincial governments; (e)
recognition of private sector involvement in generation, while maintaining transmission and distribution
in the public sector. The Electric Power Law provides a sound foundation for economic regulation of the
power sector.
This regulatory transformation will be gradual in order to ensure consistency with the process of
administrative reform in the Central and Provincial governments. The implementation process will
require the following four phases of implementation: (a) elimination of MOEP and consolidation of
regulatory responsibilities in one higher government institution; (b) appropriate division of regulatory
responsibility between one central and one provincial-level government institution; (c) formation of
distinct single-purpose regulatory department within central and provincial government institutions; (d)
power sector regulatory authorities at the central and provincial level to be established as regulatory
commissions under the State Council, but separate from other government institutions.
It is expected that a transition period of about 10 years would be required to achieve the ultimate
objective of consolidating all economic regulatory functions in an independent agency. The first phase of
eliminating MOEP and transferring regulatory responsibilities to higher level government institutions is
now being undertaken.

ANNEX 5: HUNAN ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM-REFORM
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
A. INTRODUCTION
Hunan Electric Power Corporation (HEPC) intends to carry out a reform plan aimed at developing a
power purchasing agency (or single buyer) market structure in Hunan. The target is to separate
generation from HEPC's operations of transmission and distribution by December 2000. HEPC's
transmission and distribution operations will be transferred to a restructured company, the Hunan Power
Network Operations Company (HPNOC). HPNOC will be incorporated in accordance with the Company
Law of China by December 2000. HPNOC's transmission department and the power supply bureaus will
be established as pro-fit centers. Another element of the restructuring program is to consolidate Leiyang
Phases I and II (i.e. 2x200 MW in operation and 2x300 MW to be constructed under the proposed
project) into a single generation corporation, the Leiyang Power Generation Company, selling power to
HPNOC on the basis of adequate contractual arrangements. The Leiyang Power Generation Company
(LPGC) will be established by December 2000.
B. REFORM OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES
The objectives and principles for power sector reform in Hunan are:
*  Unbundling of Generation from Transmission and Distribution. The objective of this unbundling
is to create a purchasing agency structure which will encourage competitive procurement of future
generation and encourage additional investment in generation. The purchasing agency (i.e. HPNOC)
will focus on the efficient operation of the transmission and distribution network.
*  Efficient Wholesale Generation Tariffs: A revised system of wholesale electricity tariffs would be
developed and applied to all power purchases from generating plants on the system. These tariffs
should be conducive to economic dispatch and overall generation efficiency. All power will be
purchased by HPNOC on the basis of wholesale contractual arrangements. All generators on the
system will be treated equally and dispatched on a nondiscriminatory basis. (The principles for
pricing are described in more detail in section E below)
C. REFORM STRATEGY AND IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
Existing Power Sector Structure
The existing structure of the power sector in Hunan is described below and diagrammatically represented
in Figure 1.
* Generation. The generation capacity in Hunan is evenly split between thermal and hydroelectric
plants. Ownership of generation plant is very diverse with entities such as HEPC, Huaneng
International Power Development Company, local investment companies, local industries, the Hunan
Water Conservancy, and local municipal and county governments owning substantial stakes in
generation facilities.
* Therrnal plants wholly owned by HEPC:
* Jingzhushan (600 MW)
* Zhuzhou (100 MW)



Page 34                                  ANNEX 5
* Liyujiang (180 MW)
* Leiyang Phase I (400 MW)
* Xiangtan Phase l(100 MW)
* Hydro Plants wholly owned by HEPC:
* Dongjiang (609 MW)
* Zhexi (447.5 MW)
* Fengtang (400 MW)
* Majitang (54.15 MW)
* Generation partially owned by HEPC:
*  Huayin Electric Power Shareholding Company-Listed  on Shanghai Stock
Exchange. (250 MW)-33.2 percent stake
*  Shimen Co. (600 MW)-47 percent stake
*  Wuling LLC (1200 MW)-56.25 percent stake
* Baiyutang LLC. (17.5 MW)-62.6 percent stake
* Generation not affiliated to HEPC (i.e. Independent and locally owned Power Plants)
* Huaneng (775 MW)
* Hydro plants owned by Water Conservancy (210 MW)
*  Local and captive plants (1,070 MW)
*  Nongrid Connected plants (509 MW)
e  Transmission and Distribution. HEPC owns and operates the Hunan Power Grid transmission and
most of the distribution networks. The transmission network is a major component of the Central
China Electric Power Network. All major plants in this network listed above are dispatched by
HEPC.
HEPC has direct ownership and control of 14 power supply bureaus (PSB) which covers 97 percent
of the electricity sales in Hunan province. These PSBs include: Changsha; Zhangjiajie; Zhuzhou;
Yiyang; Xiangtan; Chengzhou; Hengyang; Loudi; Shaoyang; Yongzhou; Yueyang; Huaihua;
Chandge; and Xiangxi.
* Noncore Businesses. HEPC has responsibility and ownership for 13 noncore units for
manufacturing, construction, design, research, health, education, etc.
Future Structure and Restructuring Plans
HEPC plans, with MOEP's approval, to complete the sector restructuring by March 2001. The sector
structure in March 2001 is diagrammatically represented in Figure 2. The key power sector reform steps
are described below.
*  Formation of separate Companies for thermal and hydropower plants fully owned by Hunan Power
Network Operations Company (i.e. HPNOC). The Thermal Power Generating Company will
comprise all thermal plants currently wholly owned by HEPC, with the exception of Leiyang Phase I
and II, and Xiangtan Phase I. The Hydro Power Generating Company will comprise all hydro plants
currently wholly owned by HEPC. These entities will sell electricity to HPNOC on the basis of
economically efficient tariffs.
* A separate Leiyang Power Generation Company (LPGC) will be formed comprising Phase I
(2x200 MW) and the proposed Phase II (2x300 MW) plants. (See section D. below for details).



Page 35                                  ANNEX 5
* All other generating entities on the Hunan power system which are either partly owned by HPNOC,
or independent, vvill remain separate legal entities. They will all sell electricity to the HPNOC on the
basis of contracts that treat all plant on the Hunan power system on an equal basis. (The principles on
which these contracts are to be based are defined in E. below).
* Restructuring of HEPC as a limited liability company engaged in transmission and distribution:
*  A wholly state-owned company, HPNOC, will be established to own and operate the
transmission and distribution networks and provide transmission ancillary services. This
company will be registered in conformance with the Company Law of China.
*  HPNOC will operate as a purchasing agent (or single buyer) at the provincial level. It will
remain responsible for the planning, development and operation of the transmission and
distribution system, and continue to have the obligation to serve all customers in its service
area.
* Noncore businesses currently owned and run by HEPC will be formed as subsidiary companies, or
profit centers of HPNOC.
D. LEIYANG POWER GENERATION COMPANY
The Leiyang Power Generation Company (LPGC) will be a generating company incorporated in
accordance with the Company Law of China. This company will comprise the existing 2x200 MW units
and the proposed 2x300 units to be financed under the proposed project. LPGC will sell electricity in
bulk to HPNOC. The following steps will be followed to establish LPGC:
- Preparation of draft corporate charter, clearly specifying the capital structure of the LPGC, board of
directors, etc. This document will be submitted for World Bank review by July 1999.
 Preparation of draft power purchase agreement between the purchasing agent to be formed in Hunan
(i.e. HPNOC) and LPGC. The power purchase agreement would be based on principles outlined in
section E. below. The draft PPA would be submitted for World Bank review by July 1999.
- Formal incorporation of LPGC by December 1999.
* Formal signing of PPA between LPGC and HPNOC by December 2000.
E. PRINCIPLES FOR ESTABLISHING GENERATION TARIFFS IN HUNAN
Based on the proposed direction for reform, it is expected that in the medium term the bulk energy
pricing system will be based on long-term contracts. Well-structured contracts would play a key role in
providing stability and ensuring economic least cost operation of the power system. The following
principles will be reflected in the bulk generation pricing contracts:
* A tariff for capacity based on the cost of the plant i.e. service of debt, depreciation, fixed
maintenance and operating costs and fair return on investment.
* A tariff for energy based on the fuel and variable cost of the unit without any guaranteed amount of
energy purchase.
* Incentives for capacity and energy. For capacity, incentive targets such as availability should be
defined. For energy, marginal costs should include incentives to encourage the generator to reduce
energy cost.
F. TARGET IMPLEMENTATION DATES
The target dates for the reform process are:

ANNEX 7: COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS SUMMARY
GENERATION COMPONENT
Cost Effectiveness
A least cost study was carried out by the Beijing Research Institute for Water Resources and Electric
Power (BERI), in conjunction with the Hunan Electric Power Company (HEPC), using a planning model
that determines the optimal capacity and generation mix to meet the demand in the most cost effective
way (minimum net present value of investment and operation costs). The study covered the development
of the system during 1997-2025, study period, with special focus on the investment required during
1997-2010, planning period. The detailed report, "Economic Analysis for Leiyang Coal Fired Thermal
Power Plant" (November 1997), prepared by BERI and HEPC is in the project files.
Shadow Pricing
The least cost study and all economic analyses were based on adjusted costs of inputs to reflect their
economic value. Imported goods and services were valued at their estimated CIF (e.g., a conversion
factor of 1.0 was used). Domestically produced goods and .materials, most notably power generating and
transmission equipment and coal, were valued at their shadow prices using specific conversion factors
(see appendices A, B and C of the above referred to report). All costs and prices were expressed in 1997
Yuan using the official exchange rate at the time of preappraisal (Y 8.3/US$ 1.0), assuming that trade
distortions are negligible. The discount rate was assumed at 12 percent.
Least Cost Analysis
All potential candidates were considered including: (a) 300 MW units using local anthracite; (b) 300 and
600 MW units using coal imported from other provinces; (c) potential hydropower projects in Hunan; (d)
power imports from neighboring provinces; (e) 300 MW combined cycle units using distillate; and (f)
gas turbines using distillate. A detailed description of the technical and economic characteristics of the
thermal and hydroelectric candidates considered in Hunan's power generation development study are
presented in the above referred report prepared by BERI and HEPC .
The optimization was based on Chinese reliability criteria equivalent to the following LOLP criteria: no
constraints up to year 2000 because of the severe power shortages in Hunan and less than 1 percent
(about 3.5 days per year) in 2001 and after.
Based on the above assumptions and using a discount rate of 12 percent, the study showed that the power
expansion program should mainly be based on 300 MW anthracite-fired units during 1997-2005 and
600 MW coal-fired unit thereafter, development of six out of the nine identified hydropower projects,
and 100 MW gas turbine units. The proposed project is the first investment of the least cost power
development program. In the without project case, the expansion program would still be based on
300 MW anthracite-fired units installed in greenfield sites. The optimum solution with Leiyang is
presented in Table 1 and the optimum solution without Leiyang is presented in Table 2.
The proposed project remains the first investment of the expansion program under a wide range of
assumptions and mainly:



Page 44                                 ANNEX 7
*  The project will still be required by year 2001-2002, even if the demand would grow at 6 percent
during the whole study period compared to 10.1 percent during 1996-2000 and 7.2 percent after in
the base case;
*  The project would be less economical than the Shanbanxi hydropower project only if the investment
cost of the latter were 16.5 percent lower than in the base case (Y 60221kW compared to Y 721 1/kW
in the base case).

/a Based on 5,000 hours/year.
The economic rate of return (IERR) of the proposed project was calculated based on an estimated plant
gate price of 29.1 fen/kWh and 6850 hours/year, price currently paid by HEPC to recently commissioned
coal-fired base load power plants (the implicit assumption is that consumers will be willing to pay the
estimated price and the plant is optimally dispatched). The estimated plant gate is based on existing
pricing policies for power sales from new power plants and is fully passed on to consumers. The
calculation yielded an IERR of 19.8 percent. The IERR has also been calculated based on an plant gate
price equivalent to the current average generation price (which the consumers are actually paying) of
24.3 fen/kWh. This method yielded an IERR of 15 percent.
The base case IERR would decrease to the test discount rate of 12 percent in the case of one of the
following occurrences:
*  the price paid at the plant gate for electricity were 27 percent lower than the estimated base case
price, i.e., about 21.2 fen/kWh instead of 29.1 fen/kWh in 1996 prices; it should be noted that the
break-even price of 13 percent lower than the current average generation price in Hunan;
*  the project were to experience a cost overrun of about 66 percent;
*  the power plant operation were reduced to about 4442 hours per year instead of about 6850 hours;
*  the economic fuel cost were 110 percent higher than the base case;
*  the project were to experience a delay in commissioning of about 4.5 years.
However, these occurrences are very unlikely because HEPC has a good experience in implementation
and operation of similar projects, the economic evaluation is based on realistic assumptions, and the



Page 45                                 ANNEX 7
power purchase agreement and the financial covenants of the project would ensure that the capacity
factor and price are high enough to meet the economic viability requirements.
To complement the above deterministic approach a risk analysis was carried out using Risk Master
computer software which takes into account uncertainties related to selected risk variables (using the
Monte Carlo Simulation).' The assumed value ranges of the selected six risk variables (including foreign
exchange risk), the probability of distribution attached to them and the results, based on 1,000
simulations, are presented in figure 1. The IERR based on the weighted average of all simulated
combination is 14.8 percent (with a standard deviation of 4.2 percent). The minimum and maximum
IERR, under the considered uncertainties, are respectively 2.0 and 27.5. The probability of a negative
outcome (negative net present value) is 26 percent. This indicates that the risk (margin of error due to
future uncertainties) associated with the project is acceptable.
BERI also conducted an economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the project and their effect
on the economic viability of the project. The analysis takes into account the: (a) adjusted estimates of the
monetary damages caused by air pollution during the study period, based on the New York State
Externality Model (Rowe et al., 1994); and (b) estimates of average climate change for carbon dioxide
emissions to evaluate the monetary damages caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The adjustment
(transfer) factor takes into account the differences in population density and standard of living. Two
estimates are considered: a low estimate based on a transfer factor using GDP and a high estimate based
on power purchase parity in Hunan. The results of the evaluation show that if the monetary value of the
environmental impacts is added to the project operation costs, the IERR of the project would be reduced
to 17.2/14.5 (low/high) percent.
TRANSMISSION COMPONENT
The strengthening of the transmission system is imperative. The load flow and stability analyses carried
out by HEPC show that the need and timing of the proposed lines and substations are justified. The
design parameters of the proposed lines and substations has been optimized to ensure that transmission
services would be provided in the most cost effective way.
In Monte Carlo simulation series of random numbers are generated following the
distribution of each risk variable. For each simulation which represents a combination of
different state of five variables, IERR is calculated and recorded. The results of 1000
simulations are averaged.

/a The incremental benefits and costs for financial analysis relate only to the transmission investment
under the proposal project.
To complement this cost effectiveness approach, BERI calculated an IERR on HEPC's entire investment
program using: (a) incremental sales revenues (incremental sales per category of consumers multiplied
by the 1997 average sales price per category of consumers) as a measure of the minimum benefit of the
investment program, and (b) adjusted costs of inputs according to the same assumptions used in the least
cost study. The method yielded an IERR of 13.6 percent and confirmed the economic viability of the
whole, and particularly the proposed transmission, investment program.
The base case IERR would decrease to the test discount rate of 12 percent in the case of one of the
following occurrences:
*  case 1     energy sales decrease 11.0 percent                      11.99 percent
*  case 2     average price is 3.0 fen/kWh less than assumed price    12.05 percent
*  case 3     generation of investment increase by 16.0 percent      11.99 percent
*  case 4     transmission investment increase by 60 percent         11.99 percent
A risk analysis was carried out using Risk Master computer software which uses Monte Carlo simulation
technique. The assumed value ranges of the selected five risk variables (including foreign exchange risk),
the probability of distribution attached to them and the results, based on 1,000 simulations, are presented
in figure 2. The IERR based on the weighted average of all simulated combination is 12.4 percent (with a
standard deviation of 4.2 percent). The minimum and maximum IERR, under the considered
uncertainties, are respectively 5.2 and 22.5. The probability of a negative outcome (negative net present
value) is 40 percent. This indicates that the risk (margin of error due to future uncertainties) associated
with the overall investment program is high but acceptable.

ANNEX 8: FINANCIAL SUMMARY
FINANCIAL VIABILITY AT PROJECT LEVEL
Leiyang Power Plant
The incremental financial benefits for the proposed component are calculated based on the prices
entailed by the "new power new price" policy which warrants cost recovery and a return on the
investments agreed between HEPC and the Pricing Department of the Hunan Provincial Government.
The required annual tariff increase will be proposed by HEPC and confirmed by the Provincial Pricing
Bureau on an annual basis taking into account the following principles:
*  Prior to the retirement of domestic debts (from 2002 to 2012): full debt service requirements; O&M
cost (including depreciation not used for debt repayments); taxes related to the proposed project; and
an annual return of not less than 15 percent on the funds invested by HEPC for the proposed
component.
*  After retirement of domestic debts (from 2013 to the end of the life of the project): full debt service
requirements for the Bank loans; O&M cost (including depreciation not used for debt repayments);
taxes related to the project; and an annual return of not less than 18 percent on the funds invested by
HEPC for the proposed component.
The financial rate of return for the proposed power plant investment is estimated at 12.11 percent.
Based on the latest investment cost estimates, operating costs arrived from historical records to increase
with projected domestic inflation rates, prevailing interest rates and exchange rate, and 5,000 operating
hours per year, the estimated average tariff for the proposed power plant component would be as follows:
*  Average tariff prior to retirement of domestic debts (from 2002 to 2012):
54.73 fen/kWh (in current terms)
34.25 fen/kWh (in 1997 prices)
*  Average tariff during the life of the project life (from 2002 to 2022)
59.71 fen/kWh (in current terms)
29.05 fen/kWh (in 1997 prices)
Transmission Component
The incremental financial benefits for the proposed component are calculated based on the prices
accounting for full cost recovery and a return on the investments agreed between HEPC and the Pricing
Department of the Hunan Provincial Government. The required annual tariff increase will be proposed
by HEPC and confirmed by the Provincial Pricing Bureau on an annual basis taking into account the
following principles:
* Full debt service requirements; O&M cost (including depreciation not used for debt repayments);
taxes related to the proposed component; and an annual return of not less than 15 percent on the
funds invested by HEPC for the proposed component.
The financial rate of return for the proposed transmission investment is estimated at 14.86 percent.
Based on the latest investment cost estimates, operating costs arrived from historical records (1 percent
of fixed assets value) to increase with projected domestic inflation rates, prevailing interest rates and



Page 52                                  ANNEX 8
exchange rate, and assuming that the electricity sales would grow by 6 percent per year during 1997-
2010, 5 percent during 2011-2015, 4 percent during 2016-2020, and 3 percent during 2021-2025, and 2
percent thereafter, the estimated average tariff increases for the proposed transmission component would
be as follows:
Average tariff increases during the life to the project:
0.55 fen/kWh (in current terms)
0.32 fen/kWh (in 1997 prices)
The sensitivity analyses would not be very meaningful in either case due to the fact that the prices are set
based on regulated cost plus approach. As a result, the rates of return are not sensitive to either the
changes in costs or the fluctuations in electricity sales.
FINANCING PLAN
The total financing requirements (including IDC of $68.4 million equivalent) are estimated at $747.2
million equivalent. The foreign exchange required for the project cost estimated at $300 million will be
financed by the proposed Bank loan. 20 percent of the total financing requirement, about $149.7 million
equivalent, will be financed by HEPC's self-generated funds. The remaining local costs and IDC for both
foreign and local loans estimated at $297.5 million equivalent will be covered by loans from the State
Development Bank (45 percent) and the China Construction Bank (55 percent). Written commitments
from the two local banks have been issued to HEPC. The risk of availability of counterpart funds is
extremely low because (i) Chinese banks are competing for financing good power projects like this one
for which the debt service of the proposed project is secured by the pricing formula committed by the
Hunan Provincial Government; and (ii) HEPC has had strong earning and solid repayment records.
VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT ENTITY-HEPC
Based on HEPC's financial statements for 1994-96 prepared in accordance with Chinese accounting
standards, HEPC is prudently capitalized (debt accounts for about 50 percent of the total capitalization),
maintained adequate liquidity (current ratios have been above 1.0 times) and strong debt service
positions (debt service coverage have been close to 1.8 times), and made satisfactory profits (net profits
represent about 5 percent of return on net fixed assets). The projection of HEPC's finances in accordance
with Chinese GAAP for 1997-2005 and the assumptions used are presented at the end of the same annex.
HEPC is expected to maintain prudent and strong financial positions throughout the projection period.
The debt/equity ratios are projected to stay below 60/40 percent and debt service coverages are averaged
above 1.5 times. The net profitability is expected to improve gradually and stabilize at the level of 7-8
percent of the net fixed assets.
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
HEPC has strengthened its financial management system in the past five years. At HEPC's headquarters,
a deputy general manager and a chief accountant were appointed to be in charge of operations and
company's finance. Under the chief accountant, the financial department is staffed with 21 professional
financial staff and accountants. HEPC's subordinate units (including power plants and power supply
bureaus) and wholly owned subsidiaries have set up financial departments and each is staffed with 10 to
15 qualified financial and accounting personnel. As of 1997, the total number of full-time financial and
accounting staff working in HEPC system and its subsidiary companies is 1206, of which 12 are senior
accountants, 208 chartered accountants, and 294 assistant accountants.



Page 53                                 ANNEX 8
HEPC's financial management system, including the accounting and auditing policies, standards, and
internal control, as well as the accounting arrangements for management of the proposed project have
been reviewed and their summary descriptions are given in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP),
available in the project file. The Chinese GAAP are generally consistent with IAS. The major differences
include: the approach and accounting treatment for bad debt provisioning, for short-term investments'
valuation, for permanent devaluation of long term investments, and for public welfare funds. However,
HEPC is still confined to other rules or set formats stipulated by MOF and MOEP and could not prepare
its financial statements that fully conform to the Chinese GAAP.
HEPC's existing systems for accounting and financial management are satisfactory. Improvements has
been made to its cash management system through a technical assistance provided by Asia Development
Bank. Centralized cash management functions and policies covering credit control, bank account control,
collection, payment and inventory have been established. However, there are areas, including ineffective
budgetary control, fragmented financial information flows, and lack of modern financial management
practice, where improvements could be made to meet modem financial management standards:
*  On the issue of budgetary control, the current practice is that annual operating budget proposals are
mostly based on administrative instructions and are seen as formalities. As a result, the comparison
between actual and budget allocation is not very meaningful and there is a lack of discipline and
effective budget control.
*  On the issue of information flows, currently, most of the information flows take a vertical
hierarchical path. Financial, planning, and construction departments/units each prepare and maintain
its own financial data, such as information related to investment, sales, costs, and tariffs, and do not
share information on a routine and timely basis. Therefore, discrepancies exist and may cause
mistakes on important decisions; and
*  On the issue of modem financial management, as HEPC was incorporated just few years ago, the
financial staff are strong in financial accounting but still at early stage of modern financial
management. HEPC could improve its financial management in financial planning, assets and
liabilities management, performance evaluation, and cost and management accounting, etc. Under
the proposed project, a TA will be provided to upgrade HEPC's financial management systems,
including intensive training for its financial staff, to address the above issues (see training program in
PIP, available in the project file).
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TARGETS
To promote prudent and sound financial management and adequate tariffs, HEPC agreed that the
following financial covenants will be included for the proposed project:
*  HEPC shall not incur any debt unless a reasonable forecast of the revenue and expenditure shows
that the estimated internal cash generation would provide a debt service coverage of no less than 1.5
times at all times;
*  HEPC shall take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments, to eam a
return of not less than 8 percent of the equity (paid-in capital plus retained earnings) in 1999-2000,
10 percent in 2001-2002, and 12 percent in 2003 and thereafter; and
* By June 1 of each year, HEPC shall furnish to the Bank a rolling eight-year financial plan containing
projected income statements, funds flow statements, and balance sheets.
A written commitment on the principles of cost recovery through tariff increase for the proposed project
was issued by the Pricing Department of the Hunan Provincial Government and provided to the Bank.

Major Assumptions:
The major assumptions used for HEPC's Financial Projections are as follows:
* General
* The general inflation rates are assumed as follows:
Local: 2.0 for 1998, 4.8 for 1999, 5.0 for 2000, 5.5 for 2001 and thereafter.
Foreign: 2.5 for 1998, 3.1 for 1999, 2.9 for 2000, 2.8 for 2001, 2.7 for 2002, 2.6 for 2003
*   The foreign exchange rate used is $1=Y 8.3.



Page 55                                  ANNEX B
*  The interest rates are assumed to be 10.53 percent per year for local loans and repayable in
12 and 10 years; 6.09 percent for IBRD loan with commitment charge of 0.75 percent and
repayable in 20 years including a 5-year grace period.
*  The capital investment program is based on the least cost power development planning for
HEPC.
* Income Statements
*  Energy sales projection is calculated based on load forecast of HEPC. Energy sales is
assumed to grow by 6.10 percent per year during the period 1997-2005.
*  The tariffs are assumed to be adjusted so that the average revenues would be adequate for
achieving the minimum financial performance targets.

ANNEX 9: PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
ARRANGEMENTS
PROCUREMENT
All goods and consultant services to be financed under Bank loan will be procured by HEPC in
accordance with the Bank Guidelines ("Guidelines-Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,"
January 1995, revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997, and "Guidelines for Selection
and Employment of consultants by World Bank Borrowers," January 1997 and revised in September
1997). Project costs by procurement arrangements are summarized in Table A and Al. Procurement
activities will be processed according to the schedule in Table A2 and Charts 1 and IA. Estimated
contractual and other payments are shown in Table A.3.
In International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and Limited International Bidding (LIB) procurement, model
bidding documents (May 1997) developed by MOF in collaboration with the Bank would be used. In
evaluation of the bids following ICB procedures, qualified domestic manufacturers would be eligible for
a margin of preference of 15 percent of the Cost, Insurance, Freight (CIF) price or the actual custom
duty, whichever is lower.
The invitation to bid for each contract estimated to cost US$10 million equivalent or more shall be
advertised in accordance with the procedures applicable to large contracts under paragraph 2.8 of the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
Goods. The Bank loan will be mainly used for procurement of major equipment and materials for
Leiyang thermal power plant and Furong substation. About 96 percent of the equipment and materials
will be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The procurement under ICB
procedures will include 13 packages for plant and transmission equipment and materials, ranging from
about US$1 million to US$126 million with a total value of US$288 million. Some specialized
equipment estimated to cost less than $300,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$4 million,
and equipment which can only be purchased from a limited number of suppliers, notwithstanding the
cost per contract thereof, will be procured through limited international bidding (LIB). Goods,
instruments and accessories needed for construction and operation of power plant and transmission
facilities, including equipment for environmental monitoring, which are readily available off-the-shelf
goods or standard specification commodities, will be procured through contracts awarded on the basis of:
(a) International Shopping procedures (IS) for contracts estimated to cost less than US$300,000 per
contract and up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.5 million, by soliciting quotations from at least
three suppliers in two different countries; or (b) National Shopping procedures (NS) for contracts
estimated to cost less than US$300,000 up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000, with the prior
agreement of the Bank. Goods of a proprietary nature may be procured through direct contracting with
the bank's prior agreement. It is expected that the aggregate amount would not exceed $500,000.
Works. The site preparation, civil works construction and installation of plant electromechanical
equipment and transmission facilities are well within the capability of the local contractors. Because of
foreign exchange limitations, these works will be financed by HEPC and procured following local
competitive bidding procedures. Installation of major equipment will be supervised by the
manufacturers.
Services. Contracts amounting to about $5.5 million in total for consulting services, including training,
will be awarded in accordance with Bank Guidelines. These include technical assistance for preparation



Page 58                                  ANNEX 9
of commercial power purchase agreements and implementation of HEPC's restructuring plan (1
contract), technical assistance for improvement of the financial management system (I contract), and
construction management (1 contract). Selection of consultants will be carried out through Quality and
cost based Selection (QCBS). These contracts shall be based on the applicable standard form of contract
for consultants' services issued by the bank, with such modifications thereto as shall have been agreed by
the bank. Other consulting services and training may be procured under Consultant's Qualification (CQ)
procedures (appropriate qualifications and reference from an established short list) for contracts expected
not to exceed US$100,000 for firms, or under procedures for the hiring of individual consultants. These
may include training, and advisory services to HEPC on restructuring and technical matters.
Prior Review Thresholds (Table B). Prior review of draft bidding documents, bid evaluation reports
and contract award recommendations and contracts will be carried out for all ICB contracts and LIB
contracts exceeding $300,000. This will cover over 99 percent of the Bank loans. Selective post-review
will apply to other contracts during the supervision missions. Prior review of the terms-of-reference, cost
estimates, selection criteria, consultant shortlists, request for proposals, bid evaluation reports and
contract award recommendations and contracts will be required for all consultants with an estimated cost
exceeding $100,000 per contract for firms, or $50,000 for individuals.
DISBURSEMENT
Allocation of Loan Proceeds (Table C). The bank loan will be disbursed against: (a) 100 percent of the
foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and materials quoted on a CIF basis; (b) 100
percent of local expenditures ex-factory for locally manufactured items; (c) 75 percent of local
expenditure for other items procured locally; and (d) 100 percent of the expenditure for consulting
services and training.
The estimated annual disbursement schedule is shown in the Project Financing data in page 1 and
detailed in the PIP (available in the project file). It reflects the bank experience with previous power
projects in China. The loan is expected to be disbursed over a period of about 5.5 years. The project
completion date would be December 31, 2003, and the loan closing date would be December 31, 2004.
Retroactive financing in an aggregated amount of $10 million, or 3.3 percent of the loan, would be provided
for the anticipated expenditures (consulting services for technical assistance and equipment on the critical
path of the project construction) incurred after the March 31, 1998 and before signing of the loan.
Use of Statements of Expenses (SOEs). For expenditures pertaining to goods contracts valued at less
than US$300,000, consultancy contracts valued at less than US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for
individuals and all training, reimbursement will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenses.
Supporting documentation need not be submitted to the Bank but will be retained in HEPC's office for
review by Bank supervision missions.
Special Account To facilitate disbursements under this project, a Special Account will be established for
HEPC with an authorized allocation of US$20 million, representing approximately four months of average
project disbursements. Applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly or when the amounts
withdrawn equal 50 percent of the initial deposit, whichever comes sooner.
Separate and auditable accounts would be established by HEPC. These accounts would include: (i) a record
of withdrawals on the Bank loan with copies of all disbursement requests and underlying documentation;
and (ii) a record of transactions on the Special Accounts and the copies of the Bank statements on this
account.

ANNEX 10: LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
General
The Hunan Power Development Project consists of three components: (a) installation of 2X300 MW
anthracite fired units at Leiyang Thermal Power Plant (Phase II); (b) construction and expansion of five
220 kV substations and seven sections of 220 kV lines totaling 410 km associated with Leiyang Power
Plant; and (c) construction and expansion of 6 substations and 13 sections of 220 kV transmission lines
totaling 378 km associated with Changsha BOT power plant. All three components involve land
acquisition and reallocation of population. Minimization of the scope of resettlement was, and will
continue to be a high priority throughout the planning, design and implementation of the proposed
project. Where land acquisition and demolition are unavoidable, the resettlement plans provide for
replacement of housing, alternative employment opportunities, infrastructure, services and other
resources to improve, or at least restore, the living conditions and income of the project affected persons
(PAPs).
The resettlement for the proposed project will be carried out in two phases. The first phase includes: (a)
policies and regulations, institutional arrangements, implementation procedures that would be applied to
all components of the proposed project; and (b) detailed resettlement plans for (i) Leiyang Power Plant;
(ii) four 220 kV substations (Furong, Dongfenghu, Hengbei, and Wangcheng); and (iii) two sections of
220 kV transmission lines (Huaneng Power Plant to Dongfenghu, and Macha to Hengbei). The second
phase includes resettlement activities related to five 220 kV substations and 18 sections of 220 kV
transmission lines. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared for the first phase. The RAP for
the second phase will be prepared by March 1999 following the completion of the design of routing and
siting of these subcomponents.
The Bank carried out full review of the RAP and the assessment found that the resettlement needs and
PAPs are well analyzed and mitigating measures of adverse social impacts are thoroughly formulated
and adequate. The second phase RAP and any unforeseen resettlement associated with the project will be
carried out according to the policy and procedures established in the first phase RAP.
Scope of Resettlement
According to the first-stage resettlement estimates, the project (including two phases) would (a) require
acquisition of 1,097.5 mu (about 73 ha) of land; (b) affect 397 persons due to land loss; (c) require
demolition of 100,145 square meters of floor spaces in rural and urban areas; and (d) require relocation
of 266 households or 1,418 persons (see Table 1). The first phase components require acquisition of a
total of 438.5 mu land area, affecting 108 people; demolishing 15,941 square meters of floor spaces, and
relocating 175 households or 993 individuals (see Table 2). Based on preliminary estimate, the remaining
project components will require acquisition of 659 mu land area, affecting 289 farmers; removing 84,204
square meters structures, and relocating 91 households or 425 individualsg.
For the Leiyang Thermal Power Plant (Phase II) component, although no land acquisition is required for
the power plant, additional site for the ash pond is needed, which will require acquisition of about
277 mu of land, including 20 mu of cultivated land. For some substations and transmission lines, no land
requisition and relocation are required.

Legal Framework
The land acquisition and resettlement of Hunan Power Development Project are based on State laws
and/or regulations, and provincial implementation measures. The State laws and regulations include:
"Land Administration Law" (1988), "City Planning Act" (1990), and "Administrative Regulation of
Urban Building Demolition and Relocation" (1991). The provincial implementation measures include:
"Hunan Provincial Implementation Measure of Land Administration Law" (1987), "Changsha City
Methods of Land Requisition and Compensation for State Construction Projects" (1991), and "Changsha
City Administration Method of Urban Building Demolition and Relocation" (1992).
The detailed compensation for lost young crops, land and property, detailed in the first phase RAP, will
apply to all resettlement actions carried out under the proposed project.

In order to effectively implement the land acquisition and resettlement program for the proposed project,
resettlement groups from provincial government to affected village level have bee established.
A leading group, including officials from Hunan Provincial Government and managers from HEPC,
representatives from Hunan Power Construction and Development Company (HPCDC), and other
concerned agencies, will supervise all resettlement activities to ensure successful implementation of the
RAP.
Under the leading group, a project resettlement office has been established within HEPC. The office
consists of key resettlement staff from HEPC and concerned departments and bureaus responsible for
Leiyang Power Plant, and transmission components associated with both Leiyang and Changsha BOT
power plants. It will: (a) supervise the local consultants' work related to the scope of resettlement based
on project engineering studies, detailed census and social economic surveys, and evaluation of
resettlement impacts; (b) arrange resettlement training for the main resettlement staff; (c) develop the
resettlement action plan; (d) carry out extensive consultation on resettlement policies; (e) manage
allocate, and supervise the disbursement of resettlement budget; (f) monitor and coordinate the
resettlement implementation among different city resettlement offices; (g) carry out internal resettlement
monitoring and develop internal monitoring report; (h) coordinate the independent resettlement
monitoring efforts; and (i) prepare progress report for the proposed project.
The resettlement offices at city and county levels comprising resettlement staff from respective power
bureaus are mainly responsible of implementation of the RAP. They will work closely with city and
county land administration bureaus to implement the resettlement programs. Their responsibilities
include: (a) completion of social economic and census surveys; (b) participation in the development of
RAP; (c) organization of public participation; (d) acquisition of land use permit and land requisition
permit; (e) supervision of the resettlement budget allocation and use; (f) provision of assistance in both
internal monitoring and external monitoring works; (g) preparation of progress reports; and (h)
coordination and conflict resolution during the resettlement implementation. In affected townships and
villages, resettlement working teams will be set up to facilitate the resettlement implementation.
Public Consultation and Grievance Procedure
In the process of formulating resettlement policies, developing resettlement action plans, and carrying
out resettlement implementation, special attention was given to consultation with affected people and
affected communities. In the project feasibility phase, the project office consulted extensively with local
governments, local people's congress, nongovernment organizations, and individuals with regard to the
site selection of substation and transmission line corridors. All affected villages and individuals were
consulted during the resettlement planning phase and the census and economic social surveys. Numerous
meetings were held with affected people and local officials on compensation policies and rehabilitation
measures. All relocated households (urban and rural) were interviewed by the project team. Their
concerns and opinions have been incorporated in the first phase RAP. In addition, serious efforts will be
made to inform the resettlers about resettlement policies and entitlements. A resettlement information
booklet, including main contents of the RAP: compensation rates, entitlement policies, and grievance
procedures, will be distributed to each resettler prior to resettlement implementation. Further
consultation with affected people will be ensured by resettlement institutions during implementation.
To ensure that the resettlement program is implemented successfully, and complaints are dealt with in a
timely fashion, a grievance procedure for the project has been established and will be publicized to all

resettlers. Unsatisfied PAPs could: (a) complain to the village committee or resettlement working team in
the township and expect to be responded in 2 weeks; (b) appeal on any unsatisfactory decision to the
county or city land administration bureaus and expect to be responded in 15 days; and (c) report directly
to the project resettlement office (provincial level) or the resettlement leading group and expect to be
responded in two vveeks. In the case of persistent disagreement, the unsatisfied PAPs could request an
administrative review of the case following the administrative appeal law, or go directly to court.
Budget and Timetable
Based on preliminary budget projection, resettlement costs will amount to 129.6 million yuan, with the
first phase being 64.33 million, second phase of 43.65 million yuan, and 21.62 million yuan of other
expenses plus contingencies (see Table 3). The cost estimates for phase one costs include 45.4 million
yuan for Furong and Dongfenghu substations, which have already completed land acquisition and
resettlement. The cost includes a 10 percent of contingency provision of 10.8 million yuan and 5 percent
of management fee.

ANNEX 11: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
A. SUMMARY OF KEY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
Power Station
Air Pollution. Table 1 presents air pollution characteristics for the existing project (400 MW), proposed
project (600 MW), and a possible additional phase (1200 MW). As can be seen, emission standards for
dust and sulfur dioxide are all in compliance with Chinese standards and World Bank Guidelines.
Nitrogen oxide emissions, however, will not meet current World Bank Guidelines, because these
guidelines were not formulated for the anthracite coal which will be used as the fuel. Basically, the
extremely low volatility of anthracite coals requires unusually high combustion temperatures. As a result
nitrogen oxide emissions tend to be higher than levels observed with more traditional coals. Currently,
international practice recommends an emission level of 1500 mg/Nm3 for boilers fired with anthracite.
World Bank Guidelines are currently in the process of being revised. The updated guidelines have
proposed 1,500 mg/Nm3 for nitrogen oxides emission levels when using anthracite coals. Thus, the
proposed project will be consistent with both international practice and proposed revisions to World
Bank Guidelines.
In addition to the emissions to be realized from the construction of the Phase II power station at Leiyang,
HEPC has agreed to a phaseout of 10 boilers (300 MW total) at 5 other locations in Hunan Province.
Therefore, Table 1 also provides an indication of the emission reductions which will be realized from
this phaseout.
Air quality information are also provided in Table 1. This information must be considered both
preliminary and extremely conservative. It is preliminary, because it is based upon only three months of
continuous monitoring. The complete data set will be available in May 1998, at which time the estimates
would be revised. It is extremely conservative because estimates of background and Phase I/Phase
II/Phase III were made by adding the measured maximums of the background to the calculated
maximum increments of the contributions from Phase I/Phase II/Phase III. The likelihood of the
background maximum occurring simultaneously with a maximum contribution from the power station is
extremely small. Since no information is available concerning the joint probability of occurrence for the
two maxima, an overly conservative approach of adding the two maximums was taken. On this basis, the
only exceedance appears to be with the daily and hourly maxima for nitrogen oxides. The EA report
indicated that these exceedances were not frequent, and concluded that the contribution of the Leiyang
plant to ambient nitrogen oxide levels to be acceptable. It is also worthwhile to note that both World
Bank Guidelines and USA standards only consider an annual average for NO,, and that the Leiyang
contribution to the annual average is comfortably within that limit.
Water Pollution. Wastewaters will be treated by technologies standard to power station operations. This
includes settling of suspended solids (coal transport drainage, boiler acid cleaning waste water, air
preheater wastewater), neutralization tanks for pH control (boiler makeup water treatment plant,
laboratory wastewater, air preheater wash water etc.), oil separators for oily wastes (drainage from oil
storage sites), and oxidation ponds for municipal sewage. After treatment, all of these waters will be used
for ash slurry and recycled to the ash yard. Drainage from the ash yard will be sent back to the plant
mixed with fly ash and treated wastewater discharges and recirculated back to the ash yard. This
recirculation system will include all wastewaters from both the existing plant as well as the proposed
project. Currently, wastewaters from the existing plant are discharged into the Leishui River. Thus, the
proposed project will result in less wastewater discharges to the Leishui River than currently exists.



Page 85                                ANNEX 11
Effluent from the ash yard consists primarily of a small amount of seepage through the toe of the ash
yard dam which will also be recycled. There is minuscule leakage through the base of the ash yard
because of the geologic substrata. Measurements of groundwater quality indicate compliance with
Chinese standards for groundwater quality (GB/T14848-93).
The Leiyang power station currently uses a once through cooling system which will also be adopted with
the proposed project. Both mathematical and physical modeling were used to develop a discharge
configuration that would provide a minimal impact of the plume on the receiving waters, and an
adequate cross-sectional area for fish passage. However, Dongjiang Dam that has been constructed on
the Leishui River upstream of Leiyang, discharges cooler water than would be experienced without the
dam presence. As a result, the thermal discharge will exceed Chinese standards for temperature rise
relative to the cooler waters. However, the existing Leiyang thermal power station and the proposed
project tend to increase water temperatures to the natural level which previously existed, and in
accordance with Chinese interpretation of their regulations the proposed project is in compliance with
Chinese standards.
Fuel Supply. The existing power station and the proposed project will utilize anthracite coal obtained
from three local State owned underground mines: Baisha (largest supplier), Jiahe, and Xifangdu. Some
coal is currently transported by truck but most is transported by rail. For the proposed project, only rail
transport will be used.,
Existing mining operations were a matter of concern even though no investments are involved. A mining
expert visited the mines and found them to be well managed, and in compliance with all Chinese Coal
Mine regulations. Also, the exceptionally low volatility of the coal gives some comfort that methane gas
is not likely to be present.
Ash Management. Ash (fly ash and bottom ash) is currently slurried and pumped through an enclosed
pipeline to an ash yard about 6 km from the plant site. The ash disposal site is a steep valley, dammed at
one end to form the enclosure. There are no residents living or using the site for any productive purpose.
For the proposed project the same ash disposal yard will be utilized by elevating the height of the
existing dam. However, fly ash and bottom ash will be separated to allow greater utilization of the
bottom ash by the construction industry. As mentioned above, no groundwater contamination is
anticipated and the small amount of seepage through the toe of the dam will be recirculated with the
slurry water. A groundwater monitoring will be maintained to insure no contamination occurs (see Part
C: Environmental Monitoring Program).
Noise. Major noise sources include generators, ball mills, fans (forced and induced draft) and pumps.
Sound levels at the plant boundary were determined to be within Chinese Standards (GB 12348-90 and
GB3096-93) and World Bank Guidelines.
Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecology. Impacts to terrestrial ecology would result from both the increased
emissions from the power station and land surface smothered by the increased levels of ash disposal.
Based upon comparisons of ground level air quality estimates with Chinese requirements for crop
protection (GB9137-88) no impacts to plant species are anticipated. As mentioned before, the ash
disposal site is in a steep valley which is not cultivated. There will be some vegetative loss as the ash
level rise, but it is of minimum extent and insignificant value.
The elimination of all wastewater effluents to the Leishui River should actually improve the water
quality and induce improvements to the aquatic ecology. This would be further enhanced by the addition



Page 86                                  ANNEX 11
of increased thermal discharges which would restore the thermal regime existing before construction and
operation of the upstream dam.
Occupational Health and Safety. Project design will be such that international standards of worker
health and safety will be included in the bidding documents of project equipment. Boilers and other
dangerous equipment will be designed to meet ASME standards of safety and will be so specified in the
bidding documents. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are illegal in China, their use is prohibited in the
project. Prohibition of asbestos use will be specified in the bid documents.
Public Consultation. A public consultation was conducted on 21 March 1997 at the Leiyang Power
Plant. The projects benefits were recognized by all participants, and a wish was expressed by the
participants that the project be started and completed as soon as possible so that the benefits could be
realized in the shortest possible time.
Transmission System
Noise. Support towers will be designed to assure that noise at ground level will be within Chinese
standards (60dB[A] daytime and 50dB[A] nighttime-GB3096/93) and World Bank guidelines (55
dB[A]). Noise measurements made at existing power lines with a design similar to the proposed project
indicated values of 36.3-47.1 dB[A]. Affirming the view that the lines will meet standards.
Substation noises arise primarily from the transformers. Estimated noise levels at the plant boundaries of
the eleven substations to be included in the project varied from 40-47.5 dB[A] at night to 37-48dB[A]
during the day. These values are well within Chinese standards (5OdB[A] night and 6OdB[A] day-
GB 12348-90).
Electric Field. Allowable ground level electric field intensities for transmission lines in China are as
follows:
Situation                        Field Intensity Limit Value (kV/m)
Crossing Farm Field                                  9.5
Crossing Highway                                    7.0
Crossing or Close to Residence                           4.0
Measurements made at existing transmission lines utilizing the same design as the proposed project
yielded values less than 3 kV/m. Therefore, design of the transmission lines are expected to comfortably
meet Chinese standards. There are no World Bank guidelines for electric field intensity.
Allowable ground level electric field intensities for substations in China are as follows:
Situation                        Field Intensity Limit Value (kV/m)
Power Distribution Installation Area                       10-15
Working Area                                       8
Power Distribution Installations Enclosure Wall                   5



Page 87                                ANNEX 11
Measurements made at existing substations utilizing the same design as the proposed project yielded
values less than 3 kV/m. Therefore, design of the substations are expected to comfortably meet Chinese
standards. There are no World Bank guidelines for electric field intensity.
Agricultural Production. Pylon foundations will occupy 12.28 ha of which 3.0 ha is agriculturally
productive and substations will occupy 33.36 ha of which 2.5 ha is agriculturally productive. Thus it is
estimated that the proposed project will reduce the annual grain harvest by about 83 tons. This is
considered negligible for the total extent of the project area.
Ecology. The project does not cross or influence any protected areas, nor does it interfere with any
migratory bird routes. There are no wild or protected species whose habitat is located at or near the
project site or right-of-way.
Public Consultation. A series of public consultations/surveys were conducted at 23 sites during the
period of October to November 1997. These meetings broadly concluded that: people should be
compensated for any land occupied by the tower foundations, relocated people should be adequately
compensated, engineering construction should minimize crop destruction (compensation should be
provided) , and transmission towers should be self standing rather than guyed.

provided on noisy equipment. Noise levels specified to be less than 90dB(A) at I m from equipment except for coal
mills at 95-105dB(A) and feed pumps at 101 dB(a). Silencers to be fitted to boiler steam release and safety valves and
forced draft fan outlet.
Contingency Measures    All bulk oil and chemical stores should have bunds of sufficient capacity to contain any spillage. Where practicable,
pumps, valves, couplings, delivery nozzles and overspill pipes should be contained within the bunded area. Materials
(absorbent granules, oil boom, etc.) should be maintained on site to deal with minor spills.                                        >

Fugitive dust           vegetated to reduce noise and dust and improve visual appearance.
Waste Water             Bund equipment containing oil in substations, oil contaminated drainage to be discharged via oil/water separators.  HEPC & Construction Unit
Sewage from substations to be collected in septic tanks.
Noise                    Maximum noise levels at the plant boundary are to specified as 60db(A) by day and 50 dB(A) by night. Construction
noise should be specified in accordance with GB12523-90. Control rooms in substations should be sound insulated.
Avoid working at night where possible.
Routing of Transmission   The transmission system is designed to minimize impact on residential areas, nature reserves, historic sites and other
Lines                   sensitive locations. A minimum clearance of 5m to residential properties should be maintained. When the electric field
intensity at Im from ground >3 kV/m houses should be removed. Adequate clearance over roads, navigable rivers, and
other transmission or communication lines to be provided according to relevant technical standards (SDJ3). Provide
public notification of any interruption of transport routes. Interference with road traffic to be avoided by use of
overhead gantries during construction & maintenance. Interference of river navigation to be restricted to <6h for each  HEPC
crossing.
Relocation/Compensation   Full compensation for economic losses (relocation, loss of crops, etc.) to guarantee no loss of living standards.
Minimize duration of temporary occupation of land. (10 days for each pylon). Restore vegetation within 2 weeks after
construction.
Safety                   Education programs to warn local population of potential dangers of overhead transmission lines. Provide secure
perimeter fencing to substations and other transmission installations. Ground railings and other metal structures.
Thermal Pollution from   HEPC has an agreement with authorities that the Dongjiang reservoir will be open in the future to maintain a minimum HEPC/Agency responsible
cooling water discharge    flow of 116m3/sec.                                                                                   of dam operation
Hazardous materials     PCBs are outlawed in China. However if either PCBs or asbestos are identified during project implementation  HEPC
PCB/Asbestos            (especially retirement of small power plants) they will be managed (removed, transported, and disposal) in strict
accordance with regulations/procedures of China.
