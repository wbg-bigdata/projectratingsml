STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
I. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Uruguay has no coal or geothermal resources, nor known reserves of
oil or gas (exploratory works are being carried out in the Santa Lucia river
basin). 1/ Its relatively few hydro power resources are, by and large, either
already utilized or in the process of being developed. As to future indige-
nous supplies, hope lies with uranium, solar energy and wind energy. Gas
imports from Argentina are presently also being considered. A study of the
possibility of a pipeline for this purpose, which would be financed by the
River Plate Basin Development Fund, is under preparation. The government has
expressed interest in Bank financing of the pipeline. At present, Uruguay
imports about 14 million bbls of petroleum per year, which absorbs about 30%
of all merchandise export earnings. Petroleum is refined locally by a govern-
ment entity: Administracion Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland (ANCAP).
1.02      Demand for oil products in Uruguay has been relatively steady and
is close to the 1970 level, whereas electricity use is growing at 5% annually
and is now substantially above the South American per capita average, as can
be expected in view of Uruguay's per capita income and urbanization. Oil
products meet over eighty percent of the 2.0 million tons primary energy
demand, and hydroelectricity the major part of the remainder.
1.03      By decree 655 (August 1975), the Government determined to develop
to the fullest extent possible the country's hydro resources, thus reducing
the reliance on imported fuel. To this end, Uruguay is investing heavily in
the development of its hydroelectric capacity. Salto Grande (1,890 MW), a
binational project executed by the Comision Tecnica Mixta del Salto Grande
(CTM), located on the Uruguay River, which will serve Argentina and Uruguay,
started generation in 1979; the first 2 units (270 MW) will supply power
to Uruguay. Palmar (300 MW), located on the Rio Negro and executed by the
Comision Mixta del Palmar (COMIPAL), is presently scheduled to start
generation by 1982. These two projects will more than triple the 1977
hydro capacity of 236 MW to 806 MW by 1982, and should meet expected demand
growth as well as allow a significant reduction in fuel requirements.2/
1.04      Given the slow growth in energy demand, a low per capita usage
overall and negligible domestic resources, there seemed to be no urgent need
for energy planning prior to 1974. Then the serious impact of the oil price
increases led to the establishment of a Direccion Nacional de Energia in a
remodelled Ministry of Industry and Energy, but the Direccion has been kept
extremely small and no major changes were made in the organization of the
1/   There are oil shale reserves in N.E. Uruguay which are being evaluated
by ANCAP with the assistance of the Institute of Geology and Petrobras,
but extraction would be costly.
2/   Recently the government also signed an agreement with Brazil for two
small hydroelectric and irrigation projects in the N.E.

energy sector. Though still understaffed and limited by the low salaries it
can offer (a common problem in Uruguay's public sector), and consequently,
constrained in the tasks it may be expected to undertake, the Direccion is the
logical locus for energy planning. Even though comprehensive energy planning
has not yet been attempted, Uruguay does have a national electrical energy
plan, spanning the period 1975-83. This plan, which was approved by decree in
August 1975, was developed by the Government (with the assistance of an
external consultant financed by UNDP, Mr. C. Robertson Lavalle).
1.05      The proposed loan would include funds (US$0.6 million) for an overall
energy study which would result in a master energy plan and define the measures
to be taken to foster fuel economizationi. These funds would be relent to the
Direccion (under terms and conditions similar to those of the proposed loan
and acceptable to the Bank) which would be responsible for this part of the
Project. In order to allow the Direccion sufficient timle for preparation
of this complex study, and reach final agreement with the Bank on the terms of
reference and organization for it, during negotiations agreement was reached
that consultants to assist the Direccion should be engaged not later than
June 30, 1980 under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The study
would be completed by December 31, 1981.
World Bank Participation in the Sector
1.06      Through the former Administracion Nacional de las Usinas Electricas
y Telefonos del Estado (now: Administracion Nacional de las Usinas y Tras-
misiones Electricas; UTE) the Bank has made four loans to the sector, in
1950 (Loan 30-UR), in 1955 (Loan 132-UR), in 1956 (Loan 152-UR), and in 1970
(Loan 712-UR), aggregating US$82 million.
1.07      The first three loans were made at a time when UTE was fairly well
managed and in a reasonably strong financial situation. Subsequently, the
enterprise's staff and finances, as well as the physical adequacy of its
installations, deteriorated markedly. This deterioration was attributable
to poor management as well as to interference and control of UTE's operations
by various Government departments. As a result, UTE's performance declined,
rate levels became inadequate, and experienced staff abandoned the company
because of low salaries and lack of other incentives. In 1970, an external
consultant, Mr. R. Salazar (General Manager of the Empresa Nacional de
Electricidad S.A., of Chile), was made available by the Bank and made a
set of recommendations which were substantially accepted by UTE and by the
Government. On this basis, the Bank agreed to appraise the fourth power
project.
1.08      The fourth power project consisted of a 100 MW steam unit (later
increased to 125 MW at UTE's request) at UTE's Battle y Ordonez plant in
Montevideo, rehabilitation of the utility's distribution network, reorganiza-
tion of its financial functions and preparation of a sector expansion program.
The Project Performance Audit Report for the Fourth Power Project (SecM78-867
of November 29, 1978) indicates that progress towards meeting the institutional
objectives the Bauk hi;&  Then making the loan was slow and generally disappoint-
ing. It also makes the point that UTE did not comply with some of the loan
covenants. With the exception of the installation of 65% of low voltage
overhead conductors and 42% of electric meters (not financed by the loan) for



-3 -
the rehabilitation of the distribution network, the project has been completed.
Its most important physical component (the steam unit, accounting for about
65% of the original project cost estimate) was commissioned 18 months behind
schedule, with a cost overrun of 141%. The overrun and delays are attrLbut-
able to: increased unit size, sharp increases in world prices for equipment
subsequent to appraisal, a longer than expected construction period, labor
problems in Italy which slowed down the manufacture of the equipment and
delays in procurement because of cumbersome legal procedures within Uruguay.
While performance on the execution of the physical components of the fourth
project was poor, the most disappointing aspect of the project was the failure
of UTE and the Government to take action to arrest UTE's managerial and
financial deterioration. The project's implementation coincided with a
period of severe social conflict and general economic dislocation, from
which the country only started recovering after 1975. The Government was
reluctant to attempt to strengthen UTE, and when it decided to undertake
Palmar, it set up COMIPAL as a special purpose authority to carry out the
project.
1.09      To provide a focus for discussion of further Bank support of the
power sector, in mid 1976 a consultant (Mr. R. V. Sear) carried out a review.
His report 1/ recommended a program of measures to strengthen the power
sector and improve UTE's performance:
(a) Provision to UTE's Board of Directors of clearly defined
duties and responsibilities for policy making.
(b)  Definition of the management responsibility of the Chief
Executive Officer.
(c) Authorization of tariff adjustments to achieve a satisfac-
tory rate of return.
(d) Authorization of competitive salary levels.
(e) Preparation of an Electricity Law and associated regulations
and statutes for UTE.
(f) Effective separation of UTE and ANTEL. 2/
(g) Settlement of debts between public entities, UTE, and the
Government.
(h) Creation of a credit line for UTE.
(i) Completion of contractual arrangements for interconnection
with Argentina.

The Uruguayan Government indicated its acceptance of this program and initi-
ated action on the first five items listed above.  On thaLt assurance, the
Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) decided to proceed with
a power transmission and distribution project.  UT'E's transmission and dis-
tribution programs were evaluated in a study 1/ carried out by external consul-
tants (Electroconsult - ELC - of Italy) under terms of refeZrence previously
discussed with the Bank and with IDB, and acceptable to both institutions.
The Bank sent a mission to appraise the 1978-81 distribution program in
October 1977 and the IDB appraised the transmission program shortly thereafter.
1.10      In view of the lessons learned under LoaLn 712-]UR, the Bank and IDB
conducted an intensive dialogue with the Government and UTE on the measures
required to improve the latter's performance. Subsequent to appraisal,
it proved impossible to reach agreement with the Uruguayan authorities on the
scope of the changes needed in UTE's management structure. It was agreed
instead to resume the discussion once the management studLy included in the
project (2.02) is completed.  The Bank project would be limited to the first
two years of UTE's distribution program. Subject to UTE's performance in
implementing the first portion of the program, the Bank agreed to consider
financing the latter portion through a subsequent loan.  Further delays
occurred, however, because of UTE's slowness in issuing calls for the various
consulting services required for the project and the dif'f'iculty in reaching
agreement with the Government on the text of the regulations to the Electricity
Law. These matters were finally resolved in April 1979 and. the project was
reappraised in the following month.2/
Sector Organization and Regulation
1.11      Most of Uruguay's energy sector, in line with Goovlernment policy
generally, is state controlled. Apart from the Ministry of' Industry and
Energy, the most important bodies are ANCAP, the power companies (1.12), some
private companies involved in oil exploration and distribution, and a private
gas company. The government-owned bodies dominate the se!ctor. The Government
also intends to establish an energy advisory body drawn frcm the Ministry of
Industry, ANCAP, and UTE. Uruguay's electric power policy is determined by
the Executive Power which also supervises the sector through the Ministry of
Industry and Energy. Electricity rates dire approved by Pre-sidential decree,
and the Ministry of Industry and Energy, the Ministry of' Economy and Finances,
and the Secretariat of Planning, Coordination and Information (SEPLACODI)
intervene in their determination, with primary decision-making powers vested in
the latter. UTE is organized as an autonomous public entity (its Board of
Directors is appointed by the Executive Power) but: in effect Government
agencies' general prerogatives impose legal and administrative constraints on
its everyday operations.  UTE's budget is approvecl by SEPI'L!CODI and this
budget places a legal ceiling on investments and expenditures. The government
auditing agency (the Tribunal de Cuentas) is responsible fcr ensuring that UTE
complies with budget and other legislation.

1.12      In addition to UTE, which is responsible for power generation,
transmission and distribution throughout the country, Uruguay's power sector
includes CTM and COMIPAL. CTM was created in 1946, and is an international
organization governed by a Board composed by four Argentine and four Uruguayan
members, all appointed by the respective Governments. CTM is constructing,
and will operate Salto Grande. COMIPAL was created in 1973 to build the
Palmar hydro plant; it is governed by a Board with representatives from the
three armed forces, from the Ministry of Industry and Energy, from the Ministry
of Economy and Finance and from SEPLACODI.
1.13      Until 1977, Uruguay did not have an electricity law.  As a result,
several aspects pertaining to the organization and regulation of the sector
were not defined, which caused uncertainty and inefficiency. In September
1977, after more than a year of study and negotiation, an electricity law
was passed which has the following features:
(a)  It covers all activities in the sector.
(b)  It establishes the Executive Power's policy, regulatory
and control functions over the sector.
(c)  It defines UTE's primary role in the sector, but allows
the presence of other local utilities.
(d)  It creates a National Load Dispatch center, to be operated
by UTE.
(e)  It defines UTE's responsibilities vis-a-vis the municipal-
ities and private consumers.
1.14      The regulations to the law were approved in June 1979, and cover
such matters as: concession regime, arrangements between UTE and munici-
palities for assignment of regulatory and supervisory functions, reimburse-
ment procedures for customer contributions and, most importantly, the tariff
regime. The Bank was given the opportunity to express its opinion on the
various drafts of the law and of its regulations, and its major comments were
taken into account in the version finally approved.
1.15      This new legal framework represents a positive step forward, and
evidences the Government's commitment to improve sector performance. UTE's
leading role in the sector is maintained in the law, which grants it the right
of first refusal for any electricity expansions proposed. Any new electric
companies to be formed under the new law will therefore be small local enter-
prises, serving areas which UTE cannot supply economically.
1.16      To accommodate to these legal changes, UTE's by-laws are also being
modified (2.02/03).  It is expected that these changes will permit a more
efficient and dynamic administration. Thus, the basic conditions will be set
for an improvement in UTE's operations. As noted in Chapter 2, however, very
serious management problems remain and important actions are required for a
meaningful improvement in UTE's performance. Solutions to these problems
would be identified by the management study included in the proposed project
(2.02). This study is one of the most important aspects of the Project and

UTE has already engaged consultants to carry it out (ICSA'- Spain). Imple-
mentation of solutions, however, will require sustained efforts on the
part of the Government and UTE over at least the next five years. Should
such efforts be forthcoming, they would justify continued support for UTE
from the international lending organizations.
The Role of the Sector in the Economy
1.17      The energy sector has played a key role in Uruguay's economy, as
evidenced by the following:
(a) In the recent past investments in generating capacity did
not keep up with the pace of growth of demand. This re-
quired constraining demand through rationing, with conse-
quent negative effects on output and on welfare.
(b) The 1973 oil price rise had a momentous effect. In 1974, the
value of petroleum imports rose by over US$100 million (within
total imports of less than US$300million) and this created a
very serious balance of payments problem. To meet it, gasoline
prices were raised more than required to cover input cost
and fuel oil prices to UTE to about international levels
(US$378/t for residual oil or US$10.50/bbl in early 1978).
Electricity rates, however, were not raised commensurately.
1.18      Since 1971, investment in the sector has increased markedly, largely
due to the Salto Grande and Palmar hydroelectric projects. However, invest-
ments in transmission and distribution have lagged. The proposed 1980-83
investment program would raise the investments to adequate levels in order to
expand transmission and distribution facilities commensurately with the increase
in power requirements and generating capabilities of Salto Grande and Palmar.
Supply and Demand of Electricity

have developed in this decade (Annex 3-1).

The sales growth rate was very low through 1974 reflecting the political and
economic difficulties encountered during the period. For the period 1971-78
it averaged 4.1%.
Power Sector Facilities and Service Levels
1.20      Under normal hydrological conditions, about half of UTE generation
is thermal. The generating plant at the end of 1977 had the following features

The Rio Negro flow is highly variable, e.g., 48 km  in 1914 but only 1.8 dm
in 1917; from September 1942 tVrough July 1946 flow totalled only 10.8 km
and within this period 0.24 km only was registered from December 1944 through
July 1945. Thus, relatively high thermal reserves are required to meet occa-
sional long dry periods.
1.21      Until the commissioning of the Bank financed 125 MW thermal unit in
mid 1975, UTE was not always able to meet the demand for electricity and,
consequently, had to ration supply. In May 1979 UTE again experienced supply
difficulties in Montevideo as a result of a transmission cable failure and of
problems this failure sgbsequently caused to the Battle fifth unit, which re-
quired its overhaul, together with low rainfall which reduced hydro generation.
Supply was restricted in various ways: lowering of voltage and frequency,
limiting the use of electricity for heating purposes, prohibiting use of general
and commercial lighting, changes of work hours for offices, rotating programs
for interrupting supply to defined areas, etc. UTE has a well defined standby
program (which is instituted through Government decrees and instructions) to
mitigate the effect of dry periods. The Salto Grande and Palmar additions



-8-
would suffice to adequately meet demand growth and provide a reasonable reserve
capacity in the early eighties. However, because of the unstable nature of the
Rio Negro and Rio Uruguay's hydrology, it is necessary to determine whether
additional thermal back-up may be required, as early as 1984 (1.30).
1.22      About 95% of UTE's generation is in the interconnected system;
the remainder is generated by isolated diesel power stations. Transmission
lines are at 110 and 150 kV, and this duality is creating some standardiza-
tion problems. The development program envisages to convert all circuits in
the East to 150 kV, while in the West only a single 110 kV line would
continue operation with limited expansion (using equipment liberated in the
East). Distribution is generally of the European type (3 phase, 50 Hz), at
intermediate voltages of 60 kV, 30 kV and 6 kV, and low voltage at 3 x 220 V.
Here, some of the main problems faced are the following: network obsolescenu-'o
low reserves and inadequate service in many substations and inadequate reli-
ability of service (particularly to such important consumers as the principal
airport and key industries) and high losses. Existing L.V. lines are at 3 x
220 V (without neutral), resulting in high losses and limited capacity;
expansion and renewals (whenever possible) would be at 380/220 V-4 wire.
1.23      Access to electric service in Uruguay is, on the whole, quite good.
About 664,000 homes are connected to UTE, and the electrification index 1/ is
about 0.80  (over 0.95 in Montevideo and 0.65 in the rest of the country).  At
present, only one town with more than 1,000 inhabitants, 20 population centers
with between 500 and 1,000 inhabitants and about 100 with between 200 and 500
inhabitants lack electricity. Thus, the main objective to be pursued by UTE
is not primarily accelerating access to service but, rather, renovating its
obsolete installations to improve the quality of its service as well as to
integrate hitherto independent systems to the interconnected network to save
fuel and create a basis for further expansion. This is the main technical
problem to which the project is addressed.
Tariffs and Rates
1.24      UTE tariff structure is simple and has not been basically revised
since loan 712-UR was made in 1970.  The rates do not del)e"tld either on the
season, the day of the week or the time of the day and are applicable through-
out the country irrespective of voltage level, distance or type of generation.
For domestic, industrial and commercial tariffs they comprise a monthly demand
block charge (tied to the kWh blocks) increasing with increased usage; the
kWh charge is in blocks, increasing with the next higher block for domestic
purposes, declining for normal industry and constant for process industry
and commerce. For traction, pumping and public services (schools, printing,
radio, theaters) only a kWh charge applies.
1/   Households served by UTE divided by total households.



1.25      Rate adjustments have tended to lag behind yearly inflation (5.02);
for 1972-78, the developments were the following:
--- Average Rates ---
ctvs/kWh
at current       ctvs/kWh          in US mills
Year    prices /a    at 1978 prices b/    per kWh

1973        3.24            34.60              38.57
1974        5.64            32.70              47.15
1975        9.86            23.16              43.63
1976       15.33           34.24               45.90
1977       23.59            35.04              50.41
1978       30.76           30.76               50.76
/a   Slight differences compared with the income statements are due to
different allocations of fixed charges and claim fees. Rates
shown are price to consumer, inclusive of energy tax (10%). In 1979
rates were increased by 17.5% on May 1 and by 34% on August 1.
/b   Inflated by the wholesale price index.
Throughout the period, rates did not reflect the increased cost of supply,
taking into account the considerable international price increases for
equipment since 1972 and the 1973 oil price rise.
1.26      UTE's tariff structure does not give an adequate message to the
consumers, it has caused a proliferation of electric room and water heating
which under adverse circumstances may represent some 25-30% (150 MW in 1977)
of peak demand (523 MW). In order to lay a basis for future improvements,
UTE has agreed to carry out a study of its tariff structure based on the
marginal cost of supply, with the assistance of consultants engaged under
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The development study (1.31)
to be undertaken under the present project, should provide an adequate data
base for the tariff study. At negotiations UTE agreed to implement, per an
agreed timetable, a load measurement program to serve as an additional data
input to the tariff study. The tariff study should be completed by June 30,
1981 and in consultation with the Bank, its recommendations put into effect
by June 30, 1982.
Power Sector Development Program
1.27      The program for generating facilities envisages that the first 135 MW
Salto Grande unit for Uruguay would be commissioned in 1979 1/ and the second in
early 1980. CTM will also construct the following transmission works, which
will become part of the Uruguayan interconnected system, owned and operated by
UTE (see Map):
1/   As of October 1979 one unit had been placed in operation, and the second
one was scheduled towards year-end.



- 10-
(a)  500 kV transmission single circuit lines with al total
length of 440 km (one line Javier-Palmar; two lines
Palmar-Montevideo).
(b) Substations at Palmar and Montevideo (2).
The line Salto Grande-Javier would be owned and operated by CTM as well as the
substations at Salto Grande and Javier (which will be the interconnecting
points with Argentina). The first 100 MW Palmar Unit would enter service in
1982. Due to interconnection of the major part of presently isolated systems,
diesel capacity would decrease from 60 MW at present to about 25 MW in 1983.
In order to transmit and distribute the power generated by Salto Grande and
Palmar, UTE plans to undertake the investment program described in 4.01-4.07.
1.28      The Salto Grande works are being financed by IDB, suppliers, and
by the Governments of Argentina and Uruguay. The Palmar Project is being
financed by Banco do Brasil, a syndicate managed by Banque de l'Union Europeene,
Banque de l'Indochine et de Suez and Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur
and by the Government, which, for this purpose, has floated a US$100 million
bond issue through a syndicate led by Citicorp Internationial. The Government's
contribution to both Salto Grande and Palmar is also der:Lved from the National
Energy Fund which obtains its revenues from a 10% tax on electricity sales
and from participation on the petroleum products tax (with rates up to 102%
on gasoline prices).  At negotiations, the Government agreed to furnish to the
Bank, by December 31, 1979, a satisfactory program for meeting power sector
financing requirements through 1983. The program would consider the possibility
of raising charges to final consumers, through increases in the energy tax,
which could be used to finance the completion of Palmar. The Government also
agreed to examine the costs and financing schemes of the projects being executed
outside UTE and to furnish to the Bank a report by December 31, 1979.
1.29      The generation program, as shown in the balances of energies and
capacities (Annex 1), is summarized as follows:
Installed Generating Capacity
1976           1980           1983
Type                    MW     %       MW      %      MW      %
Hydro                        236   36       396     48    806      68
Steam                        333   50      333      41    333      28
Gas turbines                  30    5        30      4      30       2
Diesel (Isolated)             60    9        60      7      25       2
659  100      819    100  1,L94    100
1.30      The change in composition of the capacity is striking, hydro plants
would increase from the present 36% of the total to 68% by 1983, steam plant
decreasing from 50% to 28% during the same period.  It is expected, however,
in view of the erratic hydrology of the Rio Negro (on which all of UTE's hydro
stations including Palmar are located) and of the Rio Uruguay (Salto Grande),
that further thermal plant may be required in 1985. Undeveloped hydro poten-
tials in Uruguay are small (restricted to the Rio Negro and its tributaries,
not exceeding 150-200 MW) and after completion of Salto Grande and Palmar,
UTE's investments in generating plant would mainly be thermal.



- 11-
1.31      Under the arrangements with Argentina for the construction of
Salto Grande (1.03), the Uruguayan Government has the right to gradually
exercise the option to acquire additional units, reaching, by 1995, 50% of
total capacity. 1/ Because in any case further thermal plant will be required
in Uruguay to meet dry water year conditions (although the timing is still to
be ascertained), the alternatives in generating facilities comprise acquisition
of further units at Salto Grande (which could be deferred by 1 or 2 years),
imports from Argentina, installation of additional gas turbines and an addi-
tional steam plant. A study of the least-cost power sector development
program, through the year 2000, resulting in the optimum timing of additional
thermal plant, will be undertaken. UTE has already engaged consultants--
(Lahmeyer, -Germany-) under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, and
has agreed to cause the study to be completed by September 30, 1980.
1/   Total cost of the Salto Grande project is presently estimated at US$1,243
million. Annual debt service and O&M costs for the 14 units will be close
to US$100 million per year, and will be distributed between Argentina and
Uruguay in proportion to the number of units operated for each country.



- 12-
2. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
2.01      The Borrower of the proposed loan would be Administracion Nacional
de Usinas y Trasmisiones Electricas (UTE), a quasi autonolmoujs entity of the
Uruguayan Government. UTE was founded in 1912 (under the name Administracion
General de las Usinas del Estado) and assigned the responsibility for public
power supply. In 1931, the telephone service was added to its activities. In
1974, the Government established a new telecommunications administration,
Administracion Nacional de Telecommunicaciones (ANTEL), lwhich took over UTE's
telecommunications operations. At present UTE and ANTEL are in the process of
separating. A complete schedule for the further steps required to finalize
this separation and commercial arrangements to be entered into were agreed
on during negotiations.
2.02      Due to its legal structure as an autonomous entity, UTE's bylaws
(Carta Organica) have to approved by law and its regulations (reglamentacion) by
Presidential decree. Both are being amended to conform to the new Electricity
Law (1.13) and allow a more flexible and efficient administration. 1/ Under the
projected new legal structure, UTE would continue to be governed by a full-time
3-member Board of Directors; UTE's President, however, will act as Chief
Executive Officer. The bylaws, as amended in agreement with the Bank, would
establish a distinction between matters of policy (including organizational
set-up, issue of internal regulations, approval of annual budget and develop-
ment program) which would be referred to the Board, and major operational
decisions, which would be the responsibility of the President. It is expected
that the President will continue to be a political appointee but the bylaws
would provide for a General Manager who would be an experienced executive, to
whom the everyday running of operations would be delegated. However, such a
division of responsibilities can only emerge over time, since UTE does not
presently have staff qualified to make it function effectively. 2/ To help UTE
achieve this objective, the proposed loan would finance the consultant services
for a management study; this study would cover all aspects of UTE's organiza-
tion, policies and procedures and the implementation of all agreed actions to
be taken. UTE has already engaged these consultants. The study should be
completed by September 30, 1980, at which time it would be submitted to the
Benk for discussion, together with a program to implement the recommendations
with the consultants' assistance.  Prompt action on the mleasures agreed upon
would be a prerequisite for further Bank financing, in the sector.
2.03      Enactment of bylaws, and of regulations to the bylaws, acceptable
to the Bank would be a condition of effectiveness.
2.04      UTE's organization chart is shown in Annex 2.  Until the recent
creation of a Planning Unit, UTE's organization lacked provision for overall
planning and budgeting. Each technical department has its own planning,
design and cost estimating group. For budgeting purposes, the finance
1/   The draft bylaws are currently being considered by the Consejo de Estado.
2/   The problem is complicated by the assignment of military "interventores"
to run certain UTE departments, who operate outside the regular organi-
zational structure.



- 13-
division collects the individual informations and consolidates them. Project
consultants, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, have already
been engaged (Electroconsult, Italy). Their services comprise the necessary
manpower for organizing and staffing, together with available UTE staff a
special Project Unit within UTE (responsible for both the IDB and Bank projects)
which shall coordinate and assist in matters of preparation and issuance of
bids documents, evaluation of bids and making recommendations for the awards,
and shall be responsible for the preparation of execution schedules and super-
vision of construction and for the reporting thereon. This unit will consti-
tute the basis of a central Planning and Supervision Department, responsible
for all works to be executed by UTE.
Staffing
2.05      UTE presently employs about 9,700 people (including 70% of the
550 employees of the services still common for UTE and ANTEL) representing
1 employee per 81 consumers (about 790,000, of which 48% in the interior).
This is high and it appears that considerable improvement in the efficient
use of manpower could be made. Two aspects, however, have to be taken into
account in evaluating the above monitoring indicator: (a) due to lack of
contractors and technically adequate local workshops, UTE itself executes
most of its works, thus increasing the need for artisans considerably (for
instance, at least some 200 people are employed for manufacturing replace-
ment parts alone); (b) the systems in the interior are wide apart and have
to be largely self supporting in all respects. A tentative estimate indi-
cates that the number of consumers in Montevideo may be a more reasonable 150
per employee (although allocation of personnel serving both Montevideo and the
Interior is rather subjective). However, there are areas, particularly in
UTE's administrative organization, which are evidently overstaffed and the
management study would suggest ways to make better use of manpower.
2.06      As of December 1978 UTE had 160 professionals on its payroll (i.e.
1.6% of its total number of employees including 11 working in supporting serv-
ices common to both UTE and ANTEL). About 100 professionals are graduate
engineers, about one third of which are young professionals; technical
expertise in the entity, therefore, constitutes presently only 0.7% of the
work force.
2.07      Over more than a decade Uruguay has been experiencing a brain-drain,
due to low salaries and limited opportunities offered to its generally well
qualified professionals. This has been even more true in the public sector.
In UTE's case, the problem was compounded by CTM and COMIPAL's competition for
qualified manpower.  While the output of the universities practically dropped
to zero during several years of unrest, both CTM and COMIPAL have been able to
pay substantially higher salaries than UTE, thus drawing away many of its more
capable professionals.
2.08      Over the past two years UTE has taken some steps to modify this
situation. Salaries of key personnel have been increased, in some cases by as
much as 100% (over and above cost of living increases, periodically granted to
all public sector employees), and there is a commitment, supported by the
Government, to continue in this direction. UTE and the Government have agreed
too that the external auditors prepare a salary study to be submitted to the
Bank by June 30, 1980, to be followed by a program for the implementation of
its recommendations. This commitment is reflected in the loan documents, which
require UTE to start implementation of the agreed proposals by January 1, 1981.



- 14-
2.09      Despite the progress discussed above, UTEI still faces a serious
staffing problem. The management study (2.02) would evaluate UTE's staffing
needs at all management and professional levels, outline the policies necessary
to recruit and train the personnel required, and develop an adequate remunera-
tion scheme. At negotiations, UTE agreed that, until the study is completed,
it will proceed with a recruitment plan, which sets the following targets:
October 1, 1979 -   April 1, 1980 -    October 1, 1980 -

2.10      Training at higher levels is totally absient in 1JTE (which is not
surprising given the shortage of staff at these levels). The training pro-
gram for lower echelons, which appears reasonably adequate, comprises courses
for basic electricity theory and practices (duration 120 hours), welding (70
h), basic industrial electronics (120 h), interior wirin,g practices (180 h),
interior wiring execution (120 h), general administration (40 h), supervi-
sion practices (30 h), metering equipment and mounting (210 h), and overhead
line construction (190 h).  The total number of people that received training
during 1978 was 364 (representing a total of 47,100 staff-hours). UTE has
agreed to engage a suitably qualified training expert acceptable to the Bank,
and on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank by April 30, 1980. This
expert, recommended by a vocational training mission in late 1977, would be
financed by the recently approved vocational training loan (1594-UR). He
should evaluate UTE's present training program and develop a comprehensive
training program for UTE (including, if necessary, scholarships abroad). UTE
has agreed to discuss with the Bank the program and its proposals for
implementation by November 30, 1980.
Accounting
2.11      UTE's management problems affected its financial administration and
performance as well as the timing and quality of its financial statements.
In early 1977, a new computer system was installed and this allowed the revi-
sion of the accounting code, as well as the gradual development of improved
information subsystems. These tasks were accomplished with the assistance
of consultants (Arthur Young & Co.) under Loan 712-UR. The updating of UTE's
information system has not yet been completed; the next stages would include
the preparation of quarterly income statements and the processing of cost
information by responsibility centers. During negotiations, it was agreed
that the external auditors should assist UTE in these areas (2.13).



- 15-
Auditing
2.12      UTE's accounts are supposed to be audited by a specialized govern-
ment agency, the Tribunal de Cuentas de la Nacion. Because such audit does
not meet the requirements of the Bank, under the fourth power project loan
agreement, UTE agreed to engage independent auditors satisfactory to the
Bank, which provision should be repeated for the proposed loan. Due to
the reorganization of its accounts and delays experienced in producing the
accounting statements, UTE has until now not been able to fulfill this obliga-
tion. The lack of an appropriate external audit has significantly affected
the reliability and comparability of UTE's financial statements, to the
point that at present these are by and large ignored by both management and
Government for decision making. Because this situation must be remedied, at
negotiations UTE agreed to engage external auditors, under terms of reference
(see also 2.13) earlier agreed with the Bank, prior to loan effectiveness. 1/
Initially, the auditors should review the 1978 and 1979 financial statements,
and submit a report with their conclusions and recommendations. As from
FY 1980, audited financial statements should be submitted within five months
of year end.
2.13      For similar reasons to those discussed above, the internal auditing
unit recently created by UTE should be organized and staffed at the earliest.
In order to avoid duplication, the external auditors would assist UTE with
this task. It has been agreed that the external auditors will submit a program,
which by December 31, 1980, UTE would transmit to the Bank together with its own
proposals, for the timely preparation of quarterly income statements and cost
data by responsibility centers, to monitor performance and provide adequate
management information, as well as for the organization and staffing of the
internal auditing unit discussed above.
Insurance
2.14      UTE's assets have not been adequately insured, despite standard Bank
requirements to that effect in the 712-UR loan agreement. UTE has now agreed to
obtain adequate external insurance for major risks and to self-insure against
risks which are amenable to such treatment starting on January 1, 1980. UTE and
the Government have also agreed with the Bank on the details of a self insurance
fund (premiums for which would be charged to operating expenses) and the Govern-
ment has also agreed to guarantee any losses not covered by insurance or self-
insurance.
Dam Safety
2.15      The Bank loan 152-UR financed the Baygorria hydro project, which
has been in operation satisfactorily since 1960. No requirements for monitor-
ing of dams have been included in previous loans to UTE, but the company
regularly inspected all facilities. Recently, UTE has signed a contract with
SOFRELEC (France) for a study of its present practices and recommendations
for modernizing them. The standard undertaking for monitoring the soundness
of dams is included in the loan agreement for the proposed project.
1/   UTE's Board has already awarded the contract to Price Waterhouse, however
due to administrative approval requirements, signature may be delayed until
January 1980.

3. THE POWER MARKET
The Energy Market
3.01      Supply data is available for the main commercial sources of
energy over many years but little is known on the demand for energy.
The most notable development in the petroleum sector has been a decline
in gasoline use after prices were raised substantially in the wake of
the 1973-74 petroleum price increase. This decline appears to have
been partly offset by increased diesel fuel consumption. In the
electricity subsector an analysis is available between domestic,
commercial and industrial sales but no such breakdown is available for
oil products. Neither is there any analysis of energy used for trans-
port, process loads, heating, cooking and lighting, nor a sectorial
analysis of industrial use. This lack of data restricts demand forecasts
to projections of trends and aggregate GDP relationships, and provides
no firm basis for planning.
3.02      The supply of energy has been as follows (in thousands of cubic
meters):

Power Market History
3.03      Statistics on the past evolution of the power market are not
available because data on the energy generated by captive industrial
plant are not collected regularly.  The last census was made in 1968,



- 17 -
when demand was suppressed and captive plant generated 62 GWh (compared
with total sales to industry of 591 GWh and total sales to all consumers
of 1513 GWh, i.e., auto production was 4% of total sales). Most
captive plants have been installed to assure continuation of generation
during years of restrictions, 6 since 1960 (3.04).
3.04      UTE's overall power data (Annex 1) since 1960 are summarized as
follows:
Average Growth (%)
1960     1970      1978    1960-70  190-78
Generation (GWh) /a           1,244    2,160    2,959         5.7       4.0
Maximum demand (MW) /b           250      402       548       4.9       3.9
Sales, total                  1,017    1,727    2,405         5.4       4.2
Industrial (%)                   47        32        37
Residential (Z)                   39       48        44

Others (%)                         6        4       - 4
Losses (%) /c                     18       20        19
/a   Including some imports, mainly fron Brazil.
/b   Interconnected system only.
/c   Including UTE consumption (82.5 GWh in 1978).
The pattern of supply to the various consumer groups changed considerably over
1960-1978. The share of industry in the market decreased from 47% in 1960
to 37% in 1978 (the minimum share of 32% was reached in 1970). Residential
supply increased from 39% in 1960 to 46% in 1965, remaining relatively level
utnti,  thne present.  Except for industry, the growth rate for this decade
decreased considerably compared with the sixties. The difference in the
growth pattern of generation and sales compared with maximum demand appears to
be due to rationing in 1965, 1968, 1970, 1972, 1974 and 1975 (two of which
were also dry years--with less than 1,000 GWh hydro generation--of which there
were four during 1960-76).
3.05      Losses remaiaed relatively constant throughout the period at some
19-20%. This is high but it is not known whether thefts are a substantive
part of these losses; this appears unlikely in view of the fact that losses
varied little from year to year (1972 and 1973 are the only exceptions).
Technical inadequacies may be the main reasons: Montevideo's intermediate
voltages are relatively low at 30 kV and 6 kV, many of the 30-kV and 6-kV
underground cables are old and overloaded (forced outages in 30 kV cables
is about 0.15/km.a and in 6 kV cables about 0.2/km.a, both about 2 times
normal), while distribution is at 3 x 220 V, i.e. non-balanced 2-phase
220-V loads, cause heavier losses due to the lack of the neutral conductor
which effecttvely adds up to 33% to the cross section of the phase conductors.



- 18 -
Although renewals are envisioned, losses should not be expected to decline
materially, particularly because renovations and a change to 380/220 V
4-wire system in Montevideo (which could reduce losses to a more reasonable
level of some 15%) will take many years. To enable it to tackle this problem,
at negotiations UTE agreed to present to the Bank by December 31, 1980 a
report on the nature, size and occurrence of losses in tbhe system, and also
terms of reference for a comprehensive study of losses, to develop recom-
mendations for reduction of losses by means of a long-termt program of
technical improvements.
Forecasts
3.06      In view of the erratic development of sales and the importance of
the effect of external circumstances of political, economical and technical
(repeated restrictions) nature, historic power data are of little use for
the preparation of forecasts unless a persistent low growth rate appears
probable. ELC included GDP in their two forecasting models, either as a
multiplier (exponential trend model) or as a separate term (adaptive model).
Both models represent historic data well. For forecasting purposes a GDP
growth in real terms of 3% was assumed which, though somewhat conservative 1/
is reasonable for the medium-term. The first model results in an average
sales growth rate of 5.2%, the second gives 6.1%. Taking into account historic
trends for the various consumer classes and regional differences, and adding
several larger future connections (e.g. 2 cement factories and a steel product
factory) further elaboration of the models indicate that the trend model is
adequate to be used for overall forecasting and an average sales growth rate
of 5.8% was assumed for the period through 1983.
Energy and Capacity Balance
3.07      ELC's forecasts, 2/ which appear reasonable, are shown in Annex 1
(Energy and Capacity Balance) together with generation capabilities and plant
capacities. The information is summarized as follows:
1/   The Bank expects that GDP could achieve a 4.5% growth rate during
the coming years - Economic Memorandum on Uruguay (Report No.
2241-UR, December 1978).
2/   Updated in May 1979.

3.08      The above table shows that by 1983 sales to industry would be
about equal to domestic sales.  UTE has signed an interconnection contract
with Agua y Energia Electrica of Argentina, which would provide some 60 MW in
additional reserve capacity. This contract provides for the construction of
a 37 km long 150-kV line between Paysandu in Uruguay and Concepcion del
Uruguay in Argentina, crossing the Uruguay River. Contracts have already been
awarded and the line is expected to be operational towards the end of 1979.

4. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Development Program
4.01      UTE's development program for 1980-83 is estimated to cost about
US$324 million equivalent, including physical and price contingencies but
excluding interest during construction. It is designed to meet the fore-
cast load and demand increases and is based on the technical recommenda-
tions of ELC (1.09). Details of the program are shown in Annex 4-1 which
is summarized here as follows (in US$ million):
Local   Foreign   Total
-----------MUS$--------
Generation         11.1      25.2      36.3        11
Transmission       35.0      67.6     102.6        32
Distribution       80.1      78.3     158.4        49
Other              13.6      12.5      26.1         8
139.9    183.6      323.5       100
4.02      The bulk of the program is in Transmission and Distribution.  This
arises from the conditions currently obtaining in Uruguay, where two large
hydro projects and related bulk transmission are nearing completion under
the responsibility of special-purpose authorities (1.27). These investments,
which are not included in UTE's program, will provide additional generating
capacity for the next few years, and the expansion of the transmission and
distribution systems is needed to make efficient use of this power, in addition
to the need for rehabilitation and up-grading of existing systems (1.22).
Generation
4.03      Generation investment consists mainly of some buildings and fuel
tanks for thermal stations, spares for thermal and hydro stations, and repairs
and replacements. It does not include possible expenditures for a future
thermal plant which may be needed for firming up hydropower at times of water
shortage, a matter which will have to await the outcome of the 1980-2000
development planning report (1.31) for which consultants are about to be
engaged. To include any estimates for such thermal plant in the 1978-83
development program would be premature since various alternatives, such as
possibility of new hydro storage sites (currently under investigation) and
availability of capacity from Salto Grande, on the Rio Uruguay that has a
hydrology different from the Rio Negro on which the other hydro stations are
located, have yet to be evaluated.



- 21 -
Transmission
4.04      Transmission investment is mainly for construction of 150 kV trans-
mission lines and related substations. The major portion of this work consists
of the following:
(a) 200 km line from G. Terra via Tacuarembo to Rivera (this line
is currently under construction, for completion in 1981);
(b) 200 km line from G. Terra via Valentines to Treinta Y Tres;
(c) 230 km line from Salto Grande via Arapey and Bella Union to
Artigas; and
(d) Load Dispatch Center (bids have been invited on the basis of
specifications prepared with the assistance of consultants
engaged in consultation with the Bank).
IDB is considering financing a significant part of the transmission works, in-
cluding the load dispatch center, and has been cooperating closely with the
Bank in project preparation and appraisal. 1/ IDB appraised the transmission
project shortly after the Bank's initial appraisal of the proposed Fifth Project,
and had held the project in abeyance pending resolution of the issues discussed
in 1.10. IDB reappraised the project in September 1979. Because the Fifth
Project's distribution facilities are complementary to those provided under the
IDB project, signature of the IDB loan has been agreed as a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
Distribution
4.05      The distribution investment program provides for expansion and re-
habilitation of existing distribution systems that are mainly underground in
Montevideo, and overhead in the interior. Existing voltage levels of 60, 30,
15 and 6 kV are adequate since load densities are not very high, and urban
development is modest. In Montevideo, about 60 km of 30 kV and 150 km of 6-kV
and 150 km of low tension (L.T.) underground cables will be needed, in addition
to transformers and substations and overhead line materials. The main technical
objective is to rehabilitate the aging system to a 4-wire 220/380 V system,
which will reduce losses and increase capacity (1.22).
4.06      For distribution work in the interior, there will be a need for
800 km of 60 and 30-kV overhead lines, 500 km of 15 and 6 kV lines, 300 km of
L.T. lines, and 70 kmn of underground cables, in addition to transformers and
substations and various other equipment. The primary technical objective is
the replacement of about two-thirds of the existing isolated diesel capacity
by linking local systems with the interconnected system.
1/   The IDB loan amount is presently scheduled at US$24 million.  The financial
projections assume a loan of US$31.5 million and the Government has informed
the Bank that this shortfall will be financed through foreign commercial
bank loans to the Central Bank, to be onlent to UTE under terms substantially
similar to those of the proposed IDB loan.



- 22 -
4.07      The development program also provides for consultants' services
which are considered necessary to overcome UTE's institutional and organiza-
tional shortcomings and lack of expert staff.
The Project
4.08      The proposed Fifth Project would consist in the distribution devel-
opment program for the years 1980-81. It is expected that a Sixth Power
Project, similar to the Fifth Project, would cover investments in 1982-83,
subject to satisfactory performance up to that time. The proposed IDB trans-
mission project would overlap in time with both IBRD projects. The proposed
Fifth Project would include:
(a) Montevideo Distribution. Renovation and expansion of the
distribution networks in Montevideo, including approximately
the following principal quantities:
(i)  36 km of 30-kV underground cables;
87 km of 6-kV underground cables; and
87 km of L.T. underground cables.
(ii) 4 new substations and 2 extensions, with a transformer
capacity of about 80 MVA at 30/6 kV.
(iii) 50 km of bare conductor;
700 km of insulated conductor; and
200 transformer stations with a capacity of about 50 MVA.
(b)  Interior Distribution.  Renovation and expansion of the
distribution networks, mainly in Treinta y Tres, Valentines,
Tacuarembo, Rivera, Rocha, and Chuy, including approximately
the following principal quantities:
(i)  230 km of 60-kV overhead lines;
230 km of 30-kV overhead lines;
290 km of 15 and 6-kV overhead lines;
170 km of L.T. overhead lines; and
40 km of 30, 15 and 6-kV underground cables.
(ii) 5 substations at 60/15/6 kV with about 34 MVA
transforming capacity; and
12 substations at 30/15 and 30/6 kV with about 62 MVA
transformer capacity.
(iii) 230 transformer stations with a capacity of about 25 MVA.
(iv) 10 MVA of capacitors for 6 kV.
(c) Consultants' Services. The services of consultants for:
(i) the organization, direction and staffing of the Project
Unit, and for assistance with project planning, design,
and implementation;



- 23 -
(ii) a study of UTE's generation development program for the
years 1980 to 2000;
(iii) a tariff study based on marginal cost criteria;
(iv) a management study;
(v) studies of UTE's internal auditing, financial reporting,
cost accounting, and management information systems, and
of its staff compensation structure and policies; and
(vi) the overall energy sector study (1.05).
Project Cost
4.09      The Project costs are estimated to be as follows:
in NUr$ millions           in US$ millions
Local  Foreign  Total   Local  Foreign  Total
1. Montevideo Distribution            46.8    70.8   117.6       6.0      9.2    15.2

3. Consultants                         16.8    26.2    43.0       2.2     3.4      5.6
4. Base Cost (1 + 2 + 3)             194.6   157.1   351.7    25.2    20.4    45.6
5. Physical Contingencies
(10% of 1 x 2)                     17.7    13.1    30.8       2.3      1.7     4.0
6. Price Contingencies               155.4   137.3   292.7       0.9      1.9      2.8
7. Totals                            367.7   307.5   675.2    28.5    24.0    52.5
4.10      The above estimates were made by ELC on the basis of the designs and
costs _n their August 1977 report (1.09), which they updated to May 1979.
Local costs include an element of indirect foreign costs, since UTE's records
do not provide an adequate basis for estimating such costs. The estimates
include physical contingencies of 10% for the distribution works which is
considered adequate. Price contingencies for local costs are based on rates
of 45% for 1980 and 40% for 1981. For foreign costs, a rate of 6% p.a. has
been assumed. Average exchange rates of NUr$11 and NUr$14.85 per US dollar for
1980 and 1981 respectively were used for conversion purposes. The cost estimates
exclude import duties and taxes, for which UTE is to be exempted. The average
base cost of consultant services (excluding travel and subsistence) is esti-
mated at US$7,000 per staff-month.

Project Execution
4.11      The Project consists mainly of a large number of small works carried
out by UTE's Montevideo and Interior Distribution Departments, with procure-
ment through UTE's Procurement Division. UTE has recently set up a planning
unit to implement detailed engineering and timely procurement. To strengthen
this unit, improve coordination and expedite project execution, Project
Consultants (Electroconsult, Italy) have been engaged to provide together with
UTE the necessary manpower for a Project Unit (2.04).  This unit will work
within the framework of UTE's existing organization, providing the required
technical and project management input to ensure that the various stages of the
design, procurement and construction are executed in a timely and orderly manner,
and ensuring coordination with the closely interrelated IDB project and other
ongoing works. A program implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4-4 which
would be used to monitor progress. Project completion is expected by December
1981.
4.12      In the area of Montevideo, construction would be largely by UTE's
workforce, with the assistance of suppliers and civil works contractors for
underground cables and substations. For the interior some difficulties may
arise because of lack of contractors for this type of work and some unwilling-
ness of UTE's artisans to work outside Montevideo. This may cause implemen-
tation delays, and during negotiations it was agreed that, in such instance,
the use of contractors from adjacent countries could be a solution.
Procurement
4.13      Procurement of goods and services to be financed from the proposed
loan, except for those of consultants, would be through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
Goods and services to be financed by UTE would be procured through UTE's normal
procedures, which require competitive bidding or negotiated contracts in special
instances. Due to the small size of the local market and unfavorable tax
treatment, locally procured equipment may be up to 40% more expensive than
equivalent imported equipment. However, the increase in total project cost
resulting from such local bidding is not expected to exceed 10%, as local
manufacturers are only capable of supplying a small portion of project
requirements. The loan agreement provides that similar items should be
grouped together to the satisfaction of the Bank, with a view to creating
reasonably large and attractive packages likely to ensure wide international
competition.
Disbursements
4.14      The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed for (a) 100%
of foreign expenditures for materials and equipment, including auxiliary
services; and (b) 90% of total expenditures for consultant services.
4.15      Retroactive financing is recommended for consultant services not
exceeding US$900,000 subsequent to June 1, 1979, in order to ensure a prompt
start on project execution. The loan disbursement schedule is shown in
Annex 4-3 and the closing date will be June 30, 1982, in order to allow for
repayment of retention moneys and some unforeseen delays.



- 25 -
Environmental Aspects
4.16      No problems in this respect are expected.  The facilities to be
constructed are of standard execution for which the necessary easements are
provided. They would be largely underground and in substation buildings in
Montevideo, and of the standard overhead and above ground type in the interior.
Project Risks
4.17      The Project is mainly subject to risks associated with UTE's and
the country's institutional and managerial shortcomings. Delays may arise
from lack of qualified staff, and from difficulties in integrating the Project
Consultant's staff into the UTE organization. A determined effort is needed
to get procurement activities moving as early as possible, and the presence
of the Project Consultants will be beneficial in overcoming UTE's bureau-
cratic inertia, provided they receive sufficient support from the utility's
management.
4.18      Procurement procedures in Uruguay have, in the past, tended to take
a long time. To reduce the danger of delays in project execution which this
may cause, during negotiations the government agreed to pass a decree exempting
procurement for the Bank and IDB projects from normal administrative procedures,
which would otherwise require approval by various ministries in a sequential
order. During negotiations it was agreed that enactment of the decree would be
a condition of loan effectiveness.

5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Earnings History
5.01      UTE's earnings record has improved over the recent past (Annex 5-1).
While until 1976 the rate of return was below the 8% level covenanted under
Loan 712-UR, it exceeded it in 1977 and 1978. This improvement in earnings
was chiefly the product of very favorable hydrological conditions in 1977 and
1978. UTE's earnings have not generated adequate resources to finance power
sector investments. This has not had a serious impact to date as a result of
the Government's decision to implement through other entities its main invest-
ments in the electric sector (the hydroelectric projects of Salto Grande and
Palmar). However, investment in transmission and distribution continued to
be under UTE, and in these two areas, as well as in maintenance, financial
tightness was felt severely.
5.02      In 1972-1978, the government did not increase electricity tariffs
to levels required on financial and economic grounds because it feared that
higher tariffs would aggravate inflation. Timely measures with respect to
tariffs are required to preclude waste (i.e., supply of electricity to the
consumer below economic cost) and financial difficulties for UTE. Given
that power generation is about 50% from thermal sources, it would indeed be
uneconomic that Uruguay should keep its rates low when fuel imports have
such significant macroeconomic effects.
Tariff Regulations
5.03      The recently enacted Electricity Law (1.13) provides that electricity
rates shall be set so as to maintain the quality of service and finance invest-
ment requirements to meet market growth. The regulations to the law institute
a tariff regime which supersedes the one instituted by decree 143/70 (see
Attachment to Annex 5-2). The basic principles of the previous regulations
have been retained. UTE's tariffs will be set on the basis of a target rate of
return on a rate base consisting of average revalued net fixed assets in oper-
ation and a provision for working capital. The main changes from the previous
regulations are as follows:
(a) The annual rate of return shall be not less than 6% (the previous
minimum was 8%) nor more than 10%, averaging 8% in the period
1975-1983, and the Executive Power shall annually determine the
rate of return expected for the next year and fix tariffs
accordingly;
(b)  UTE may request tariff adjustments:  (i) within the first
four months of each year (to reflect hydrological conditions),
(ii) every three months to take into account cost changes
adding up to 5% or more, 1/ (iii) at any moment when cost
changes since the last rate increase add to 10% or more; 1/ and
1/   These provisiorLs were incorporated through a subsequent decree issued
in August 1979.



- 27 -
(c) Provision is made for a more comprehensive asset revaluation
scheme than the one presently in use, 1/ which--before being
instituted--must be proposed by UTE for approval by the Executivt
Power.
At negotiations, UTE agreed to submit, on a mandatory basis, tariff increase
requests if any of the conditions listed in (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) occurs, and
the government agreed to act expeditiously on such requests.
5.04      At negotiations, UTE agreed to require its external auditors to
submit a report with their recommendations on the new asset revaluation
scheme not later than December 31, 1980; to exchange views with the Bank on
the report and its recommendations; and to put into effect such proposals as
shall have been approved by the Bank. This timing would enable the Bank to
discuss the new scheme with the Government prior to the appraisal of the
proposed Sixth Power Project.
Financial Position
5.05      UTE has a strong financial structure.  Its debt/equity ratio as of
December 1978 was 20:80 (Annex 5-7) and this is probably overstated, since
inventories are carried at their historic cost (and not all items have been
adequately inventoried), work in progress is shown at cost, and foreign infla-
tion is not yet taken into account for fixed asset revaluation purposes. Thus
UTE has the capacity to carry considerable additional debt, provided its revenues
are allowed to increase so as to meet the additional debt service.
Liquidity
5.06      In the past UTE's liquidity has fluctuated from very poor to fairly
good.  At present, with investment being kept low, UTE has no liquidity
problem.  UTE regulates its liquidity through its payments to ANCAP and to
the Government (Treasury, pension funds), falling back on these when its own
financial situation tightens, an event often associated with difficulties in
collecting its accounts receivables from the Government and its agencies.
UTE's short-term debt to ANCAP has on occasion been excessive. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that debts to the public .;ector, in-
cluding ANCAP, should be settled on a timely basis.
Overdue Government Accounts
5.07      Overdue Government accounts have been a perennial problem for UTE,
associated with its de facto dependence from the Central Governmenit.  Loari
712-UR included a covenant requiring collection of overdue receivables from
the public sector (as well as timely payment of UTE's debts to it) but this
was never fulfilled. As of December 31, 1978, accounts due from the pkublAt
sector were estimated to amount to the equivalent of US$20.0 million which,
had rates remained invariant through time, would represent about 15 months of
sales (at prevailing inflation rates, however, it is probably closer ;:o about
20 months of sales).
1/   At present, fixed assets are revalued by the arithmetic average of the
annual cost of living index and rate of exchange increases (Annex 5-2,
Attachment).



- 28 --
5.08      To deal with this problem, the Government established a compensating
mechanism for "old" debt in early 1978 and made budgetary allocations for power
purchases in such a manner that they may not be diverted from the intended
purpose.  These measures have proved insufficient, as overdue accounts have
kept on mounting. In view of the above, the loan documents contain provisions
to ensure timely payment of future electricity bills, and agreement has been
reached on the manner and timetable in which debtS outstanding as of December 31,
1978 shall be settled. In this respect, the Government has agreed that by
June 30, 1980 it will settle any public sector overdue accounts yet outstanding. 1/
UTE has agreed to take adequate measures to collect accounts receivable from
public sector agencies within 75 days of billing and the Government has agreed
to make direct payment to UTE of bills not paid by its respective agencies, other
Government enterprises or municipalities, within the same period. To monitor
compliance, UTE has agreed to submit quarterly reports on sales and receivables
to the public sector.  Miring negotiations, it was agreed that prior to loan
effectiveness, the Bank will receive evidence that the above commitments are
being fulfilled.
Financing Plan
5.09      The financing plan on the next page was prepared on the basis of the
information available during appraisal and updated in May 1979. It is expected
that during the disbursement period of the proposed loan, the financing for
UTE's investments will come substantially (42%) from internal cash generation,
complemented by the proposed Bank and IDB/Central Bank loans (26%) and by
suppliers credits and future commercial bank loans (32%).
5.10      The proposed Bank fifth power loan of US$24 million would be made to
UTE for a term of 15 years including 3 years of grace, 2/' at the current Bank
interest rate, assumed for the purpose of financial projections to be 8%. The
loan would be guaranteed by the Republic of Uruguay. Of the proceeds of the
loan, US$0.6 million would be relent to the Direccion de Energia, for purposes
of the energy sector study (1.05).  It has been assumed that these funds will
be onlent on the same terms as the loan to UTE. The loaEn documents provide
for the onlending arrangements, which should be satisfactory to the Bank.
5.11      The proposed IDB project has already been appraised, and loan approval
is expected before December 31, 1979. The financiLal projections assume a loan
amount of US$31.5 million equivalent (see 4.04), f-or a term of 20 years, in-
cluding a 3.5 years grace period, which is currently assumed to bear an interest
rate of 7.5% per year.
1/   Information submitted to the Bank shows that, through the first semester
of 1979, reasonable progress towards achieving the above target had
been achieved.
2/   These are the standard terms for Uruguay.

5.12      The financial projections also assume a future IBRD loan, on the
same conditions as the Fifth Power loan, to finance the foreign costs of UTE's
1982-83 distribution investment program (1.10).
Forecast Financial Performance
5.13      During negotiations, UTE and the Government agreed that UTE's
electricity rates will be adjusted periodically, to achieve an annual rate of
return of not less than 7.5% averaged over two year periods, to take account
of impact of variable hydrology on fuel costs. 1/
5.14      The new regulations to the electricity law provide a satisfactory
legal framework for the achievement of the rate of return targets proposed
(5.03). The main issue, however, is not the legal framework but the Govern-
ment's willingness to take tariff actions when required. Due to recent inter-
national fuel price increases, not yet fully reflected in the price paid by UTE
for its fuel purchases to ANCAP, to the need for further salary increases to
maintain the progress achieved in improving salary structures (2.08), and to
the persistence of inflation, significant tariff actions will be required
during project execution. The initial test of this intention will be Govern-
meent action on UTE's tariff application for 1980, which is due by January
1980 under the regulations . During negotiations the Government agreed to
approve, by January 15, 1980, a tariff increase program designed to ensure
that a rate of return of 7.5% will be achieved.
5.15      The financial projections (Annexes 5-4 and 5-5') indicate that tariffs
as shown below will be required to ensure the viability of IJTE's investment
program.

- 31 -
Future Finances
5.16      With the rate actions discussed above and the Government repaying
its arrears and paying its electricity bills on time, UTE's 1980-81 financial
situatton should be comfortable. In 1980 and 1982, UTE's financial structure
wil change significantly with the incorporation to its assets of the Salto
Grande 500 kV transmission works and of the Palmar hydro project respectively
(Annex 5-6). It has been agreed that the debt stevice on these two projects
will also be transferred to UTE, while the equity contributions made by the
Government will be considered as a Government contribution to UTE's capital. 1/
5.17      With the transfers, combined with the proposed investment plan and
its financing, UTE's debt-equity ratio is expected to rise to 47:53 by 1982
which is still satisfactory, and should provide adequate margin for additional
borrowings. The debt service coverage ratio will be comfortable during project
execution but will fall to its lowest level (about 1.2) in 1983 when UTE will
be servicing the entire Palmar debt, which is tight. To ensure adequate review
of future borrowings the present covenant of Loan 712-UR, which requires UTE
to seek the agreement of the Bank before incurring any additional long-term
debt which would lower the coverage of the maximum future debt service below
1.5, has been repeated for the proposed loan.
5.19      In 1978 the Government imposed a contribution of NUr$6.0 million
on UTE. The financing plan does not provide for any further contributions and
UTE and the Government have agreed that all UTE's earnings shall be retained
until project completion.
5.20      UTE's current position should remain comfortable as receivables
from Government are paid. The acid test (the ratio of cash plus short-term
receivables to current liabtlities) is expected to reach 0.70 in 1983 which,
though below its presently high level, is still satisfactory. By 1983, the
average collection period is also expected to have fallen to about two
months from its 4.5 months present level, due to the improvement in Govern-
ment payments.
5.21      In order to avoid a recurrence of UTE's past severe liquidity
problems, the Government has agreed to a,-,st UTE in obtaining, as and when
required, short-term credits from the Government-owned banks for not less
than US$1.5 million. UTE should be able to maintain adequate liquidity
at all times and, to monitor its behavior, the acid test ratio has been
included in the performance indicators.
1/   Since Palmar is not expected to be fully operational until late 1982,
it was also agreed that the Government will bear 50% of the debt
service burden in that year (see Annex 5-5).



- 32 -
Performance Indicators
5.22      Over the project implementation period UTE is expected to improve
its performance in several areas (see Annex 5-8), the most important of
which are:
(a) The ratio of customers to employees is expected to improve
despite the heavy investment effort and the larger share
of sales in the interior;
(b) The relative number of professionals within the work force
and their average salary are expected to improve;
(c) The investment program would result in a gradual reduction
in the number of forced outages;
(d) System losses would reduce gradually;
(e) UTE's penetration in the interior would increase;
(f) Rates would increase in real terms, and the rate of return
would remain satisfactory;
(g) The collection period for public sector receivables would
gradually fall to a normal level; and
(h) Satisfactory liquidity would be maintained.
The forecast indicators shown in Annex 5-8 refer to the above and would be
used as a basis for monitoring performance during project execution.

6.   ECONOMIC ANALYSES
Network Evaluation
6.01      The design of UTE's network is technically simple and follows European
standards instituted many years ago: the system is of the radial levels type
(except for the higher voltages in Montevideo; though even there most rings are
not closed); down to the 15 kV and 6 kV level cables, lines and busbars are re-
lay protected, below this level protection generally consists of fuses (fused
isolators are used for protection of the distribution transformers and outgoing
radial lines and cables), except for important industrial connections. Except
in urban centers (Montevideo) the systems have overhead lines and open-air
substations for higher voltage levels, and brick or concrete buildings for the
distribution substations (where the intermediate to low voltage transformers,
switching and protection equipment, and L.V. boards are located). The 150 kV
and 115 kV lines have towers, all intermediate voltage lines concrete poles
and L.V. lines either wood or concrete poles. The planned expansion would
follow the same standards and thus its capital cost is considered to be at a
minimum. On the other hand, in view of the considereable use of fused pro-
tections, the quality of service is less than would have been obtained with
the most modern (and more expensive) equipment and systems that allow automatic
restoration of service. The standards applied are commensurate with the
historic and forecast conditions of Uruguay's economy, where least direct cost
considerations are of prime importance and increase in reliability of the
service of secondary importance. The expansion of the distribution networks at
220/380 V (4-wire) rather than 3 x 220 V (3-wire), however, will ensure less
voltage distortions and a reduction in losses, thus raising the quality of service.
The replacement of old and worn-out equipment and cables in Montevideo, together
with the removal of overloads in various sections, will provide an acceptable
level of security of supply (in the long term the objective is to cut the relative
number of forced outages in half).
Comparison of Alternatives
6.02      In designing the transmission (150 kV) and subtransmission facilities
(the latter being part of the Project), a least-cost comparison has been made
to justify the replacement of localized diesel-electric supply by supply
from the interconnected system. The low voltage distribution networks are
considered to be common to either system of supply and its costs, therefore,
should not be included in the comparison. The consultants have grouped the
various diesel stations in such a way so as to assure technically adequate
supply from the grid at reasonable cost, thus defining a number of areas to
be included in the comparison. These areas (8), subsequently were assumed to
develop (during a period of 20 years) with or without the benefit of supply
from the grid (in the "without" case additional diesels would have to be
installed to meet requirements).



- 34 -
6.03      The discount rate up to which the present value of all costs related
to supply from the interconnected system, would be lower than the present value
of all cost of isolated (diesel) supply, is about 18% (Annex 6-1). Under reason-
able assumptions for various adverse conditions materializing simulataneously
(i.e., neglecting simultaneous occurrence of favorable conditions, in view of
the rather high equalizing discount rate), the equalizing discount rate would
range from 10%-18% with an average of 14%, i.e., even under adverse conditions
the equalizing discount rate exceeds the opportunity cost of capital by a
comfortable margin. Supply from the interconnected system is therefore econo-
mically justified.
Rate of Return on Investments
6.04      Because of the nature of the Project it is not possible to separate
the costs and benefits that it generates from those of the other components
of UTE's overall development program. The rate of return of the entire
program was therefore calculated (Annex 6-2). The cost streams include the
capital cost of UTE's development program, project administration costs, and
associated operating costs (fuel, operation and maintenance, and administration
and commercial). The benefit streams associated with the program comprise sales
revenues (inclusive of the tax on energy sales) and connection fees derived from
new customers and revenues from incremental sales to existing customers (3.06)
and the estimated market value of diesel units to be sold after interconnecting
isolated systems (6.03).
6.05      Since, even after Palmar and Salto Grande enter into operation, a
proportion of UTE's generation is expected to be from thermal sources (1.30)
incremental operating costs have been estimated from the expected incremental
fuel requirements 1/ associated with the program, as well as operation, main-
tenance, administrative and commercial expenses.
6.06      The rate of return calculations are based on international fuel prices.
Local currency costs and benefits have been adjusted through shadow pricing (by
a factor of 0.8), following standard Bank practice for Uruguay. All other
values considered are based on market prices. Based on the above assumptions,
the rate of return on the 1980-1983 program would be about 7%. Details of the
calculations are shown in Annex 6-2. The results of sensitivity analyses are
shown below:

scheduled replacement of some hydro equipment which is evidencing
reliability problems (4.03), reduced system losses (3.05), and displace-
ment of diesel generation due to interconnection (4.06).

6.07      The results shown do not take into account productivity and
welfare gains resulting from outage reduction, nor other factors affecting
consumer surplus. Taken in isolation, however, they suggest that the tariff
levels which may be adequate to meet UTE's financial requirements may be
insufficient to cover marginal costs. For this reason, UTE has agreed to
carry out a tariff structure study to determine the appropriate level of
charges to different classes of consumers (para. 1.26).

7. SUMMARY OF PROPOSED AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with the Government
and with UTE, as applicable, on the following principal points:
(a)  The Direccion Nacional de Energia will, not later thaa Jtin-~ 30,
1980, engage consultants to prepare an energy study.  The study
would be completed by December 31, 1981. It would be financed,

tion with the Bank, its recommendations put into effect by June
30, 1982 (para. 1.26).
(c)  By December 31, 1979 the Government will furnish to the Bank a
satisfactory program for meeting power sector financing require-
ments through 1983, and a report on the costs and financing
schemes of power projects being carried out outside UTE
(para. 1.28).

at which time it would be submitted to the Bank for discussion.
Implementation to be completed with the assistance of the
consultants (para. 2.02).
(g)  Role of the project unit with regard to the IBRD and IDB
projects (para. 2.04).
(h)  UTE's external auditors will prepare a salary study, which will be
submitted to the Bank by June 30, 1980. UTE will submit, for Bank
review, a program for the implementation of the study's recom-
mendations, which is to start by January 1, 1981 (para. 2.08).
(i)  UTE's recruitment program for engineers and other professionals
(para. 2.09).



- 37 -
(j) Engagement of a training expert (to be financed under loan 1594-UR)
by April 30, 1980. Presentation to the Bank of a training program
by November 30, 1980 (para. 2.10).
(k) UTE's external auditors will:
(i) review the 1978 and 1979 financial statements, and UTE
will furnish to the Bank their report (para. 2.12),
(ii) assist UTE in the updating of its information systems
(including preparation of quarterly income statements and
processing of cost information by responsibility centers)
(para. 2.11),
(iii) assist UTE on the organization and staffing of its internal
auditing unit (para. 2.13), and
(iv) prepare a report on a new asset revaluation scheme - which
is to adequately take into account external inflation -,
said report to be submitted to the Bank by UTE, together with
its own proposals, by December 31, 1980 (para. 5.04).
(1) Starting on January 1, 1980, UTE will externally insure its major
assets against agreed risks, and will set up a self insurance
provision for other risks. The Government will guarantee any
losses not covered by the above (para. 2.14).
(m)  The standard undertaking for monitoring the soundness of dams
(para. 2.15).
(n) UTE will be exempted from import duties on imports for the project
(para. 4.10).
(o) Use of contractors from neighboring countries, if required
(para. 4.12). Grouping of similar items to ensure economic
procurement (para. 4.13).
(p) UTE's debts to the public sector, including ANCAP, will be settled
on a timely basis (para. 5.06).
(q) By June 30, 1980 all overdue public sector debts to UTE will have
been settled. As from January 1, 1980 all electricity bills to
public sector agencies will be settled within 75 days. UTE will
submit to the Bank quarterly reports on its sales to and receivables
from the public sector (para. 5.08).
(r) UTE's annual rate of return will be not less than 7.5%, averaged
over two year periods. In any one year it will not be less than
6%, (para. 5.13). By January 15, 1980 the Government will approve
a tariff increase program designed to achieve a 7.5% rate of return
in 1980 (para. 5.14).

(s) Upon their completion, the Salto Grande non common works and
the Palmar hydroproject will be transferred to UTE. The debt
service on these projects will also be transferred to UTE. The
equity contributions made by the Government will be considered
a Government contribution to UTE's capital (para. 5.16).
(t)  UTE will consult the Bank prior to incurring any long term debt
if its debt service coverage ratio is lower than 1.5 (para. 5.17).
(u) All UTE's earnings will be retained until project completion
(para. 5.19).
(v) The Government will assist UTE in obtaining, as and when required,
short term credit from the Government owned Banks for not less
than US$1.5 million (para. 5.20).
7.2       Before declaring the loan effective, the following conditions would

which may adversely affect the utility's operations or its financial performance
would be an event of default.
7.04      Retroactive financing for consulting services as from June 1, 1979, in
an amount not exceeding US$0.9 million is recommended (para. 4.14).
7.05      With the above assurances, the project would constitute a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$24 million. The loan would be repaid over a period
of 15 years, including three years of grace.

ANNEX 5-2
URUGUAY - FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Tariff Regime 1970-1979
1.        UTE's tariff regime was approved on March 20, 1970 by Presidential
decree No. 143/70, and was the result of the negotiations with the Bank that
took place for the Fourth Power Loan.
2.        The decree establishes that UTE should earn a rate of return of not
less than 8% nor more than 10% on its tariff base. Any difference between the
actual return and the minimum or maximum return calculated using the figures
indicated above is to be recorded in a special account, to be carried over to
the next fiscal year as an additional surplus or deficit, as applicable.
3.        The rate base is given by-the sum, as of June 30 of each year of:
a)     Revalued net fixed assets;
b)     Inventories;
c)     One-third of annual collected operating revenues.
4.        Revalued net fixed assets are to be calculated in the following
manner:
a)     Book value of gross fixed assets at the beginning of the year
is revalued by an index which is a simple average of the cost
of living index and the rate of exchange index. 1/ To this
figure are added assets incorporated into operation during
the period and for this purpose, UTE has to keep constant
value accounting (defined to mean revaluation by the composite
index mentioned above) for each work in progress.
b)     Book value of accumulated depreciation is calculated in a
similar manner: the initial value is revalued by the same
composite index and the annual depreciation charge is added
to this figure.
5.        In practice actual book values as of June 30 have not been available -
(UTE only produces annual financial statements for their fiscal year which ends
on December 31) and both UTE and the Bank have estimated them from the arith-
metic average of December 31 figures.
6.        The rate of return is given by the ratio of net operating income to
the tariff base, calculated as indicated above. Net operating income, in turn
is given by the difference between operating revenues and operating expenses.
7.        Operating revenues include sales of electricity and related charges.
They do not include connection fees. Operating expenses include all expenses
attributable to the provision of electricity, including depreciation on revalued
assets. The average (straight line) depreciation rate on said assets cannot
be lower than 3% nor higher than 5%.
8.        The tariff regime also includes provisions for rate adjustments and
for annual rate revisions on an estimation basis.
1/  The actual formula used by UTE has been:  I - 0.5 CLt               ERt
ctl  + 0.5 qERt-l-,
where: I is the revaluation index; CL is the cost of living index;
ER is the exchange rate (pesos per dollar).

a/  As forecasted by Electroconsult (see Chapter 3).  Adjusted in 1979 for the
estimated sales reduction due to the factors mentioned in para. 1.21.
b/ The average rate was determined after establishing the investment and financing plans,
to yield a rate of return of 7.5% which ensures the internal cash generation
required to make these viable. For 1979 it is based on actual tariffs through
May 1979, and on Government announced tariff increases of 7.5% (effective July 1)
and 4% (effective November 1).
c/ Fuel consumption is based on the generation plan shown in Annex 3_  Fuel
prices are based on actual prices charged by ANCAP for Bunker C and for
diesel, escalated by 5% as of November 1, 1979, by 25% as of January 1,
1980 (bringing them to an equivalent then of US$21 per bbl of crude), and
by 87. per year thereafter.
d/ 1979 expenditures for personnel reflect an increase in the workforce of 3%
(as provided for in UTE's budget) and an already Government announced 8%
general salary increase effective September 1. Forecasts for subsequent
years assume annual increases in the workforce of 3% and average real salary
iacreems (i..ever foretasted inflation rates) of. 2  per year, this result
in average current dollar salary increases of 6.5% per year (for top level
staff, however, the average current dollar salary increase assumed was 10.5%,
see Attachment).
e/ Includes depreciation of the Salto Grande 500 kV facilities (starting in 1981)
and of Palmar (starting in 1982) at rates of 3% and 2% per year respectively
(though for 1982, in view of Palmar's limited output, only 50% of the
corresponding depreciation was charged).
f/ Figures shown include small purchases from Brasil (for which prices were
assumed to increase at a rate of 10% per year) and, also, purchases from
Salto Grande - as per the amounts shown in Annex 1 -, for which an initial
1979 tariff of US 25 mills/kWh was assumed, escalating at a rate of US 1
mill/kWh per year. Agreement has yet to be reached between CTM and the
Argentine and Uruguayan authorities on the applicable tariff scheme.
/ Figures for other operating expenses for 1979 are based on UTE's budget,
incremented by a provision of US$0.6 million for purchase of external insurance.
Thereafter they have been increased at the same growth rate of physical sales
(5.8% per year), and escalated under the assumption that they will follow the
same pace as internal inflation.
hi Projected to grow at the same rate as sales.

FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Comparison of Alternative Supply Development in the Interior
1.        Supply to networks in the interior could either (Alternative 1)
be from the interconnected system (requiring expansion of the 150 kV trans-
mission facilities) or (Alternative 2) from isolated diesel station (requiring
expansion of these stations). Expansion in subtransmission (60 kV, 30 kV,
25 kV, L.T.) would be common to both development and for this reason can be
omitted from the comparison.
2.        Also taking into account appropriate retirement of old diesel units,
the consultants prepared a development program for the following areas and
calculated the equalizing discount rate up to which supply from the inter-
connected system would have least-present cost.
Interconnected               Equalizing

3.        It should be further noted that the consultant's report (prepared in
mid 1977) assumed fuel prices about 40% below current international levels.
Adjustment for this factor increases the economic advantage of alternative 1.
Reasonable assumptions for variations in cost items do not materially affect
the conclusion that the equalizing discount rate up to which interconnected
supply would be the least cost solution exceeds by a comfortable margin the
opportunity cost of capital in Uruguay.

Rate of Return Calculations
Basic Assumptions
1.        A shadow exchange rate 25% higher than the market rate has been used
to convert cost and benefit figures accruing in local currency.
A. Costs
2.        Investment figures have been obtained from Annex 4-1.  They include
provision for physical contingencies. Other investments include the project
consultants and UTE's own project administration costs. The average life assumed
for the investments in the program is 25 years.
3.        Operating and Maintenance expenditures were estimated at 2% of cumulative
investments caused by the program excluding the load dispatch center 1/, this is
in accordance with UTE's past experience.
4.        Incremental fuel costs were established from an estimated generation
program (on a plant by plant basis), using UTE's 1977 fuel efficiency records.
The costs of the marginal plants 2/ were used. Fuel prices assume: (i) a 1981
price of crude of US$25 per bbl (in 1979 constant dollars); (ii) real price
increases of 4% p.a. through 1984, and (iii) price of Bunker C fuel equal to
70% of price of crude. Fuel savings due to reductions in sustem losses were
estimated assuming distribution losses would fall from 11% in 1981 to 8.5% in
1985 (on a straight line basis). The savings were valued in terms of the
reduction in generation at the marginal plants. Fuel savings due to the
scheduled replacement of hydro generation equipment were estimated (bv the
mission) as the fuel cost for generating 50 GWh in 1982 and 1983 and as the
fuel cost for generating 100 GWh thereafter. Fuel savings from displacement
of diesel units through interconnection of isolated systems were estimated
on the basis of forecasted generation and of differential fuel requirements.
5.        Incremental administrative and commercial costs were estimated
(assuming these are proportional to number of consumers) by projecting actual
1978 costs.
1/ Quantification of the effects of the center on the program's benefits
would require developing a complex simulation model to estimate the
resulting cost reductions; it is believed that the results of such an
exercise would not alter the rate of return calculation significantly.
2/ The plants which would be operated at a reduced rate or shut down if the
sales growth attributed to the investment program were not to materialize.

B. Benefits
6.        Incremental sales revenues result from adding sales to new consumers
(to be connected under the program, see Annex 5-8) and incremental sales to
existing consumers attributed to the program 1/. Average rates used are as
shown in para. 5.15, (increased by 10% tax on electricity sales).
7.        Connection fee revenues are based on number of consumers to be
connected and on assumed average connection fee (based on 1975-1978 data).
8.        Benefits from the displacement of diesel units due to interconnection
were calculated by estimating, on the basis of replacement values and useful
life, the market value of the displaced units. Replacement costs were
estimated at US$600 per kW, of which 25% local and 75% foreign.
1/ These are the following proportions of incremental sales to existing
consumers: 1981 25%, 1982 65%, 1983 90%, 1984 55%, 1985 45%, 1986 20%.
