JAMAICA - SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                         Sugar Industry Authority (SIA).
Guarantor:                        Jamaica.
Beneficiary:                     National Sugar Company, Limited.
Amount:                           US$18 million.
Terms:                            Payable in 17 years, including four
years of grace, at 7.45% per annum.
Relending Terms:                 The subloans, estimated at about US$17.6
million, from SIA to the National Sugar
Company will be denominated in Jamaican
dollars at an interest rate of 12% and
for the same term and grace period as the
Bank loan.
Proiect Description:             The project's principal objectives are to
maintain sugar production in factories that
are currently in need of rehabilitation, and
to raise the sugar industry's efficiency from
the present unsatisfactory levels. The
project provides for the rehabilitation of the
physical works for Jamaica's only sugar
refinery and its three largest raw sugar
factories and a technical assistance program
to improve the efficiency of cane and sugar
production. The physical works consist of a
large number of individual jobs to replace
and/or renovate worn-out or outmoded facilities,
and improve efficiency. The technical assistance
consists of studies leading to improvement in
a) cane harvesting, loading and quality
assessment, and b) factory operations, main-
tenance and management. The project also
includes training elements.
The project has foreign exchange earning
and employment benefits. The annual production
of approximately 45,000 tons of sugar that
would be lost, without the rehabilitation

of the three factories is expected to prevent
losses in estimated net foreign exchange
earnings of US$8.1 million per annum at
average 1977 market prices and the retention
of about 1,600 canefield jobs. The project's
emphasis on training, technical assistance and
studies is expected to help arrest further
deterioration in the industry.
The principal project risk is that cane
supply could decline to levels below the
factory capacities after rehabilitation. The
project design has included measures to
reduce this risk through the studies it will
finance.  With these measures and the conti-
nuance of ongoing government efforts to support
improved cane production the project risks are
acceptable.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE SUGAR INDUSTRY AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF JAMAICA
FOR A SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Sugar Industry Authority with the guarantee of Jamaica for
the equivalent of US$18 million. The loan would have a term of 17 years,
including four years of grace, with interest at 7.45% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
Introduction
2.        An Economic Report entitled "Current Economic Situation and Pros-
pects of Jamaica" was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 22,
1976. Updating missions visited Jamaica in August 1976, January 1977, March
1977, August 1977 and October 1977. The Country Data Sheets are attached as
Annex I.
Background
3.        Many of the long-term structural problems of the Jamaican economy
today have their origin in the pattern of growth of the 1960s. During the
decade following independence in 1962, Jamaica experienced rapid economic
growth, averaging about 6% per annum in real terms. Growth was spurred by
major developments in tourism and in bauxite and alumina production. Tourist
visitors increased from 200,000 in 1962 to 500,000 in 1972, while over the
same period bauxite production expanded from 8 million tons to 13 million tons,
and the output of alumina rose from 650,000 tons to 2 million tons. Large
private capital inflows from abroad underpinned investments in these sectors,
and these same capital inflows enabled Jamaica to finance increasing deficits
on the current account of the balance of payments. The decade of the sixties
was, therefore, a period of high investment and rising incomes. However, the
growth of other sectors was less buoyant. To begin with, investment during
this period bypassed the agricultural sector, the traditional source of
Jamaica's income and employment opportunities. Agricultural production
stagnated and there was increasing migration to urban areas. Moreover,
import-substituting manufacturing, mainly of consumer goods, continued to grow
under high levels of effective protection. This, in combination with liberal
tax incentives and a high industrial wage structure led to the development of
1/   The "Background" and "The Economic Crisis of 1976" sections of this Part
are substantially the same as the similarly titled sections of Part I
of the President's Report of November 21, 1977 for the Jamaica Program
Loan. The latter sections of Part I, however, differ from Part I of the
November 21 Report to reflect recent economic developments.



- 2 -
a sector which we-s -xca.si-vely capital intensive, provided relatively little
employment and was heavily dependent on the import of intermediate goods.  The
failure to foment agricultural and manufacturing production for exports made
bauxite and alumina exports, which already accounted for over one-half of
total exports in 1966, rise to about 70% by 1972. Finally, the pattern of
development of the economy failed to narrow the extreme inequality of Jamaica's
income distribution. Thus, by the early 1970s, Jamaica was suffering from
serious unemployment and social tensions.
4.        The Government which came to power in 1972 was committed to reducing
the inequality in the distribution of income, alleviating unemployment and
reducing the country's external dependence. It embarked upon a development
program emphasizing greatly increased government ownership of and control over
the country's productive resources and promised expanded popular participation
in decision making. Economic diversification, employment and redistribution
of income were set forth as priority goals, with economic growth considered a
subsidiary, albeit important, goal. This strategy created an atmosphere of
uncertainty with immediate result of reduced investment activity by the
private sector.
5.        The implementation of the structural changes sought by the Govern-
ment was further complicated by unforeseen external factors. The completion
of a major investment cycle in tourism and mining in Jamaica resulted in a
sharp drop in foreign capital inflows beginning in 1972. This was followed
by the increase in petroleum and other commodity prices in late 1973 which
resulted in severe deterioration in the country's terms of trade. Moreover,
the world recession of 1974-75 had serious repercussions on Jamaica's tourism
and mining sector receipts. The Government was able to counteract the effects
of these unfavorable developments by the introduction of a bauxite levy, which
yielded an additional US$150 million in foreign exchange receipts. This,
together with the near doubling of international sugar prices and the unpre-
cedented level of external medium- and long-term borrowing by the public
sector in 1975 res;-ued Jarmiaica from a serious balance of payments crisis. While
the bauxite levy and the temporary upsurge in sugar prices did not resolve
the underlying weaknesses in the economy, they did provide a temporary respite.
Thus, despite a loss of foreign exchange reserves of US$82 million in 1975,
the economic situation did not become critical until 1976.
The Economic Crisis of 1976
6.        The balance of payments situation deteriorated sharply in 1976.
Serious labor problem.s in the mining sector together with soft world demand
for aluminum reduced total bauxite and alumina export receipts by about 14%.
Receipts from sugar exports in 1976 were only 40% of the 1975 level, owing
to much lower international prices for sugar. Moreover, as internal security
became more precarious, Jamaica did not benefit from the recovery of tourism
evident in the rest of the Caribbean during the year. Thus, despite strict
controls which resulted in a 19% drop in merchandise imports, the current
account balance deteriorated further in 1976, with the deficit reaching
US$295 million. (See Annex I for details.)



- 3 -
7.        Adverse development on capital account made the balance of payments
situation even more difficult. Foreign commercial bank lending to Jamaica
practically ceased, and capital flight accelerated owing to the prevalence of
political and economic uncertainty. There was a net outflow of direct private
investment funds for the third consecutive year. A large part of the credits
received by the public sector were government-to-government loans from Jamaica's
CARICOM partners (Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana), Venezuela and
Canada. The IMF extended a total of US$65 million in credits to Jamaica under
its oil and compensatory facilities. Despite these credits, the country
suffered a net reserve loss in 1976 of US$268 million. By December 21, 1976,
the gross official reserves had fallen to US$41 million, equivalent to two
weeks of imports, and the authorities were forced to close the foreign exchange
markets for a period of two weeks.
8.        The balance of payments difficulties have been accompanied by, and
in part reflect, problems of budgetary management. Growth in current expen-
ditures over the past few years has consistently outstripped that of current
revenues as the Government introduced social welfare schemes to ameliorate
the effects of high unemployment. At the same time, Government investment
expenditure rose rapidly as the Government tried to carry out its ambitious
program.   Thus, Government expenditure in 1976/77 1/ increased by 20% over
1975/76 (see Table 1), the bulk of the increase being transfers to public
entities, as well as new grants and loans to industry, construction and
tourism, in an effort to stimulate the lagging economy. Concomitantly,
current revenues were 5% below the 1975 level, because of shortfalls in
customs duty and consumption tax receipts resulting from the import cutbacks.
As a consequence, the overall deficit of the Central Government increased to
the equivalent of 18.6% of GDP, compared to a figure of under 11% in 1975/76.
Since this coincided with a modest reduction in foreign financing, there was
unprecedented reliance on financing from the banking system equivalent to
11.6% of GDP.
1/   Fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31.

9.        As a consequence of the decline in bauxite production, poor tourism
performance and the adverse effect of import restrictions on industrial
imports, real GDP fell by almost 7% in 1976. This followed three successive
years of negative real growth rate. The only major sectors which exhibited
positive growth were agriculture and government services. Unemployment, a
chronic problem in Jamaica, increased to about 24% from about 21% in 1975.

The Government's Response to the Crisis
10.       In January of 1977, after having been re-elected, the Government,
began to take measures to alleviate the country's severe economic problems.
It introduced new revenue measures expected to yield J$80 million annually.
New wage guidelines were instituted under which wage and salary increases in
the private sector and in government-owned enterprises that are run as commer-
cial establishments would be granted (as contracts fall due) only for those
employees whose real wages were below the June 1973 level. This applied to
only a small part of the labor force. Even in these cases, wage increases
would not be permitted to exceed a flat J$10 per week for the 12-month period
that began July 1, 1977. Moreover, the wage freeze for employees of the
Central Government and Statutory Boards, which was due to expire in March
1977, was extended until March 31, 1978. On the external side, there was a
sharp reduction in the ceiling for the issuance of import licenses and tighten-
ing of restrictions on payments for certain invisibles. In addition, a dual
exchange rate system was instituted in April. Under this system, a new
"special" exchange rate of US$1.00=J$1.25 was established for all transactions
except essential imports and transactions of the Government and bauxite
sector, which remained at the old ("basic") exchange rate of US$1.00=J$0.909.
This implied a weighted average devaluation of about 24%. 1/ Concurrently,
1/   Subsequent exchange rate adjustments (see para. 14 below) have brought
the weighted average devaluation to about 40% in relation to US$ and
to a slightly larger percentage in relation to SDRs.



- 6 -
the Government unveiled an Emergency Production Plan, setting out targets
and strategies for increasing production. Finally, in May, a fiscal budget
for 1977/78 was adopted which called for a sharp reduction in the deficit,
primarily through restraints in expenditures.
11.       In July 1977, the Government adopted a comprehensive program
covering a period of almost two years. This program was the basis for
reaching agreement with the IMF on a Stand-by arrangement, which was approved
by the Fund's Executive Directors in August. Full adherence to the program
would have made Jamaica eligible to draw a total of SDR 64 million (US$74
million) over this period, or into the fourth credit tranche. The key elements
of the program were:
(a) ceilings on net credit to the public sector from the banking
system;
(b) limits on the net domestic assets of the Bank of Jamaica to
ensure that the monetary and credit program of the Government
would be compatible with the planned improvement in the
balance of payments;
(c) limits on the authorization of new foreign indebtedness of
the public sector to ensure that the terms of foreign
borrowing are appropriately related to the country's debt
servicing capability;
(d) quarterly targets for increases in net international reserves
during 1977 and 1978;
(e) provisions for orderly management of payments arrears; and
(f) adjustment in the exchange rate system and avoidance of any
further intensification of import restrictions.
12.       Under the IMF Stand-by arrangement, Jamaica drew the first tranche
of SDR 19.2 million (US$22 million). The first review of the progress on the
quarterly targets took place in October/November 1977, when a Bank staff
member accompanied the Fund mission to Jamaica. On the basis of this review,
it was concluded that Jamaica had fulfilled all the quarterly criteria of the
program and appeared likely to remain in compliance with the credit ceilings,
which were being monitored by the Fund on a weekly basis, on the date of the
request for the second drawdown of funds. The request for this drawdown,
amounting to SDR 9.6 million (US$10.5 million) could only take place after
December 1, 1977. The second quarterly review of performance was scheduled
for February, 1978 as prelude to the third drawdown. Eligibility for this
drawing could only be established and funds drawn after March 1, 1978.
13.       The Government's economic program reflected its decision to adopt the
measures required to cope with the serious economic situation, in spite of the
political difficulties associated with such a course of action. The Government
failed, however, to meet the December target established for the limit on the



- 7 -
level of net domestic assets of the Bank of Jamaica described in paragraph
11(b) above. In part this excessive expansion was the result of a reduction
in deposits by public enterprises. Net public sector credit from the banking
system, however, was within the agreed limits, since a relatively liquid
private sector provided a market for Government bonds. Taking into account
the causes and implications of the Government's failure to restrain domestic
credit expansion, the IMF was not prepared to approve a second drawing under
the Stand-by arrangement. As a result, the Government was unable to draw
on external commercial bank resources; this, in combination with the non-
availability of an anticipated loan from Trinidad and Tobago caused the
Government to fail the test under paragraph 11(d) above for increasing net
international reserves. Despite the failure to meet fully the targets estab-
lished under the stabilization program, the program as a whole achieved some
significant successes. Moreover, the Government installed a system of fiscal
controls and review which give promise of better future performance; demon-
strated its ability to execute a flexible exchange rate policy through the
October devaluation; and maintained an incomes policy which, in general, was
able to prevent real wage increases from exceeding the 1973 level. However,
with prices having risen 10% in 1976 and rising at a 15% rate in 1977 (see
paragraph 22 below), the Government was beginning to feel increasing pressures
to relax its incomes policy late in 1977, and some wage increases in excess of
the Government's announced norms were awarded.
14.       As a result of the slippages under the two-year program which had
been agreed to with the Fund, the Government reexamined the constraints that
such a program would imply. In addition to the problem of maintaining a
successful incomes policy, the Government was also concerned about the extent
of the decline in output and the increase in unemployment that were accom-
panying the program. Rather than readjust the targets for a two-year stabili-
zation program, the Government and the Fund agreed that the program should be
revamped and negotiations have now begun for a three-year Extended Fund
Facility arrangement, which would permit a longer period for adjustment and
also provide a higher level of financial assistance from the IMF. In announcing
on January 13 the negotiations to be conducted with the Fund, the Government
stated in clear terms its commitments to a flexible exchange rate policy, its
willingness to adopt austerity measures and its continued concern with its most
economically disadvantaged citizens. To give substance to its exchange rate
policy commitment, the Government instituted an immediate devaluation of both
the "basic" and "special" exchange rates. The "basic" rate was moved from
US$1.00=J$0.91 to US$1.00=J$1.05 and the "special" rate was moved from
US$1.00=J$1.28 to US$1.00=J$1.35. The weighted average effect of the devalua-
tion on current transactions is estimated to have been about 10%. Simulta-
neously, the minimum wage was increased from J$20 to J$24 and adjustments made
to pensions. In addition, the price of petroleum was increased so that, in
effect, petroleum was moved from the "basic" to the "special" rate.
15.       While Fund negotiations were under way in June 1977, the Government
started negotiations with bilateral and multilateral sources as well as with
foreign commercial banks for a package of extraordinary external financing for
1977 and 1978 (see Table 3). The financing plan was based on a detailed

-9-
analysis of the size of the external resource gap and was premised on the
Government's ability to restrict the current account deficit to US$120 million
in 1977, to reduce it to US$77 million in 1978 and to nearly eliminate it by
1980. As a result of the restructuring of the economic program, estimates of
the size of the external resource gap will have to be revised and adjustments
made in the arrangements for mobilizing external financing. (The "as projected
now" figures in Table 3 are staff estimates indicative of levels which now seem
feasible in 1978.)
16.       A loan of US$49 million had been expected from Trinidad and Tobago.
This was not obtained during 1977 and, at present, it is not clear whether
this will be available. Moreover, the reduced level of external capital
inflows, referred to in paragraph 14 above, meant that extraordinary external
financing was only US$45.0 million in 1977, compared to the projected level of
US$156.0 million. In addition, disbursements from prior commitments were
significantly lower, largely as a result of the lack of counterpart funds. To
meet this external inflows shortfall, the Government (i) reduced the current
account deficit from the projected level of US$110 million through the intens-
ification of import restrictions, (ii) received forward payments for sugar
from Tate & Lyle Company of UK of US$23 million, and (iii) received prepayments
of the bauxite levy of approximately US$40 million.
17.       Although these measures provided some short-term relief, they were
not sufficient to cover the shortfall on external capital inflows. Conse-
quently, there was a loss of reserves of approximately US$40 million.
Impact of Government's Policies on the Economic Situation During 1977
18.       Jamaica's balance of payments and fiscal situations generally
improved during 1977, reflecting both improved international demand for
bauxite/alumina and the effects of the policy measures which were introduced
to deal with the crisis.
19.       There was a dramatic improvement in the balance of payments during
the first half of 1977. Over this period, the country's trade balance deficit
was reduced to only US$4 million, compared to US$164 million for the corre-
sponding period in 1976. Merchandise exports totalled US$376.6 million,
compared with US$288.6 million during the first six months of 1977, an increase
of about 30%. The gains have been mainly due to the recovery (in terms of
both prices and production levels) in the bauxite/alumina sector. At the same
time, the import restrictions produced a decline of about 16% in merchandise
imports during the first half of the year, compared to the corresponding
period in 1976.

Source: Bank of Jamaica.
20.       For the year as a whole, it is estimated that the trade deficit
amounted to about US$20 million as import payments are typically higher for the
second half of the year in Jamaica. With respect to the rest of the current
account, tourism is estimated to have grossed US$70 million. These earnings,
however, were more than offset by interest payments and other factor and non-
factor service payments. On balance, the current account deficit for 1977
is estimated to have been US$70 million. This compares with the corresponding
figure for 1976 of US$295 million. The loss of international reserves was
about US$40 million, in sharp contrast to the loss in reserves of US$268
million during 1976.
21.       The situation has also improved on the fiscal side.  The actual
expenditures during the first half of the fiscal year were in line with
the budget. To ensure that expenditures remain within targeted amounts,
the Government adopted strict controls. All major outlays were and are being
audited at the Ministry of Finance, and monthly expenditure limits have been
assigned to various government ministries and departments. However, revenue
collections are estimated to have been slightly lower than earlier expectations,
primarily because of a revenue shortfall of J$50 million from the Exchange
Stabilization Fund. This shortfall reflected an under-estimation of accumu-
lated foreign liabilities which were settled at the exchange rate prevailing
prior to the April devaluation. This, together with the apparent nonavail-
ability, for the time being at least, of the anticipated US$49 million loan
from Trinidad and Tobago, will require further fiscal adjustments in the
future. On the whole, however, the Government's fiscal policies have been
accomplishing the objective of reducing the disequilibrium in public finances.
It is projected that the overall deficit of the Central Government will
decrease from 18.5% of GDP in the last fiscal year to about 9% in 1977/78.
22.       These accomplishments in the fiscal and balance of payments areas
have, however, been at a heavy cost in terms of output and employment. The
drastic reduction of imports has led to shortages of raw materials and inter-
mediate goods which have, in turn, led to the closure or reduced activity of
many distributing and manufacturing firms. There is a massive underutiliza-
tion of capacity in the productive sectors, in part because of external condi-
tions and in part because of the restriction on imports and domestic demand.



- 11 -
The bauxite/alumina sector is currently operating at about 75% of capacity.
In the manufacturing sector, capacity utilization, based on 1.5 shifts per
day, is about 33%. Unemployment rose to about 30% at the end of 1977, from
the already high level of 24% at the end of last year. Real GDP is estimated
to have declined by no less than 10%. Moreover, the impact of devaluation on
domestic prices has started to be felt. Whereas consumer prices increased by
about 10% during 1976 (and maintained the same rate during the first five
months of 1977), they increased by about 15% for 1977 as a whole.
Growth and Balance of Payments Prospects Beyond 1977
23.       The recent steps taken by the Government show its intention to
reduce the current account deficit to a level which can be sustained over
the longer run on the basis of normal levels and sources of external finance.
In the near term, the main source of better performance is expected to be on
the exports side. In the bauxite/alumina sector a return to the more normal
level of capacity utilization and good price prospects are projected to result
in export receipts from the sector of about US$915 million in 1980, compared
to about US$590 million in 1977, a nominal increase of about 55%. Sugar
receipts are expected to increase by about US$17 million between 1977 and
1980. In addition, the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar is expected to have
a significant effect on the country's other merchandise exports and tourism.
Growth in tourism will also depend on the maintenance of favorable economic
conditions in the North American countries and Jamaica's ability to improve
its image of security for the international tourist. On the whole, the export
of goods and nonfactor services are projected to increase from US$1,036
million in 1977 to US$1,703 in 1980, a nominal increase of about 64%.
24.       The level of economic activity in Jamaica is at present severely
restricted by the country's limited import capacity. The speed with which
recovery can be accomplished consequently will depend heavily upon the growth
of export earnings, the ability of the public sector to mobilize external
financing on appropriate terms and the trends in private capital flows. As
noted, the export prospects are generally favorable.
25.       Mobilizing the required levels of public sector capital inflows will
depend upon an improved capacity to prepare and implement projects and espe-
cially upon realizing the levels of public sector savings necessary as domestic
counterpart. Private capital movements will depend upon the Government's
ability to reestablish a climate of confidence which will stop, and eventually
reverse, recent private capital outflows.
26.       In the future external financing of public sector investments is
expected to rely upon medium- to long-term loans and credits with an average
maturity in excess of 10 years. (At the end of 1976, over 40% of the debt
outstanding and disbursed had an average maturity of under 10 years.) As a
result, debt service would not present an unmanageable problem. The estimated
total debt outstanding and disbursed at the end of August 1977 amounted to
approximately US$1.35 billion. Of this amount, about US$450 million was
direct public debt, US$400 million was government-guaranteed and the remaining



- 12 -
US$500 million was private nonguaranteed debt. The public debt service ratio,
which is currently estimated at 13.5%, is projected to increase further to
about 14% by 1978. Thereafter, however, it is expected to decline. Nonguaran-
teed private debt is not expected to change significantly over the next several
years. Provided Jamaica successfully carries out its economic stabilization
program and maintains its international competitiveness, it should be able to
manage its external indebtedness and be considered creditworthy for continued
Bank lending.
27.       Jamaica has the resources to enable it to both sustain significant
positive rates of real growth of per capita income and achieve a wider distri-
bution of the benefits of growth. Nevertheless, growth in real GDP during
1978 is projected to be low primarily because of the continuing constraint on
the capacity to import projected for the year. After 1978 a relatively rapid
recovery should be possible and subsequently it should be possible to maintain
real growth rates of 5 to 6 percent.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JAMAICA 1/
28.       To date the Bank has made 16 loans in Jamaica totalling $182.4
million after cancellations. Of this amount about $81.5 million (44%) has
been for infrastructure investments in transportation, electric power, water
supply and sewerage; the remainder has gone into a program loan (16%), agri-
culture (13%), education (13%), sites and services (8%), and population and
nutrition (5%). There have so far been two IFC investments in Jamaica; a loan
in 1961 to a pre-mix concrete company and an equity/loan investment in 1968 in
a hotel project. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC
investments as of November 30, 1977 and notes on the execution of projects in
Jamaica. 2/
29.       Bank lending in Jamaica has been principally aimed at providing
transfers of long-term external capital to help finance the foreign exchange
component of high priority public sector investment projects. The Bank
program has been developed taking into account the role of other external
lending agencies--IDB, CIDA, ODM, USAID and the Caribbean Development Bank
(CDB)--and the Government's development strategy. Jamaica's program lending
needs have been assessed in close coordination with IMF and after determining
the availability of other sources of external capital. Bank lending supports
government programs designed to increase production and employment, to achieve
a wider distribution of the benefits of economic growth, and to improve the

in Jamaica in the President's Report of November 21, 1977 for the Jamaica
Program Loan.

Bank's Executive Directors on December 13, 1977 and signed on December 16,

country's economic infrastructure where inadequate facilities are presently
constraining development. It is also an important objective of Bank lending
to strengthen the public sector institutions associated with Bank-financed
projects by supporting policies designed to improve the quality of management,
their operating procedures and finances.
30.       After a lull in Bank lending in 1972/73--resulting largely from
institutional constraints and slow project preparation--the pace of Bank opera-
tions picked up in FY74 and FY75, with an increased emphasis on projects in
the social sectors. Slow project preparation and, later in the period,
unsettled economic conditions reduced Bank lending to one loan each in FY76
and FY77. The current year lending program includes a $30 million Program
Loan approved in December 1/ and a proposed $20 million Second Power project
for electric power transmission and distribution, which is being presented
to the Executive Directors at about the same time as the proposed loan.
31.       In the last several months, there have been some project implementa-
tion difficulties with several of our projects (see Annex II). They have been
caused by the deterioration in general economic conditions (there has been a
particular problem in maintaining subloan repayments in intermediate credit
operations), the limitations of counterpart availability arising from fiscal
restraints and general preoccupation of Jamaica's economic managers with the
economic crisis. However, the Government is aware of these problems and is
adopting measures directed toward solving them.
32.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's fourth loan in the agriculture
sector. A loan for a rural development project was approved by the Executive
Directors in June 1977 and became effective in October 1977. Two loans for
agricultural credit have been made to the Jamaica Development Bank to help
meet the financing requirements for commercial farming and agro-industrial
development.
33.       In line with the Government's priorities and development strategy
Bank project lending will place increasing emphasis on projects to promote
exports, stimulate import substitution, increase employment and raise the
living standards for those in the lower economic strata. The project under
consideration addresses some of the key problems in Jamaica's second largest
export-earning industry. The proposed loan for Small Scale Enterprise is
in an advanced state of preparation and will assist the emerging entrepreneur
and small businessman. The project will have significant employment and
social benefits. In the coming years, the Bank hopes to support the Govern-
ment's efforts in the agricultural sector with possible financing of projects
for agricultural credit, irrigation, forestry and rural development. Identif-
ication and preparation work has begun on all of these projects.
1/   Jamaica has not yet met the conditions of disbursement which were estab-
lished under this loan. It is planned during the presentation of the two
new loans to the Executive Directors on Febuary 7 to make a statement
regarding the status of the Program Loan, taking into account the most
recent developments at that time, particularly with regard to the rela-
tions between Jamaica and the International Monetary Fund.



- 14 -
34.       In the social sectors, the Bank has been active in financing two
education projects, two population projects (the second of which contains an
important nutrition element) and a sites and services project. The Bank
expects to continue to support programs to improve social and physical
infrastructure in Kingston and other urban areas. Looking further ahead,
it is expected that a third education project will be prepared for possible
Bank financing. The possible scope and content of the project, however, has
not yet been defined. The Bank's share of external public debt outstanding
and disbursed was about 8% in 1976 and its share of external public debt
service was about 6% in that year. It is estimated that these percentages
will not vary significantly.
PART III - SECTORAL BACKGROUND
A. The Agricultural Sector
35.       The overall performance of the Jamaican agricultural sector has not
been commensurate with its physical potential. Over the last decade, produc-
tion has remained stagnant, resulting in a decline in agricultural output and
food production per capita. This has been particularly evident for export
crops, production of which has been decreasing at an annual rate of 5%. Al-
though food-crop production has increased in the last few ye,.rs, it has not
kept pace with domestic demand. As a result, food imports have increased at
an annual rate of 5% in real terms to reach US$130 million in 1975. More
recently, restrictions imposed by Government in 1976 reduced food imports to
US$90 million.
36.       Nevertheless, agriculture is still a major source of income and
employment in Jamaica. In spite of continuous migration from the rural to
the urban areas in recent years, about 60% (1.2 million) of the population
still lives outside the urban centers. Hence agriculture, expecially sugar-
cane cultivation, has considerable impact on the economic and social develop-
ment of Jamaica. It currently contributes approximately 7% to GNP, over 30%
to national employment and about 13% to export earnings.
37.       Jamaican agriculture has traditionally consisted of two sectors,
namely: (a) the export-oriented, large-scale plantation sector engaged in
the production of cash crops and beef cattle and (b) small-scale farmers,
producing food crops and livestock, largely for domestic consumption. In
recent years, economic, social and political factors have changed this pat-
tern into 8 more diversified structure. Thus, the importance of the plan-
tation sector has declined, while at the same time, a small to medium-sized,
more capital-intensive commercial farm sector has emerged.
38.       The skewed distribution of land, with the considerable underutili-
zation of resources that has resulted, has been a major impediment to the
development of agriculture and the prosperity of rural areas. Agricultural
land is distributed among 192,000 holdings. Over 40% of such land is owned
by 630 large farms, two-thirds of which are owned by Government, the bauxite



- 15 -
companies, and (since 1976) the sugarcane-growing cooperatives. In recent
years Government has distributed sizeable tracts of land to about 20,000
smallholders and landless laborers under its Project Land Lease. Similar
land distribution schemes, including those under the Bank-financed First
Rural Development Project (Loan 1464-JM), are expected in the future.
39.       There is considerable poverty, underemployment, and unemployment in
the rural areas. About 80% of the rural population have incomes less than a
third of the national average (relative poverty) and at least a third of the
rural population earns less than the income considered necessary to provide
minimum calorific requirements (absolute poverty).
40.       The Government is well aware of the problems in the sector and,
with Bank assistance, undertook an in-depth agricultural sector study in
1973. This resulted in a Cabinet-approved policy for improving agricultural
production, rural infrastructure and enhancing rural living conditions.
Based on the recommendations of this study, the Government has initiated an
agricultural development program which has the following objectives: intensi-
fication of land utilization by introducing a progressive land tax and by
requiring owners of idle or underutilized holdings to intensify land use or
to make the property available via Government to landless people or small-
holders on a lease basis (Project Land Lease); increased credit availability;
introduction of improved farm inputs and practices through subsidies for
better planting materials, fertilizers, and soil conservation; encouragement
of production of sugar, bananas, and citrus by subsidized marketing services
through the Agricultural Marketing Corporation and guaranteed minimum prices;
expansion of food crop and livestock production through special development
projects and through the Government-owned Agricultural Development Corporation;
improvement in the effectiveness of the Ministry of Agriculture by centraliz-
ing its policy functions and decentralizing its program implementation and
service functions; and improvement of rural infrastructure.
41.       The Government's Emergency Production Plan calls for a substantial
increase in the output of food in order to replace food imports and for an
increase in per capita food consumption somewhat above 1976 levels. A princi-
pal objective of the Production Plan is to bring 50,000 acres of presently
unutilized land into production. This would be accomplished by providing an
additional J$18 million of credit to smallholders (5 acres or less) who are
now unable to farm their entire plots because of capital shortages, and
making available to small farmers 25,000 unutilized acres belonging to the
Government and the bauxite companies through Project Land Lease. The goals
of the Production Plan are consistent with those being established for the
sector in the Five Year Development Plan that is now under preparation.
42.       The success of the Government's strategy will depend on the ability
of the public sector to: implement the proposed schemes effectively; provide
a timely supply of agricultural inputs and adequate technical services,
especially for the development of the small-farm sector; and maintain a
favorable investment climate to facilitate expansion of the medium-sized
commercial farm sector.



- 16 -
B. The Sugar Sub-Sector
43.       Sugar has been produced in Jamaica for centuries.  The sugar
industry has long been a cornerstone of the economy, a major employer, an
important source of foreign exchange and, all too often, a center for social
and political controversy. Throughout the industry's history there have
been periods of growth and decline, determined by prevailing economic and
social conditions, but it has always adapted to these changes. The last
cycle began at the end of World War II. Sugar production increased from
178,000 tons in 1946, an all-time record until then, to 506,000 tons in 1965,
when the industrv employed directly over 60,000 people, and over 30,000
independent cane farmers delivered cane to 18 sugar factories. Since 1965,
however, the acreage devoted to cane cultivation, cane yields, and total cane
production have all steadily declined. Sugar production in 1976 was 360,000
tons and further declines have occurred in 1977 because of severe drought in
many cane-growing areas.
44.       Until the 1970s, approximately half of the cane acreage was owned
and operated by estates, the largest of which also owned the 18 factories
then in existence. The other half was owned by approximately 30,000 independ-
ent cane farmers. Of these a large number cultivated only a few acres of cane,
but at the other end of the scale were farmers who cultivated as much as 1,500
acres. Workers were employed both by the estates (in their fields and
factories) and by the larger farmers.
45.       Significant government participation in the industry began in 1970
when it created the Sugar Industry Authority (SIA) as overall industry coor-
dinator and bought the three largest estates on the island, Frome, Monymusk
and Bernard Lodge. At that time Government bought only the land and not the
three factories attached to the land, the original idea being to subdivide the
land into medium-sized parcels, so that they could be sold to independent cane
farmers. Before this occurred, however, a new Government-- which favored a
different approach to land reform, with emphasis on maintaining relatively
large units of production under cooperative ownership -- was installed. As a
result, by 1977 all the erstwhile estate lands had been subdivided into 23
cooperatives. The cooperatives were created without adequate planning and
this has in part been responsible for the labor problems and low productivity
that have been experienced. Since the factories whose rehabilitation consti-
tutes most of the project depend on the cooperatives for half their cane
supplies, were the cooperatives' performance to continue to decline, it might
result in under-utilization of the factories capacities once they are completely
rehabilitated.
46.       Originally, the Government had no intention of buying sugar faWtories,
its interests being mainly in the land. Policies and circumstances subsequently
changed and by 1977 Government had become the sole owner of the three factories,
which have over 60% of the sugar processing capacity of the country. These
three factories, which are the principal subject of the proposed project, are
now owned by wholly owned subsidiaries of the Government-controlled National
Sugar Company, Ltd. (National Sugar).

47.       Despite its most recent decline, sugar is still vital to the Jamaican
economy and social fabric; its cultivation represents the biggest area under a
single crop (30% of "land in farms"); it is still the most valuable export
crop; it produces the raw material, molasses, for the production of rum and
other alcoholic beverages; and it directly and indirectly provides employment
to some 50,000 people, or 6% of the total labor force. In 1977 sugar thus
remains the economic cornerstone of Jamaica's agriculture.
48.       The sugar industry has been beset by many problems and there have
been a variety of reasons for its recent decline. They include the slowness
of industry management to adjust to changing economic and political cir-
cumstances; the militancy of the unions which represent industry workers
and a consequent decline in areas under cane because of labor difficulties;
limitations on finance available for proper factory maintenance and improve-
ments; the reluctance of private owners to invest during a period of increased
Government emphasis on public sector participation in the industry and, more
recently, foreign-exchange shortages and resultant limitations on finance
available for public sector entities; wasteful cane harvesting, loading and
transport practices which have reduced cane quality, sugar production and
industrial efficiency; and competition for skilled personnel from other
industries which could afford to pay higher salaries. The Government,
while aware of the very difficult situation in the sugar industry, remains
convinced of its continuing vital role in the country's economy as a means
of providing employment and foreign exchange. It has therefore attached the
highest priority to avoiding further declines in sugar production and to
building a suitable basis for future growth in this vital segment of Jamaica's
economy.
49.       To accomplish its objective, Government has begun to take action on
the following measures: maintaining a guaranteed-price system to protect
cane farmers and factories from the severe fluctuations in world sugar prices
which have taken place in the past, thereby providing appropriate incentive
to farmers for continuing producing cane; taking over responsibility for
operating factories which would otherwise go out of production; promoting
fuller worker participation in the industry by the establishment of cane-
growing cooperatives and inclusion of labor representatives in factory
management; improving agronomic practices through increased research and
extension of the Sugar Industry Research Institute (SIRI); improving training
of factory and field personnel through on-the-job training and formal courses
administered by SIRI; and modernizing factories, which is the subject of the
proposed project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
A.   Pro_ect Concept
50.       The project was first conceived in mid-1972 when the Government re-
quested Bank assistance in the preparation of proposals for assistance to the
sugar industry. While the Bank's initial response was that a comprehensive



- 18 -
development plan should be drawn up to assess the requirements of all indus-
try segments, subsequent developments--most notably, the establishment of
canefield cooperatives--made it clear that a comprehensive solution to all
industry problems within the framework of one project was not possible. The
politically sensitive problems of the cooperatives and the complex technical
problems of cane and sugar production suggested a step-by-step approach to
Bank financial assistance, which would begin with the most pressing and
manageable problems. The Bank therefore agreed with the Government to
consider the project for the rehabilitation of the main sugar factories,
which would also include the study of other problems within the industry.
51.       The project's principal objectives are to maintain sugar production
in factories that are currently in need of rehabilitation, and to raise the
sugar industry's efficiency from the current unsatisfactory levels. This
would be accomplished by re-equipping the three key factories so that the
deterioration in operating conditions, efficiency and sugar output which has
taken place over the last decade may be reversed, and by providing technical
assistance to help the industry improve the efficiency of its harvesting and
factory operations. The three factories have been selected as the key to the
sugar industry's future, because, comprising over 60% of the island's sugar
producing capacity, they must remain in operation under any circumstances.
They are within the present management capability of National Sugar, and the
experience gained in their rehabilitation and operation could be used in the
future for other factories in the sector.
52.       To help arrest declines in factory efficiency and productivity, the
following measures have been taken, or will be included in the project:
(a)  Overmanning.  National Sugar has submitted an analysis of
future manning requirements of the three factories to the
Bank and has agreed to prepare and carry out a plan satis-
factory to the Bank which would reduce overmanning in the
factories (Section 3.04, Project Agreement). The Govern-
ment has agreed to this plan and to prevent any of its
agencies from taking any actions which would prevent or
interfere with its executions (Section 3.03, Guarantee
Agreement).
(b) Operational Problems. To remedy operational problems at
the factories, National Sugar will engage consultants
acceptable to the Bank to prepare suitable operating and
maintenance plans and provide in-factory training for per-
sonnel involved in milling operations at the three factories
(Section 2.02, Project Agreement) and Schedule 2, Parts B(2)
and (3), Loan Agreement).
(c) Management. National Sugar will continue to employ an
experienced and competent chief executive officer, technical
director and financial director (Section 3.01 (b), Project
Agreement) and analyze its training, management and organi-
zational needs (Section 2.08, Project Agreement).



- 19 -
53.       To help arrest declines in canefield efficiency and productivity,
the following measures have been taken, or will be included in the project.
(a) Cane Harvesting. Present harvesting practice--burning
canefields prior to cutting and gathering cut cane with
"push-pile" loaders--results in sugar losses of as much
as 10% in comparison with harvesting green (i.e., unburned)
cane and loading by means other than push-piling. SIA has
agreed to pay incentives to farmers for cane harvested
and loaded using the recommended procedures, starting with
1978 crop. While these measures would be satisfactory for
the coming crop, more intense study is required to propose
a solution to the problem over the longer term, and a
condition of loan effectiveness is that SIA make arrangements
to engage consultants to make long-term recommendations
based on such a study (Section 7.01(b), Loan Agreement).
(b) The Cooperatives. In order to improve the efficiency and
operation of the cane-growing cooperatives, the Government
has established in the Ministry of Agriculture a Cooperative
Development Center to study in depth the problems of training,
management, organization, rationalization of wages and manning
of the cooperatives. These studies are being performed on a
continuing basis and the Government will consult with the Bank
from time to time on their results.
B.   Prolect Description, Cost and Financing
54.       The project consists of physical works to rehabilitate Jamaica's
only sugar refinery and the three largest raw-sugar factories--Frome, Monymusk
and Bernard Lodge--and a technical assistance program to improve the effi-
ciency of cane and sugar production. The physical works consist of a large
number of individual components to replace and/or renovate worn-out or
outmoded facilities, improve efficiency in all industrial phases of sugar
production--cane reception facilities; cane carriers, preparation equip-
ment, milling equipment; steam production, electricity generation, and
cooling-water systems; boiling, crystallization and centrifugal systems;
and sugar storage and bagging facilities--at the three factories and
Monymusk refinery. The installation of materials and equipment, begun in
1977, would be carried out during the out-of-crop seasons (roughly from July
through November) through 1982. The technical assistance consists of the
studies and retention of consultants described in the preceding two paragraphs.

55.       The project's estimated cost totals US$33.8 million with a US$18.9
million foreign component as summarized below:
Local    Foreign    Total
---in millions of US$----
1.   Physical works:
Frome Factory               4.50       6.08     10.58

Total cost              14.90      18.90     33.80
56.       The proposed Bank loan would finance the estimated foreign-exchange
component, except for US$0.9 million of refinery equipment ordered without
international competitive bidding, as prescribed by the Bank Guidelines, prior
to appraisal. Net internal cash generation of National Sugar plus loans from
SIA totalling J$10 million would cover the local-cost financing requirements.
SIA would be capable of providing this amount of financing without government
support unless free-market world sugar prices remained at the extremely
low levels (below US$0.09 per pound) prevailing during part of 1977.
The proposed Bank loan would be made to SIA, with Jamaica as guarantor,
at the current Bank interest rate and a 17-year term, including 4 years
of grace. SIA, which would bear the foreign-exchange risk, would relend the
portion of the loan (about US$17.6 million equivalent--the remaining US$0.4
million equivalent would be for studies under SIA's responsibility) pertaining
to physical works and factory technical assistance to National Sugar. The
subloan will be denominated in Jamaican dollars at an interest rate of 12% and
for the same term and grace period as the Bank loan. A condition of loan
effectiveness is that SIA and National Sugar had reached agreement acceptable
to the Bank on re-lending terms (Section 7.01(a), Loan Agreement).



- 21 -
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
57.       Because of the advanced degree of deterioration of boilers at Frome
and Monymusk and the absence of water-level controls at Bernard Lodge, it
is doubtful that the factories could operate with satisfactory reliability
during the 1978 harvest season. To correct these deficiencies, National Sugar
has placed a number of orders for necessary items of equipment and parts to
correct this unsatisfactory situation, generally with the original equipment
manufacturers. Up to US$1.2 million of loan funds may be used to finance
such purchases (Schedule 1, para. 4(a), Loan Agreement).
58.       In addition to the equipment described in the preceding paragraph,
National Sugar would obtain specialized cane preparation knives and boiling
aids, which are relatively new devices made by only one manufacturer, by
direct procurement. All other contracts for Bank-financed plant and equipment
(including initial spare parts) would be awarded following international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement.
A 15% margin of preference will be permitted Jamaican manufacturers who have a
local value added of at least 20% in bid items. Local manufacturers may be in
a position to win contracts for air heaters, de-aerators and various boiler
parts and accessories with a total estimated cost of about US$3 million.
59.       Disbursements from the loan account would be made for 100% of the
expenditures for foreign consultants' services; 90% of the expenditures for
local consultants services (although it is unlikely that qualified local
consultants would be available); and 100% of the cif cost of imported equip-
ment and materials, and/or 100% of the ex-factory cost of domestically manu-
factured items, including the cost of supervision of erection and installation
and the engineering fees of National Sugar's technical advisor.
60.       The estimated disbursement schedule is as follows:
US$ Million
FY78     FY79      FY80     FY81      FY82     FY83
Annual                1.2       3.1      4.7       4.0      2.9       2.1
Cummulative           1.2       4.3      9.0      13.0     15.9      18.0
D.   Project Implementation
61.       SIA is a statutory body which, while nominally accountable to the
Minister of Agriculture, operates with a high degree of autonomy. Its pr-in-
cipal responsibilities are: direction of sugar marketing, internally and for
export; making development loans to cane farmers and sugar factories; pro-
posing pricing arangements for cane and sugar to Government under the
guaranteed-price scheme; canefield and factory research, extension and train-
ing through SIRI; and overall industry coordination.



- 22 -
62.       For a period of time, SIA has not had a qualified financial comp-
troller, and a number of deficiencies have existed in its accounting and audit
arrangements. SIA has agreed to hire a full-time financial comptroller
(Section 4.04, Loan Agreement) and to have audited financial statements and
an audit report prepared by an acceptable firm provided to the Bank (Section
5.02, Loan Agreement).
63.       The proposed loan's principal beneficiary, National Sugar, was
formed in 1975 but did not become active until October 1, 1976. A holding
company with a small headquarters staff in Kingston, its shares are owned or
controlled by government agencies. It now controls through wholly owned
subsidiaries four sugar factories and related facilities and operates a fifth
factory--Holland--which the Government has owned for some time.
64.       While National Sugar's accounting system is satisfactory, its
accounts do not reflect the real value of its property, since the assets of
its subsidiaries have not been revalued sufficiently to reflect high rates
of inflation which have occurred in Jamaica, especially in the recent past.
National Sugar has agreed to revalue its assets at the end of its 1978 fiscal
year and whenever future price levels increase by 25% from the previous
revaluation (Section 3.05, Project Agreement).
65.       The Government, SIA and National Sugar have recognized the need to
establish a plan of action for the carrying out of the project and have agreed
that the presentation of such a plan would be a condition of loan effective-
ness of the project (Section 7.01(c), Loan Agreement). Under the plan of
action, they would confirm various arrangements that have been or will be made
to secure more efficient cane cultivation and factory performance.
E.   Production and Marketing
66.       There are three principal markets for Jamaican sugar:  local (which
includes relatively minor sales to other Caribbean countries); quota to the
European Economic Community (EEC); and other export sales. Based on expected
sugar production (net of conversion losses) of the three key factories and on
continued stabilized production of 140,000 tons/year from the other factories
in Jamaica, the total national production and sales are estimated as below
(in thousands of tons):

Total                     347    352    359    363    364        363

- other                   111    105    110    113    113        111

Total                     347    352    359    363    364        363
67.       As is the prevailing practice in many Caribbean countries, wholesale
and retail prices for domestic consumption of certain grades of sugar are kept
artificially low by Government. In this respect, the Government has decided
to maintain its policy of low prices for certain grades of sugar which are diet
staples of the low-income segment of the population.  Beginning in 1976,
Government has, however, reimbursed SIA for its losses from sales of local
sugar under informal arrangements. The Government has agreed that it would
continue to reimburse SIA for the losses SIA incurs on sales of sugar within
the country (Section 3.04, Guarantee Agreement).
68.       Jamaica's EEC-quota sales result from the Lome convention, which
gears prices to beet-sugar costs in EEC member nations. At the current price
of 272.5 units of account (J$440)/ton f.o.b. for raw sugar, this provides
Jamaica with a profitable outlet for 125,000 tons per annum at least through
1980 (the earliest terminal date) and possibly into the future (since there is
no present indication that the arrangement, which would continue until two
years' termination notice is given, will not continue). The balance of export
sales occurs in other markets. Jamaica's quota under the new October 1977
negotiated International Sugar Agreement (ISA) will provide Jamaica with a
market for 130,000 tons of sugar per year. As indicated in the table in
paragraph 66 above, Jamaica's current and anticipated sugar production will
fall significantly below the amount required to fill its quota under the ISA.
The ISA attempts to provide price stability to a volatile market, which has
seen prices range from US$0.65/lb. in November 1974 to just over US$0.07/lb.
in mid-1976. Under the new ISA, which assigns quotas to all sugar-exporting
signatories and provides for the accumulation of stocks up to 2.5 million tons
of sugar by sugar exporters, a stabilization price target range of US$0.11 to
0.21/lb. will be established. It is expected that the current oversupply
situation will be corrected by 1980 and that sugar prices will approach the
long-run marginal production cost of about US$0.14/lb. Because of increasing
competition from lower cost substitutes, most notably liquid sweeteners
derived from corn (HFCS - high fructose corn syrup), it is possible that sugar
price increases will be limited, and a price of US$0.13/lb. has been used in



- 24 -
financial projections for SIA, beginning 1980. HFCS is available at prices
20% lower than equivalent refined sugar prices, is virtually interchangeable
with sugar in many industrial uses and is expected to capture 20 to 25% of the
US sweetener market by the 1980s.
F.   Financial Analysis
69.       National Sugar's financial results are expected to be extremely poor
in 1977 but to improve in 1978 and continue improving throughout the project
implementation period, as summarized below.
1977     1978      1982
---millions of US$----
Revenues                            22.5      27.8      31.2
Operating income                    -6.2      -3.3      -0.4
The improvement in 1978 is expected to result principally from improved
rainfall and resultant increases in cane supply. Over the longer term,
rationalization of the factories' manpower requirements and more efficient
factory operations resulting from the proposed project would be reflected in
increased factory profitability.
70.       Because of their substandard financial results for several years,
particularly 1977, the National Sugar subsidiaries which own the Monymusk and
Bernard Lodge factories have been unable to meet the debt service on loans
owed to SIA and the commercial banks. The Government has agreed to furnish
the Bank, for its review and comment, proposals for its or SIA's consoli-
dation and assumption of these loans (Section 3.06, Guarantee Agreement).
71.       The three-factory 1978-82 financing plan is summarized below (in
1977 J$ million):
Amount        Percent
Availability of funds
Net internal cash generation             11.6           26
Borrowings:
IBRD loan                             22.0           50
SIA local-cost loans                  10.6           24
Total borrowings                   32.6           74
Total availability                 44.2          100

Increase in working capital               0.9            2
Total requirements             44.2          100



- 25 -
The financing plan, under which net internal cash generation would provide
26% of the three companies' requirements for the period, would be satisfactory
if prices and labor costs in Jamaica were to stabilize at 1977 levels. To
allow for the effect of future inflation or other unforeseen cost increases,
SIA and Government have agreed that revenues from sugar production will be
adjusted in such manner that the three factories can finance at least 30% of
their construction programs from net internal cash generation and/or con-
cessionary loans from SIA (Section 3.05, Guarantee Agreement and Section 5.06,
Loan Agreement). SIA has agreed to provide the sugar factories with capital
rehabilitation loans of J$2 per ton of cane milled, on terms which shall
include a minimum grace period on principal and interest of at least five
years, provided the factories invest the proceeds of such loans in equipment
designed to increase productivity (Section 5.07, Loan Agreement). Prices and
payments in this manner would provide management of National Sugar sufficient
financial independence to carry out their operating responsibilities without
undue reliance on outside borrowings.
72.       To complete the financing plan, loans of J$10 million (in 1977
terms) from SIA's Development Fund would be required for part of the local-
cost component of the rehabilitation project. Such amounts as may be
necessary to complete the project's financing plan will be loaned by SIA
to National Sugar (Section 5.08, Loan Agreement).
73.       SIA's ability to provide such financing depends largely on world
prices. To test its capability, three sets of projections have been carried
out to show the year-by-year net cash inflows to SIA (after disbursements on
all its loan funds including those for the proposed project) under different
assumptions of price levels: those considered most likely (increasing from
the expected average 1978 price of US$.106/lb. to US$.130/lb. by 1982);
stabilization at the minimum US$.11/lb. ISA price beginning in 1979; and
continuation of abnormally low (US$.08/lb.) prices throughout the period. The
results of these computations are summarized below (in 1977 J$ millions):

To guard against the possibility of an extended period of low free-market
sugar prices or other unforeseen economic circumstances, the Government
has agreed that it would provide financing to complete the project if SIA and
National Sugar are unable to do so (Section 2.02, Guarantee Agreement). How-
ever, the sugar industry cannot afford to subsidize the losses of cane-growing
cooperatives by providing them special loan terms. Therefore, SIA will not
provide financing to any cane-growing farmer (which includes cooperatives
growing cane) that is not available to any other cane farmer of similar size
(Section 5.04, Loan Agreement).
H.   Economic Analysis
74.       The primary benefit of the proposed project would be the prevention
of the loss in annual production of about 45,000 tons of sugar which would occur
unless the three factories were rehabilitated. This level of production would
furnish Jamaica with net foreign-exchange earnings of about US$8.1 million per
annum, and would utilize about 1,600 man-years per annum in canefield labor
requirements.
75.       Additional project benefits would be reduction in operating costs
(and lower foreign-exchange expenditures for fuel) resulting from reducing
or eliminating excess factory stoppages, increases in refined sugar output to
meet local requriements (with consequent foreign exchange savings), and
improvements in cane cultivation, harvesting and transport which would result
directly or indirectly from the project.
76.       In addition to these measurable effects, it is felt that if the
sugar industry's deterioration is not arrested now, it will accelerate,
eventually endangering the livelihoods of most of the 50,000 Jamaicans now
employed by the industry. To prevent this long-run effect, it is necessary
to take measures now to begin to eliminate unproductive employment and allow
management to reinstate desired efficiency levels at the key factories. In
comparison to the long-run preservation of employment which the project would
seek to achieve, the recommended reduction of superfluous employment
(totalling about 400 people at the three key factories) is small.
77.       Using only the measurable benefits directly attributable to the
project, and assuming that (a) world sugar prices stabilize at the minimum
level prescribed in the new ISA (US$0.11/lb.) beginning in 1979 after re-
maining at the current free market 1977 levels (US$0.08/lb.) in 1978;
(b) the most likely long-term availability of cane prevails; and (c) the
most likely estimate of investment costs prevail--the project's overall
economic rate of return would be 51%. Assuming world sugar prices remain
at the depressed 1977 free market level of US$0.08/lb. and no other changes in
assumptions, the economic rate of return of the project would be 25%. If all
of the worst case assumptions prevailed--a 25% increase in estimated invest-
ment costs, a minimum foreseeable cane availability and the continuation of
current depressed world market sugar prices--the project's overall economic
rate of return would be 9%. Relatively high rates of return, such as those
calculated for this project, are not unusual for rehabilitation projects.
In this project, the estimated investment cost is about half of what equivalent
new capacity would cost, and incremental operating costs are negligible.

I.   Project Risks
78.       Security of cane supply is a vital condition for efficient sugar-
factory operation. Under the worst case assumptions, however, cane production
in the Monymusk and Bernard Lodge areas could decline to levels below the
factory capacities after rehabilitation. Government has already taken some
steps--provision of loans for farmers and initial measures to control smut
disease--to maintain cane production in those and other areas, and intends to
adopt other measures directed at improving conditions for cane cultivation.
However, the central problems of the cooperatives--weak agricultural manage-
ment, sub-optimal agricultural, harvesting, loading and transport practices,
strained relations between management and worker/members--could reduce cane
availability. As indicated in paragraph 53(b) above, the Government has
recognized this problem and established a Cooperative Development Center in
the Ministry of Agriculture to direct its efforts to improve the efficiency
and operation of the cooperatives. The success of the project will depend, in
part, on the Government's ability to deal with the problems affecting cane
production. Not going ahead with the project could lead to further deteriora-
tion of the factories and of the sugar industry with the consequent serious
reductions in employment and foreign exchange earnings. Considering all of
the circumstances, we believe that the project risks are acceptable and that
there is a suitable basis for proceeding with the proposed loan.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
79.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Sugar Industry
Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Bank and Jamaica, the
draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the National Sugar Company, Ltd.,
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex III,
Section III. Additional conditions of effectiveness are that SIA make
arrangements to engage consultants to study and make recommendations on cane
harvesting practices, that SIA and National Sugar reach an agreement accept-
able to the Bank on re-lending terms and that the Government National Sugar
and SIA furnish the Bank with a plan of action satisfactory for the carrying
out of the project.
80.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
81.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   Projects in Execution
Ln. No. 727    Second Education Project; US$13.5 million of March 25, 1971;
Effective Date: July 30, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Project implementation is about three years behind appraisal
schedule due to a change in government, high turnover in project unit staff
and a lack of project implementation machinery. However, project implemen-
tation now seems satisfactory. As a result of initial delays in getting the
physical aspects of the project underway, the construction of schools will
not be completed before August 1978. Thus, the Closing Date, originally
December 31, 1975, has been extended to December 31, 1978. Due to sharp
increases in prices and wages in the construction sector since appraisal,
estimated project costs are about 100% greater than originally anticipated.
Counterpart funds are available, however, to allow project implementation to
proceed satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 899    Road Improvement and Maintenance Project; US$9.3 million of
June 1, 1973; Effective Date: August 31, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
After some initial delays and quality control problems, the
resurfacing and resealing program is proceeding satisfactorily. The technical
assistance and training programs of the consultants are also proceeding satis-
factorily. Total project costs are estimated to be about 50% above the
appraisal estimate due to increased costs of asphaltic overlay.

ANNEX II
Ln. No. 1003   Sites and Services Project; US$15.0 million of June 13, 1974;
Effective Date: September 9, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Delays in the project have been caused by initial start-up
problems, political violence and ineffective management controls. The project
is about 18 months behind schedule and costs are running 50% more than antici-
pated. The Government has recently agreed to adopt measures suggested by the
Bank to improve management systems and controls.
Ln. No. 1004   Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$5.5 million of
June 13, 1974; Effective Date: October 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The worsening general economic situation and difficult drought
conditions over the last year have had a negative impact on the Borrower (the
Jamaica Development Bank) and the project. As a result arrears on principal
and interest payments have risen to unacceptable levels. The Bank has
suggested that the Jamaica Development Bank initiate an in-depth review of its
loan portfolio, which includes the reappraisal and rescheduling of loans and
the strengthening of collection activities.
Ln. No. 1032   Third Highway Project; US$13.5 million of July 26, 1974;
Effective Date: September 27, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Construction has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions,
redesign of some sections, unsuccessful tenders and labor problems. As a
result, it will be necessary to extend the project closing date by two years.
It is estimated that the project will have a cost overrun of 50%.
Ln. No. 1043   Airport Development Project; US$12.5 million of October 2, 1974;
Effective Date: March 14, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
All major contracts have now been awarded, but earlier delays
encountered during the design and award phases, mean that the project comple-
tion date will slip from 12 to 18 months, and the project cost will probably
exceed appraisal estimates by about 10%. Though execution of work in progress
has been slower than expected, the Government's tight fiscal situation makes
the revised construction schedule more acceptable. The Airports Authority's
aggressive management has improved this institution's financial position in
spite of reduced traffic and high inflation. Nonetheless, the Authority will
be unable to supply its contribution to the project financing plan. The short-
fall will be made up by the Government with help from the Venezuelan Investment
Fund.

Ln. No. 1146   Kingston Sewerage and Water Supply Project; US$15 million of
July 23, 1975; Effective Date: June 24, 1976;
Closing Date: September 30, 1979.
After some initial delays in establishing the project unit,
project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Construction has begun
on all of the subcomponents of the water supply construction program and been
completed on one of them. The Government has approved a water rate increase
required by the loan.
Ln. No. 1284   Second Population Project; US$6.8 million of June 17, 1976;
Effective Date: August 30, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
A good start in the implementation of the project has been made.
Civil works and procurement are on schedule and project costs are within
appraisal estimates.
Ln. No. 1464   Rural Development Project; US$15 million of June 29, 1977;
effective Date:  October 14, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The loan was declared effective on October 14, 1977 and project
implementation has only just begun.
