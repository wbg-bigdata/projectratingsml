                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Over 2011, the Project has pursued activities aimed at the introduction of the “one-stop-shop? business model for administration of all types of social assistance benefits countrywide.
                         The efficiency of client intake has notably improved, with all welfare offices now receiving applicants five days a week without lunch breaks compared to only half of offices in 2006.
                         Nearly all, 753 out of 756 local welfare offices (LWOs), have introduced a “one-stop-shop? business model entailing a single application for all types of social assistance and a single
                         set of documents to support this (only 23.7 per cent of LWOs offered a “one-stop shop? back in 2006). The new model has made possible reducing processing time from 4.5 to 1.4
                         hours per application. Such efficiency improvements have also yielded a higher number of benefits processed per social officer per month: 397 up from 260, and so contributed to

                         the MoSP’s efforts to contain the growing administrative costs of social assistance programs. Now fully completed, the SASMP-financed renovations in LWOs allowed delivery of
                         benefits and related services in better, more dignified conditions.

                         increasing functionality and coverage of benefit programs and is to be launched in 2012 in each local welfare office to support its daily operations. The MoSP has taken the
                         opportunity to consolidate the data, application and system management functions (that were originally planned for the 27 oblast offices) at two central sites, i.e. data processing
                         centers (DPCs). MIS implementation has accelerated during the second half of 2011, with 3 out of 4 MIS-related contracts now completed. Accordingly, the challenges faced by the
                         MoSP are shifting away from the challenges of the design and development phases (i.e., functional requirements specification and software development) to the challenge of
                         assembling all of the necessary elements required to configure, test and go-live with the new management system.

                         In sum, the prospects for the transition into the national roll-out phase in the first quarter of 2012 are good. Operational acceptance of new application software in Vinnutsia oblast
                         should be complete in mid April 2102. On March 1, 2012 the MoSP has signed the contract for new application software installment and data migration in all LWOs that was the last
                         contract to be signed to support MIS implementation. Thus, the technological underpinnings of the national roll-out are more-or-less in place. The challenges for successful roll-out
                         are concentrated in organizational and staffing realms at rayon/city level.

                         The series of capacity building and institutional development activities, including implementation of the Hybrid-means testing mechanism, social inspection and business model for
                         integration of the benefits with care services and activation policies, have been also contracted out to help improve the functioning of the LWOs, and to improve the targeting
                         accuracy of the social assistance system, which is critical to the achievement of the PDO.

                         By March 1, 2012 the Project disbursements had reached US$86.4 million (IBRD loan) and commitments under the loan had risen to US$93.1 million. The Project is the second-
                         fastest disbursing project in Ukraine.
