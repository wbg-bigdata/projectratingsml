     A.      SUMMARY

     1.      The proposed changes concern reallocation of proceeds of the Ukraine Social
     Assistance System Modernization Project (Loan 4807-UA) from the Category 2
     “Subvention for Modernization of local social welfare services? to the Category 1
     “Goods, works and services (other than consultants’ services), consultants’ services
     training, study tours, and operational costs?. The Borrower requested the reallocation of
     proceeds on the ground of significant saving of funds under Category 2. All renovation
     works under this Category have been completed and the amount left is sufficient to cover
     in full all the contractual amounts due. Meanwhile, a need to increase the funds under
     Category 1 arose. In order to implement a new Data Processing System of the Social
     Assistance System in an all-inclusive format and provide necessary hardware and
     software to the most distant Labor and Social Assistance Offices additional financial
     resources are required.

     The proposed changes do not affect the Project Development Objective.

     B.      PROJECT STATUS

     2.     The SASMP performance is rated Satisfactory because of well-advanced project
     implementation and good progress made in achieving project outputs and outcomes. 90
     percent of the loan proceeds have been disbursed to date.

     C.      PROPOSED CHANGES

     3.     In view of the above it is proposed to reallocate savings amounting to US$
     2,554,200 from the Category 2 “Subvention for Modernization of local social welfare
     services? to the Category 1 “Goods, works and services (other than consultants’ services),
     consultants’ services , training, study tours, and operational costs?.
