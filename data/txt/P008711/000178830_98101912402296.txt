I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Romania proposes to build a seamless pipe plant
at Roman, about 500 km northwest of Bucharest (Map IBRD 10895R). The project,
to be operated by the existing Roman Enterprise within the Industrial Central
for Metallurgical Processes, is designed for a capacity of about 130,000 tons
of large diameter seamless pipes per year, with a diameter range of 270-680
mm, and a wide variety of wall thickness and steel grades. Technology will
be based on the well-proven Pilger process. Preliminary work for the imple-
mentation of the project has begun and commissioning is expected to take
place in late 1981.
1.02      Large diameter seamless pipes are used primarily in petroleum
drilling and transportation, and other energy related areas. The project is
part of the Government's overall development strategy to promote rapid expan-
sion of domestic industry, and thus minimize reliance on imports of critical
products needed by the energy and industrial sectors. It will also earn
critically needed foreign exchange as about half of the production will be
exported. It is expected that half of exports will be destined to COMECON
countries and the other half to the international market where it will account
for about 3% of total trade. Although world market opportunities now appear
favorable, in case they would fall below expectations, the COMECON countries
and China could absorb the entire exports from the project. The total finan-
cing required by the project is estimated at Lei 2,510 million (US$139 mil-
lion), including Lei 1,340 million (US$74 million) foreign exchange. The
proposed Bank loan would be US$40 million, equivalent to 54% of the foreign
exchange cost of the project. The project was submitted to the Bank in May
1976 and reviewed by three preparation missions. Modifications of the project
scope were made in early 1977 and the project was appraised in March 1978 by a
mission consisting of Messrs. Michel Cognet and Donald Brown (from the Indus-
trial Projects Department) and Albert Scribbins (consultant). In addition,
two other consultants were used to review both the domestic and export markets
for large seamless pipes.
II. THE SECTOR AND SUBSECTOR
A. The Industrial Sector
2.01      Industrial development is a key element in Romania's overall
development strategy. The concentrated effort to expand industry has had
impressive results. According to Romanian statistics, gross industrial
production grew at an average rate of about 13% per year during 1951-77, a
pace which was one of the highest among developing countries and is comparable
with the rates in Japan, Spain and Greece. World-wide, only Korea, Singapore
and Iran have shown significantly higher growth rates of industrial produc-
tion. As a result, industry's share in social product, expressed in current



-2-
prices, rose from about 47% in 1950 to 65% in 1977, and thus represented
(in 1975) about five times the contribution of agriculture. Added to these
achievements are the two million industrial jobs that have been created since
1950, with total industrial employment increasing to 3.4 million in 1977.
The share of industrial labor in the total labor force grew from 12% in 1950
to 31% in 1977. Labor force absorption in Romanian industry has been greater
than in countries with similar records of industrial growth although, in part,
this may be due to overstaffing and a political philosophy which requires
everyone to be employed.
2.02      To achieve maximum utilization of its natural resources as well
as efficient use of its labor potential, Romania has placed great emphasis
on the creation of basic industries that would use domestic raw materials
and also provide a base for more specialized secondary industries with good
potential for employment and improved labor productivity. In this context,
the output of capital goods grew at an average annual rate of 14.2% during
1951-77, compared to 10% per annum for consumer goods during the same period.
The leading growth sectors of industry were (i) chemicals utilizing the
country's hydrocarbon resources and other chemical raw materials and (ii)
metallurgical industries using available minerals and energy resources. A
shift of priority is gradually taking place from basic industries to process-
ing industries, notably engineering which grew at an annual rate of 18% over
the last five years.
2.03      Industries oriented mainly to the domestic market have for some
time been given priority since the achievement of certain levels of industrial
self-sufficiency has long been an important objective of Romania. However,
because of the rapidly growing import needs for equipment, technologies and
material supplies, there has been an increasing urgency in recent years to
develop industrial exports. Through energetic efforts, at times by suppressing
domestic demand and by vigorously promoting exports, Romania succeeded in
boosting its industrial exports from very low levels in the 1950's and early
1960's to US$1.7 billion in 1970 and US$5.1 billion in 1977. As a result, the
share of industrial products in total exports increased from about 25% in 1960
to 55% in 1977.
2.04      The current Five Year Plan (1976-80) and the guidelines for Romania's
economic and social development over the 1981-1990 period, call for continua-
tion of the past industrial strategy with particular attention to the expan-
sion of basic industries and of technologically advanced secondary industries.
Gross industrial production is planned to rise at 10-11% a year during 1976-80
and at a somewhat lower pace of 8-9% during 1981-90. The highest growth is
planned in the chemical and engineering subsectors, which are expected to
increase their share of gross industrial production from about 44% in 1975 to
55-60% in 1990. With the economy moving more and more into a net importer
position of energy and raw materials, the rapid growth rates in industrial
production will require a continuing growth in imports. To finance and
balance growing imports, total exports are required to grow at an average
annual rate of 12-13% until 1980, and then at an average rate of some 6.7%
until 1990. Four sectors are expected to take the lead in this expansion:



- 3 -
machinery and equipment, steel, chemicals and, to a lesser extent, industrial
consumer goods. All recent industrial projects in Romania financed by the Bank
have been in these subsectors. Major issues and problems related to the
future development of the industrial sector are discussed in more detail in
the basic Economic Report (No. 1601-RO) dated March 31, 1978.
B.   The Steel Industry in Romania
2.05      In 1950, total crude steel production in Romania was only about
half a million tons. During the 1950's, crude steel production increased at
an annual rate of 13% and during the following decade at 13.7%. Since 1970,
the growth rate has declined to about 9% per year. This growth pattern
reflects the emphasis placed in Romania on the creation of basic industries
that in turn will provide the base for more specialized secondary industries.
Crude steel production reached 12.0 million tons per year (tpy) in 1977,
accounting for about 8% of gross industrial output. The major indicators of
the Romanian steel industry and their evolution over the past 15 years are
given in the table below.

a/   1977 figures are not yet available, except for crude steel production
which increased to 12.0 million tons.
2.06      The Romanian steel industry developed based on domestic raw mate-
rials, in particular iron ore and coking coal.  However, production of iron
ore did not keep pace with the expansion of the steel industry and Romania's
dependence on foreign supplies has sharply increased from 35% in 1960 to 80%
in 1976. To a lesser extent, a comparable evolution was experienced with
coking coal production with imports now accounting for 55% of requirements as
compared with 45% in 1960.



2.07      In Romania, per capita steel consumption was only 132 kg in 1960,
but since then has increased to about 500 kg, i.e. to a level comparable with
many industrialized nations. The development of the steel industry has been
primarily oriented towards meeting the domestic market requirements. However,
in spite of concerted efforts to bridge the gap between imports and exports,
Romania is still a net importer of steel products, primarily high alloy and/or
specialized steel, of about 1.0 million tpy, which is equivalent to 12% of
domestic consumption.
2.08      As is typical of capital intensive industries, the share of the
Romanian steel industry in total industrial investments has been well in
excess of its share in job creation. With an average of 10% of industrial
investment over the past 15 years, the steel industry provides direct employ-
ment for about 100,000 workers, less than 4% of the industrial labor force.
Early investments were located in the Western part of the country near iron
ore and coking coal resources. More recent investments have been close to
market areas and along navigable waterways to facilitate the transport of
incoming raw materials and outgoing finished products. Although the major
investments in steel expansion were made in recent years, an important share
of production is still based on the old open hearth furnace. In Romania,
this process accounts for 60% of production, whereas in the rest of the
world, it has decreased on average to less than 20% and is further declining
as old facilities are gradually being shut down.
2.09      In the current 1976-80 Five Year Plan, crude steel production is
planned to increase from 12 million tpy in 1977 to 17 million tpy in 1980,
through the further expansion of existing facilities and the development of
a new integrated steel complex on the Danube river. Several factors will
likely curtail or delay these ambitious expansion plans. Constraints may be
imposed by the limitations of domestic raw material supplies (iron ore and
coking coal) and a longer than planned implementation period of the new steel
works. Also, from the steel demand side, factors may call for a slower pace
of expansion. In particular, steel consumption per capita in Romania would
have to reach 650 kg in 1980 as compared to the present range of between 450
and 700 kg in industrial nations.
C.   The Steel Pipe Industry in Romania
1.   Past Development of the Steel Pipe Industry
2.10      Romania was one of the earliest producers of crude petroleum and
the country's first pipe-rolling mill was installed in Bucharest in 1933 to
produce seamless pipes for oil exploration, production, and transportation.
By 1960, total pipe production (seamless plus welded) reached 300,000 tpy.
Later on, Government policy towards rapid industrialization was a major factor
for the expansion of the pipe industry. Between 1960 and 1977 total welded
and seamless pipe production increased by an average 8% per annum to 1.3 mil-
lion tons in 1977. During this period, production of welded pipes developed



- 5-
faster than that of seamless pipes, in line with a world-wide trend of growing
substitution from seamless to welded pipes, due to improved welding techniques
and cheaper fabrication costs. Now, overall pipe production in Romania is
equally split between the two types of pipes, as shown in the table below:

2.11      Although traditionally Romania has supplied pipe products to the
CO4ECON countries to which in 1977 about 80% of exports went, the development
of the industry has been primarily aimed at meeting the domestic requirements.
As shown above, imports have been kept at the same level of about 100,000 tpy
since 1960, and production now meets more than 90% of domestic requirements,
as compared with 70% in 1960. Although exports doubled in volume, their share
of production declined from 45% in 1960 to 27% in 1977. Yet, with 372,000
tons of exports in 1977, Romania remains an important pipe exporter.



- 6 -
2.12      The development of the pipe industry in Romania has been favored by
important advantages the country enjoys. First, the domestic market has been
large enough to support viable production in economic terms for various pipe
specifications. Second, Romania has a large number of skilled and disciplined
workers available at a fraction of the cost of the wages paid in developed
countries. Third, steel pipes being standard products, their production
utilizes relatively simple machinery and equipment; interestingly enough,
Romania has developed a capacity to fabricate certain types of equipment for
pipe production and some recent mills have been almost entirely built in
Romania. Fourth, steel products, the main input for pipe production, have
been available in the country since an early stage. Finally, the centralized
planning system has brought an element of certainty to demand and supply,
permitting production facilities to work generally at full capacity, a crucial
advantage for a capital intensive industry such as the pipe industry. Taking
these factors into account, and also the considerable experience accumulated
over the last 40 years, Romania has been well placed to develop a competitive
pipe industry. It will continue to do so provided further investments are
based on a realistic assessment of domestic and international market require-
ments (see Chapter IV).
2.   Steel Pipe Industry Organization
2.13      In Romania, manufacturing of pipes comes under the Ministry of
Metallurgical Industries which also deals with the steel industry. The orga-
nizational structure of the pipe industry has the same three-step hierarchy
as all industrial sectors in Romania, comprising the Technical Ministry, the
Industrial Central, and the Enterprise. The Ministry is responsible for the
planning and performance of its sector for which it also approves proposed
investments for subsequent submission to the Council of State , the highest
authority, for final approval. Also under the Ministry of Metallurgical
Industries and relevant to the pipe industry are the following: IPROLAM,
the institute for engineering of rolling mills; METAROM, the import agency
for metallurgical equipment and technology; and METALIMPORTEXPORT, the agency
for the exportation of steel products, including steel pipes.
2.14      The Industrial Central of Metallurgical Processing (CIPM) is respon-
sible for the production and domestic sales of steel pipe and wire-drawn
products. All enterprises engaged in the manufacturing of these products fall
under the jurisdiction of CIPM, which has been acting so far, in a sense, as
a holding company, allocating production programs and financial resources,
coordinating local purchases and domestic sales and monitoring performance.
However, the Central's role and responsibilities are expected to be redefined
as a consequence of the recent move in Romania towards giving more autonomy to
enterprises (para. 3.05). CIPM's headquarters are located in Bucharest, with
a staff of about 200, under five functional departments (production, techno-
logical, commercial, finance, and personnel). CIPM senior staff generally
also act in similar functions in one of the enterprises and provide opera-
tional technical assistance to all enterprises. Steel pipe-producing enter-
prises, which account for most of CIPM's activity are described below.



3.   Capacity and Future Developments
2.15      Steel pipes are produced by three enterprises, employing a total of
about 15,000 workers. Republica, located in Bucharest, produces both seamless
(220,000 tpy) and welded (127,000 tpy) pipes, Iasi, in the northeastern
corner of the country, specializes in welded pipes (503,000 tpy); and Roman,
located in the same area, specializes in seamless pipes (470,000 tpy).
Existing and future pipe production facilities, capacity, and production are
outlined in the following page.
2.16      The welded pipe facilities were built more recently and they use
modern technology with the majority of the large pipes being manufactured by
the helicoidal process. Seamless pipe mills are older and are mostly based
on the "Stiefel" process (plug mill) which is an old technology, but still
widely employed around the world. Overall, production facilities are well
maintained and they appear to be run efficiently. Some minor damage was
caused in Republica by the 1977 earthquake, but the adverse effect on
production was marginal. Except for facilities which have been recently
commissioned, pipe works now operate at full capacity.
2.17      The product mix of the Romanian pipe industry is comprehensive
(except for the large seamless pipes which will be produced by the proposed
project) and covers a wide range of diameters, wall thicknesses and steel
grades. Product quality is recognized as an important factor and most of
the pipes are produced according to international standards such as those
of the American Petroleum Institute (API) for casings and line pipes and
Deutsche Ingenieur Normen (DIN) for boiler tubes. Romania is authorized to
use the API monogram and compliance with API standards is regularly checked
by TUBOSCOPE, a reputed international inspecting agency.
2.18      Expansion plans for the pipe industry are very ambitious.  They
call for almost a doubling of capacity by 1985 for seamless pipes and a 50%
increase for welded pipes. Investments before 1980 have already been decided
and are included in the National Five Year Plan (1976-80). In line with the
regional development policy, the Plan foresees the creation of two new enter-
prises, one at Zalau (northwest) and the other at Zimnicea (south). At Zalau,
a 300,000 tpy continuous mill is already being installed for the production of
small diameter seamless pipes. This is a large volume and highly productive
project, using latest technology (mandrel mill). At Zimnicea, the new pipe
works will include two helicoidal welded lines, with a capacity of 35,000 tpy
each to produce very large diameter welded pipes.  Except for the proposed
project, other investments in the Five Year Plan are minor and they will be
undertaken by existing enterprises. Projects to be started after 1980
are still at the planning stage and no decision will be made until the Five
Year Plan (1981-85) is completed and approved. The major projects which were
tentatively contemplated at the time of appraisal include expansion of the
Zalau continuous mill by 100,000 tpy small diameter seamless pipes and instal-
lation of two longitudinal welded lines at Zimnicea for small diameter pipes

with a capacity of 110,000 tpy each. Were these projects to proceed, seamless
pipe capacity would be further expanded betwen 1981 and 1985 by 10% and welded
pipe capacity by 30%.
2.19      According to Romanian data, all new investments in pipe production
will be geared towards the domestic market. However, the Bank's analysis
indicates that the domestic market will not be large enough to sustain the
investment program outlined above, as discussed in detail in Chapter IV.
4.   Availability of Steel Product Inputs
2.20      Most of the steel products used for pipe production are available
in the country. However, for historical as well as regional development
considerations, none of the pipe-producing enterprises is located close to
a steel plant, resulting in additional transport costs. From an organiza-
tional point of view, pipe works and steel plants are also separated, each
being under a different enterprise and a different central. Coordination is
exercised by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries, under which the steel
and the pipe centrals are placed.
2.21      Steel coils, which are used for welded pipe production, are produced
at the Galati steel complex (Map 10895R). Rolled round bars and squares which
are used in the "Stiefel" and "Stossbank" seamless mills are produced at
Hunedora for the small and medium diameter pipes. Raw materials for the large
diameter pipes are temporarily imported from Russia. The proposed project,
which is to produce the upper range of large diameter pipes, will be based on
the Pilger technology, and it will use cast steel ingots to be manufactured
in the country at Tirgoviste. Detailed arrangements for ingot production are
discussed in paragraph 5.07.
III. ROMAN ENTERPRISE AND THE BORROWER
A. Introduction
3.01      In the Romanian system, responsibilities for new investments are
split between various agencies. The enterprise is responsible for local
procurement and eventually operation of a project, whereas project design
and engineering as well as foreign procurement are handled by other agencies
placed under the same ministry as the enterprise. As the project will be
located adjacent to the existing pipe works at Roman (para. 5.02), Roman
Enterprise has been chosen to carry out the project and thereafter operate
it.
B.   Plant Facilities
3.02      Roman Enterprise was established in 1957, to produce seamless
pipes. At that time, the plan was to create a large steel complex at Roman,

which would supply the raw materials for the pipe works. The pipe mill was
built first and, pending the construction of the steel plant, it was planned
to import rolled steel bars from neighboring Russia and, in exchange, export
pipes. The steel complex was eventually located in Hunedora, some 650 km away
from Roman, and currently supplies most of the rolled bars to Roman Enter-
prise. Adjacent to the pipe works is now available a large piece of land
with sufficient infrastructure to accommodate the expansion of the existing
facilities.
3.03      Roman Enterprise started operations with a 400 mm Stiefel mill,
producing 340,000 tpy of seamless pipes, out of which 115,000 tpy are large
pipes (above 270 mm). The mill was designed to produce pipes with a diameter
ranging from 168 to 400 mm. However, due to the impossibility of obtaining
large rolled bars (above 270 mm diameter), actual diameter of pipes is limited
to 377 mm, with the 340-377 mm range being produced with great difficulty. As
discussed, the proposed Pilger mill will use cast ingots as feedstock which
can be obtained without limitation in diameter. Since the diameter range of
the project (270-520 mm) will partially overlap that of the existing mill,
the part of production which now cannot be easily obtained on the 400 mm
Stiefel mill will be transferred to the new Pilger mill. The Stiefel mill
will then concentrate on diameters smaller than 340 mm. Existing facilities at
Roman also include a 170 mm Stiefel mill with a capacity of 110,000 tons per
annum and a diameter range of 100 to 170 mm. This mill was built in 1969 by
Romanian suppliers. Another 170 mm Stiefel mill with the same capacity and
diameter range has just been commissioned. A smaller mill with a capacity of
86,000 tons per annum is under construction, and it will produce small seam-
less tubes (25-76 mm diameter).
3.04      Except for the 170 mm Stiefel mill commissioned in 1977, the
present pipe works at Roman operate at full capacity, they are well main-
tained and are run efficiently. Operations are on a three shift basis, with
production continuing through Saturday and part of Sunday. On this basis,
the number of working hours is 25% higher than what is considered as normal
in Western Europe and the USA. Productivity and yield factors (labor,
output, energy and raw material consumption rates, etc.) are comparable to
those experienced in OECD countries. Product quality is also satisfactory.
C.   Organization and Management
3.05      Roman Enterprise, as other industrial enterprises in Romania, has
so far been primarily a production-oriented organization with only limited
autonomy and decision-making reponsibilities outside production. While it
has its own production plans based on targets set by the Five Year Plan,
prepares separate financial statements, and can borrow from designated
banks, any substantive changes in its organization structure, investment
programs, production targets, or in product mix has to be approved by its
ministry and ultimately by the Council of Ministers. With the recent move
towards more decentralization, the involvement of Roman Enterprise in the



- 11 -
planning process will be accentuated. Based on market requirements, it
will prepare its own investment plans and operating budget for subsequent
approval at the Government level. Roman Enterprise will also receive in-
creased autonomy in managing its financial resources with a view of becoming
financially self-supporting. For the procurement of local and foreign supplies,
Roman Enterprise will also have increased responsibility. All these policy
changes have been officially announced in broad terms during March 1978 and
are scheduled to become effective in 1979. However, their specific setting
and implementation framework have still to be worked out, and little immediate
practical effect is expected from these new economic measures on actual
implementation and operation of Bank-financed projects in Romania.
3.06      Roman Enterprise employs 5,000 persons and its organizational
structure, shown in Annex 3, is adequate for fulfilling production func-
tions. Technically, the ultimate decision-making authority lies with the
Workers' General Assembly, which normally meets twice a year to examine the
operating results and review the performance of the working people's Execu-
tive Committee. This Executive Committee, consisting of elected represen-
tatives of workers and also some key members of the management, is chaired
by the General Director of the Enterprise, who is normally appointed by the
Minister of Metallurgical Industries. In practical terms, the General Director
is responsible for overall management including the day-to-day operations and
implementation of the decisions taken by the Executive Committee, through a
team of key managers, such as for production and other technical matters,
sales and procurement, as well as finance and accounting. The General Director
and the Technical Director of Roman Enterprise have been associated with the
pipe industry in various senior positions for a long period of time. They are
well-versed in the technical developments in the industry outside Romania, and
they are supported by a group of experienced and dedicated technicians.
Overall, the Enterprise appears well-managed.
D.   Financial Performance
3.07      The conventional financial analysis applied by the Bank to evaluate
the performance of commercial organizations has been so far of limited signi-
ficance in the case of Romanian enterprises. Since their primary responsibility
has been to meet the physical production targets set by higher authorities,
with product mix and prices of all inputs and outputs being also predetermined,
the financial profitability neither reflects an enterprise's efficiency nor
has been an important factor in investment decisions. The following evaluation
of Roman Enterprise's past and present performance should be viewed in this
context.
3.08      The major indicators of Roman Enterprise's financial performance in
the recent past are summarized below:

a/   Reflects downward adjustment of pipe and input prices.
3.09      Over the last few years production has been maintained at full
capacity with some variations resulting from changes in product mix. In
1977, the utilization rate of capacity dropped to 83%, due to the start-up
of the new 170 mm Stiefel mill, the production of which is progressively
building up. Sales value of production and benefits have widely fluctuated
over the recent years following adjustments in input and output prices. A
general resetting of prices in Romania was undertaken between 1973 and 1975
and pipe and raw material prices were increased by about 60%. However, due
to changes in the taxation system, pipe and input prices were further adjusted
downwards by 40%, effective March 1977.
3.10      In line with the objectives for the pipe industry, profits generated
by Roman Enterprise have been maintained at 10 to 15% of sales. Compared
to Western European pipe producers, production costs (i.e. after depreciation
but before financial charges) of Roman Enterprise are on the average 50 to 70%
lower. This must be interpreted cautiously since Romanian financial systems
(input and output prices set by Government, low interest charged on loans) and
accounting practices (low depreciation rates) differ significantly from those
prevailing in Western Europe. However, production costs should reflect the
facts that in Romania as compared to Western Europe (i) the number of working



- 13 -
hours is 25% higher, (ii) labor is equally skilled but more disciplined and
considerably cheaper, (iii) overhead costs are kept at a minimum, and (iv) all
other factors (raw materials and energy consumption rates, product quality,
etc.) are similar.
3.11      As for most of the enterprises in Romania, all investments of Roman
Enterprise have been financed by State funds and except for working capital
requirements, the Enterprise has not incurred any debt. The cash flow is
not being retained in the Enterprise, but is used through the Central to finance
investments in other enterprises of the same sector and to contribute to the
State budget.
E.   Investment Bank - The Borrower
3.12      The Investment Bank (IB) administers and controls all investment
funds of the State budget (except for agriculture and food processing) and
acts as a channel for all sources of major domestic investment financing in
industry. Recently, IB has also started to make credits on its own, though
funds available for this purpose are still relatively small. Traditionally,
all Bank loans to Romanian industry have been channelled through the IB,
with the proceeds of the loan passed on to the project beneficiary as State
Budget funds. The IB will also be the borrower for the proposed project, and
the Government has indicated that the recent institutional changes in Romania
towards more autonomy to enterprises, will not change in any major way the
present arrangement for the proposed project.
3.13      The IB has wide-ranging responsibilities in the implementation of
projects and plays an important role in project evaluation, procurement and
execution. For all projects, the IB reviews the "Nota de Commanda", a highly
summarized version of the technical-economic study, before submission to the
Council of State for formal approval, and later ensures that the projects
are executed accordingly. It also reviews all orders for equipment before
they are placed, comments on any contract changes, and can impose penalties
on defaulting parties. During the operational phase of the project, the
IB's functions are limited to checking whether the enterprise is meeting the
targets set in the Investment Plan. The IB has no legal authority to bring
its views to bear directly on the management of an enterprise. In practice,
however, the IB can recommend necessary operational actions to the Ministry
of Finance, which, in turn, can act through the ministry concerned with the
project. As in the case of previous Bank loans, the IB has agreed to submit
its audited financial reports to the Bank in an agreed form and within
agreed dates. The "Nota de Commanda" for the proposed project is expected
to be approved by the Council of State in January, 1979 and this approval
is a condition for the Bank loan effectiveness.

IV. THE MARKET
A.   Introduction
4.01       Steel pipes are so widely employed that a comprehensive list of
their applications is almost impossible to establish. They are used in many
sectors of the economy, with the industrial (capital goods in particular),
energy (oil, gas, electricity) and construction sectors being the leading
consumers. The many uses to which steel pipes are being applied require a
great diversity of product specifications, which can be classified in many
ways such as diameter, wall thickness and steel grade composition. The
fabrication technique is also a differentiating factor with welded pipes
being distinct from seamless pipes both in terms of physical properties and
market applications which are determined by technical and economic considera-
tions.
4.02       The proposed project will produce large diameter seamless pipes
whose applications are more restricted and are found in oil and gas explora-
tion, the subsequent production, transportation and transformation of these
energy and feedstock products (refineries and chemical plants) and in the
manufacture of equipment. The following paragraphs discuss the overall pipe
market in Romania, with a specific focus on the market for large diameter
seamless pipes. Because a substantial portion of the project's production
will be exported, the international market and prices for large seamless pipes
is also discussed.
B.   Overall Steel Pipe Consumption/Demand in Romania

4.04      Total consumption of pipes in Romania grew by about 10% annually
over the last five years. During this period, there has been an acceleration
in the annual growth rate, due to an increased capacity of the Romanian
industry to participate in the supply of domestic investment, the main pipe
outlet. However, the growth rate of pipe consumption remains below that of
investments in industry and energy. Significant volumes of pipes are used
for investments in oil and gas production and transportation, and in power,
whose moderate growth over the past ten years had the effect of keeping down
the growth of pipe consumption.
4.05      Welded pipe consumption sharply increased starting in 1970, when at
the same time seamless pipe consumption's growth began to slow down. As noted
earlier, in recent years, there has been world-wide a growing shift from
seamless to welded pipes, due to improved welding techniques and cheaper
fabrication costs. In Romania, new welded pipe factories have been commis-
sioned between 1973 and 1975. It could well be that prior to that period,
the strong concern of avoiding imports had led to the use of seamless pipes
for typical welded pipe applications. Thus, the faster growth of welded pipes
since 1970 represents an improvement in the consumption pattern.
4.06      Domestic pipe demand projections have been prepared by IPROLAM.
Very little information could be obtained on underlying assumptions, thus
making a detailed assessment of IPROLAM's forecasts difficult. The following
analysis should be viewed in that context. IPROLAM's demand projections for
1980 were prepared by aggregating individual requirements of each ministry
based on investment targets in the Five Year Plan. They indicate a 9.8%
annual growth of pipe consumption for the 1975-1980 period, in line with
recent trends. Demand figures for 1985 are "indicative plan" figures used by
Romania for the purpose of long-range planning. Although more moderate than
in the past, the increase in demand foreseen between 1980 and 1985 does not
reflect fully the projected slowdown in industrial investment growth.
4.07      Steel pipe consumption is, in any country, a function of many fac-
tors, the most important being the level of development, the growth of the
industrial sector, the size of the territory, the density of population and
the existence of oil and gas reserves under exploration and production. In
relation to these factors, Romania is a developing nation with a strong drive
towards industrialization; it is a middle-sized country in terms of popula-
tion and territory, with oil and gas reserves which were put into production
at an early stage and will not be depleted before at least another 20 years.
In these circumstances, pipe consumption can be expected to be reasonably
high in Romania. However, as illustrated in the international comparison
below, there is a stage of economic development after which pipe consumption
on a per capita basis levels off and even declines, such as has occurred in
the USA, Japan and to a lesser extent in Western Europe.

4.08      Based on IPROLAM's projections, pipe consumption in Romania would
reach 65 kg per capita in 1980. In light of the above comparison, this is
indeed a high figure. Yet, it is possible since (i) IPROLAM projections have
been built into the National Five Year Plan (1976-80) and Romania's ability
to generally achieve the Plan targets is not questioned (Economic Report No.
1601-RO); (ii) the average growth of pipe consumption between 1975 and 1980
maintains the same relationship as in the past with investment growth of the
industrial and energy sectors; and (iii) the sectorial distribution of indus-
trial investment is expected to follow the same pattern with particular
emphasis being placed on chemical and mechanical industries. However, growth
in industrial output may slow down and all industrial indicators for 1980 may
not be achieved on time. For 1985, IPROLAM's projections indicate a consump-
tion of 86 kg per capita, which would place Romania at an exceptionally high
level. While it is recognized that Romania will remain an important consumer
of pipes, there is no reason to believe why its per capita consumption should
well exceed the levels experienced in other countries.
4.09      Taking into account the already high levels expected to be reached
in 1980, the Bank's projections assume that there will be no significant
increase in pipe consumption in Romania between 1980 and 1985. Further, it
could very well be that in the late eighties or in the nineties when oil and
gas resources may start to decline and Romania's economy is well developed,
steel pipe consumption will gradually decline to levels experienced in de-
veloped countries such as Western Europe, the USA or Japan. It is recognized
in Romania that 1985 projections are preliminary and that they will be only
firmed up when the next Five Year Plan (1981-85) is prepared. In view of the
sizable potential imbalance between pipe supply and demand that could develop
in Romania in the mid 1980's, were it to put its preliminary plans for that
period into effect (para. 4.11), the IB has agreed that it will submit an
updated domestic market analysis by June 30, 1980, and discuss the results and
recommendations of that analysis with the Bank before the next Five Year
Plan is finalized.

a/ Bank's estimate
b/ Relate to projects-in the 1981-85 Five Year Plan.
4."1,      The present surplus between supply and demand of steel pipes in
Romania totals about 370,000 tpy, equivalent to 28% of production with an
equal split betwen welded and seamless pipes. This surplus is primarily
exported to the COMECON market (80%) where Romania is a traditional supplier
and where it ranks second exporter after Czechoslovakia. By 1980, the produc-
tion surplus of the Romanian pipe industry is expected to increase to 550,000
tpy remaining at 29% of production. Assuming investments presently only at
the planning stage were in fact carried out, the production surplus might
either decline marginally (Romanian projections), or further rise to 900,000
tpy (Bank's projections) by 1985 accounting for 36% of production. In com-
parison with major pipe producing countries, this surplus would be as follows:

4.12      With a 900,000 tpy production surplus by the mid-eighties, Romania
would rank as an important potential pipe exporter, comparable to France or
the USA. A significant portion of this surplus (perhaps 50%) would likely be
exported to COMECON countries. The country's capacity to expand its exports
on the international market outside COMECON largely depends on (i) its compe-
titiveness with respect to production costs, product quality and marketing
expertise, and (ii) the future development of the international market. As
discussed earlier, Romanian pipe producers operate efficiently and the quality
of their output meets international standards. Provided the marketing organi-
zation is adequate (para. 4.33), Romania should therefore be capable of



- 19 -
competing successfully in worldwide markets. The future development of the
world market is discussed in detail in paragraphs 4.23 to 4.28 insofar as
the pipes to be produced by the project are concerned. As for other types of
pipes, in view of the ambitious investment program under planning and the high
level of exports this could generate, the IB has agreed, as already noted in
para 4.09, to submit to the Bank before June 30, 1980 an updated analysis of
the international pipe market, and will discuss its results and recommenda-
tions with the Bank.
D.   Large Seamless Pipe Consumption/Demand in Romania
4.13       Large seamless pipes are defined as pipes with a diameter in excess
of 270 mm. Their main applications are found mostly in the energy sector, and
in chemical, engineering and metalworking industries. In 1977, consumption
of large seamless pipes in Romania is estimated at about 88,000 tpy. This
is a small volume distributed over different markets. Thus, consumption is
subject to substantial variations and demand projections are very sensitive
to changes in the assumptions upon which they are based. Past and projected
consumption/demand of large seamless pipes in Romania compared with the growth
of the consuming sectors is given in the table below. As can be seen, local
demand projections for 1985 differ between Romanian and Bank forecasts.

4.14      Casings are used for oil/gas exploration and production.  Although
oil and gas production is stagnating in Romania, demand for large casings
is projected by IPROLAM to increase sharply. This trend has already started
in 1970 and is expected to accelerate until 1980. As noted earlier, it is
estimated that the present level of oil production will be maintained over the
next 20 years or beyond. However, Romania's oil reserves are increasingly
more difficult to exploit and it is planned to drill wells down to 6,000,
8,000 and even 10,000 meters which requires larger diameter casings and higher
volumes. Although the Bank was unable to obtain further detailed information
on future drilling programs against which casings consumption could be checked,
IPROLAM's forecast for casings demand on the whole, appears reasonable and is
used for projections in this report.
4.15      The major line pipe applications are for (i) the transmission of
natural gas between gas fields and consumption centers, and (ii) to a much
lesser extent, the chemical industry. Over the recent years, gas production
has leveled off whereas the chemical industry has grown very sharply. The
fast increase in pipe demand for the chemical industry, however, was more
than offset by the declining demand for gas transmission, and the overall con-
sumption of line pipes decreased from 65,000 tons in 1960 to 50,000 tons in
1977. The chemical industry is planned to continue its fast development until
1980, after which it will expand at a slower pace. Gas production is expected
to be maintained at a constant level in order to conserve reserves and the
increasing energy deficit will be met by expansion of local coal production
and imports of crude and refined oil. In this context, Romania's demand pro-
jections for 1985 appear optimistic and as reflected in Bank's projections
for that year, we rather expect annual line pipe consumption to remain constant
over the near future.
4.16      Structural pipes are used in the construction of industrial plant
and machinery. Major applications are found in shipbuilding, marine platform,
chemical and steel plant construction, machine tool and earth moving equip-
ment fabrication. The demand for large seamless structural pipes did not
exceed 1,000-2,000 tpy before 1973, but increased to 9,000 tpy in 1977.
The recent sharp increase in consumption was due to the construction of a
marine platform and of oil tankers which, respectively, use 3,500 and 1,000
tons of large seamless pipes per unit. The (1976-80) Five Year Plan calls
for a continued expansion of the engineering and metalworks industries though
less rapid than during the 1966-75 period. The construction of further drill-
ing platforms is also planned but will depend on the success of the first
one. An ambitious program including construction of five oil tankers, 22-27
ore ships and 80-96 general cargo freighters aims at transporting 50% of all
sea-going trade under Romania's flag by 1980. The 1980 demand projections
for large seamless structural pipes, being built in the Five Year Plan, take
these factors into account and in this context they appear acceptable. How-
ever, a large portion of the demand by 1980 is of a temporary nature, par-
ticularly with respect to shipbuilding and marine platform construction.
IPROLAM's assumption of further growth of 10% per annum between 1980 and 1985
(leading to a 1985 demand of 26,000 tons) therefore does not appear realistic.
In comparison, developed countries such as Germany or the UK consume less
than 15,000 tpy. As reflected in the Bank's projections, IPROLAM's forecasts
for 1985 have therefore been discounted by half or to 13,000 tpy.

4.17      Boilers for power stations and for industrial plants are the major
applications for large seamless boiler tubes. These tubes are used as steam
pipes in the boiler itself and for bringing high pressure from the boiler
to the turbine and returning low pressure steam to the boiler. Romania is
progressively shifting to the construction of large power plants (330 MW
per unit), using lignite instead of fuel oil. The construction of nuclear
power plants is also being planned. This development requires larger boilers,
with an increasing volume of large seamless boiler tubes. Demand of tubes for
industrial boilers develops about in line with industrial investments. New
capacities are being commissioned in Romania for the manufacture of large
boilers under Babcock-Wilcox (USA) license and the 1980 projections for boiler
tube demand are based upon the requirements derived from such production.
A rapid increase in large boiler tube consumption is likely, but not at the
levels projected for 1980 and 1985 in the Romanian forecast. The development
program of the power sector calls for the installation of an average 1,500 MW
annual capacity including nuclear energy which, based on a 5.3 tons of pipe
per MW (a coefficient which is already high by international standards) would
require in total a maximum of 8,000 tons of large boiler tubes. In this
context IPROLAM's demand projections of 32,000 tpy in 1985 appear overstated.
Even with substantial exports of boilers from Romania and with a high growth
of domestic demand for industrial boilers, internal consumption of large
seamless boiler tubes is not likely to exceed 15,000 tons in 1985 and there-
fore, the Bank's projections are based on this figure.
4.18      Drill collars are used in oil well drilling and are attached to the
drill pipe to add weight. The volume of demand for drill collars is very
low (1,700 tpy in 1977) and according to IPROLAM's as well as the Bank's
projections, it is not expected to increase.
E.   Large Seamless Pipe Supply and Demand Balance and Exports
4.19      The historical and projected balance between supply and demand of
large seamless pipes, i.e. those to be produced by the project, and the
resulting surplus for exports by type of pipes are compared below:

4.20      As discussed earlier, the existing 400 mm Stiefel mill at Roman
cannot produce pipes with a diameter larger than 370 mm, or wall thickness
above 14 mm or special steel grades. These pipes are currently imported and
IPROLAM projects that imports for these specifications will increase from
19,000 tons in 1977 to 53,000 tons in 1985. The project will primarily aim at
replacing these imports. In addition, as noted above the 400 mm Stiefel mill
will cease producing pipes with a diameter range of 340 to 370 mm which are
now being manufactured with great difficulty. This production (20,000 to
30,000 tpy) will be transferred to the project. It is estimated that, based
on a more realistic assessment of import growth for pipes with a diameter
larger than 370 mm and the transfer of production for pipes with a diameter
ranging between 340 and 370 mm the contribution of the project to meeting
domestic requirements will be of about 60,000 tons in 1985.
4.21      At present, about 50,000 tpy or 41% of the large seamless pipe
production is exported, mainly in the form of casings and drill collars. Of
these exports, 85% are directed to COMECON countries, primarily to the USSR



- 23 -
based on long-tern contracts with prices revised annually. Outside COMECON,
the USA and China are the main recipient countries. With the proposed project
entering into production, and based on the Bank's domestic market projections
it is estimated that the surplus available for both direct and indirect ex-
ports will more than double, reaching 107,000 tpy in 1985 and about 120,000
tpy in 1986, when the project operates at full capacity. The 70,000 tpy
increase will be attributable to the project and it will account for 60%
of its production. Marketing prospects for exportinig a portion of this
surplus on the international market are discussed in the following section.
4.22      As noted above, present exports of large seamless pipes from
Romania are mainly in the form of casings and this is also expected to be the
case in future. However, the project mix forecast for the project's exports
is only preliminary; it should be determined more accurately based on a review
of the international market requirements (para 4.12) at the time exports from
the project develop. The project design is adequately flexible to accomodate
any foreseeable change in product mix.
F.   The International Market for Large Seamless Pipes
4.23      Information on the international market for large seamless pipes is
very difficult to obtain since no published statistics are available on the
subject and pipe producers avoid releasing information in view of the competi-
tive market situation. The Bank has completed a study 1/ on the world market
prospects for large seamless pipes. Its detailed conclusions are summarized
below.
4.24      The international market for large seamless pipes is to a large ex-
tent associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas around the
world. Following the 1973 oil price rise, oil companies anticipated a sharp
increase in world drilling activity and they accumulated large inventories of
pipe. However, their expectations have been only partly met as world oil
consumption stagnated due to the slowdown of developed economies. As a
result, during 1975-76, large diameter seamless pipe mills have been operating
below capacity (about 70%). Starting in late 1977, oil and gas exploration
became very active again and pipe inventories decreased rapidly as demand for
large seamless pipes started to rise. With the exception of Western Europe,
most of the pipe works in the world are estimated to operate now close to full
capacity.
4.25      As compared to present situation, the supply and demand balance
for large diameter seamless pipes in the world (excluding centrally planned
economies) is projected to show the following evolution.

b/   Therefore excludes any exports from Romania to CPEs.
4.26      Demand projections in market economy countries indicate an annual
growth rate of about 4.5% over the 1978-85 period, slightly higher than what
would commonly be projected from such indicators as GNP growth, oil production
or steel consumption. A major factor is the strong upsurge, already started,
in oil and gas exploration, including offshore drilling. CPEs countries
(including China) are not self-sufficient in large seamless pipes and they are
estimated to continue importing about 200,000 tpy from OECD economies. In fact,
most observers believe that present imports will further increase, in view of
the policy of these countries to develop their oil and gas resources. As for
production capacities, they have been projected following a review of large
seamless pipe mills in operation, projects under construction or at the
planning stage. On this basis, it is concluded that while some surplus
capacity will remain in 1980, world supply and demand should more or less
balance in 1985.
4.27      Except for the USA which is at the same time a pipe manufacturer
and a major oil producer consuming large seamless pipes, most of other pipe
producing countries, in particular Japan, Germany and Italy, export a major
portion of their output. The total international trade for large seamless
pipes is estimated at about 1.0 million tpy in 1978, equivalent to about
60% of world demand (demand in market economy countries plus net imports by
centrally planned economies). By applying the same percentage to 1985 world
demand, the international trade would reach 1.3 million tons in 1985. Outside
CPEs, major importers are found in the Middle East and North Africa, North
America (USA, Mexico and Canada), Europe (North Sea) and those developing
nations waich are now going into oil and gas exploration or production. In
the Communist countries, China and the USSR are the most promising markets.
4.28      Out of the 70,000 tpy of pipe that according to the Bank's projec-
tions (para 4.21) are in the mid-1980's expected to be available from the
project for exports, it is assumed that Romania will export about half (i.e.



- 25 -
35,000 tpy) to CPE countries and the other half to market economy countries.
These assumptions seem realistic, since (i) Romania is already experienced in
exporting large seamless pipes to the USSR and China (50,000 tpy); (ii) these
two countries with whom Romania maintains close ties appear as excellent
prospects for pipe exports; and (iii) the remaining exportable surplus will
account for less than 3% of the international trade. Provided Romania adjusts
adequately its exports sales organization (para. 4.33) and policies, it should
be able to export successfully the additional 35,000 tpy on the international
market. Moreover, in case Romania would fail to export on the international
market all what is now expected, there would still be a chance that it could
further increase its pipe sales to the USSR as this country will continue to
be a major pipe consumer.
G.   International Prices of Large Seamless Pipes
4.29     Romania's exports of large seamless pipes including those to COMECON
countries, will be subject to prices prevailing on the international market.

Source:  Study on international market for large seamless pipe
In the last few years, export prices have been exceptionally volatile.
They reached their peak in 1974-75 as oil companies apparently accumulated
large inventories in anticipation of a boom in worldwide drilling activity
following the 1973 oil crisis. But as noted above, these expectations were
not met, due in part to the recession in the OECD economies, and in 1976 and
1977 export prices hit a record low, declining by more than 100%. Starting
early 1978, prices have increased again but in real terms, they are still
lower than during the 1960's when their variations were less extreme. Japanese
FOB export prices are on the average 15 to 20% lower than FOB European prices.
This price difference reflects (i) a freight differential between Japanese and
European producers as Europe is located closer to major consuming countries
(Middle East, USA) and (ii) the strong commitment of Japan to promote pipe
exports and increase its market share.

4.30      Some large diameter seamless pipe mills in Western Europe are still
operating below capacity and this is reflected in present prices. As demon-
strated earlier, while there will continue to be some oversupply into the early
1980's, demand and supply is projected to balance in the mid 1980's. As
capacity utilization gradually increases, prices are expected to move upward
in real terms and ir. the projections shown above, a 5% increase (compared to
1978 level) has been assumed in 1985. This assumption should bring back real
prices to their 1960-65 level, with the exception of line pipes for which
real prices are not expected to regain their 1960-65 level due to progressive
substitution of welded pipes, whose manufacturing costs are lower.
H.   Marketing Arrangements
4.31      Once the recent changes in the Romanian system are implemented,
domestic sales from the project will be made directly by Roman Enterprise.
As is customary in Romania, after project start-up, detailed annual sales
plans will be prepared and sales contracts signed with the pipe consuming
enterprises. Distribution will be arranged by BAZA, the national distribution
enterprise and most of the production will be shipped by train. Although by
1985 pipe production is planned to double, no difficulty is anticipated as the
expansion of marketing, distribution and transportation capacities has been
taken into account in the Five Year Plan (1976-80).
4.32      Exports from the project will be arranged by METALIMPORTEXPORT,
which operates through a network of representatives based in the country
embassies abroad.  These representatives handle all steel products with the
exception of the USA where an independent agent has been appointed to sell
casings.  Technical specialists travel from Romania to customers when neces-
sary.
4.33      The organization required to sell oil tubular goods on the export
market is simple as there are relatively few easily identified customers (the
oil companies) and products are manufactured to a single internationally
acceptable standard (API). However, it is essential that the organization
provides customers with a quick response to their requirements, reliability
of delivery, transportation arrangements and technical assistance. Types of
pipes other than casings require a more sophisticated organization as there
are many standards and numerous customers with various requirements. METAL-
IMPORTEXPORT has only limited experience in selling pipes outside COMECON
countries. To achieve the high volume of exports anticipated from the pro-
ject and 'rom other pipe investments in Romania, METALIMPORTEXPORT will need
to adjust its market organization and its sales policies including technical
assistance to customers, regularity of deliveries, extension of credit and
adequate pricing. Therefore, the IB will also review, as part of the inter-
national market analysis (para 4.12), before June 30, 1980, export marketing
set-up and arrangements and will discuss them with the Bank.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Scope, Description and Location
5.01      The project consists of a Pilger mill with a capacity of about
130,000 tpy of seamless wall pipes with a diameter range of 270-680 mm, wall
thickness of 7-50 mm and fabricated from carbon and steel alloy. It includes
(i) ingot preparation facilities for grinding, turning and heating of raw
material ingots to be supplied by the Tirgoviste Steel Works, (ii) a main
Pilger line, including piercing press, elongator, presentation device and
Pilger mill itself for the transformation of ingots into tubes up to 500 mm
diameter, (-ii) a hot expansion press to further enlarge a part of the Pilger
mill production (4,000 tpy) up to 680 mm diameter, (iv) finishing facilities
for straightening, cutting, beveling, coating and inspecting of semi-processed
tubes, and (v) ancillary facilities, including workshops for maintenance, and
a water treatment plant. A detailed plant layout is given in Annex 5-1.
5.02      As mentioned earlier, the project is an expansion of the currently
operating Roman Enterprise, and the selected site is adjacent to the existing
pipe works at Roman, located 500 km north of Bucharest. The project will,
therefore, benefit from the Roman Enterprise's experience in pipe production
and from existing infrastructure, including good connection by road and rail
to raw material sources and major markets. Some of the ingot preparation
facilities (grinding and turning equipment) which at present are tentatively
planned to be erected at the Roman project site would be better located at the
raw material source (Tirgoviste steel works) to avoid transportation of metal
removed in this operation and more importantly to identify and correct quality
problems on ingots at a point nearest to the source of manufacture. Prior to
the final decision on the location of grinding and turning equipment for ingot
preparation, and in any case not later than December 31, 1979, the IB will
exchange views with the Bank on this matter, based on the documentation
prepared for the project implementation.
B.   Process and Technology
5.03      The Pilger mill is a relatively low volume production unit compared
to other types of mills but has the advantage of using low cost raw materials,
producing thicker wall pipes and permitting rapid changes in product types.
It is, therefore, efficient in producing a wide variety of pipe specifications,
each with low production volumes. For the Romanian market which includes
small quantities of different pipe sizes and specifications, the Pilger process
is the best available technology.
5.04      The manufacture of seamless pipes on the proposed Pilger mill will
consist of several operations detailed in Annex 5-2 and summarized as follows:
after preparation and inspection, raw material ingots are heated in a rotary
hearth furnace. From the furnace, they are moved mechanically to a high
pressure water jet descaling unit and then transported to a hydraulic pierc-
ing press. The object of piercing is to transform the solid polygonal cross-
section ingots into round hollow sections and to concentrate any impurities



- 28 -
into the unpierced end of the ingots. The semi-finished products or "bottle"
are transported to the elongator which expands its internal diameter to a
dimension determined by the finished seamless pipes. A solid bar or mandrel
is then inserted inside the bottle on a presentation device and both pieces
are transported to the Pilger mill unit where the bottle is further elongated
and the outside diameter reduced to the desired diameter of the finished pipe.
The end of the produced pipe in which previous steps concentrated the impuri-
ites of the ingot is cut off by a mechanical saw. The pipe is then passed
to the finishing section of the plant where, depending on the type and spe-
cification, several steps of straightening, cutting, beveling, coating, and
inspection are carried out. Before the finishing stage, pipes with a required
diameter larger than 500 mm are reheated and further expanded on a hot expan-
sion press.
C.   Product Mix and Capacity
5.05      The product will produce about 100 different specifications of pipes
in accordance with domestic and export market requirements. As discussed
earlier, Romania's and the Bank's assessment of the domestic market differ
significantly. Adjustments have been made accordingly in the project product
mix proposed by IPROLAM, as shown in the following table:

a/ Based on Bank's assessment of capacity at 130,000 tpy.
b/  Based on IPROLAM initial estimate capacity of 108,000 tpy as contained in the Nota de Comunda.
5.06       Pipe specifications differ in terms of diameter, wall thickness,
steel grades and also processing. The capacity of the project can vary sig-
nificantly according to these specifications. Following extensive discussions
during preappraisal and appraisal, the capacity of the project mix proposed
by IPROLAM was agreed at 130,000 tpy. As no significant variation would
result from the adjustments made by the Bank to the product mix envisaged by



- 29 -
IPROLAM, the 130,000 tpy estimate has been maintained for appraisal. This
estimate can be considered as conservative, since assuming no market con-
straint the project has the ability of producing 145,000 tpy, based on present
number of working hours at Roman. However, this higher capacity is not
acknowledged by IPROLAM which does not envisage to have the proposed project
operate at more than 130,000 tpy.
D.   Raw Materials and Utilities
5.07      The main raw materials for the proposed Pilger mill are quality
steel ingots, which will be produced by the steel complex at Tirgoviste
(location of the Bank financed Otelinox steel project), 500 km from Roman.
The Tirgoviste steel works now operate electric furnaces and casting facil-
ities with a capacity of about 600,000 tpy. Standard ingots are produced,
which are rolled into bars in a nearby rolling mill. Tirgoviste has an
adequate program to expand the number of electric furnaces and upgrade its
ingot casting facilities to produce "Pilger" ingots for the project. How-
ever, the manufacturing of quality ingots for the Pilger mill necessitates a
special "knowhow" (selection of scrap, control of melting process, casting,
ingot mold preparation and ingot cooling) which Romania does not have at
present. Therefore, to secure an adequate supply of quality ingots for the
project, assurances have been obtained that (i) all necessary investments for
Pilger ingot production will be timely made at Tirgoviste; (ii) appropriate
arrangements will be made with the Pilger mill technology and equipment
supplier for the testing, which will start not later than 18 months prior to
the scheduled commissioning of the project, of ingots produced by Tirgoviste
Steel Works in Pilger mill facilities outside the country; and (iii) in the
event that the tests are not positive, all measures will be taken, including
obtaining appropriate technical assistance for the Tirgoviste Steel Works, in
order to be able to secure not later than six months prior to the scheduled
commissioning of the project, the required quality and quantity of ingots
required by the project.
5.08      The project requires about 2 MW of power, to be supplied from the
national grid by existing transformer facilities which have ample unused
capacity. Water is available from a nearby river, also through existing sys-
tems. The project will use small amounts of natural gas and fuel oil, already
available on the project site. The supply of utilities is satisfactory.
E.   Environment
5.09      The project generates very little effluents except for solid steel
scrap and sewerage. Steel is efficiently recycled due to its high value,
and its relatively concentrated form makes collection easy. Water treatment
and sewerage facilities will be handled through the present system which
will be expanded. Flue gases from fuel oil-fired furnaces are exhausted
through stacks without further treatment but present no significant hazard
since the total quantity of gases is small.
5.10      The project includes adequate provisions regarding safety and
health standards following normal industrial practices in Romania that are



- 30 -
similar to standards in Western Europe. Certain sections of the plant will
experience high noise levels (about 85 decibels) and in these sections all
workers are provided with protective ear coverings. Nevertheless, assur-
ances have been obtained that Roman Enterprise will operate the project
with due regard to ecological, environmental and safety standards acceptable
to the Bank.
F.   Employment and Training
5.11      The project will provide about 900 new jobs, of which about 70%
are skilled or management personnel. The major portion will be supplied
from the Central and from existing Roman facilities through transfers. The
balance will be covered by people from' the nearby town of Roman plus new
technical graduates. The Romanian Plan was to provide only for about 820
jobs; however, agreement has been obtained that Roman Enterprise will staff
the project at adequate levels.
5.12      Training is recognized by the Roman Enterprise as an important
element of the project. Romania has a highly-concentrated and well-
developed program for training in a new enterprise and/or one employing new
technology. Although several existing pipe works are in operation in Romania,
none employs the special techniques for Pilger mill technology. The main
technology package will include provision for technical assistance by ex-
patriate engineers and Romanian staff will be trained in operating Pilger
mill plants outside Romania. In addition, there may be technical assistance/
training for ingot production (para. 5.07). For other operations (finishing,
testing and quality control) that are already carried out in other pipe works
in Romania, staff will be trained in such existing facilities. Training and
technical assistance extend through early operating stages until steady
commercial operations are achieved. The detailed scope of the training
program has already been defined during technical discussions with potential
Pilger mill suppliers and will be part of the main technology package.
G.   Project Implementation
5.13      The "Nota de Commanda", the official Romanian document on the
basis of which the project is decided, is scheduled to be approved shortly
(January 1979) by the Council of State. As mentiontioned earlier (para
3.13), the approval of the Nota de Commanda by the Council of State will be
a condition of effectiveness for the proposed loan.
5.14      The actual project management team is in the process of being
selected for the project by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries. The
project management team will include staff from the Central, the existing
Roman Pipe Works, IPROLAM 1/ and METAROM 1/ who are experienced in the
1/   IPROLAM and METAROM are involved in the Bank's OTELINOX Project and
are experienced in Bank procedures and in all steel project implemen-
tation in Romania.



- 31 -
design, procurement, construction and operation of steel rolling mills and
pipe manufacturing facilities. The Project Manager, reporting to the
management of Roman Pipe Works, will serve as overall project coordinator
plus site construction manager and will thus be primarily responsible for
project implementation. However, several areas of project execution are
delegated to other organizations not under the Project Manager's control
and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries together with the Investment
Bank oversee the coordination of all activities. Although this procedure
does not result in a single unified project management system and appears
somewhat cumbersome, it is well established in Romania and has worked
satisfactorily in other Bank-financed projects.
5.15      IPROLAM is responsible for the general design of the project,
technical selection of foreign technology and equipment, overall site and
project layout, construction design and detailed engineering. In the
planning stage, IPROLAM prepares all documentation necessary for project
approval including capital and operating costs, project scope and other
specifications. Civil works and construction, under the supervision of
IPROLAM, are the responsibility of construction companies that report to
the Ministry of Buildings. METAROM, which reports both to the Ministry of
Metallurgical Industries and Ministry of Foreign Trade, is responsible for
all foreign procurement, using IPROLAM as technical advisor.  Local pro-
curement will be handled by the Enterprise's Project Manager. Technical
assistance will be provided by the supplier of the main technology package
to IPROLAM for engineering and procurement and to the Roman Enterprise for
erection, training, commissioning and operation of the project.
5.16      The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1981 and
to operate at full production by 1986. Completion is deemed to be reached
after guarantee tests have been fulfilled and the plant has achieved at
least 80% capacity utilization for 30 consecutive days. A detailed project
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 5-3. However, the Roman Enter-
prise will prepare and periodically update and have submitted to the Bank a
more detailed project implementation schedule, based on PERT or CPM meth-
odology.
VI. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Capital Costs
6.01      The total financing required for the project is estimated at
Lei 2,510 million (US$139.4 million) of which Lei 1,340 million (US$74.4
million) or 53% is in foreign exchange. Details of the capital cost
estimate are given in Annex 6-1 and are summarized below:

6.02      The estimates were prepared by IPROLAM in February 1978, based on
experience in other pipe mills recently built in Romania and on quotations
from potential suppliers. They were revised by Bank staff in March 1978 and
higher values on some equipment related to finishing facilities (additional
US$3 million) have been incorporated in the above estimates.
6.03      A physical contingency of 10% has been included in project costs and
annual price escalation has been calculated as follows: (i) local costs at 1%
annual increase in line with the practice for Bank financed projects in Romania;
(ii) imported equipment at 7.5% in 1978 and 1979 and 7% in 1980, 1981 and 1982;
and (iii) foreign consulting services at 8% in 1978, 7.5% in 1979 and 7% in
1980, 1981, and 1982. The price contingencies thus represents 9.4% of the
base cost estimate plus physical contingencies. The above cost estimate,
including contingencies, is considered reasonable and adequate. The estimate



- 33 -
of working capital is based on current practices at Roman Enterprise and the
project's specific requirements. Detailed assumptions are shown in Annex 6-2.
B. Financing Plan
6.04      In the Romanian system, Centrals establish financing plans for their
Five Year Investment Program. They aggregate all approved investments of the
enterprises under their control and match them against the availability of
funds from State budget allocations. The financing requirements of the
project are therefore proposed to be covered as follows:

Suppliers' Credit                    360.0            20.0             14
Total                          2,509.9          139.4             100
6.05      The proposed Bank loan of at US$40 million will cover 54% of
the estimated foreign exchange financing requirements of the project. In
line with the project procurement schedule, arrangements for co-financing
will be made by Romania and the IB agreed to contract by December 31, 1979
foreign convertible currency loans in an approximate aggregate amount of US$20
million in order to finance the portion of the direct foreign exchange cost of
the project not financed out of the proceeds of the Bank's loan (para 6.13).
The above financing plan therefore assumes export credits could be obtained
for US$20 million at 10% interest rate with eight years maturity including
three years grace 1/. The financing of other project costs, including interest
during construction, would be financed from the State Budget.
6.06      The Bank loan is proposed to be extended to the Investment Bank for
15 years including 3 years of grace, and at the prevailing interest rate
(7.35%). As in the case of other Bank projects in Romania, the IB will pass
on the loan proceeds to Roman Enterprise, together with the State funds. There
is no formal on lending arrangement from the IB to Roman Enterprise, but agree-
ment has been obtained that Roman Enterprise will ensure that the sums of its
annual benefits and depreciation allowances will be sufficient to at least equal
payments of interest and principal on the Bank's loan on terms assumed to be
identical to those due to the Bank, except for a normal interest rate of 10%.
This arrangement is in line with Bank's practice in all previous industrial
projects in Romania and the 10% interest rate is the normal rate currently
paid by our borrowers in Bank-financed industrial projects in other countries.
1/   These are conservative assumptions, since better terms are expected
to be available.



- 34 -
6.07      The Council of State approval of the "Nota de Commanda" automatically
includes approval to spend funds up to the estimated cost of the project. The
Romanian system has no simple mechanism for providing additional funds once
the "Nota de Commanda" is approved, since the Council of State's decision is
law and another decision of the Council would be required to authorize addi-
tional funds. As for all industrial Bank projects in Romania, agreement
has been obtained that funds will be provided as needed for carrying out the
project, including prompt allocation of State funds to cover any cost overrun
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
C. Procurement
6.08      Procurement for the project is underway following procedures accept-
able to the Bank (excluding civil works which are not being proposed for Bank
financing) that had been approved during preappraisal. There are three main
categories of procurement, (i) a main technology/equipment package consisting
of the core of the project, i.e. the Pilger mill and including: the imported
proprietary technology, design, complete drawings and specifications, tech-
nical assistance, and proprietary equipment for the Pilger mill itself (US$32
million), (ii) the balance of imported equipment not currently fabricated
in Romania (US$28 million), and (iii) a much smaller group of less critical
equipment for which both foreign and local bidders will compete (US$8 million).
6.09      Pilger mill technology is highly specialized and proprietary and
only two companies, world-wide, have the necessary know-how and experience
to supply the mill. The companies are Innocenti (Italy) and Demag (FRG).
During November 1977, METAROM extensively advertised the Pilger mill package
through all Bank-member embassies in Bucharest plus directly contacted 18
firms in the steel processing industry (in 8 countries), but no additional
experienced company was discovered. Thus the bidding for the main technology
package is limited to two firms. Following normal practice in Romania a
two-stage bidding procedure has been used with separate technical and commer-
cial bidding. This procedure has proven most effective in previous Bank-
financed projects in Romania particularly in the procurement of complex
packages of proprietary technology such as that required for the proposed
project. Technical discussions for the main technology package were completed
in August 1978 and M4ETAROM is scheduling to request separate commercial bids
on a cash and credit basis in January 1979. On this basis, METAROM plans to
conclude a contract for the main technology package in March 1979. It is
expected that credit financing will be available for a major portion of the
main technology package at satisfactory terms and conditions. Based on this
expectation, the Bank would limit its financing to the balance of the package
- i.e., engineering, technology, technical assistance, training and proprietary
equipment, estimated at US$7 million.
6.10      Other imported equipment and materials, consisting of some 23 pack-
ages, and estimated to cost about US$28 million will also be procured on the
basis of ICB or international shopping (para. 6.12) following Bank procure-
ment guidelines. A vendor's list has been agreed to with the Bank following



- 35 -
advertising in November 1977. These items are not manufactured in Romania and
there are only foreign companies on the vendor list. All of these contracts
are scheduled to be awarded in the second half of 1979. The Bank will finance
the imported equipment on this list.
6.11      A smaller group of less specialized equipment that is suitable
for international bidding, but is also manufactured in Romania, with an
approximate value of US$8 million, constitutes the third group of procurement.
The Bank will also finance US$5 million of this equipment; in such an event
and for purposes of bid evaluation, Romanian suppliers will be given a margin
of preference of 15% over the CIF value of foreign bids, or the applicable
import duty, whichever is less. Following past experience, it may be assumed
that Romanian bidders will win virtually all of these contracts.
6.12      Internationally bid items (in all above categories) available only
from a limited number of suppliers, or whose availability is time - critical
to project completion, or costing less than US$250,000 each may be purchased
through international shopping on the basis of suitability, availability and
price considerations, subject to prior approval by the Bank of the list of
items involved. The total value of these items is estimated to be a maximum
of US$2 million of the proposed loan.
D. Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
6.13      A detailed list of equipment and services to be eligible for Bank
financing (Annex 6-3) has been agreed and changes in this list will be made
only by prior agreement between the Bank and the Borrower. On this basis the
allocation of the Bank loan is as follows:
Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
(US$ million)
A. Technology, technical assistance,
training, equipment and spares
(open to foreign bidders only)
Main technology package         7.0      22% of foreign exchange cost (CIF)
Other imported packages        28.0      100% of foreign exchange costs (CIF)
Subtotal                   35.0
B.  Other equipment and spares         5.0     100% of foreign exchange cost (CIF)
(open to foreign and local                 or 100% of factory cost if locally
bidders)                                purchased
Total                      40.0
As shown above and as discussed in para 6.09, it is expected that the Bank
will finance only a portion of the main technology package.  However, in the
event that export credits for this package are not available or their terms
and conditions unduly onerous, so that it would become more advantageous for
Romania to utilize other lines of bilateral credits for the other imported
packages, the Bank would finance the entire foreign exchange cost of that
package (US$32 million), and the balance of the Bank loan would be split
between other imported packages (US$5 million) and other equipment and spares
(US$3 million).



- 36 -
6.14      Based on the above table, estimated quarterly disbursements of
the Bank loan are given in Annex 6-4. The Bank loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by the second quarter of 1982. Any funds remaining uncommitted
upon completion of the bidding for equipment on the Bank's list would be
used to finance additional equipment for the project, if found justified.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Production Buildup and Sales Forecast
7.01      As mentioned previously, the project is expected to start opera-
tions in late December 1981. Production is expected to build up over a
four-year period with respective build-ups of 35%, 65%, 80% and 90% capacity
utilization and 100% in the fifth (1986) and following years. The Bank has
reviewed underlying assumptions and considers this production schedule to
be reasonable. Based on these assumptions, the sales forecast, showing
domestic market and exports, is as follows:
Roman-Sales Program
(000 tons)
1982       1983        1984        1985        1986
Domestic Sales           46         56          58          60          62
Exports                   -         29          46          57          68
Total              46          85         104         117         130
7.02      Sales on the domestic market are projected at 60,000 tpy in 1985,
as discussed in para. 4.20. For the purpose of financial projections, domes-
tic sales have been assumed to increase by about 3.5% annually. The export
surplus available from the project is projected to reach a peak at 68,000 tpy
in 1986 and gradually decrease thereafter. The proposed product mix at full
production has been discussed in para. 5.05. Detailed domestic market and
export sales projections per type and steel grades are shown in Annex 7-1.
B.   Pipe Prices
7.03      Under the present financial system in Romania, sales accrue to
Roman Enterprise at domestic prices, independently of whether such sales
are for the domestic market or for exports. As for all other products,
pipe prices are set by the Government, at levels so as to provide a 10 to
15% margin after covering production costs (para. 3.10). For those pipes
which are to be available from the project but which are not yet produced
in Romania, their price has been based on projected production costs, as is
the practice in Romania for new products. Detailed price assumptions used
in the project's financial projections are shown in Annex 7-1.

C.   Operating Cost Estimates
7.04      Operating cost estimates for the project have been prepared by
IPROLAM based on discussions with equipment manufacturers and experience on
a similar Pilger mill recently built in Poland. Following Bank's review of
the estimation method, adjustments have been made on labor costs to take
into account higher manpower requirements than anticipated in the "Nota de
Commanda." Detailed assumptions and estimates are given in Annex 7-2 and are
summarized below:

a/   Purchasing cost of ingots less sales value of recouped scrap.
7.05      The unit operating cost of pipe for the proposed product mix will
average Lei 6,500/ton (US$361) at full production with steel ingots account-
ing for 68% of total cost.  Unit operating cost is very low by world standards,
but is considered realistic in view of low input prices as set by the Govern-
ment in Romania, wages paid at a fraction of those paid in industrialized
countries and better use of production capacity in Romania due to longer
operating hours.
D.   Financial Projections
7.06      From the above discussions of investment costs, financing plan,
sales volume, prices and operating costs, relevant financial indicators
for the project are detailed in Annex 7-3 and summarized below:

Net Profit as % of Net Sales          (24)        1        7        10        12
7.07      Financial projections shown above are based on current prices until
1982 and constant prices thereafter.  In any case, whatever adjustments in
input and output prices may be made, they are not expected to affect the
project's financial viability adversely in view of the Government's policy to
provide for a reasonable margin after covering production costs.
7.08      When the project operates at full capacity, it is expected to
generate a 12% profit margin on sales, in line with experience in the pipe
industry. However, during the first year of operations, losses will be
incurred and in year 1982 to 1983, cash generation from the project would
not be sufficient to meet notional 1/ debt obligations. These cash deficits
could nevertheless be financed through profits generated at the Roman Enter-
prise level.
7.09      Detailed projections of Income Statement, Source and Application of
Funds and Balance Sheet for Roman Enterprise, including the proposed project,
are given in Annex 7-4 and summarized below:

to the beneficiary on a "non interest-bearing capital" basis.



- 39 -
7.10      At full capacity, the project will account for 25% of Roman Enter-
prise's sales and 40% of its assets. Except between 1982 and 1985 when some
inefficiencies are expected to be experienced with building up production,
the project will not alter Roman Enterprise's profitability which will be
maintained at 14% of sales. Since Roman Enterprise has virtually no debt at
present, it would have no difficulty in meeting notional debt service obliga-
tions (para. 7.08) under the project. Notional debt service coverage, long-
term debt/permanent funds and current ratios are expected to remain satisfac-
tory during the forecast period. However, as discussed in para. 6.06, it has
been agreed that Roman Enterprise will ensure that its annual benefits and
depreciation allowances will be sufficient to at least equal payments of
interest and principal on the Bank loan on terms assumed to be identical to
those due to the Bank, except for a notional interest rate of 10%.
E.   Financial Rate of Return and Break-even Point
7.11      The financial rate of return for the project has been calculated
at 5%. Because of the nature of the Romanian pricing system, the financial
rate of return cannot be used as an objective investment criterion which is
obtained through the more meaningful economic return (para. 8.06). The
variable costs as a percentage of total production costs, including depre-
ciation and financial charges, are estimated at 65%, giving a profit
break-even capacity utilization level of 68% or 88,000 tpy.
F.   Auditing and Reporting
7.12      Romania has an elaborate audit system under which enterprises
submit periodic operational and financial reports to their Central, Mini-
stry and Investment and National Banks. These reports serve to ensure
achievement of plan targets and proper use of funds. Though the contents
and presentation of these reports differ from those normally received by
the Bank, it is possible to adjust them to provide sufficient information
for the Bank to adequately monitor the progress of project implementation
and operations. The Bank will require the IB to submit quarterly project
progress reports prepared by Roman Enterprise within 45 days after the end of
each quarter, annual financial statements in a form satisfactory to the Bank
and within six months after the end of each year, and annual audit reports of
Roman Enterprise prepared by the Ministry of Finance also within six months.
An assurance to that effect has been obtained from the Government.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
8.01      All economic benefits and costs for tradeable items have been
determined by using expected long-term international prices estimated to
prevail during the 1980's. These prices have been determined at the official
rate of Lei 18 per US dollar used by the Bank for project appraisal. For
non-tradeable items, domestic prices have been taken and, where applicable,



- 40 -
adjusted to reflect the economic price of their internationally trade com-
ponents. All calculations have been based on end-1978 real prices and they
exclude transfer payments and taxes. Detailed assumptions are given in
Annexes 8-1 and 8-2 and are summarized in the following paragraphs.
8.02      Export sales from the project have been valued at FOB European
prices (border prices) for large seamless pipes. In view of the projected
supply and demand situation, long-term export prices are expected to rise and
as discussed earlier, an average 5% increase in real terms has been assumed by
1985 and a constant level thereafter. Sales on the domestic market have been
valued at the opportunity cost of imports, using the same FOB prices, but
including freight and handling charges.
8.03      On the cost side, the major inputs for the project production are
steel ingots which will account for about 70% of economic operating costs. As
mentioned earlier, steel ingots as required for the project are of a special
type, which are not yet produced in Romania. They are not generally traded
internationally and their price has been imputed by using economic costs
that would be incurred in Romania for their production. A cost estimate was
prepared by IPROMET, the Design Institute for Steel Works, based on their
experience at Tirgoviste where standard ingots are already being produced.
Steel scrap, energy and maintenance are the major operating costs for ingot
production. The following adjustments have been made to reflect their
economic value. Since Romania is in a self-sufficient position, steel scrap
has been valued at US$80 per ton, which is the estimated long-term export
price for Romanian scrap. The costs of electricity and gas have been increased
respectively by 50% and 600% in line with their economic prices. Maintenance
costs in steel production normally amount to 5% of capital investments.
Assuming the economic investment cost for electric arc steel making at US$250
per annual ton capacity, then maintenance costs would be about US$12 per ingot
ton. Total operating costs have been further increased by 8% to take into
account that Pilger ingots are more expensive to produce than standard ingots.
Two elements have been added to the operating costs of ingots to obtain their
input price to the project:  (i) a 10% return on capital investment and (ii)
the economic cost of transport between the steel making plant and the project
location, estimated at US$9 per ton of ingot. The following table compares
the economic price at Roman for a carbon steel ingot, obtained with the
methodology outlined above, with the price used in the financial projections.
Roman - Carbon Steel Ingot Price Comparison
(US$ per ton)
Estimated Economic Price                   200
Financial Price in Romania                 147
8.04      The economic price of carbon steel ingots obtained by shadow pricing
the production costs of a Romanian enterprise is about 35% higher than the
price used in financial projections. However, it is comparable to the price
that would cover the costs of a Western European producer and allow a reason-
able return on investment. The economic prices for low and high alloy ingots
have been based on the carbon steel ingot price, adjusted to reflect the value
of alloy additions and higher production costs.



- 41 -
8.05      Other costs than raw material ingots have also been adjusted to
reflect their economic values. In particular, energy costs have been in-
creased along the same lines as discussed for the steel ingots.
B.   Economic Rates of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
8.06      Using the above assumptions, the economic rate of return for the
life of the project (18 years), is estimated at 12.5%. It compares favour-
ably with expectations for pipe industry investments in developed economies.
Sensitivity tests indicate the following results:
Sensitivity Tests on Economic Rate of Return
Rate of Return %

8.07      The economic rate of return is most sensitive to small variations
in sales revenue and steel ingot costs. In particular, any change in the
product mix and world market prices or in the assessment of the economic
price of raw material ingots could have a substantial effect, upward or down-
ward, on the project's economic viability. However, in the long run there
is to a certain extent a linkage between ingot and pipe prices. Therefore,
cases 6 and 7 which combine a variation of both ingot and pipe prices represent
respectively the effects of reasonably adverse and positive conditions that
the project could face. Other events such as delays in project implementation
or cost overruns would have a far lesser impact. The risks that these events
will occur are discussed under the paragraphs below.
C.   Risks
8.08      The major risk that the project faces derives from the high share
(above 50%) of production to be exported (half of which again to convertible
currency countries), and the vulnerability of the project economic viability
to fluctuations in international prices. Unlike the domestic market, the
international market of large seamless pipes is dominated by factors outside
Romania's control. A slowdown in worldwide oil and gas exploration, a new
recession in industrialized economies combined with reinforced protectionism,
a deliberate strategy by some countries to increase significantly their share
of the world market of pipes are factors which could endanger the project's



- 42 -
economic viability, through reduced volumes of export sales, depressed inter-
national prices or unfavorable changes in product mix. However, taking into
account that (i) the international market of large seamless pipes which is
based on world energy consumption appears favorable, and (ii) Romania's share
of the world trade for large diameter pipes will not exceed 3% when the
project reaches full production, the probability of Romania being able to sell
the entire production surplus from the project at reasonable prices on the
export market is significantly higher than the probability that the project
will operate below capacity with international prices decreasing due to
depressed world market conditions. The likelihood that, in case world market
opportunities fall below expectations, Romania could increase its exports
to COMECON countries (USSR in particular) and to China, which are expected
to remain major pipe importers and to which Romania maintains close ties,
is also a positive factor. Furthermore, the international market analysis,
including Romanian export marketing set-up and arrangements, which the
Romanians have agreed to undertake (para 4.33) will contribute to reduce the
project's vulnerability to above outlined risks. Under these conditions,
therefore, the commercial and marketing risks associated with the project are
considered acceptable.
8.09      Moderate risks exist that raw material ingots will not be produced
at Tirgoviste with the necessary quality, thus leading to a high rejection
rate of faulty pipes in the Pilger mill and increased production costs.
However, these risks will be minimized by the assurances obtained to ensure
adequate ingot production (para 5.07) and at worst may be expected to be of
temporary nature. Small risks exist in possible delays in project completion
and in technical difficulties in the early years of operation, as the project
will be the first pipe mill in Romania using the Pilger technology. However,
the Pilger process is well proven and the arrangements for technical assistance
with the equipment manufacturer should minimize these technical risks. In
addition, although using different technology, the project shares many tech-
nical features with existing seamless pipe mills in Romania and the experience
the country has gained in building and operating such mills will also reduce
these technical risks. There is almost no risk of cost overrun in implementing
the project, as confirmed by past experience for most Bank-financed projects
in Romania.
D.   Foreign Exchange Savings
8.10      The foreign exchange costs incurred for the construction of the
project will be recovered over a three-year period and at full capacity, the
project will yield average annual foreign exchange savings in real terms of
about Lei 1,550 million (US$86 million) before loan repayment and about Lei
1,400 million (US$78 million) after loan repayment. Detailed foreign exchange
in-and-out flows are shown in Annex 8-3.
E.   Other Benefits
8.11      The project will be located in a region with relatively little
industry and by providing about 900 additional jobs, it will contribute
to the Government's objectives of a more uniformly balanced industrial



- 43 -
structure and of secured supply of basic products, whose availability on
the international market is irregular. The project will also contribute to
facilitate exports of engineering goods from Romania. The competitiveness
of Romania in exporting such goods as boilers, oil drilling or chemical
equipment, will definitely be improved by being able to provide the entire
assortment of pipes needed for the supply of these goods. Furthermore, as
discussed earlier, the project will be the first pipe mill in Romania using
the Pilger technology. The Romanian pipe industry will definitively
benefit from this transfer of technology.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      The following major assurances and agreements have been reached.
A. The IB will:
(i) submit its audited financial reports to the Bank in an
agreed form and within agreed dates (para. 3.13);
(ii) submit by June 30, 1980, an updated market analysis
regarding the domestic and international supply and demand
of steel pipes, and exchange views with the Bank with
respect to this analysis, its basis and conclusions,
including export marketing set-up and arrangements (paras.
4.09, 4.12, 4.33);
(iii) prior to final decision on the location of ingot prepara-
tion facilities, but not later than December 31, 1979,
exchange views with the Bank on the matter (para. 5.02);
(iv) contract by December 31, 1979 foreign convertible currency
loans of about US$20 million to finance the portion of the
direct foreign exchange cost of the project not financed
by the Bank (para. 6.05); and
(v) submit to the Bank (i) quarterly project progress reports
on the project and annual financial statements of the
Enterprise, and (ii) annual audit reports of the Enterprise
in form satisfactory to the Bank and within time periods
agreed upon (para. 7.12).
B. The Government will:
(i) timely make all necessary investments for Pilger ingot
production at Tirgoviste, and make appropriate arrangements
with the Pilger mill technology and equipment supplier to
ensure proper quality and adequate quantity of Pilger mill
ingots as required for the project, six months prior to
the commissioning of the project (para 5.07);



- 44 -
(ii) provide promptly all funds needed to complete the project,
including funds for any cost overrun (para. 6.07); and
(iii) make no changes in the list of Bank-financed items without
prior agreement by the Bank (para. 6.13).
C.  Roman Enterprise will:
(i) implement and thereafter operate the project with due
regard to ecological, environmental and safety standards
(para. 5.10);
(ii) staff the project at satisfactory levels (para. 5.11);
(iii) prepare and periodically update and have submitted to the
Bank a detailed implementation schedule (para 5.16); and
(iv) ensure that the sum of its annual benefits and depreciation
allowance will be sufficient to cover payments of a notional
10% interest rate and principal on the Bank loan (para 6.06,
7.10).
9.02      Condition of effectiveness for the Bank loan will be that the "Nota
de Commanda" has been duly approved by the Council of State (para. 3.13).
9.03      With the above agreements and understandings, the project provides
a sound basis for a Bank loan of US$40 million with a term of 15 years, in-
cluding a 3-year grace period at the standard interest rate and on lending
terms as discussed in para 6.06.

Process Description - Pilger Mill
1.        With Pilger mill technology, seamless steel pipes are forged (or
rolled) from cast steel ingots. The ingots are typically produced in 10-100
ton electric arc furnaces from scrap steel with other iron and alloying agents
added during the melt to produce the desired chemical specification of the
ultimate pipe. The molten steel is poured into specially designed and prepared
ingot molds in a critical step to ensure product quality of the seamless pipe,
and then cooled, and the ingot is separated from the mold. The surface of the
cold ingot (which becomes the surface of the seamless pipe) is ground with
pneumatic chisels to remove surface defects. For high alloy specifications
the full surface of the ingot is ground and the top of the ingot is cut off.
(Impurities in the molten ingot tend to concentrate in the top of the mold
during the cooling cycle.)
2.        After preparation and inspection, the ingot is heated in a rotary
hearth furnace to a rolling temperature of about 1,280 C. The hot ingot is
moved mechanically to a high pressure water jet descaling step and then trans-
ported to a hydraulic piercing press. The ingot is placed in a cylindrical
sleeve (to limit lateral expansion) and pierced with a bar which is approxi-
mately 50% of the ingot diameter. Piercing is from the bottom to the top of
the ingot but does not penetrate the entire length and the top (unpierced)
portion is usually about 4" thick. The piercing induces a backward extrusion
action and elongates the ingot by about 20%. The object of piercing is to
transform the solid polygonal cross section ingot into a round hollow section
and to concentrate any impurities (in the end of the ingot) further into the
unpierced end of the ingot which will eventually be cut off and recycled as
scrap steel.
3.        The semi-finished product or "bottle" is transported to a rotary
piercing or elongation stage in which the internal diameter is expanded to a
dimension determined by the finished seamless pipe diameter. Rotary piercing
is accomplished by rotating the "bottle" between two inclined driven rolls over
a plug or bar. This step further elongates the "bloom" and completely pierces
the blind end and the semi-finished product is now a short, very-thick wall
pipe in the general shape of the finished pipe.
4.        A solid bar (the diameter of the finished pipe) or mandrel is in-
serted inside the cylindrical hollow "bottle". Both pieces are transported
to the Pilger mill unit where they are forced through rolls mounted on the
Pilger mill. The rolls have a non-cylindrical profile and by forcing the
bloom through the mill, it is further elongated and the outside diameter is
reduced to the desired diameter of the finished pipe. The inside diameter
remains constant since the mandrel bar remains inside during this elongation
step. The carriage of the Pilger mill is fed by a hydraulic press in several
stages depending on the amount of reduction in wall thickness desired.

ANNEX 5-2
Page 3
5.        When rolling has been completed, the mandrel bar is extracted
from the pipe by reverse hydraulic action of the Pilger mill carriage.
The mandrel is recirculated for subsequent re-use after cooling and washing
to remove scale. The mandrel is made from high grade steel, and about six
are needed to allow sufficient cooling time. They operate in heavy duty
service and represent the major tooling cost for Pilger mill operation. The
semi-finished pipe (now the dimension of the final product) has one end that
was not elongated (due to the design of the Pilger mill), about 20% of the
weight of the pipe, that has to be cut off by a mechanical saw, to be recycled
as scrap. This end is the same end in which previous steps concentrated the
impurities in the ingot.
6.        The pipe is then passed to the finishing section of the plant where,
depending on the type and specification, several stages of straightening, cut-
ting and beveling, and inspection are,carried out. In successive steps the
pipe is straightened, the ends cut off square or the ends beveled and the pipe
is inspected for defects by X-ray, and visual means. The final inspection is
a hydraulic testing station that loads the pipe to its design pressure. Any
pipe that fails the several inspection stages is either reprocessed (for
correctable defects) or recycled as scrap steel. The completed pipe is then
delivered to storage and inventory control.
