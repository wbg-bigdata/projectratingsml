PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - ROMAN SEAMLESS PIPES
(LOAN 1651-RO)
PREFACE
Loan 1651-RO for the Roman Seamless Pipes Project for US$40 million
was signed on February 1980 and closed on December 1985, at which time the
loan had been disbursed in full.
The main objective of the loan was to increase annual production
capacity of large diameter pipes to minimize the reliance of imports of
critical products needed in the energy and industrial sector.
This Project Completion Report has been prepared by the Industry
Department based on drafts prepared by the beneficiaries and the findings of
an Industry Department mission in December 1986. Comments were received from
the beneficiary in April 1988, and are attached to this report as Annex 3.
Where appropriate, the report has been adjusted to reflect these comments.
In a:cordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.

ROMAN SEAMLESS PIPES (Loan I6b1-RO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
i.       Implementation was completed about 24 months behind schedule in the
main project component and an additional 24 months delay for the finishing
equipment. The total cost of the fixed assets amounted to US$124.5 million,
up to 3.4% over the US$120.3 million appraisal estimate (Para 2.11). The main
reasons for the implementation delay were: (i) delays in finalizing the
contract for the main technolkgy package; (ii) review of the project scope to
rinimize imported equipment which required design changes and delayed
procurement; (iii) severe weather conditions which hampered progress in civil
works; (iv) delays in supply by domestic manufacturers, and (v) delays in the
procurement of critical foreign finishing equipment (Para 2.09).
ii.      Although actual commissioning of the Pilger Mill took place in
December 1983, parts of the mill had to be removed and reinstalled during 1984
in order to reduce excessive vibrations. Installation of the finishing equip-
ment was completed throughout 1985. By the end of 1985, the whole capacity of
the plant had been commissioned (Para 2.08). Actual production in that year
was about half of the appraisal estimate and was expected to build up at a
slower pace than anticipated due to adverse market conditions. This is
despite the fact that present product mix is less complex and diversified than
estimated at apnraisal and the mill is operating satisfactorily (Para 3.01).
iii.     The company is expected to incur operating losses until produ_tion
reaches full capacity utilization in 1988. However, this is based on the
assumption that more than half of the project's output can be exported. The
financial position of the Roman Enterprise as a whole continued to be satis-
factory (Para 4.01). The project is now expected to achieve a financial rate
of return of 4% compared to 5% in the appraisal (Para 4.03). The economic rate
of return is estimated at 5.7% compared to 7.72 in the appraisal (Para 4.05).
The main reasons for the decreased returns are the implementation delays,
depressed international prices and increased production ccsts. If prices were
to increase by 101, the economic rate of return would increase to 11.62. Some
market analysts believe that there are good prospects for a price recovery in
the medium term (Para 4.06).



- iv -
iv       In summary, the project can be considered worthwhile, although only
marginally successful in terms of its economic beuefits. The project is
expected to have a positive impact in Romania development plans in the pipe
industry wh.ch aim at self-sufficiency and maintaining at least marginal
exports, although these benefits will materialize at a slower pace thun
originally expected (Para 5.01). The Bank had a limited role in project
design or choice of technology, but it was influencial in defining its
economic size. The Bank also secured the necessary assurances regarding
arrangements that would ensure the proper quality and quantity of steel ingots
required for the project.
v.       The Roman Seamless Pipes project was the last in a group of six
industrial projects identified and appraised during the late 1970s and
benefited, to some extent, from experience gained during the implementation of
earlier projects. Nevertheless, some of the lessons learned have
similiarities with past projects and relate to the need to establish realistic
schedules for: (i) bidding, negotiating and finalizing international
contracts; (ii) implementation of civil works, and (iii) domestic
manufacturing of equipment. Finally, greater attention should be placed
during appraisal on marketing forecast and arrangements. The latter,
particularly, in export oriented projects are critical to ensure the
sustainability of project benefits. Covenants for future studies by themselves
can do little to reduce the project's market-related risks (Para 5.07).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANTA - ROMAN SEAMLESS PIPE PROJECT
(LOAN 1651-RO)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal, and Loan Approval
1.01      The project, which was proposed for Bank financing by the
Romanian Investment Bank in May 1976, was subsequently reviewed by three
preparation missions and preappraised in December 1977. The project was
formulated and designed by the Design Institute for Rolling Mills (IPROLAM)
who prepared the technical and economic study for the project.
1.02      The project was appraised in March 1978.  It wae agreed that the
analysis of the project would be based on a 130,000 tpy production output
to be reached over a four year period, particularly since the lower
capacity under which the project had been internally approved in Romania
(108,000 tpy), would not yield an adequate economic return.
1.03      In November 1978, negotiations between the Romanian authorities
and the Bank took place and on January 1979, the Bank's Executive Directors
approved a loan for US$40.0 million to the Investment Bank to be onlent to
the Roman Enterprise. The loan became effective in July 1979.
B. Project Description and Objectives
1.04      The project description is covered in detail in the Romanian PCR
(para 2.04). The main objectives of the preject were:
(a)  to increase annual production capacity of large diameter pipes
from 115,000 tons to 245,000 tons per year;
(b)  to minimize the reliance of imports of critical products needed
by the energy and industrial sectors;
(c)  to earn critically needed foreign exchange since it was expected
that half of the project's output would be exported;
(d)  to facilitate exports of engineering goods from Romania, since
its competitiveness would be enhanced by being able to provide
the entire assortment of pipes needed for the supply of these
products; and
(e) to introduce new Pilger technology for the manufacturing of
seamless pipes.



-2 -
1.05      These objectives will, in all likelihood, be only partly
accomplished. The foreign exchange savings and earnings generated 5y the
project will be substantially lower than the appraisal estimate since pipe
imports have been drastically curtailed and due to depressed world market
conditions, most of the project's exports will be to COMECON countries
(USSR in particular) througr bartering arrangements.
11. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MAUIAGEMENT
A. Project Scope Changes
2.01      Ouly one minor change in project scope was introduced with Bank
approval relating co the ingot preparatioa facilities which were shifted
from Tif-zoviste to the project site.
B. Proiecl.   - ,agement
2.02      The project was implemented by the Roman Enterprise.  IPROLAM
designed and engineered the project; the management team included staff
from the existing Roman pipes works, IPROLAM and Usinexportimport all of
which we- considered at appraisal to be experienced in the design,
procurement, construction and operatioi of steel rolling mills and pipe
manufacturing facilities.
2.03      The Investment Bank of Romania su-ervised the implementation of
the Roman project, together with Bank supervision missions and periodically
between Bank missions. Given the experience and level of competence of all
the Romanian institutions involved, the degree and frequency of problems
requiring intervention by the investment Bank or the Bank were few. All
communications and queries from the Bank on implementation and procurement
matters were promptly answered by the Investment Bank.
C.  Employment ard Training
2.04      By 1988 when the project is expected to achieve its full
production capacity, the total work force will be 860 employees, which is
40 workers less than the appraisal estimate. For operations in which the
country had ample experience, training waL done at operating pipe works as
well as in the existing Roman Stiefel pipe mill. For the operation of the
Pilger mill, specialized training was provided by the supplier as part of
che main technology package. The Romanian PCR (paras 4.02 and 4.03) covers
in detail the staff specialization and training of personnel at Roman.
D. Procuremer.t
2.05      All major machinery and equipment, financed by the Bank, were
procured under international competitive bidding (ICB) using Bank
guidelines. There were three categories of procurement: (i) a main
technology package consisting or the core of the project (i.e., the Pilger
mill); (ii) the balance of imported equipment not fabricated in Romania;
and, (iii) a much smaller group of less critical equipment for which both
foreign and local bidders could compete.



-3-
2.06      Originally the Bank was expected to finance only a portion of the
main technology package with a provision that, in the event that export
credits could not be obtained or their terms were deemed unduly onerous (so
that it would become more advantageous for Romania to use credits for other
imperted packages), the Bank would finance the entire package and the
balance of the loan would be split between other imported packages. With
this proviso, a co-financing covenant in an approximate aggregate amount of
US$20 million was included in the loan. The original bank allocation is
shown below:
US$ million
Main Technology Package            7.0
Other Imported Packages          28.0
Other Equipment & Spares           5.0
40.0
2.07      Some significapt changes occurrea in project concept during
implementation.  First, some components of the main technology package were
either manufactured domestically (on the basis of drawings provided by the
main supplier) or imported from eastern block countries, and second, a
number of items that were originally assessed as necessary to be imported
were shifted to domestic production. This major shiht from foreign to
local costs substantially reduced the foreign exchange requtrements of the
project. The procurement of items was spread among eight cot;ntries. Among
foreign suppliers, the most iniportant ones were FRG (84%), USA (8%) and
Italy (3%). The total value of procurement won by foreign suppliers was
US$27.6 million or 69% of the loan amount.
E. Implementation Schedule
2.08      A comparison of the appraisal and actual implementation schedules
is presented in Annex 1 of the Romania PCR. At the time of appraisal it
was estimated that the project would be completed by December 1981.
Although actual commissioning of the Pilger mill took place in December
1983, parts of the mill had to be removed and reinstalled during 1984 in
order to reduce excessive vibrations. Installation of the finishing
equipment was completed throlighout 1985. In summary, a delay of two years
occurred in the Main project component and an additional two years for the
finishing equipment.
2.09      Much of the delays can be identified as follows:  (i) delays in
flnalizing the contract for the main technology package during 1979;
(ii) review of the project components during mid-1980 with a view to
minimizing imports which required design changes and delayed procurement of
affected equipment; (ii!) a severe winter of 1981/82 which hampered
progress in civil works; (iv) delays in supply by domestic manufacturers
charged to produce critical equipment for the first time in Romania which in some
cases did not meet design standards and had to be reordered; (v) delays in



- 4 -
the procurement of critical foreign finishing equipment due,in one case, to
the inability of the supplier to obtain the export permit, and in another
case by the bankruptcy of the s-lected supplier. Against this backdrop of
project implementation difficulties, there were cumbersome procedures
compounded b: fragmented responsibilities for project implementation that
contributed to the overall ptoject delay.
F. Ecology
2.10      As indicated in the appraisal report, the project generates very
little effluents except for solid steel scrap which is efficiently recycled
due to its high value. Water treatment and sewerage are adequately treated
through appropriate facilities. Roman is in compliance with the Romanian
laws on protection of the environmerc.
G. Capital Costs and Financing Plan
2.11      The total costs of fixed assets for the project amounted to
US$124.5 million, up 3.4% over the US$120.3 million appraisal estimate.
Some capital cost figures provided in the narrative of the Romanian PCR
(para 3.11 and 3.12) ant Annex 3 were revised in response to Bank comments
in order to ensure comparability with the original SAR estimate. These
changes, however, are minor and do not affect the overall conclusions. A
summary of final project cost and financing required is provided below.

2.12      Due to the pressures to reduce foreign exchange expenditures by
substituting foreign equipment with locally manufactured goods (para 2.07),
foreign exchange expenditures for fixed assets were reduced by 39% from



- 5 -
US$68.6 to US$42.0 million. Conversely, local costs expressed in US
dollars increased by 35% from US$53.) million to US$72.5 million. It
should be noted, however, that during appraisal the exchange rate was
estimated to remain constant at around Lei 18 per US dollar whereas the
actual weighted exchange rate average during the *ore of the implementation
period was about Lei 15.8 per US dollar. Thus, expressed in US dollars, a
portion of the local cost overrun is explained by the exchange rate
differential. Other reasons were price realignments in the Romanian
economy during 1980-1982 and increases in working capital.
2.13      The actual financing plan for the project compared with the
appraisal is summarized below:

State Funds                   79.4        57       104.0       72        24.6

2.14      As indicated above, in addition to the net cost overrun which was
financed solely from state funds, the major difference in the financing
plan relates to the absence of supplier's credit. As a result of savings
in the main technology package (para 2.07) and increased local content of
other packages, the foreign exchange component of the project was reduced
to US$42.0 million, of which US$40.0 millien was covered by the Bank loan.
As a result the Borrower requested and the Bank agreed to delete
Section 3.03 of the Loan Agreement regarding cofinancing.
H. Disbursements
2.15      The original closing date of the loan was December 31, 1982.
After three extensions, the loan was officially closed on June 30, 1985.
Compared to the appraisal estimates, disbursements were as follows:

2.16      Disbursements for the loan did not start until the second quarter
of 1980 as a result of delays in finalizing the rontract for the main
technology package. By mid-1984 about 85% of the loan had been disbursed
and essentially all of the production equipment had been procured. Delays
in remaining disbursements were mostly related to the procurement of
finishing equipment some of which was outside of the Borrower's control.
Other reasons associated with thoj lag in disbursements ate explained in
para 2.09.
2.17      The actual allocation of loan proceeds compared to the appraisal
estimate was as follows:

III. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Production
3.01      By the end of 1985, the whole capacity of the plant had been
commissioned. Actual production in that year was slightly over half of the
appraisal estimate, and, throughout 1988 when the project is expected to
reach full production, capacity utilization is expected to remain between
10-20% below estimate. This is despite the fact that at present the
product mix is less complex and diversified than originaily expected and
the mill is operating satisfactorily. Therefore, the main reason for the
slower build-up in production is related to market developments
(para 3.03).

B. Product Mix
3.02      As previously indicated (para 2.01) there were no changes in the
scope of the project that would affect the product mix.  However, two
factors which have affected the overall market prospects for the prcject,
have influenced, at least in the short term, the present and future product
mix.  First, decreased oil and gas exploration resulting from low prices
have reduced the demand from the energy sector, the main user of large
seamless casings and line pipes. Second, changes in technology have now
made possible the substitution of seamless pipes with welded pipes,
particularly for low level drilling, with considerable savings in operating
costs. Now, at full production in 1988, the project is expected to produce
76,000 tons of casings and line pipes compared with the appraisal estimate
of 99,000 tons, a reduction of 30% which will be compensated by increased
production of structural pipes (i.e., used in the construction of
industrial plants and machinery).
C. Market Developments
3.03      The Romanian PCR addresses this subject only briefly.  In fact,
discussions on market developments during project supervision were never
very fruitful. For example, domestic market projections were mostly based
on the Five-Year Plan budgetary targets and were not frequently updated
within the cycle to reflect the actual performance of the consuming
industries.  Thus, because of considerable delays in the implementation of
domestic projects, there was always a tendency to overestimate local
demand. On the other hand, information on the international market for
large seamless pipes is very difficult to obtain since very little
published statistics are available on the subject. Als3, given the
competitive nature of the market, pipe producers avoid releasirg
information. These reasons have made past market projections highly
questionable.
3.04      As previously stated (para 3.01), production and sales have
fallen below appraisal estimate mostly as a result of adverse market
conditions. The Romanian PCR indicates that by 1988 more than half of the
plant's output at full production (i.e., about 70,000 tons) would have to
be exported. Although in the present conditions of oversupply it will be
difficult for a new producer to penetrate the international market, it is
expected that the Comecon countries, China, India and Indonesia will remain
importers of large seamless pipes and good customers of the project. It is
unlikely, however, that in the short term the project can export its total
available surplus.
IV. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A. Financial Results
4.01      The projected financial performance for the seamless pipe project
indicates that operating losses will be incurred until production reaches
full capacity utilization in 1988. This is based on the assumption that in



-8-
that year more than half of the project's output can be exported. The
appraisal report had estimated losses only for the first year of
operation. The major reasons for lower profits are: (i) slower production
build-up; (ii) 41% lower margin of contribution per ton of product,
(lii) charges in product mix resulting from market conditions. The slower
production build-up is primarily associated with delays in commissioning
the different project components with a contributing factor being the
adverse market situation. The lower margin of contribution results from
increases in the cost of principal inputs like steel ingots, energy and
labor not fully reflected in the domestic price of pipes (to contain
domestic inflation) and lagging export prices.
4.02      The financial performance of the Roman Enterprise as a whole,
continued to be satisfactoryl/ Its operating margins on the existing
operations are higher than previously estimated reflecting continuing high
productivity and yield factors as well as good product quality. Since this
performance is expected to continue, the enterprise oill remain financially
viable despite reduced income from its large diameter seamless pipes.
B. Financial Rate of Return
4.03      The financial rate of return (FRR) calculated in the PCR prepared
by the borrower (Annex 9) has been adjusted to reflect: (i) revised
working capital ustimates provided to the mission; (ii) a small revision in
capital costs; (iii) revised actual production for 1985 and 1986; and
(iv) higher production unit costs during the period of the initial learning
curve.
4.04      The new FRR is estimated at 4% compared with 5% estimated at
appraisal and 7.4% in the PCR. The main reasons for the reduced FRR are
the longer implementation period, the longer production built-up and a
deterioration in the margin of contribution, as explained in para 4.02.
C. Economic Rate of Return
4.05      Since in the Romanian context domestic selling prices only assure
that the enterprise will cover production costs, the ERR is a more
meaningful measure of the project's benefits. On the other hand, because
of the extensive product mix, the lack of published price statistics and
the difficulties in estimating border prices and related adjustment to
input prices, the calculation of ERR is difficult. The major assumptions
in the ERR were: (i) taxes on imports were eliminated; (ii) the average
economic price per ton of seamless pipes is set 25% higher than the
financial prices and reflects FOB European prices for export sales and CIF
prices (FOB Europe plus freight, insurance and handling) for domestic
1/   Conventional financial analysis in the Romanian context is of limited
significance since the primary responsibility of industrial
enterprises is to meet the physical production targets established by
higher authorities. Thus, financial profitability does not
necessarily reflect the enterprise's potential profitability.

sales; and (iii) major inputs have been adjusted to reflect their economic
cost.
4.06      The incremental ERR of the project is 5.7% compared to 12.5%
estimated at appraisal. The main reasons for the decreased return are
implementation delays, depressed international prices and increased
production costs. In real terms, while the average selling price increased
by 44% the average cost of production increased by 68%. The return is very
sensitive to prices.  If prices were to increase by 5% and 10%, the ERR
increases to Q.9% and 11.6%, respectively. Conversely, a decline of 5%
reduces the ER  .So 1.9%.  Some market analysts believe that prospects for
price recovery in the medium term are good.
V. CONCLUSIONS
A. Overall Assessment
5.01      In summary, the project can be considered worthwhile although
only marginally successful in terms of its economic benefits. The project
is expected to have a positive impact in Romania's development plans in the
pipe industry which aim at self-sufficiency and maintaining at least
marginal exports, although these benefits will materialize at a slower pace
than originally expected. Due to depressed prices, reduced domestic
consumption and increased export to COMECON countries, it is also highly
unlikely that the project will yield the foreign exchange savings and
earnings originally expected.
5.02      The Bank had a limited role in project design or choice of
technology but was influential in defining the economic size of the project
(130,000 tpy vs. 108,000 tpy), and in determining the appropriate number
and type of equipment (particularly finishing) to be incorporated in the
project. The Bank also secured the necessary assurances regarding
arrangements that would ensure the proper quality and the adequate quantity
of steel ingots required for the project.
5.03      Many of the risks identified during appraisal have affected the
project in various degrees. The most important so far is the decline in
the international market resulting from a worldwide slowdown in oil and gas
exploration, increased protectionism, environmental issues (such as thcae
related to the construction of nuclear plants) and overall economic
recessioa. Contrary to appraisal expectations the domestic market has been
'lo sezriously affected thus increasing the surplus production available
for exports.
5.04      These market risks associated with the project were expected to
be reduced through a covenant requiring the Remanians to undertake thorough
market analysis of domestic and international supply and demand of seamless
pipes, including marketing set-up and arrangements. Although a bona-fide
effort was undertaken and the covenant was fulfilled, (i) the market study
was of poor quality and both the domestic and international analysis lacked
analytical depth, and (ii) no special marketing set-up or arrangements



- 10 -
appear to have been made and the product continues to be promoted and sold
through existing channels (METALIMPORTEXPORT). Even if this covenant had
been more effectively carried out, it is unlikely it could have
significantly reduced the project's vulnerability to market risks.
5.05      Regarding the quality of the raw material ingots, although some
are being rejected, they are quickly replaced and production build-up,
which is slower than anticipated anyway, has not been affected. Agreements
reached in this area, particularly with regards to-the testing of ingots by
the equipment manufacturer well ahead of the start of commercial
production, proved very effective. Although Pilger technology was used for
the first time in the country, technical assistance arrangements and
training with the equipment manufacturer together with the country's proven
experience in the manufacture of seamless pipes, were critical to the
successful process of transfer of technology and technical operation of the
project.
5.06      Finally, the project did suffer longer than expected
implementation delays, many as a result of the prevailing strong tendency
in Romania to produce locally as much equipment as possible to alleviate
foreign exchange constraints. For example, some of the equipment supplied
for the project was being manufactured for the first time in Romania and
this resulted in manufacturing delays. Also, occasionally local equipment
did not meet design standards and had to be corrected. To this extent, the
economic costs associated with implementation delays were never fully
appreciated by the Romanian authorities.
B. Lessons Learned
5.07      The Roman seamless pipes project was the last in a group of six
industrial projects identified and appraised during the late 1970s and
benefited to some extent from experience gained during the implementation
of earlier projects. Nevertheless, some of the lessons learned in carrying
out the Roman project have similarities with past projects and relate to
the need to establish realistic schedules for: (i) bidding, negotiating
and finalizing international contracts; 'ii) implementation of civil works;
and (iii) domestic manufacturing of equipment. Finally, greater attention
should be placed during appraisal on market forecasts and marketing set-up
and arrangements. The latter, particularly in export-oriented projects,
are critical to ensure the sustainability of project benefits. Covenants
for future studies by themselves can do little to reduce the project's
market-related risks.

3.09.   2he ProJect's completion was estimated, at the time of
Prooot'o appraisul, to take place by the end of December 1981,
to enable PrJect's operation at full oapseitY (130,000 tpy) by
1986. Civil works stertd in April 1980 ap sempared to the first
quarter 1979 estimated at the tim* of Project's appraisal.
Th conclusion of the main technology sad equipment con-

procurement of ether hard currency imported equipment, we  the
masi reasons of the delay in startin the Project's Implementa-
tioe  and comissioning of the preduotioe capacity.
2he actual implemntation schedule as compared to the
appraisal estimates ib given in Annex 1.
3.10.   The detalled reasons leading to the delay in commissionia
of the production capacity,ere:
a) Delayed contracting of some finishing equipment,with
delivery terms not correlated with delivery term of hot rolling
mill (fourth quarter 1981 to first quarter 1982), namely:
- the pipes hydrostatic testing press delivered in
November 1983;
- the pipes and couplings cutting muchinse, as a
result of initial contract'ctancelation concluded
with Pistellini - Italy, as explained in paragraph
3.09
- the API calibre. grinding machines sad expanding
banch, as a result of the difficulties in finding
the interested suppliers.
b) The delays in delivering of some finishing equipment
compared to the contractual delivery terms, as followst



- 26 -
the pipes theading uIohiae as a result ef the banok-
rupteoy of Orida- frae and taking over the contraot
by the producing compeay, as explained under paragraph
3,09;
the API calibres grinding maehines, supplier Landriani
Italy, due to the fact that the initial delivered ma-
chine, had hard detoriorations as a result *f an unap-
propriated packing in Italy. Under the circumstances,
these machines were sent back to Italy for remedies.
a) The occurenca of some defects in the operation of some
equipcont and epperete, which led to atop of the rolling mill,
asB fohlowas
the defect of PLC programmblo oomtrohlors, delivered
by Werner firm me sub-supplier of anesmonn Domag -
P0]16 of Germanye The replacement of these controllers
was required and this led to an actual delay of the
tests by 5 months; period of time including the teots
for findiag tho defects;
the defect of the action transformer for Pilger conver
targ delivered by Ansaldo firm as sub-supplier of
Hmanema  Demag - P.R. of Germany, whioh led to a
delay of one month and a hslf ia tests;
the dislocation with about 10 mm on foundation of
the presentment moohenism from Plger mill due to
unappropriated solution for fixing it given by
Mannesmann Deaig - P.R. of Grmany i  the technioal
docuseatation delivered. Based en a joint agreesaet
with the supplier, the consolidating end fixing works
of the frame en foundation wer made, and for this
resson the operation was stopped for oes months.
d) Not reaching the parameters provided in the toohaical
bidt  based en which the contracts were awarded forg



- 27 -
- the couplings tbohading muohims, doli"erd by
Keaomima Demog- F.Re of Gemay, at Which. during
the tests, the defeot appeared at aumerical order
*ad at the sandel for aoupling0s fiing,g not ensurii
the good quality of throad. To eliaiast, these dateso
"es modifiostioans and ompleti.ns were required,for
which the machinm  had not operated for 8 months;
- the pipes tbreading machine, delivered by Berthies -
Prance, which, during the tests, processed vibrated
threads. To eliminate these defects, some constructi
modificatiom were mad,e for which the mahine had
not operated for 3 monthb.
*) Mannesman Demag - F1.  of Germany had not finalised
the documentation for the production of high alloy and stainless
steel pipes and they had sent with delay the production technolo
accordingly causing diffioulties in production of produot six
acoording to the program, respectively for nuclear pipes, pipes
for power sector, low temperature pipes.
P.      Costs. Disbursements and Financin
3,11.       The total cost of the Project, as present estimated,
based on actual expenditures by September 30,1985 and estimates
by the completion of all remaining works, is of LIoi 2919291
million (US $ 129.2 million), compared with Lei 2,381.9 million
(US $ 1323 million) estimated at the time of Project's appraise
!Te total capital cost is detailed, in L1i and US $, oompared
with estimates at the time of Project's appraisale, in Annex 3.
The fixed assets oost overrun the Initial estimates
with US $ 1.6 million. Howe"r, the total cost of the Project
is loes then the estimate at the ti.' of Project'e appraisa1l
due to the fact that the working capital roeeived by the anter-
pr5.os in 1984, was correlated with the commissioned produation
seapsity, and tho excbange rate of If@i %o/ US $ 1 used to convex
the working capital In US $ equivalent compared with Lei 18/US$
ued at the time of Projeot's appraisal.



- 28 -
Also in comparinS the aotual cost of the Project with
that estimsted at the time of Pro,ect's appraisal, an wel as
In reviewiag, by eategoris of expeaditures, the Project cost
exproed in US $, there has to be taken into account the
followings
- the estimates for the total cost of the Prj ot were
made in March 1978, with about one year before the conclusion of
maiA technology sud equipment contract and the finaliszation of
the tocbnioal-oonomic documentetion,
The main tochnology and equipment contract was concluded
at a much lower value than estimated at the time of Projectts
appraisal ( actual value US $ 14.7 million oompard with US C
32.0 million at th  time of appraisal), diminishing the total
coat of the Project;
- the Project cost expressed in Lei and implicitly in
US $ increased from the Proj.ot2s appraisal by now due to the
prices resetting., in the Romaenian economy, in 1980 and 1982,
the contingencies being higher than those estimated at the time
of Project's appraisal;
- the imports substitution policy which deot-oinad that a
major part of the machine and equipment initially provided to
be imported,.to be manufactured end usupplied in due time by
local manacturers; this led to the reduction of the foreign
exchange cost;
- the succesive changes of the foreign exchange rate of
Leu/US $ from Lei 18/US $ 1 in 1979-1980 used at the Project's
appraisal to Lei 15/US $ 1 in 1981-19829 Lei 16.5/US  1 and
Lei 17.5o/US $ 1 in 1983, and starting with December 1983 a
weekly exchange rate based on a basket of curenoies,the oficial
echaugo rates being of Lei 21,50/US $ 1 in 1984, and starting
with November 1,1984 by now Lei 17,50/US $ 1. About 46% of the
total expenditures for the Projoct wera made during 1982 when the
exchange rate was of Lei 15/US $ 1l



- 29 -
The in.uzoes of redmuig ozr increasing the total sogt
of theD PrOjet led,fiaally, to ea actual cost of the Project,
oxpriesed la US $, lower with US $ 3.1 million then 'hoae e*t-
mted at the time of Project'is appraoal.
PzJiet Pinaagu@l
3.12.   Mhe etimates at the time of Projeot's appraisal providec
for that three sources would be used for Project financing:
state funds, TBED loan for 54% of the financing requirements in
foreign exchange currencies ( US $ 40.0 million) and suppllers'
credit in forign exchange cus for financing of the direc
cost portion in foreign exchange currencies of the P-ojeot un-

The following three factors had an important contri-

at the time of froject's appraisal:
- the entiroly financing out of the Bank loan of the
main technology and equipment package, leading to the increase
of its percentage in the Bank loan;
- the local manufacturing and procurement from
COUCON contries of some machines and equipment initially provid
to be imported from freely convertible areas, loading to thk
reduction of the percentage of other imported equipment packages
in the Bank loan and Increase of tho percentage of local manifac

The current estimates of the product miz at full

and auclear contrals'impl.mentation.
Using the mame praoea for each type of products,
both for the product miz had in view on Project 's appraisal and
currently estimated, it is resulting a favourable effect of the

commissioning by acbieving the full capacity, the sales volume
to be achieved by Roman Pipes Enterprise from Pilger i-olling ail
represents 68.2% out of the estimated volume at the time of ap-

of the production capacity had takan placo gradually, as shown

5.04.        For the purpose of making a nw .estimate of th
JProeooVe financial rate of return, the following major esstuap
tious bhve boon mados
(1) capital cost expressed in US dol&ar equivalut,owas
oaloulateod by oonverting Lei amounts into US $ using the xchange
3ttes prevailing as of the date ft dilbursemeates (i) 1985 pipes
prices and produotion costs were used an  assumed t, remaij comp.
stut ia future years; and (iii) the rolling dll was assumd to
roeah ful operation in 1988, whioh would be equivalest to a
learning curve two years longr.
5.05.    Under the asawuptioms above,the financial rate of returi
is of 7.44% as compared to 5% appraisal estimate as show J
Me increos is maily due to the abseace of any sigal
ficoat cost overrus despite the delay in project isplentation.
vi.r       ROONOMIC PIRPORMAJOR
6.01.    Tho economio rate of return, calculated in Amex 10 is
of 13.0% as compared to 12.5% estimated at ProjeCt's appraisal.
Fer the calculation of the Projectts economic coats and
benefits, the following adjustments to the financial data are mad
- the taxes on imports were eliminated;
-the cost of ingots were increased, since they reprooent
60.8% in the production expenditures, with a view of
reflecting the economic oost of iron ore, fuel and
power used for ingots'production;
-for pipes exports P)B prices were need for the luropear
market, while for the pipes sold locally the cost.
assumed were the importation cost of such pipes made
by Romania.
6.02.    Operating at full capacity the Project will ensure sant
foreign exchange savings amounting to US $ 74.3 million.

6.03.           be implementation of the Project in Roman, is
providing about 860 additional jobo, the PoJoot contributLzg
to the Industrial development of the region.
ho Project also contributei to facilitate exports
of engineering goods, lncreasing the competitivness of the Roma-
nian firmes for exports such an boilers, oil drilling equipment
and equipmeat for chemical industry, ensuring full product mix of
pipes required for manufacturing such goods.
Sinoo the Project is the first one using Pilger
teohnology in Romanio, the entire pipe industry of the country
benefits from this transfer of technology.
