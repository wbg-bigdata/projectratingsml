1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Solomon Islands are a scattered archipelago extending over
1,400 km between Bougainville in Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu (formerly New
Hebrides). Total land area is about 29,000 sq. km. About 90% of the total
population of about 230,000 are rural dwellers, residing in small, widely
dispersed settlements located along the coasts. The most common form of
settlement is a group of families, or clan, rarely exceeding 50 people.
1.02      Having been a British Protectorate since 1893, the Solomon Islands
attained internal self-government in 1976 and full independence in 1978.
The economy is based primarily on agriculture, including forestry, livestock
and fisheries. The 1980 per capita GNP is estimated at about US$460. Sub-
sistence (nonmonetary) production is important, contributing 40% to the GDP.
As is typical in the islands in the Pacific, the basic needs of the popula-
tion for food and shelter are reasonably well met from subsistence activity.
Nine out of ten households are engaged in subsistence food production to
some extent. A large proportion of rural households also earns some cash
from crop production and intermittent wage employment.
1.03      As economic development of the Solomon Islands has progressed, a
very uneven distribution of the benefits of development among the various
parts of the country has emerged. Wide regional disparities have resulted
from a combination of the following factors: (a) differences in resource
endowments, including the availability of agricultural land per household;
(b) the concentration of large-scale agricultural investments in a few
provinces; and (c) the lack of sustained efforts by the Government to foster
balanced regional development.
Development Issues
1.04      The main developmental challenges facing the Solomon Islands are the
need for: (a) human resource development at all levels; and (b) a regionally
balanced expansion of employment opportunities and the exchange economy, with
particular emphasis on smallholder agriculture.
1.05      Human Resource Development.  The low educational development of the
Solomon Islanders is not only a serious constraint to economic development but
also limits the extent to which the benefits of economic growth can be cap-
tured for the citizens. Due to an acute shortage of skilled local manpower, a
heavy reliance has been placed on foreign skills. A high proportion of
middle- and high-level administrative, managerial and technical posts in both
the public and private sectors is held by expatriates./l Noncitizens domi-
nate large commercial and industrial enterprises and trade.
/1 About 10% of all established public service posts are staffed by expatri-
ates. Most of these posts are at middle- and high-levels.

1.06      In 1975, almost one-half of the adult population had not received
any formal schooling and only 5.5% had received education above the primary
level. Currently only 60% of the relevant age groups are enrolled at the
primary level, 25% at the lower secondary level, 7% at the upper secondary
level and 1% at the tertiary level. These proportions vary significantly
between regions. The Association's experience has shown that the rate of
return on the expansion of primary education is strikingly high in countries
with low educational attainment, such as the Solomon Islands. Increased
agricultural productivity, lower infant mortality and decreased fertility
all have a strong correlation with the attainment of education.  The Solomon
Islands score particularly low in twco of these areas. Infant mortality is
high at 60/1,000 live births /1 (compared to the regional average of
44/1,000), and the crude birth rate is among the highest in the world at
49/1,000./2 As a first step in developing human resources, enrollments at
the primary level need to be increased.
1.07      There is a strong case for increasing substantially the coverage
of primary education in the Solomon Islands, but the quality of primary
education must also be improved. Many primary school leavers will have no
further education, and education at this level should prepare most students
for life in the communities. It should also provide others with a sound
basis for studies at the secondary level, because ultimately the country's
ability to produce sufficient middle- and high-level manpower will depend on
the quality of primary education. The importance the Government attaches to
basic education reflects its desire that the country's own people be trained
for national service, as, for example, in agricultural and health extension.
Project Generation
1.08      The proposed project was identified by an Association mission in
May 1980, prepared by the Government with the Association's assistance from
August 1980-March 1981 and appraisted in April 1981./3 This project would be
the first lending operation in the SoLomons with the Association in the lead
role. In an attempt to adapt Association operations to the small size of
the country's economy, the project originally included two sectors -
education and transportation. The transport component was deleted after
appraisal because of available financing from other sources.

(architect and mission leader), M. Matheson (general educator, consultant)

2. ISSUES IN PRIMARY EDUCATION
Overview
2.01      Primary education in the Solomon Islands is of six years duration
and is provided by 289 public and 55 private schools, with a total enroll-
ment of 28,900 (1980). Until 1974, church related agencies, chiefly the
Seventh Day Adventists, provided most of primary education. While some of
these groups are still active, they are generally phasing out their assist-
ance and, therefore, responsibility for providing primary education rests
increasingly with the Government. The same is true with secondary educa-
tion, which is offered at eight Provincial and seven National Secondary
Schools. About 35% of primary school graduates enter secondary school.
Drawing students from their respective provinces, the Provincial Secondary
Schools have a total enrollment of 1,500 and conduct three year programs
(grades 7 to 9) that are predominantly vocational in nature. The National
Secondary Schools have a total enrollment of 2,000 students selected from
all provinces for a five-year academic course (grade 7 to 11). An addi-
tional 12th year of training (Form 6) is given to a small number of students
(65 in 1980) to prepare them for tertiary training. Some of this tertiaLry
training is given by the Honiara Technical Institute which provides basic
courses in technical and commercial subjects to about 600 students a year;
and by the Solomon Islands Teachers College, with an enrollment of 160
students. which trains primary and secondary school teachers. A large part
of the tertiary education takes place abroad, mainly in Papua New Guinea and
Fiji.
2.02      The primary education subsector suffers from five main types of
problems: (a) deficiencies in management, (b) poor quality of education
(c) enrollment stagnation; (d) financial constraints; and (e) imbalances in
the equality of opportunity for primary education.
Education Management
2.03      Weaknesses in education management in the Solomon Islands are
largely due to the lack of training of management staff at various leveLs.
The current and projected future education management cadre number as
follows:

Primary school headmasters                370          400
/a Including SITC and Honiara Technical Institute staff.
2.04      National Level Administration.  The Ministry of Education
Training and Cultural Affairs (MET) is responsible for carrying out
Government policy for all aspects of education and training. MET's
responsibilities include registraltion of schools, setting of student intake
policies, payment of teachers' salaries, and the setting of policies on
deployment of teachers. Its Curr:Lcu]Lum Coordinating Committee has the
mandate to approve the outputs of various MET curriculum subject panels and
subcommittees including that of the Curriculum Development Unit of the
Solomon Islands Teachers' College (SITC). MET-s management of many of its
activities tends to be weak, largely due to the lack of training of its
professional staff. These weaknesses in management are particularly
pronounced with regard to its dealings with the SITC. There are several
cases in which SITC actions have been in contradiction to the MET's
policies, but the MET has failed to react. For example, in 1981 the SITC
accepted only 41 students for primary teacher training out of 500
applicants, which was less than 50% of the MET's target figure of 90
entrants. SITC felt emphasis should be placed on training secondary level
teachers. MET and SITC views alsc, often differ over the printing and
distribution of primary teaching mtaterials, but the MET offers little
resistance to SITC actions in this area. MET's weaknesses also show up in
its dealings with the provincial education authorities. Contrary to MET
regulations, untrained teachers are frequently assigned to grade 1, and
schools accept pupils at irregular intervals to avoid the multi-class
teaching that is encouraged by the MET.
2.05      Provincial Level Administration.  The country is divided into
eight provinces. Malaita, Western and Guadalcanal, the most densely
inhabited provinces, contain two-thirds of the total population. The
capital city of Honiara, on the north coast of Guadalcanal, is itself
designated as a province. The administration of primary education within
these eight provinces is the responsibility of Provincial Education Boards.
They consist of elected members of provincial governments who are advised by
the Provincial Education Secretary and his staff. In accordance with a



- 5 -
quota set by the MET, the Boards employ teachers and then deploy them among
the province's primary schools. A 1980 school survey showed serious
shortcomings in the efficiency of the Boards- deployment practices. For
example, Western Province was found to have one school with only one teacher
and a total enrollment of 51 pupils, while another school in that province
had 2 teachers and 12 pupils. Instances were also found where a province
had some schools that employed only trained teachers and other schools that
had very few or even no trained teachers. Once the provinces have assigned
teachers to their schools, there is little follow-up by the Boards to assess
performance or advise on improvements. Some field supervisors are used, but
they are few in number, often have trouble reaching remote schools and do
not assume an advisory role.
2.06      Local Level Administration.  At the local level, community school
committees are responsible for providing and maintaining public school
facilities and teacher housing. They also provide guidance to teachers and
headmasters on the preservation of local cultural values. Active participa-
tion in these committees by community members is encouraged by the Govern-
ment. The day-to-day running of the public and private schools is the
responsibility of headmasters, whose effectiveness is limited by a general
lack of administrative training and marginal knowledge of government
policies and procedures.
Education Quality
2.07      In general the quality of primary education in the Solomon Islands
is inadequate. While instructional programs seem to be well balanced and
improvements in curriculum have been made, drawbacks exist in terms of
language problems, weak instructional methods, scarcity of textbooks and
teaching materials, and poorly trained teachers.
2.08      Instructional Programs and Methods.  In the Solomon Islands set-
ting, where more than 80 local dialects are spoken, language problems hamper
teaching programs. English is the official medium of instruction, and all
textbooks are in English, but only a small fraction of the school children
have mastered that language upon entry. Consequently, some teaching is
carried out in Pidgin, which is widely used as a lingua franca. Other
teachers instruct in the local language, especially in the lower grades, but
this is only possible when the teacher originates from the area of his or
her deployment. Though there is no easy solution to the language problems,
a large proportion of the primary instructional program is appropriately
devoted to language studies. The time distribution of subjects of the 140
day (5 day a week) school-year is shown in Table 2.2.

2.09       Instructional methods vary, depending upon the quality, training
and experience of teachers, but the n)st widely used methods are teacher
centered lectures and rote learning. The generally small and scattered
nature of the schools makes multi-grade teaching a necessity in most cases.
However, little weight has been given in the past to training teachers in
effective multigrade teaching. Also, there is virtually no attempt made to
group children according to their abi:Lities. Gifted students are slowed
down while poor students are left behind and indirectly encouraged to drop
out.
2.10       Curriculum.  The curricuLum has been developed with the assistance
of the University of the South Pacific which also prepares textbooks for the
South Pacific Islands. The preseni: curriculum is suitable for use in the
Solomon Islands and for the presenit project. Continuing development of
curriculum and materials is conducited by the Curriculum Development Unit in
the Solomon Islands Teachers  College (SITC).  This combination of teacher
training with curricula reinforces the linkage between subject matter and
its presentation through the schoo:L curriculum. The Curriculum Development
Unit has recently started a one year course for 25 experienced teachers in
the field of curriculum development. On return to their schools, they are
provided with a guide for testing the materials. A few selected teachers
are also trained overseas in curriculum methods. As this operation is in
its early stages, it is still premature to assess its impact on the schools,
but the outlook is favorable. New facilities for the Curriculum Development
Unit are currently under construction with British aid.

2.11      Textbooks and Teaching Materials.  Although great strides are
being made in developing relevant curricula, there has been much less
success in effectively distributing textbooks and teaching materials to the
schools. Rural primary schools generally possess only a few tattered
textbooks while urban schools are somewhat better equipped. Most schools
have little in the way of materials, such as poster board, glue and paints,
with which to produce classroom aids. A printing unit has recently been
equipped within the SITC for trial runs of materials developed there, and
the Government Printer has the capacity to do longer runs of soft-cover
books. However, the chronic shortage of textbooks and teaching materials
persists, due partly to the lack of funds for producing or purchasing
materials on a large scale, and considerable logistical problems in
distribution to the widely dispersed schools. In addition, there does not
seem to be a firm government policy towards supplying educational materials,
resulting in the late supply of course books each year and ineffective
management of their distribution. It will be necessary for the Government
to develop a textbook policy, including frequency of book replacement,
conditions of use, and whether any charges should be made to students.
2.12      Facilities.  In general, the existing primary school facilities
are impoverished, reflecting the economic conditions of the communities
which are responsible for providing them. There is considerable variation
between urban and rural schools. Urban schools are usually built of semi-
permanent wooden frames with corrugated iron roofs. A typical rural school
is a poorly lit leaf hut with crude benches and cracked blackboards. Pro-
vision of building materials has been a problem in rural areas as suitable
leaf material is often not easily available within the vicinity of a school.
Also, maintenance of the leaf hut schools is labor intensive and many are in
disrepair due to a growing reluctance of parents to contribute at short
intervals both time and funds for school construction.  Storage for teaching
materials and textbooks rarely exists at either urban or rural schools.
2.13      Teacher Qualifications and Supply.  Trained primary teachers have
chronically been in short supply in the Solomon Islands due to a combination
of insufficient training facilities and a shortage of suitable trainees. To
help reduce teacher shortages, untrained or partly trained teachers have
been recruited. Table 2.3 shows the numbers of primary teachers and their
levels of training for the period 1976-80.

2.14       All primary teacher training is carried out at the Solomon Islands
Teachers' College (SITC) on the outskirts of the capital, Honiara. The
college offers courses in primary teaching at the certificate and diploma
levels. The certificate course consists of two years of training at the
college followed by one year's probationary service in primary schools. The
Diploma of Education course consists of three years training at the college
and prepares teachers for work in either primary or lower secondary schools.
The diploma course is run in collaboration with the University of the Sotth
Pacific in Fiji. The SITC also carries out in-service training for
untrained primary teachers. This consists of vacation period training each
year for two years, after which an untrained teacher is upgraded to part-
trained teacher status. Additional in-service training is provided at nine
teacher's resource centers spread throughout the country which were estab-
lished between 1976-79. These centers conduct short courses for provincial
teachers with emphasis on coping with the problems of composite class
teaching and to help in preparation of teaching aids.
2.15       At present, SITC's facilities allow an enrollment of 160 students,
about 75% of which are in primary teaching programs. With an average output
of only 55 new primary teachers per year between 1976 and 1980, no signi-
ficant progress has been made in increasing the number of trained teachers
as a proportion of total primary teachers. (Table 2.3). Table 2.4 shows
estimates of teacher requirements between 1981 and 1985, based on the Govern-
ment's plan to increase primary enrollments by 7% per annum and to raise the
teacher:pupil ratio from the current: 1:26 to a more efficient target of
1:28 in 1985./1  At the current rate of output of trained teachers from
SITC, there would be little change in the proportion of trained teachers
over the next five years. Large scale expansion of SITC's facilities is
clearly needed if the demand for trained primary teachers is to be met.
/1 By 1990 the Government plans to raise the teacher:pupil ratio to 1:30.

2.16       In the past, the pressure on SITC to increase enrollments has not
been great, due to the shortage of suitable entrants. Normal entry require-
ment for primary teacher training is now grade 10 training, but in earlier
times SITC accepted many entrants with only six or seven years of primary
education, to fill student places. This constraint is expected to be alle-
viated in the near future due to a doubling of secondary level enrollments
from 1,550 in 1975 to 3,220 in 1979. Also, teaching careers were made much
more attractive to school leavers in 1975 through Government action to
create the National Teaching Service and a subsequent policy declaration by
Parliament in 1980 on improving career advancement opportunities and
salaries. Expansion of pre-service teacher training alone would not solve
the problem of poor teacher quality. A large number of untrained or partly
trained teachers would most likely stay in the system, and their skills
would need to be improved through increased in-service training programs.
Enrollment Stagnation
2.17       Dimensions of the system.  Primary school enrollments in the
Solomon Islands have shown little growth over the past decades, and enroll-
ment rates actually deteriorated in recent years. Enrollment increased
marginally in absolute numbers from about 25,100 in 1971 to 28,900 in 1980
(Table 2.5).  The stagnation of enrollments between 1976 and 1980 was partly



- 10 -
due to the reduction in the number of grades from seven to six, but finan-
cial constraints on the part of Provincial Governments have prevented the
number of classrooms from keeping pace with the estimated 3.4% annual
increase in population growth. DiLminishing support by the churches for
primary education has also been a factor. As shown in Table 2.6, the
enrollment ratio for primary education in the country declined between
1976-80 at an average annual rate of 1.2%.

2.18      In addition to limiting enrollments, the lack of school facilities
within reasonable commuting distance has been cited as a cause of absen-
teeism and eventual dropout from a grade. About 25% of the students who
enter grade 1 drop out before grade 6 as shown in Table 2.7. Physical
immaturity of the younger students at entry age (6-9 years) often makes it
difficult for them to travel the distance to school. Many schools uni-
laterally decide to accept only students of 8 years or older for this
reason. Thus, lack of accessible schools is a contributing factor to an
undesirable age disparity within each class cohort, as shown in Table 2.8.

An additional factor contributing to this undesirable age disparity is
teacher opposition to multi-grade teaching (para. 2.09). A government sur-
vey in 1981 showed that many schools in rural areas will only admit students
at two, three or even four-year intervals.
2.19      Equality of Opportunity.  As evidenced by the enrollment ratios
shown in Table 2.6, some provinces are much more advantaged than others in
the amount of school facilities available within their region. This is also
true in terms of the quality of education given. School equipment and
teaching aids are not equitably distributed throughout the country, and some
provinces have a disproportionately high number of untrained teachers.
2.20      There is also an imbalance between the number of girls and boys
enrolled in primary schools. Although the situation has steadily improved
during the past ten years, girls constituted only 41% of total enrollments
in 1980, as shown in Table 2.9. Further progress is necessary in this
respect, especially given the context of the Solomon Islands economy where
women contribute at least 50% of labor to the agricultural work force. In
many of the outlying areas, tribal men devote a large part of their time to
ceremonial activities while the women perform gardening chores. Their role
in the economy of the country strongly indicates the need for increasing the
enrollment ratio of girls in primary schools.

Education Finance
2.21      In 1980, total expenditure on education in the Solomon Islands was
about SI$5.0 million, a significant increase over the 1975 expenditure of
SI$2.0 million. The 1980 expenditure represented a moderate 10.0% of total
public expenditure and about 4.2% of GDP. The Government is placing greater
emphasis on the development of human resources under its current draft plan
(1980-84) than in the past. Education development expenditure, which was
only SI$1.2 million in 1980, is accordingly scheduled to rise to SI$2.3
million in 1981 and gradually increase to SI$3.3 million in 1984. Further
increases are proposed in the draft plan for 1981-85. Because of limited
amounts of revenue sources, the Government will have to rely heavily on
external aid to finance its ambitious plans for educational development.
Government Plans
2.22      The Government's objectives in the education sector are to:
(a) provide equal education opportunities regardless of sex,
religion or location;
(b) establish linkages between education and national development;
and
(c)  provide skill training for its growing economy.
Immediate Government strategies in the sector are to:
(a) increase enrollment in primary education at 7% per annum
from the current 28,900 to 40,600 in 1985, to achieve an enroll-
ment ratio of 70%;
(b) improve primary education quality;
(c) match outputs from nationa:L secondary schools with manpower
needs, including emphasis on agricultural and technical skills;
(d)  increase access to provLncial secondary schools and to adult/non-
formal education centers for those who do not gain entry to
national secondary schools;
(e)  provide equitable access to higher education through merit and
provincial quotas and scholarships, where needed; and
(f)  introduce more relevant curricula at all levels.

Association Assistance Strategy
2.23      For the further development of the Solomon Islands assistance in
the education sector is of great importance. The Government strategies
in this sector are sound and are supported by the Association, which
considers improvement and expansion of primary education to be of the
highest priority.

3.01      The proposed project is designed to support Government development
plans in the education sector. It would: (a) help improve education manage-
ment at various levels through provision of training for national and pro-
vincial administrators and for headmasters; (b) upgrade education quality
through improved inservice teacher training and provision of textbooks and
teaching materials; (c) increase primary enrollments through provision of
new school facilities and expansion of preservice teacher training to
provide the needed teachers; and (d) equalize education opportunities among
provinces and between the sexes by improving access to education of good
quality in underserved areas. To achieve these objectives the project would
finance:
(a) training in educational administration of 34 national and
provincial level education officers and headmasters;
(b) inservice training in multigrade teaching techniques of about
1,200 teachers annually;
(c) purchase of 150,000 textbooks and teachers- guides and provision
of supplementary teaching materials;
(d) building materials for construction of about 300 new primary
school classrooms;
(e) construction, equipment and fellowships to enable the Solomon
Islands Teachers College to increase its enrollment from 160 to
400; and
(f) related specialist services (17 man-years).
Project Components
3.02      Education Management (Proposed outlay:  US$0.6 million, excluding
contingencies). To upgrade the skills of national level education officers,
the proposed project would provide staff training comprising: (a) short
courses (two-months) in educational administration for six staff; and



- 16 -
(b) one- to two-year courses in education administration, school location
analysis, personnel relations, supervision, budgeting and finance for up to
eight staff. Twenty provincial lelel education officers and headmasters
would receive short training courses (two months) in administration. Most
of the short courses would be conducted at either the University of the
South Pacific (Suva, Fiji) or at 1:he University of Papua New Guinea. The
longer courses, for the most part, would be conducted further afield. Most
courses would be nondegree in nature.
3.03      To prevent excessive depletion of staff, this training would be
spread evenly over the project period.  In addition, headquarters staff
would be reinforced with the services of an education planning specialist
(three man-years). This specialist wrould help the MET identify and overcome
weaknesses in planning and administration and would assist in organizing and
implementing the training courses for MET staff, provincial administrators
and headmasters.
3.04      Inservice Teacher Training (Proposed outlay:  US$0.7 million,
excluding contingencies). To help overcome the shortcomings in the qualifi-
cations of existing primary teaching staff (para. 2.13), the proposed
project would provide inservice teacher training. This training would place
particular emphasis on classroom management/multigrade teaching techniques
and on the use of the new textbooks and teaching materials that would also
be provided under the proposed project, as discussed below. Inservice
training would be conducted in two phases. The first phase would create a
core group of 20 master trainers, to be selected from experienced teachers,
headmasters and provincial staff. These 20 would receive six months of
training in a tailormade course which would be conducted by a university
experienced in multigrade teaching techniques./1   Part of this course would
be conducted overseas and the balance in the Solomon Islands. On completion
of their training, the master trainers would commence the second phase of
inservice training. They would prepare materials and conduct short courses
(one to two weeks) at existing schools and resource centers (para. 2.14) for
groups of about 20-24 teachers three times per year during school holidays.
During the project period, each servirLg teacher would receive this training
once a year, starting in mid-1983. Candidates for master trainers have been
identified and are expected to begin their training in July 1982. During
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would by December
1982 prepare a plan to discourage the "alternate year intake" practice
(paras. 2.04, 2.09 and 2.18).
3.05      The project would provide the services of two education special-
ists to supervise the production of inservice training materials by the
master trainers and monitor their work in conducting the short courses.
These specialists would be based at the Solomon Islands Teachers' College
/1 Negotiations are currently underway with two establishments in New South
Wales.



- 17 -
(SITC) and travel to the other provinces as needed. They would be hired for
overlapping terms of three years each to cover the entire project
implementation period.
3.06      Educational Materials (Proposed outlay:  US$0.4 million, excluding
contingencies). With the purpose of upgrading the quality of education, the
proposed project would provide all primary schools with textbooks, teachers'
guides and other printed teaching materials. About 150,000 textbooks of
about 64 pages each would be provided (i.e. one book per pupil and grade in
each of the five major subjects). Teachers' guides would also be provided,
together with supplementary printed materials.
3.07      Selection of appropriate materials and development of teachers-
guides would be done by SITC-s Curriculum Development Unit and MET officials
with assistance from the education specialists provided under the inservice
training component (para. 3.05). Because of the diseconomies of textbook
development for such a small country, the emphasis would be on purchasing or
adapting suitable materials from the existing "South Pacific Series" text-
books for use in the Solomon Islands. To ensure the adequate and timely
supply of these textbooks, an acceptable plan of textbook purchase and
materials production including the methods of delivery has been prepared.
In order to develop a policy of regular replacement of textbooks and
teaching materials, records would be kept for a small sample to determine
length of physical life (para. 2.11).
3.08      Primary Education Facilities (Proposed outlay:  US$2.4 million,
excluding contingencies). To help meet the Government's target for
increased primary school enrollments, the proposed project would provide
building materials for construction of about 300 new classrooms. This would
satisfy about 75% of the estimated requirements for new classrooms in
accordance with the planned 7% per annum growth in enrollments as shown in
Table 3.1. The project would not attempt to meet the total need for new
classrooms due to the anticipation that:  (a) a realistic program of teacher
training would be able to provide staff for only about 300 classrooms; and
(b) there would inevitably be delays in constructing some of the 400
classrooms required to meet government enrollment targets.

3.09       Because of the need to maLke primary education more accessible to
the widely scattered small settleme!nts, these classrooms would, for the most
part, be provided in the form of one-room school buildings, rather than as
expansion to existing facilities. Taking into consideration the need to
alleviate regional imbalances, the claLssrooms would be allocated to the
provinces on the basis of the number needed to bring enrollment ratios as
close to the target of 70% by 1985 as feasible. The results of a school
location planning exercise conducted by the Government in 1981 has heavily
influenced the selection of school locations. This survey examined the
enrollments of children of school Entry age (6-9 years) and derived
estimates of new classrooms needed by each province (Table 3.2). The final
location and distribution of classrooms will be agreed between the MET and
provincial governments during project implementation. First priority would
be given to providing facilities where none exist at present, and there is a
known demand for such facilities.  Second priority would be given to
providing facilities to extend existing schools, provided that such
facilities would result in an expansion of enrollments at these schools.
Third priority would be given to relocation of existing schools to a new
catchment area with a resultant net increase in enrollments at the new
school.

3.10      New classrooms would be provided to the communities in the form of
building material kits, consisting of materials for concrete flooring,
wooden uprights, roof trusses, corrugated iron roofing with foil insulation,
blackboards, and materials to make simple furniture and storage cabinets for
teaching materials and textbooks. To facilitate transport and discourage
theft, the materials making up the kits would generally be pre-cut for
shipping and assembly on site. Prior to receiving building materials, the
communities would have to agree to maintain the buildings in satisfactoryr
condition.  This share of responsibilities would be in accordance with the
traditional role of the communities to provide school facilities (para.
d 2.06). The communities would have the option of providing walls, doors and
windows for the classrooms, though they are not essential in the country-s
climate.  A precondition to providing a building kit for any school would be
an undertaking by the province that the community would provide adequate
sites, teacher housing, labor, and sand and gravel for construction of the
classrooms. The adequacy of the proposed school sites would be reviewed by
the Project Unit in Honiara, with the assistance of its mobile supervisory
teams. The organization of these teams and labor forces for constructing
the schools is described in Chapter 4.
3.11      Preservice Teacher Training (Proposed outlay:  US$2.4 million,
excluding contingencies). To alleviate the prgblem of shortage of trained
primary school teachers (paras. 2.13'and 2.15) and meet the demand for new
teachers to be generated by planned enrollment increases, the proposed
project would help expand the SITC. College facilities would be increased
from the current 160 student places to permit the enrollment of 400 trainees



- 20 -
by 1987, 90% of whom would be in primary teaching programs. The annual
output of 170 primary teachers, commencing in 1988, would fully meet the
demand for new teachers each year and provide an additional 80 teachers per
year to replace retired teachers and replace or retrain unqualified
teachers. No difficulty is anticipated in recruiting entrants to teacher
training by the time SITC's expansion is completed (para. 2.16).
3.12      The enrollment expansion at SITC would be accomplished through
provision of civil works, equipment and furnishings for classrooms, library
facilities, alterations to an existing assembly hall and kitchen facilities,
and 22 additional staff housing units.  Since almost all trainees would be                -
boarders, new dormitory facilitiels for 210 students would also be provided.
3.13      To raise the quality of SITC staff, technical assistance would be
provided under the project in the form of eight fellowships of two years
duration each for teacher trainers. In addition, assistance in organizing
preservice training programs in multLgrade teaching techniques would be
given by the education specialists provided under the inservice training
component (para. 3.05). To ensure a continued supply of primary school
teachers in sufficient numbers, assurances were given by the Government
during negotiations that the MET would by December 1982 prepare a plan for
improving selection policies and procedures at SITC to ensure that MET-s
annual enrollment targets for primary teacher trainees are met.
3.14      Project Management and Evaluation.  (Proposed outlay: US$0.3 mil-
lion). As in the area of education management (paras. 2.03-2.05), skilled
manpower is insufficient for management of project implementation.
Therefore, foreign specialist services (eight man-years) would be obtained
to manage the project and conduct its evaluation (paras. 4.01, 4.02, 4.03).
Draft terms of reference are filed in Working Papers. There are no reliable
data on student achievements, but baseline data for the proposed project in
terms of enrollments, dropouts, teacher numbers and qualifications are
available. The proposed project implementation staff would evaluate project
success in terms of targeted increases in enrollments (cf. Table 3.1 and
para. 3.11), increases in the number of fully trained teachers (Table 2.4),
changes in teacher:pupil ratios, from 1:26 now to 1:28 in 1985 (Tables 2.4
and 3.1), methods of distribution, effectiveness and physical life of
textbooks and teaching materials (paras. 2.11 and 3.07), numbers of
in-service courses conducted (para.. 3.04) and number of classrooms built
(Table 3.2).
3.15      Future Investments (Proposed outlay:  US$0.1 million, excluding
contingencies).  The proposed project would include this modest amount
to conduct studies on issues in the education sector and to help prepare
future projects for external financing.

4. MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
Management
4.01      The proposed project would be implemented by existing line agen-
cies, suitably strengthened through technical assistance. Because some of
the agencies involved are seriously understaffed and because few nationals
have been trained in the needed skills, five expatriate specialists (total
of 17 man-years) would be employed to aid project implementation. In order
to coordinate the government agencies involved, responsibility for overall
project coordination would be placed in the Development Administration
Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs and National Development (Chart: A -
see Working Papers).

- 22 -
4.02      An expatriate project manager/building engineer and an accountant
with experience in contract administration would be hired for the duration
of the project to manage and coordinate all project activities. In addition
to its coordinating role, this technical group would supervise technical
aspects of civil works components of the proposed project.  It would in
particular:
(a) coordinate activities of executive government departments and
agencies and ensure that the covenants and conditions of the
Credit Agreement are complied with;
(b) prepare staffing plans;
(c) arrange for preparation of building designs and supervise the
approved capital works program;
(d) arrange for procurement of civil works, building materials,
furniture and equipment and ensure that contracts are awarded
in accordance with the Association and Government guidelines;
(e) arrange for preparation of project budgets;
(f) monitor and control costs in accordance with the approved budgets;
(g) maintain records and accounts, prepare periodic progress reports
and liaise with the Association;
(h)  prepare and submit disbursetment applications to the Association,
and
(i)  ensure the monitoring and evaluation of progress and the conduct
of project studies.
4.03      A Deputy Project Manager (expatriate) with specific responsibili-
ties for educational aspects of the project (including staff development
plans) would be located in the Ministry of Education and Training (MET).
He would, under the general guidance of the Permanent Secretary, be responsi-
ble for advising Ministry staff on education planning and administration
matters, help review detailed proposals for school locations, and prepare
proposals for improved textbook acquisition and delivery systems. His term
would be for three years. The two training advisors, located at SITC (para.
3.05), would complete the expatriate project implementing staff. Details of
terms of reference for project staff aLre shown in Working Papers.
4.04      Because several Government agencies would be involved in project
implementation, a coordinating committee, chaired by a representative of the
DAD, has been established. Committee members have been nominated by
Government agencies involved in project implementation, namely departments



- 23 -
within the MET and Ministry of Finance. The committee will meet
periodically to review progress, resolve issues and establish guidelines for
project implementors.
4.05      An early recruitment of project managers is essential to project
success. The foreign specialists in the project management team would
therefore be hired through the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation,
a recruitment agency which could also be utilized to help place fellowship
trainees overseas. This agency was selected by the Government with IDA
concurrence because of its demonstrated competence and prior knowledge of
requirements in the Solomon Islands.
Procurement Procedures
4.06      Civil Works.  Overall responsibility for organizing and supervis-
ing implementation of civil works components would rest with the Project
Manager to be appointed in DAD (paras. 4.01, 4.02). Detailed designs and
working drawings for all project items exist. These were reviewed during
negotiations and found acceptable.
4.07      The SITC buildings financed under the IDA Credit would be
constructed under contracts awarded under international competitive bidding
procedures in accordance with the Association's Guidelines. At least two
contracts are envisioned: one for academic and communal facilities (esti-
imated to cost about US$0.4 million), and another for staff houses
(estimated to cost US$0.8 million). Procurement of ADAB-financed boarding
facilities would not be governed by the Association's ICB guidelines.
4.08      Primary school construction would be done by communities interes-
ted in constructing new schools or expanding existing schools on locations
which have been identified as lacking classroom facilities (paras. 3.09 and
3.10). Typically, most of the land is communally owned by a clan, so site
acquisition should not be a problem for an interested community. The
Project Manager would arrange for shipments of complete kits of materials
for classrooms (including storage cupboards and knocked down furniture
(para. 3.10)) to be delivered by landing craft to a shore near the proposed
school location or overland by cross-country vehicles where this is
feasible. The communities would be responsible for transporting the
building materials to school sites on locations which cannot be reached by
motorized transport. In accordance with current practice, the communities
would organize their own labor gangs to erect the buildings and take care of
subsequent maintenance, under the general supervision of ten supervisors/
carpenters. These supervisors will work under the guidance of the project
director in Honiara. The supervisors will be provided with motorized canoes
to enable them to travel from school to school. During negotiations the
Government provided assurances that project financed building materials
would be supplied only to communities that have allocated a suitable school
site and declared themselves willing to erect and maintain the schools arnd
provide teacher housing.



- 24 -
4.09      Equipment, Materials and Textbooks.  Traditionally imported
building materials (i.e. corrugated iron roofing, insulation material and
cement), estimated to cost about US$0.5 million, would be procured through
international competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Association.
Domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% or the
existing customs duty over the c.i.f. price of competing imports, whichever
is the lower. Other building materials (mainly timber) would be procured in
accordance with local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the
Association. SITC equipment and furniture (US$200,000 total value), library
books (US$250,000 total value) and textbooks/printed materials (US$300,000
total value) would be procured in accordance with existing government
procedures. These procedures include local bidding, stores contracts with
local firms, indents with other Government entities (e.g. the Government
Printer) and procurement agreements wiLth Australian-based broker firms.
Because of the small volume and diverse nature of the goods to be procured
under this project these procedures are the most appropriate in terms of
efficiency and economy.
4.10      Specialist Services.  Selection of and terms of reference for the
recruiting firm and the five expatriate specialists are in accordance with
the Association's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981).
State of Preparation
4.11      The project is in an advanced state of preparation as follows:
(a) working drawings have been prepared for practically all SITC
buildings and construction of the ADAB-financed hosels is sched-
uled to start in March 1982;
(b)  design and specifications of classroom construction kits have been
prepared;
(c) specifications for equipmient and lists of books have been prepared
to permit start of procurement in mid-1982
(d)  negotiations are currently underway with New South Wales
training institutions to undertake training of "master trainers"
(para.  3.04) starting in July 1982
(e)  master trainers have been identified  and
(f) agreement has been reachetd with the Commonwealth Fund for Technical
Cooperation to start recruiting technical assistance in April/May
1982.
Further implementation activities are shown in Annex 2.

About US$ 0.9 million of the above construction costs would be for student
boarding facilities (13.5% of total base cost) and another US$0.7 million
would be for staff housing (9.8% of total base cost).

5.03      Bases of Cost Estimates.  Base costs refer to January 1982 prices.
Construction costs for the SITC-s academic and boarding facilities have been
estimated on the basis of recently built comparable facilities, constructecl
by the Government-s labor force. Despite extensive use of simple structures
and locally available materials, unit area costs are on the high side, at
US$315/sq m because of lack of competitiveness in the market. SITC-s hous--
ing costs have been estimated on the basis of recent construction costs of
identical facilities. Baseline costs of primary school construction kits
are based on detailed bills of quantities.  Including sea freight costs
these amount to US$3,450/classroom. Labor and local materials donated by
the communities to build the schools has been valued at US$2,300/classroom.
Furniture, equipment and teaching materials costs have been estimated on the
basis of equipment lists and review of unit costs of earlier produced or
purchased teaching materials and textbooks. The cost of specialist
services, including salaries, housing allowances, education and medical
benefits, moving allowances and airfares have been estimated at a low unit
cost of US$5,000/ man-month. This unit cost is in line with that of
existing expatriate personnel. Overseas training costs have been estimated
at an average of US$1,300/man-month, similarly in line with current costs.
5.04      International comparisons of unit costs and areas for hostels and
housing units (excluding contingency allowances and professional fees) are
shown in Table 5.3. This table shows that costs per place are low by
international comparison.

Costs for academic and communal facilities at SITC are extensions of
existing facilities, and international comparisons are therefore difficult
to make.

5.05      Contingency Allowances.  The contingency allowances in project
cost estimates are as follows:
(a) physical contingencies (US$0.7 million) estimated at 10% of the
base cost of all project items; and
(b) price contingencies (US$2.4 million) calculated on the January
1982 base cost plus physical contingencies and assuming an annual
12% price escalation for domestic purchases, and foreign price
increases of 8.5% in 1982, 7.5% in 1983-85, and 6.0% thereafter.
5.06      Foreign Exchange.  The foreign exchange component is estimated at
about US$5.6 million or 56% of total project cost. This was derived from
estimates of labor, materials antd overhead costs of construction and furni-
ture; estimates of the amount of imported equipment and materials; and
estimates of the foreign exchanges content of technical assistance. The
resultant foreign exchange proportions of project cost amount to 46% for
construction, locally manufactured building materials and furniture, 92% for
equipment and imported materials, 90% for overseas fellowships and
specialist services and 10% for :Local training.
5.07      Duties and Taxes.  The loc:al customs duties on civil works and
locally procured materials are estimated at US$0.5 million, or about 10% of
the estimated costs of these items including contingencies. No customs
duties are levied on items directly imported for project use.
5.08      Recurrent Costs.  Recurrent costs generated by the project are
estimated at about SI$0.7 million (US$0.8 million equivalent at 1981
prices).  This would represent about 11% of the MET's recurrent budget in
1985. Although this is a large increase, the Government places a high
priority on the project and is therefore prepared to assume the recurrent
costs.
Project Financing
5.09      Of the total project cost of US$10.0 million, US$5.0 million would
be financed by the Association. The Australian Development Assistance
Bureau has tentatively agreed to provide a grant of US$1.7 million for
student hostels and technical assistance. Local communities would provide
US$0.7 million for labor and locally available materials. The Central
Government would finance the remaining US$2.6 million and, if the Australian
assistance does not materialize, would also finance an additional US$1.7
million from its own resources (Table 5.4).

The IDA credit of US$5.0 million would finance 86% of foreign exchange costs
(US$4.8 million) and 5% (US$0.2 million) of local costs. ADAB has tenta-
tively agreed to finance the remaining 14% of foreign costs (US$0.8 million)
and 20% of local costs (US$0.9 million). Retroactive IDA financing up to a
maximum of US$100,000 would cover costs incurred after June 30, 1981 in
respect of employment of an international recruiting firm for recruitment of
project managers. These managers would be appointed before credit signing,
to permit rapid implementation of the project.

Disbursements
5.10      Disbursements under the proposed project would be made as follows:
(a)  70% of local expenditures on civil works and locally procured
furniture and building materials;/l
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported building
materials;
(c)  100% of foreign expenditure for directly imported equipment,
furniture, paper, books and materials; and 70% of local
expenditures on goods and services procured locally; and
(d)  100% of foreign expenditures for fellowships and specialist
services, excluding the costs of: (i) design services for
buildings; and (ii) specialist services and fellowships for
inservice teacher training, which would be financed by the
Australian Development Assistance Bureau or by the Government
itself (para. 5.09).
Disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31, 1987. The esti-
mated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 5.5. This schedule is
based on experience in other education projects in East Asia and the Pacific.
5.11      Documentation, Accounts and Audits.  Dsbursement against various
small local expenditures, each less than US$l,00(i and aggregating less than
US$500,000, could be made against statements of expenditures, signed by
the authorized representative of the ('overnment. Supporting documents would
be kept in the project office and made available to visiting IDA missions.
This method of disbursement would minimize an otherwise large flow of paper
between the Government and the Association. Sound accounting procedures
used by the Government indicate that the statement of expenditure procedure
would not lead to abuse.  Disbursement against remaining project expenditures
would be made against full document:ation. All agencies involved in project
implementation would prepare and maintain separate accounts for the project
in accordance with sound accounting practices.  Such accounts, together with
disbursement documents, would be audited annually by the Government according
to standard government procedures. During negotiations the Government
provided assurances that: (a) project accounts would be maintained in
accordance with sound accounting procedures; and (b) auditing procedures
acceptable to the Association would be applied annually during
implementation.

6. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      The proposed project would make a large contribution towards the
development of the Solomon Islands' human resources and lay the groundwork
for reducing the now heavy dependence on foreign skills. Specific benefits
to be derived from the project would be: (a) institution building in the
education sector, through in-service training and technical assistance to



- 32 -
upgrade the skills of education management staff; (b) improvement in the
quality of primary education, through provision of textbooks and teaching
materials and in-service training of teachers; and (c) increases in primary
school enrollments, through provision of new facilities and expansion of
preservice teacher training facilities to supply needed teacher staff.
Increasing the quantity and quality of primary education can be expected to
lead to higher agricultural productivity, lower infant mortality and
decreased fertility, and to a better quality of life generally (para. 1.06).
The proposed strengthening of the administrative and planning capacity of
education management staff woul,l not only benefit primary education, but
would also provide the basis for effective future development of the
education sector as a whole. Improvements in the quality of primary
education would ensure that the 35% of its graduates who continue on to the
secondary level have an adequatea background for post-primary education,
which is essential to the country's ability to produce sufficient middle-and
high-level manpower, including trained agents for agricultural and health
extension (para. 1.07). The provision of 300 new classrooms would raise the
proportion of school age children enrolled in primary school from the
present 60% to close to 70% on a countrywide average. At the same time,
school location selection criteria used under the project would provide new
facilities only to presently unserved or underserved areas, thus fostering a
more equal access to education among regions.
Risks
6.02      The main risks to the project are managerial and institutional.
This project would be the Association's first operation in the Solomon Islands
and it would constitute a large--scale investment in relation to the size of
the economy. To reduce managerial risks, expatriate project management
personnel would be included in the proposed project and a large number of
local personnel would be trained to assume future managerial duties. A
second risk associated with the project would be that the SITC would dis-
regard MET targets for primary teaching program entrants, as it has in the
past, and use some of the new student places for secondary teaching pro-
grams. An assurance was given by the Government that this would not be
allowed to happen.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations the Government provided assurances on the
following:
(a) that it would by December 1982 prepare a plan to discourage
alternate year intakes and promote multi-grade teaching (para.
3.04);



- 33 -
(b) that MET would by December 1982 prepare a plan for improving
SITC's selection policies and procedures to ensure that MET's
enrollment targets are met (para. 3.13);
(c) that project financed building materials would only be supplied to
communities that had allocated suitable school sites and declared
themselves willing to erect and maintain the schools and provide
teacher housing (para. 4.08); and
(d)  that (i) project accounts would be maintained in accordance with
sound accounting procedures; and (ii) auditing procedures
acceptable to the Association would be applied annually during
implementation (para. 5.11).
7.03      Subject to the above conditions the project constitutes a suitable
basis for a US$5.0 million credit on standard IDA terms to the Governmenit of
Solomon Islands.
