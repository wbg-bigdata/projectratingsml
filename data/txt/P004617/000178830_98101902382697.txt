PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:         Solomon Islands
Beneficiary:    Ministry of Education, Training and Cultural Affairs (MET)
Amount:           SDR 4.3 million (US$5.0 million equivalent)
Terms:            Standard IDA
Project
Description:  The proposed project aims at improving education management,
upgrading the quality of primary education, and increasing
primary enrollments. The project consists of (a) 34 fellow-
ships in educational administration for national and provin-
cial level education officers and for headmasters of primary
schools; (b) in-service training to develop 20 master
trainers, who would in turn prepare materials and conduct
short courses once a year for all (1,200 to 1,400) primary
school teachers, in groups of 20 to 24, starting in 1983;
(c) provision of 150,000 textbooks, teachers- guides and
other printed teaching materials; (d) building materials for
construction of about 300 new primary school classrooms;
(e) construction and equipment for the Solomon Islands
Teachers' College (SITC), to permit an increase in its
enrollment from 160 to 400, together with 16 man-years of
fellowships for staff of the College; and (f) 17 man-years
of foreign specialist services to help with training and
management.
In the primary schools, the Government's target is to
increase the 1980 net enrollment ratio of 60% to a 1985
ratio of 70%. The proposed project would help meet about
75% of this target by focussing its assistance on areas in
the widely scattered settlements not now served by primary
education.  To become eligible to receive assistance from the
proposed project, the communities would undertake to provide
land and labor to construct and maintain the classrooms.
The main project risks are managerial and institutional. To
reduce managerial risks, five expatriate project management
personnel would be included in the proposed project, and an

-ii-
adequate number of local personnel would be trained to
assume future managerial responsibilities. A second risk is
that the SITC might disregard the targets set by the
Ministry of Education, Training and Cultural Affairs for
primary teaching program entrants and use some of the new
student places for secondary teaching programs. An
assurance has been obtained from the Government that this
would not be allowed to happen.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
SOLOMON ISLANDS FOR A
PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Credit to Solomon Islands for SDR 4.3 million (US$5.0 million equivalent) on
standard IDA terms to help finance a Primary Education Project. Cofinancing
by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB) of US$1.7 million is
under negotiation.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank Group's first report since the country-s independence (The
Solomon Islands: An Introductory Economic Report, No. 2553-SOL) is dated
December 18, 1979. Basic country data are given in Annex I.
Structure of the Economy
3.        The Solomon Islands constitute a scattered archipelago east of Papua
New Guinea. A British protectorate since 1893, the country became independent
in July 1978. The country has a population of 230,000 and per capita GNP of
US$460. Six main islands account for most of the population and the land area
of some 29,000 sq km. Although the population is racially homogeneous (about
93% Melanesian), at least 87 vernacular languages are spoken. Most of the
population reside in small, widely dispersed settlements along the coasts; 60X
of the people live in localities with fewer than 100 inhabitants and more than
80% in localities with fewer than 200. The capital city of Honiara, situated
on Guadalcanal, the largest island, has 16,000 inhabitants; other urban
centers have less than 2,000 inhabitants each. The country's division into
numerous islands, a low population density and the dispersion of the
population in small settlements along coastal areas make inter-island shipping
the main mode of transportation.
4.        The Solomon Islands is a predominantly agricultural country.
Agriculture, including forestry, livestock and fisheries, accounts for 70%
of GDP and almost all exports. Subsistence (nonmonetary) production is an
important component of total output. It contributes 40% of GDP, and nine
out of ten households are engaged in subsistence food production to some
extent. As is typical in the islands of the Pacific, the basic needs of the
population are reasonably well met from subsistence activity. Reflecting
the size of the subsistence sector, the proportion of the labor force working
for money is limited. At the time of the 1976 census, only 21% of the labor
force had been employed as full-time wage earners; and an additional 7% of
the labor force had derived some cash income, mostly from copra or market
gardening, in the week preceding the census. Thus, only 28% of the labor
force had been engaged in cash earning occupations at the time of the census.



- 2 -
5.        The economy has demonstrated remarkable dynamism in recent years.
Betweeen 1973-79, real incomes grew at an average annual rate of nearly 8%,
which, even after allowing for the country's unusually high rate of population
growth of 3.4% annually, resulted in an increase in real per capita income of
over 4% annually. Sustained expansion and increasing diversity of exports
provided the main stimulus to growth. Exports as a proportion of GDP grew
from 21% in 1960 to 37% in 1978, and to almost 60% in 1979. While copra
accounted for almost 90% of exports in 1960, fish, timber and palm oil each
accounted for a sizable fraction of total export proceeds in 1979. Large-
scale commercial operations dominate production of all major exports except
copra, which is the main smallholder cash crop. The exceptionally good
performance in 1979 was due to an improvement of about 40% in the terms of
trade and an export volume increase of 30%. However, a sharp deterioration in
the terms of trade was experienced in 1980, with export earnings growing less
than 2%. These wide fluctuations in export earnings show the susceptibility
of the small island economy to international commodity price changes. Because
of the worsened balance of payments situation, the Government devalued its
currency by 6% in March 1981 and entered into a stand-by arrangement with the
Fund in May 1981 equivalent to SDR 1.6 million.
Development Issues
6.        The Government-s development strategy, as reflected in the draft
National Development Plan, 1980-84, recognizes the critical importance of
expanding and diversifying opportunities for earning cash incomes, balanced
development of smallholder agriculture and educational progress in the
country's future development. Rapid growth of the working age population, the
likelihood of a growing proportion of the labor force seeking cash earning
opportunities and the anticipated slow growth of formal wage and salary
employment suggest that if the demand for money incomes is to be reasonably
met, the creation of cash earning activities in the rural sector must be
accelerated. The importance of increased participation of the rural
population in commercial agriculture is recognized in the Plan, which allo-
cates substantial resources to extension services, research, transportation,
marketing and credit.
7.        The country faces formidable problems in the educational area.  As
recently as 1975, almost one half of the adult population had not received any
formal schooling and only 5.5% had received education above the primary
level. Rapid educational progress is essential for increasing the citizens
participation in the economy; severe limitations of local skilled manpower
and capital have necessitated a heavy reliance on foreign skills and capital,
leading to a high (about 30%) foreign participation in the wages, salaries
and profits generated in the Solomon Islands. The Plan has rightly identi-
fied the improvement of quality and the enrollment ratio in primary education,
and a substantial expansion of enrollments at secondary schools as the main
priorities.



- 3 -
8.        Reflecting the public sector's growing involvement in development,
total Central Government expenditures between 1973-79 grew at an average
annual rate of 10% in real terms, with development expenditures growing
somewhat faster. Since the United Kingdom (UK) financed all development
expenditures and provided grants for the recurrent budget, domestic resources
did not constitute a constraint to development. In recent years, foreign
resources have financed about 45% of total Central Government expenditures.
Recognizing the need for greater efforts to mobilize domestic resources in the
future, the Government has taken a number of policy initiatives. The most
recent budget proposal envisages the virtual elimination of the grant for the
recurrent budget and the opportunities for domestic borrowing from financial
institutions have begun to be utilized. In addition, the National Provident
Fund, established in end-1976, is emerging as a growing source of nonbank
borrowing. Other policies to raise the country's low rate of domestic
savings, estimated at 5% of GDP, include acquisition of equity in a commercial
bank, and issue of savings certificates for sale through post offices; these
measures should contribute to much needed improvement in savings facilities,
particularly in rural areas.
External Sector
9.        External capital assistance more than tripled between 1973-78,
rising from SI$3.6 million to SI$12.6 million, and the prospects for assis-
tance over the plan period are also good. The UK, which accounted for almost
all external assistance in the past and is committed to provide development
aid of z26 million over 1978-81 as part of the independence settlement, will
remain the major source of external assistance; however, concessional funds
from both multilateral and bilateral sources have already begun to supplement
UK assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is the main source of
multilateral finance, but assistance has also been received from the European
Development Fund (EDF) and the OPEC Fund. Australia and Japan are the major
new sources of bilateral grants, and New Zealand is also expected to provide
continuing support at a more modest level. Private foreign investment also
plays an important role in the country s development; net direct foreign
investment has accounted for over one third of the net inflow of medium- and
long-term capital in recent years.
10.       With the UK providing all development aid in the form of grants,
the country's external public debt and debt servicing are negligible. At the
end of 1980, public debt outstanding and disbursed amounted to SI$7.6 million,
and servicing payments in respect of this debt were only 0.1% of exports of
goods and services. The future investment rates needed to achieve a
satisfactory improvement in the living standards of a fast-growing population
as well as a growing use of loans from multilateral institutions will tend to
raise future debt servicing obligations. In view of this, and the



- 4 -
country's low per capita GNP, narrow revenue base and vulnerability to
movements in world prices of primary commodities, it is desirable that the
Solomon Islands' external public capital requirements continue to be met
largely through grants and loans on concessional terms.
11.       The country's low population density, the small fraction of land
currently under cultivation, sufficient rainfall and relatively abundant
fisheries resources suggest a substantial long-term potential for growth
based on a further development of agriculture, forestry and fisheries. At
the same time, the implementation of one or two bauxite mining projects,
which could greatly enhance the country's foreign exchange receipts and tax
revenues, is a distinct possibility in the 1980s. Nonetheless, measures to
reduce the high rate of population growth are also needed to safeguard the
country-s standard of living in the long term.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       The proposed project is the second IDA lending operation to
Solomon Islands. In March 1981 the Board approved the first ever IDA Credit
to Solomon Islands in the form of a cofinancing operation with the ADB in
the lead (see Annex II). The beneficiary of the first Credit was the
Development Bank of Solomon Islands (DBSI). The general pattern of lending
for this small country will consist of a relatively large lending operation
every few years such as the one proposed herein, and more frequent
small-scale projects, co-financed with the ADB. The Bank Group lending
strategy is conditioned to some extent by the activities of other
well-established donors and lenders. In general, however, the highest
priority for Bank Group involvement will be accorded to those projects that
address the problems of increasing rural cash incomes and improving and
extending the educational system.  The project proposed herein is clearly
associated with the second problem area, and the next planned lending
operation is likely to focus on the agriculture sector.
PART III - PRIMARY EDUCATION
The Need for Human Resource Development
13.       The low educational development of the people of Solomon Islands
is not only a serious constraint to economic development, but also limits
the extent to which the benefits of economic growth can be captured for
the citizens. The acute shortage of skilled local manpower has resulted
in a heavy reliance on foreign skills. A high proportion of middleand
high-level administrative, managerial, and technical posts in both the
public and private sectors is held by expatriates. At the present time,



-5-
only 60% of the relevant age group is enrolled at the primary level, 25% at
the lower secondary level, 7% at the upper secondary level and 1% at the
tertiary level. Clearly, the need for development of human resources is one
of the main challenges facing the country in the years to come. While
enrollment at all levels needs to be expanded, special attention must also be
paid to quality primary education as the essential foundation for development
of the education sector.
Issues in Primary Education
Overview
14.       Primary education in the Solomon Islands is of six years duration
and is given by a total of 344 schools, of which 289 are public and 55 are
private. Until 1974, church related agencies provided most primary education.
While some of these groups are still active, they are generally phasing out
their assistance and the Government is increasingly accepting the
responsibility for providing primary education. The existing primary
education system suffers from the following problems: (a) deficiencies in
management; (b) poor quality; (c) enrollment stagnation; (d) financial
constraints; and (e) imbalances in opportunity for primary education among
regions and between the sexes.
Issues
15.       Education Management.  At the national level, the Ministry of
Education, Training and Cultural Affairs (MET) is responsible for carrying out
government policy for all aspects of education and training. Among its tasks
in the primary education sector are review and approval of curriculum,
registration of schools, payment of teacher's salaries and the setting of
policies on teacher deployment, the mix of trained/untrained teachers and
student intake. The administration of primary education within the countrys
eight provinces is the responsibility of Provincial Education Boards. One of
their major tasks is to employ and deploy teachers among the provinces'
primary schools in accordance with quotas set by the MET. At the local level,
community school committees are responsible for providing and monitoring
public school facilities and teacher housing and also for giving guidance to
teachers and headmasters on the preservation of local cultural values. The
day-to-day administration of the schools is carried out by headmasters.
16.       Education management is weak at all levels, largely due to lack of
training in administration and planning. At the NET, this has resulted in
weak enforcement of its policies in its dealings with Solomon Islands
Teachers' College (SITC) and the Provincial Education Boards. These Boards
themselves exhibit serious inefficiencies, particularly in their failure to
deploy teachers evenly among schools and to obtain a balanced mixture of
trained and untrained teachers at each school. The effectiveness of day-to-



day school administration also suffers, due to the headmasters- lack of
training and marginal knowledge of government policies and procedures.
17.       Education Quality.  While instructional programs seem well-balanced
and substantial improvements in curricula have been made, the quality of
primary education is poor, largely due to a chronic shortage of textbooks and
teaching materials and of trained teachers. Rural primary schools generally
possess only a few textbooks, while urban schools are somewhat better
equipped. Most schools have little in the way of materials with which to
produce classroom aids. A printing center has recently been built at SITC-s
Curriculum Development Unit for trial runs of the materials developed there,
and the Government Printer has the capacity to do longer runs of soft-cover
texts.  However, there is a serious lack of funds for producing or purchasing
textbooks and materials on a large scale, as well as considerable logistical
problems in distributing materials to the widelv scattered schools.
18.       Trained primary teachers are in short supply in the Solomon Islands.
To meet staffing requirements, partly-trained or untrained teachers have been
recruited. In 1980, out of a total of 1,172 primary teachers, 53% were
trained, 24% were partly trained and 23% were untrained. The main constraints
to an adequate teacher supply have been a combination of insufficient training
facilities at SITC and a shortage of suitable trainees. The shortage of
trainees is expected to be alleviated by recent increases in secondary school
enrollments and improvements in teacher benefits. However, SITC's facilities
need to be expanded to increase output to replace untrained teachers and to
meet increasing demand for new teachers. Since a large number of partly-
trained or untrained teachers are expected to remain in the system, in-service
teacher training programs are needed to upgrade their skills. The existing
trained teachers would also benefit from in-service training, particularly in
classroom management/multiclass teaching, where SITC's teaching programs are
weak.
19.       Enrollment.  Primary school enrollments have grown slowly over the
past decade, from 25,100 in 1971 to only 28,900 in 1980, and enrollment rates
have actually deteriorated from 66% in 1976 to 60% in 1980. Lack of trained
teachers, coupled with administrative and financial problems arising as the
Government assumed most of the responsibility for primary education, are the
chief causes of slow growth in new facilities. The lack of sufficient faci-
lities has also contributed to a dropout rate of 25% between Grades 1 and 6.
Excessive commuting distance to school in many rural areas can make daily
attendance arduous, particularly for the entry age students (6-9 years).
The wide disparity in entry age, coupled with irregular intakes of students,
has contributed to an undesirable age disparity within each class cohort./l
/1 Many schools admit students only at two, three or even four year
intervals.



20.       Equality of Opportunity.  Some of the country's provinces have much
better access to primary school facilities than others, resulting in enroll-
ment ratios ranging from 48% in Malaita to 73% in Honiara. (The overall
average for the country in 1980 was 60%). School equipment and teaching aids
also are not equitably distributed and some provinces have a disproportionate-
ly high number of untrained teachers. There is also an imbalance between the
numbers of girls and boys enrolled in primary schools. In 1980, girls
constituted only 41% of total enrollments. Although this proportion has
increased steadily from a level of 34% in 1971, further progress is necessary,
especially given the context of Solomon Islands where women contribute at
least 50% of labor to the agricultural work force.
21.       Government Plans.  The Government has three broad objectives for the
education sector: (a) to provide equal education opportunities regardless of
sex, religion, or location; (b) to establish linkages between education and
national development; and (c) to provide skill training for its growing
economy. As the first step in achieving these goals, the Government plans to
focus attention on primary education to: (a) increase enrollment by 7% per
year and achieve an enrollment ratio of 70% by 1985; and (b) improve the
overall quality of the system.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed project was prepared by the GQvernment with the
Association's assistance and was appraised in April 1981. Negotiations
were held in Washington from January 11 to January 13, 1982; the Solomon
Islands delegation was led by the Permanent Secretary of Education,
Mr. M.B. Sibisophere. A Staff Appraisal Report (No. 3670a-SOL dated
January 24, 1982) is being distributed separately. Supplementary project data
are provided in Annex III.
Objectives and Strategy
23.       The proposed project would support Government development plans
in the education sector. It would: (a) help improve education management
through provision of training for national and provincial level administra-
tors and headmasters; (b) upgrade the quality of primary education through
improved in-service teacher training and provision of textbooks and teaching
materials to all primary schools; (c) increase primary enrollments through
construction of new school facilities and expansion of preservice teacher
training to provide the needed teachers; and (d) equalize education opportu-
nities by improving the access to education of good quality in underserved
areas.
Project Details
24.       Education Management.  In order to upgrade the skills of national
level education officers, the proposed project would provide short courses



- 8 -
(two-months) for six staff in educational administration and one- to two-year
courses for up to eight staff in educational administration, school location
analysis, personnel relations supervision, budgeting and finance. The skills
of 20 provincial level education officers and headmasters would be upgraded
through two-month courses in administration. Most of these short courses
would be conducted at the University of the South Pacific (Fiji) and the
University of Papua New Guinea, while most of the longer courses would be
conducted further afield.  To prevent excessive depletion of staff, the
training would be spread evenly over the project period. To supplement the
training, the Ministry of Education, Training and Cultural Affairs (MET) would
be provided with an education planning specialist for three years who would
help identify and overcome management weaknesses at the MET and would assist
in organizing and implementing the in-service training program for education
administrators at all levels.
25.       In-service Teacher Training.  The current practice of alternate year
intake is not considered appropriate because it promotes undesirable age
disparity and retards enrollment expansion. It will therefore be replaced by
a multigrade arrangement. To help overcome the shortcomings in the qualifica-
tions of existing primary teachers and to encourage improved teaching prac-
tices, the proposed project would provide in-service training with particular
emphasis on classroom management and multigrade teaching techniques. This
training would be conducted in two phases. First, a core group of 20 master
trainers would be selected among experienced teachers, headmasters, and
provincial staff, to receive six months of training. Negotiations are current-
ly under way with universities experienced in multigrade teaching techniques
to develop an appropriate course of training. This course would be conducted
partly overseas and partly in the Solomon Islands. Second, after completing
their training, the master trainers would prepare materials and conduct short
courses (one to two weeks) at existing schools and teachers' resource centers
for groups of about 20-24 teachers during school holidays. During the project
period, each serving primary teacher would attend such a short course once a
year, commencing in mid-1983. During negotiations the Government provided
assurances that it would, by December 1982, prepare a plan to discourage the
alternate year intake practice and promote multiclass teaching techniques
(Section 3.06 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
26.       To assist in implementation of this component, the project would
provide the services of two education specialists to supervise the work of the
master trainers. These specialists would be hired for overlapping terms of
three years each, to cover the entire project implementation period, and would
be based at the Solomon Islands Teachers' College (SITC) and travel to course
locations as needed.
27.       Education Materials.  In order to upgrade the quality of education
and provide all primary schools with the necessary teaching materials, the
proposed project would provide about 150,000 textbooks and teachers' guides,
together with supplementary printed teaching materials. Selection of



_9-
apDropriate materials and the development of teachers guides would be done by
SITC-s Curriculum Development Unit and MET officials with assistance from the
education specialists provided under the in-service training component
(para. 26). Because of the diseconomies of textbook development for such a
small country, the emphasis would be on purchasing or adapting suitable
materials from the existing "South Pacific Series" for use in the Solomon
Islands.
28.       Primary Education Facilities.  In order to help increase access to
primary education for the country-s children, the proposed project would
provide building materials for construction of about 300 new classrooms. This
would meet 75% of the Government's goal to increase enrollments by 7% per
year, from 28,900 in 1980 to 40,600 in 1985. Further increases during the
project period would not be feasible because teacher training would provide
staff for only 300 additional classrooms. Because of the low density of
population, in most of the underserved areas, most of these new classrooms
would be provided in the form of one-room school buildings at locations
broadly determined by a 1981 school mapping exercise. The final selection of
new classroom sites would be agreed between the MET and provincial governments
during implementation in accordance with established priorities.
29.       The new classrooms would be provided to the communities in the form
of building material kits, generally precut for assembly on site. The Govern-
ment has provided adequate assurances that a building kit would only be
supplied to communities that are prepared to provide adequate sites, teacher
housing, labor, locally available materials and maintenance (Section 3.08 of
the draft Development Credit Agreement).
30.       Preservice Teacher Training.  To help alleviate the shortage of
trained primary teachers and meet the demand for new teachers to be generated
by the planned enrollment increases, the proposed project would finance the
expansion of the SITC to 400 student places by 1987 (current enrollment is
160). Of these student places, 90% would be allocated to primary teaching
programs, resulting in an output of 170 new primary teachers each year. This
project component would include provision of civil works, equipment and
furnishings for classrooms, library facilities, alterations to an existing
assembly hall and to kitchen facilities, 22 additional staff housing units and
new dormitory facilities for 210 students. The quality of SITC-s staff and
teaching programs would also be upgraded through the provision of: (a) eight
fellowships (two years each) for teacher trainers; and (b) assistance in
organizing preservice training programs in multigrade teaching techniques to
be given by the education specialists provided under the in-service training
component (para. 26). To ensure that SITC will allocate adequate student
places to primary teacher training programs, assurances were given by the
Government at negotiations that the MET would by 1982 prepare a plan to
improve SITC's selection policies to ensure that SITC will meet the MET-s
enrollment targets by project completion (Section 3.07 of the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement).

31.       Project Management and Evaluation.  In order to ensure efficient
management and evaluation of project implementation, the proposed project
would provide expatriate specialist services in the form of a Project Manager
and an Accountant (eight man-years). This Project Management Team would be
responsible for coordinating all project activities, supervising the technical
and managerial aspects of all civil works components, and assuring the
monitoring and evaluation of project progress. The Education Planner, located
at MET (para. 24) would double as a Deputy Project Manager and be responsible
for implementation of the educational aspects of the project. This would
include advising the MET on education, planning and administrative matters,
reviewing detailed proposals for school locations and preparing proposals for
improved textbook acquisition and delivery systems. Project success would be
evaluated in terms of increases in enrollments, increases in the number of
fully trained teachers, changes in teacher:pupil ratios, methods of
distribution, effectiveness and physical life of textbooks and teaching
materials, and the numbers of in-service courses conducted and classrooms
built.
32.       Future Investments.  The proposed project would include financing
for studies to be conducted on issues in the education sector and for help in
preparing future projects for external financing.
Project Cost and Financing
33.       The total cost of the proposed project, including estimated value of
community inputs totalling US$0.7 million, is estimated at US$10.0 million.
The proposed credit of US$5.0 million would finance 86% of foreign exchange
costs (US$4.8 million) and 5% (US$0.2 million) of local costs. The ADAB has
tentatively agreed to provide a grant of US$1.7 million equivalent for student
hostels and technical assistance (14% of total foreign costs and 20% of local
costs).  The Government is prepared to assume this financing if ADAB financing
does not materialize.  Retroactive financing up to a maximum of US$100,000
would cover costs incurred after June 30, 1981, to assist in recruitment of
technical assistance to ensure a prompt start of the Project. The Government
would finance the remaining US$2.6 million. The contingency allowance of
US$3.1 million would include: physical contingencies (US$0.7 million)
estimated at 10% of the base cost of all project items; and (b) price
contingencies (US$2.4 million) estimated at 12% annually for domestic
purchases, and foreign price increases of 8.5% in 1982, 7.5% in 1983-85, and
6.0% thereafter on the base cost and physical contingencies. The costs of
foreign specialist services are estimated at US$5,000 per man-month and
include salaries, housing allowances, education and medical benefits, moving
allowances and airfares. Overseas training costs would amount to about
US$1,300 per man-month.
34.       Annual recurrent costs generated by the project are estimated at
about SI$ 0.7 million (US$0.8 million equivalent at 1981 prices). This would
represent about 11% of the MET's recurrent budget in 1985. Although this is a



- 11 -
large increase, the Government places a high priority on the project and is
therefore likely to be able to provide finance for the recurrent costs.
Implementation
35.       The Development Administration Division (DAD) in the Ministry of
Home Affairs and National Development would be the agency responsible for
overall project coordination.   Also involved in project implementation would
be the Ministries of Education, Training and Cultural Affairs and Finance. To
coordinate project activities, a committee would be formed consisting of
members of these Ministries, chaired by a representative of DAD. This
committee would meet periodically to review progress, resolve issues and
establish guidelines for project implementors. To assist the Government in
implementation, the Project Manager and Accountant would be located in DAD
whereas, the Deputy Project Manager would be located at MET. As early
recruitment of these managers and other specialists to be provided under the
project is important to project success, the Government with Association
concurrence selected the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation as a
recruitment agency. This agency could also be utilized to help place fellow-
ship trainees overseas.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Except for ADAB financed boarding facilities, construction of civil
works for the SITC expansion (IJS$1.2 million) would be contracted through
international competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the
Association-s Guidelines. Primary school construction would be done by the
communities selected to receive new classrooms (para. 29).
37.       Traditionally imported building materials estimated to cost about
US$0.5 million would be procured under contracts awarded after international
competitive bidding, following procedures acceptable to the Association.
Domestic manufacturers of these materials would be allowed a preferential
margin of 15% or the existing customs duty over the c.i.f. price of competing
imports, whichever is lower. Other building materials (mainly timber) would
be procured in accordance with local competitive bidding procedures, accept-
able to the Association. SITC equipment and furniture (US$200,000), library
books (US$250,000) and textbooks/printed materials (US$300,000 total value)
would be procured in accordance with existing government procedures, accept-
able to the Association. These procedures include local bidding, stores
contracts with local firms, indents with other government entities (e.g., the
Government Printer) and procurement agreements with Australian-based broker
firms.
38.       The proposed credit of US$5.0 million would be disbursed on the
basis of: (a) 70% of local expenditures for civil works; (b) 100% of foreign
expenditures for directly imported building materials, equipment, furniture,
and teaching materials; (c) 100% of local (ex-factory) cost for locally
manufactured building materials, equipment, furniture and teaching materials;



- 12 -
(d) 70% of local expenditures for imported building materials, equipment,
furniture and teaching materials procured locally; and (e) 100% of foreign
expenditures for specialist services and overseas fellowships (excluding those
selected for ADAB assistance). Disbursements are expected to be completed by
December 31, 1987.
39.      Disbursements against various small and local expenditures, each
less than US$1,000 and aggregating less than US$500,000, would be made against
statements of expenditures to be certified by the authorized representative
of the Government. Disbursements against remaining project expenditures would
be made against full documentation- All agencies involved in project
implementation would prepare and maintain separate accounts for the project in
accordance with sound accounting practices. Such accounts, together with
disbursement documents, would be audited annually by the Government according
to standard government procedures. During negotiations the Government
provided assurances that: (a) project accounts would be maintained in
accordance with sound accounting procedures; and (b) auditing procedures
acceptable to the Association would be applied annually during implementation
(Section 4.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
40.       The proposed project would make a large contribution towards the
development of the Solomon Islands- human resources and lay the groundwork for
reducing the now heavy dependence on foreign skills. Specific benefits to be
derived from the project would be: (a) institution building in the education
sector, through in-service training and technical assistance to upgrade the
skills of education management staff; (b) improvement in the quality of
primary education, through provision of textbooks and teaching materials and
in-service training of teachers and (c) increases in primary school
enrollments, through provision of new facilities and expansion of preservice
teacher training facilities to supply needed teacher staff. The proposed
strengthening of the administrative and planning capacity of education
management staff would not only benefit primary education, but also would
provide the basis for effective future development of the education sector as
a whole. Improvements in the quality of primary education would ensure that
its graduates have an adequate background for secondary education, which is
essential to the country's ability to produce sufficient middle- and
high-level manpower. The provision of 300 new classrooms would raise the
proportion of school age children enrolled in primary school from the present
60% to close to 70% on a countrywide average. At the same time, school
location selection criteria used under the project would provide new
facilities only to presently unserved or underserved areas. thus fostering a
more equal access to education among regions.
41.       The main risks of the project are managerial and institutional.
Because the project components are highly interdependent, there is a risk that
uncoordinated implementation of the components could result in failure to
achieve full benefits within the implementation period. Project Management
would therefore be strengthened through provision of qualified staff to



- 13 -
prevent this from occurring. A second risk associated with the project would
be that the SITC could disregard MET targets for primary teaching program
entrants, as it has in the past, and use some of the new student places for
secondary teaching programs. An assurance was given by the Government during
negotiations that steps would be taken to prevent such an occurrence (see
para. 30).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
42.       The Development Credit Agreement between Solomon Islands and the
Association and the recommendations of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are
being distributed separately.
43.       Special conditions of this project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

period 1981-82. The ADB is the lead cofinancier for this operation. Their
US$2.0 million credit became effective on May 21, 1981 and disbursements
from their credit have commenced. DBSI operations are proceeding approxi-
mately as planned and disbursement requests for the IDA Credit are expected
to commence soon.
/1 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.
