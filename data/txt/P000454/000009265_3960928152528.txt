MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
FOR A TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to
the Central African Republic (CAR) for SDR 46.6 million (US$62.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms with 40 years' maturity and would help finance a Transport Sector
Project (TSP) that would cover the transport sector component of CAR's rolling
three-year public investment plan over the period 1991-93.
2.        Backsround.  Economic development in CAR, a landlocked country, is
stagnating and hampered by long distances from the sea. Total import and export
traffic in 1988 was about 220,000 tons, a decline from 312,000 tons in 1984.
CAR's major external links are the road or road/rail routes to Douala, Cameroon
(1,650 km and 1,850 km, respectively), and the river/rail route via Brazzaville
to Pointe Noire, Congo (1,800 km). It has an international airport at Bangui.
the capital, and 30 small airports or air strips. About 75Z of transport goes
by river, 231 by road, and the remainder by air, which is mainly international.
For a relatively small populatioi. of 2.7 million inhabitants, CAR has to maintain
a large internal road system, consisting of about 9,300 km of classified roads
and about 14,400 km of unclassified rural roads and tracks. Abo.t 440 km are
paved; the remainder are gravel or earth roads. Since 1980, about 3,700 km of
main roads have been rehabilitated, of which 1,300 km under the Fourth Highway
Project (IDA Credit 1258-CA of 1982), which was IDA's last operation in the
transport sector. Transport by road is regulated by a freight office (BARC),
with State and private ownership, and by sea by the CAR Shipping Council (CCAC).
Both agencies act under the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation (MTAC),
which is also responsible for transport sector policy.   In addition, Y(TAC
oversees air transport using ASECNA's services, and river transport, which is
managed by SOCATRAW, a mixed economy company with expatriate management. Road
maintenance and constructioL aro the responsibilities of the Ministry of Public
Works and Territorial Development (MTPAT) and are financed by local resources
and several donor agencies.
3.        Major issues in the transport sector are (a) lack of a coherent
transport sector policy and sector investment planning; (b) restrictive transport
industry regulations and cumbersome transport controls;  (c) a complex river
transport tariff; (d) inadequate management of road maintenance; (e) insufficient
budget funds for recurrent finance; and (f) inadequate organization of the
responsible ministries and subsidiary agencies, and lack of technical ability
of staff. To address these issues, the Government issued a policy declaration
with a detailed action plan of transport sector policy measures to be implemented
during the TSP. This action plan includes measures recommended by an Environmen-
tal Impact Study to mitigate adverse environmental aspects caused by the
construction of a highway through CAR's equatorial rain forest in 1988/89. The
TSP also reflects the conclusions of the PPAR on the Third and Fourth Highway
Projects, to be issued to the Executive Directors shortly.
4.        Proiect Obiectives.  The TSP has been designed to become a durable
framework for sector policy making, investment planning and implementation in
CAR, in which donors can participate in accordance with their own programuing
mechanisms, so as to avoid past interruptions in donor financing. This sector
development strategy, which was adopted during the Donor Consultation Meeting



held in Bangui in March 1990, departs from the past individual project approach.
Its purpose is to (a) establish an efficient system of resource allocation to
priority sector investments within acceptable macro-economic parameters in
keeping with CAR's limited financial, institutional and operational capacity;
(b) strengthen institutional capacity for adequate planning and implementation
of transport infrastructure investments; (c) enhance operational capacity by
expanding participation of the private sector and local communities in road
works; and (d) initiating a long-term program of environmental protection related
to the transport sector.
5.        Proiect Description.    The TSP's sector policy measures  include
(a) deregulation of the transport industry; (b) establishment of an efficient
road maintenance strategy, essentially through contracting out of mechanized
maintenance works, and improved procurement methods; (c) adequate road
maintenance financing, including an increase in maintenance funding from
CFAF 1.8 billion at present to CFAF 2.7 billion in 1993; (d) reform of transport
sector institutions; (e) improved sector investment planning; (f) river transport
tariff reform; (g) airport management improvements; and (h) environmental protec-
tion measures.  The proposed investments, which would be carried out over a
period of five years, include (a) rehabilitation and maintenance of about
4.000 km of priority roads and about 720 km of primary rural roads; (b) recon-
struction to paved standards of an additional 70 km of CAR's main international
road and part of the existing paved section to protect it from flooding because
of the nearby hydro-electric dam construction under the Energy Project
(Credit L978-CA of May 1989); (c) improvement of Banguis airport security,
runway repairs of CAR's secondary airport at Berberati, and improvements in
meteorological services; (d) implementation of a road safety program; and
(e) studies and detailed engineering, and technical assistance and training for
transport sector planning, project management, and execution.
6.        Implementation.  The TSP will be implemented by MTPA. and MTAC, with
coordination through their Interministerial Planning Cell for Transports and
Public Works (IPCTP), which was created in 1988 to help prepare the TSP. The
road works will be executed essentially by private contractors, including local
contractors, small entrepreneurs and village workers, with MTPAT concentrating
on programming, management and supervision. MTPAT will retain only two small
brigades for emergency road and bridge repairs.   Environmental protection
measures related to the road component will be implemented by MTPAT, and the
Ministry of Water and Forests under the Natural Resource Management Project,
which was appraised in 1989. The rural roads program will be carried out by
SOCADA, the cotton development agency, and by small contractors and village
workers, supported by a programming and coordination unit at MTPAT. MTAC will
monitor sector policy measures, and the river, civil aviation and road safety
components. The TSP includes mechanisms for detailed planning and monitoring
of annual programs, which will be discussed in regular donor meetings in order
to mobilize timely external financing for implementation. By the end of 1992,
a mid-term review will be carried out to assess the implementation of sector
policy measures and to determine with Government and donors the next transport
sector investment plan.
7.        Technical Assistance and Training at MTPAT and MTAC, which will be
reviewed semi-annually, will ensure adequate programming, management and
supervision of project execution, monitoring of project expenditure, and
application of appropriate procurement methods. MTPAT staff will be trained in
these areas, while pilot actions will devise appropriate technologies in road



maintenance.   At both Ministries, personnel management and policy will be
developed to achieve an improved staffing profile with the objective of gradually
lessening CAR's dependence on expatriate technical assistance.  In addition,
short-term consultancies will strengthen supervision capacity and investment
planning. Overall project implementation will be overseen by a national project
coordinator located in tie Planning Cell, assisted by an experienced technical
assistant.
S.        Benefits.  The TSP's policy measures would result in improved sector
performance, improved maintenance management, more efficient maintenance funding,
and stronger sector institutions. Road users and agricultural production would
benefit from reduced vehicle operating costs and improved access. Development
of a national construction industry would stimulate employment and economic
activity. River transport would benefit from tariff simplification. Implementa-
tion of the recommendations of the Environmental Impact Study and appropriate
environmental measures under the road component would help prevent further
degradation of the country's natural resources. Training and technical assis-
tance programs should result in better sector management and investment planning.
9.        Risks.  The project has no unusual technical risks.  Institutional
weaknesses of MTPAT and MTAC could be the main causes for delays in project
implementation, as well as insufficient resources for road maintenance financing.
Technical assistance and improved personnel management should help mitigate these
weaknesses, while operational efficiency would be enhanced by adequate planning
and privatization, improved donor coordination, and by mobilizing additional
resources for road maintenance.
10.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Third and Fourth Highway Projects,
in which IDA played a leading role, contributed to improving CAR's maifz road
network. but the weaknesses of the transport sector institutions persisted. The
Government and IDA concluded that the experience with these projects and the SAL
program revealed that a broader approach of transport sector development was
needed, and the Government, therefore, requested IDA to help it prepare the
proposed transport sector operation.
11.       Actions Agreed Upon.  The project objectives, policy measures, and
contents were agreed at appraisal. At negotiations, agreement was reached on
(a) Government's transport sector policy declaration; (b) specific measures to
increase domestic revenues for road maintenance; (c) measures to improve procure-
ment methods; (d) implementation of environmental protection measures; and
(e) institutional reorganization and appointment of key staff. Said appointment
and institutional changes are special conditions of credit effectivenees. A
condition of disbursement would be the settlement of arrears due ty PETROCA to
the Road Fund.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
