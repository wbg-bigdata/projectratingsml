CHAPTER 1
THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01          Jamaica's indigenous energy resources are limited.
Non-commercial energy - primarily in the form of charcoal and wood - is
perhaps the most abundant domestic energy source presently in use. The
absence of non-commercial energy statistics precludes a definitive assessment
of its utilization. However, recent surveys indicate that non-commercial
energy may account for about 9 percent of household energy use.
1.02          Because of the paucity of indigenous energy resources, Jamaica
is dependent on imports to meet its energy needs. Of the total commercial
energy consumption in 1980 (see Annex 1.1) about 91% was provided by imported
petroleum. The remainder was provided by sugarcane bagasse (7%) and hydro
power (2%). Petroleum imports in 1980 amounted to about 15.6 million barrels
equivalent to about US$450 million or nearly half of Jamaica's foreign
exchange earnings for the year.
1.03          To reduce its dependence on petroleum imports, the Government,
through the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ) and the Ministry of Mining
and Energy (MME), is taking a number of initiatives to expand and develop
indigenous sources of energy. On-shore drilling for oil and gas financed by
an Inter American Development Bank (IDB) loan began in November 1981 at three
sites; off-shore drilling is expected to begin shortly with the assistance of
international oil companies as part of a Bank-financed project (Loan
2017-JM).
1.04      In addition, the Government and the Jamaica Public  Service
Company (JPS) are discussing with bilateral financing agencies funding for a
development program for six small hydropower sites. The Government, JPS, the
National Water Commission (NWC) and the Ministry of Agriculture are reviewing
grant-financed studies by consultants (SWECO/Sweden) for the Blue Mountain
hydro project to provide water supply, irrigation, and electric power. The
consultant's preliminary findings indicate that the cost of the multipurpose
project, including the construction of a 55 MW hydro power plant would be
about US$450 million (in 1980 prices).
1.05      In addition to these potential energy sources, peat reserves
adequate to fuel an 80-100 MW power plant for 30 years have been located in
Negril and Black River (Lower Morass). Feasibility studies on peat mining
and on the use of peat as a fuel source are being carried out by PCJ. The
Jamaica campus of the University of the West Indies is undertaking studies on
the ecological impact of peat mining.
1.06      Renewable sources of energy are receiving increased attention.
Solar water heaters have been installed in public buildings. A variety of
other solar technologies are being studied by the Ministry of Mines and
Energy and the College of Arts, Science and Technology (CAST) with financial
assistance from the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID). Suitable sites for the utilization of wind energy for water pumping



and electricity generation have been identified with the assistance of fund-
ing from the European Development Fund (EDF). Preliminary st-udies of coal
utilization, including conversion of existing boilers, have been conducted.
Studies of the potential for ocean thermal energy with financing from the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) are being executed by the
MME. Studies of the use of garbage for electricity generation and the use of
other bio-degradable materials to produce natural gas are under execution by
the Ministry. Twenty-four kilns for the production of charcoal were con-
structed in 1981 by the Ministry of Agriculture in cooperation with the
Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Scientific Research Council. These
kilns have a combined annual capacity equivalent to 4.6 million barrels of
fuel oil equivalent.  At the Twickenham Park Sawmill, a 1.2 MW plant oper-
ating on wood residue is planned to meet the power requirements of the saw-
mill, with the surplus to be fed into the national electric grid. Finally,
preliminary studies of the geothermal potential of hot springs in nine
localities are being studied by the MME.
1.07      The development of non-petroleum energy sources holds the potential
of moderately easing the country's balance of payments constraint over the
medium and longer term.  Nevertheless, barring significant discoveries of oil
and gas or unforeseen technological break throughs, Jamaica will continue to
rely on imported petroleum to meet most of its energy requirements during the
next two decades.
1.08      The MMlE is also promoting energy conservation.  The Ministry has
initiated work on an energy accounting system and energy fuel use surveys. A
USAID-financed energy audit scheme designed to identify energy waste and
recommend practical methods of increasing energy efficiency is underway: 43
public sector industries were audited in 1980. Associated with the scheme is
a proposed energy retrofitting program which would provide credit facilities
and expertise for the replacement of inefficient parts and equipment for
industries.  The economics of re-refining used lubricating oils will be
studies under the aegis of the Bank petroleum exploration loan. A public
education program aimed at increasing awareness of the energy crisis was
launched in April 1979 and is still underway. The MME, which is the agency
spearheading the Government's energy initiatives, is supported by technical
assistance from UNDP, USAID, CIDA and other donors to strengthen its core of
trained staff. With this assistance, the MME should be able to carry out the
energy initiatives successfully.
1.09      Government has complemented the efforts above with fiscal measures
aimed at curtailing petroleum demand and promoting efficient energy
utilization. In January 1980 overall subsidies on petroleum products were
removed. The Government periodically reviews the price of all petroleum
products, and has established a stabilization fund to cushion consumers
against short-term fluctuations in world oil price. During the past year,
the stabilization fund has also been used as a vehicle by which the prices of
gasoline and other fully refined products subsidize the price of fuel oil by
approximately 9% of the exrefinery price.
1.10      Under the provisions of an agreement (terminating in May 1982) with
the small, privately owned refinery which supplies most of the fuel oil used
in the nonbauxite economy, the ex-refinery price is set at a level which
provides the refinery an operating margin. The price paid for fuel oil, even



- 3 -
taking into account the cross subsidy element, is well above the Caribbean
posted price (US$32/bbl. compared to about US$23/bbl in January 1982).
Discussious with the refinery concerning the present purchasing and pricing
arrangements are under way. The Government will also review its present energy
pricing system as part of an ongoing energy assessment study. Under the
provisions of the Bank petroleum exploration loan, the Government has agreed
to consult with the Bank concerning the fundings of the study.
Power Sector Organization and Regulation
1.11      The main institutions concerned with electric energy in Jamaica
are: JPS (electric power generation and distribution); the Ministry of Public
Utilities and Transport (rate regulation and financial supervision); the
Ministry of Mining and Energy (energy policy, fuel pricing, conservation and
studies); and, the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (exploration, development
and marketing of petroleum and other energy sources). The Electricity
Authority, which holds the Government shares in JPS, has no other functions.
The Rural Electricity Programme, established by the Government in 1975 to
plan and construct rural electrification projects (see para 1.20) receives
financing through an IDB loan to the Government of Jamaica, and is managed by
a JPS employee seconded to the program. There is the potential for conflict
between two Ministries; but, to date, the organization of the sector has been
satisfactory.
1.12      Prior to 1975, regulation for the power sector was entrusted to the
Public Utilities Commission, a statutory body. Following its acquisition of
majority shares of JPS, the Government transferred responsibility for
regulating the utility to the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport. A
close relationship exists between the two entities. JPS provides monthly
financial reports to the Advisory and Monitoring Unit of the Ministry, which
is closely involved in financial and investment planning for the company.
This arrangement for the regulation of the sector is satisfactory.
Electricity Rate Setting
1.13      While the JPS license (as amended in April 1977) vests authority
for the setting of electricity rates in the Ministry of Public Utilities and
Transport, the actual procedure has been that JPS files proposals for rate
adjustments with 'the Ministry which then analyzes them and submits them to
the full cabinet for approval. This arrangement for rate setting is not
uncommon in countries where the utilities are essentially government-owned.
Electricity Tariffs
1.14      In connection with the second Bank loan, JPS agreed to hire con-
sultants to study its tariff structure in relation to the marginal cost of
supplying electricity. After sending JPS sample terms of reference for such
a study, the Bank agreed to funding the study with an USAID grant. The re-
sulting study did not reflect the sample terms of reference. There were re-
commendations for restructuring tariffs but they were not based on the mar-
ginal cost principle. A marginal cost based tariff study is important to
provide the proper framework for a rational tariff structure. However, the
rehabilitation of the JPS generating plant is essential. if the study is to
be based on actual (and optimum) operating conditions. Annex 1.2 show the
JPS tariff schedule. It contains features which appear to discourage efficient



- 4 -
energy utilization (such as declining block rates, an absence of regional
and/or peak and off-peak pricing, and a great difference betwen the unit
prices charged industrial and residential customers).
Existing Facilities
1.15      Total installed generating capacity at the end of 1980 was about
680MW, of which approximately 457MW (67%) were part of the JPS system. The
remainder were captive plants owned principally by the aluminum, sugar and
cement industries (see Annex 1.3). Of the electric energy generated by JPS,
approximately 83% was by steam plants, 6% by gas turbines and diesel plants,
and only 11% by hydroplants. Fuel costs are accordingly a large component of
the company's operating costs (approximately 68% in 1980).
1.16      The JPS transmission system consists of about 540 miles of 138 kV
and 69 kV lines. There are about 5,000 miles of primary distribution lines
at voltages of 24KV and below. The JPS transmission and distribution system
is inadequate to meet service requirements. The proposed program will assist
in solving this problem (see para 4.17).
1.17      The high proportion of captive generation is caused by a historic
difference in frequency (most captive generating plants operate at 60HZ while
the public system operates at 50HZ), as well as the need of certain
industries for process steam. The inability of the public supply system to
provide a consistently reliable service has undoubtedly also been a factor.
It is expected that improvement in the reliability to be achieved by the
proposed program will enable JPS to meet the incremental needs of those
industries which operate at 50 Hz, thus reducing the need for installation of
costly captive generating plants in the future.
Electricity Consumption
1.18      In 1980, the mining, industrial and commercial sectors, consti-
tuting approximately two thirds of GDP, accounted for about 75% of total
electricity consumption. The public service system supplied about 56% of
total electricity consumption for the year. Commercial and industrial con-
sumers accounted for about 56% of the public service electricity consumption
(or 73%, including captive generation) which reflects the importance of the
productive sector in the composition of electricity consumption; residential
consumers accounted for 31% and others (street lighting, goverment, munici-
palities, etc.) the remaining 13%. A summary of electricity consumption in
1980 is shown in Annex 1.4.
Access to Service
1.19      Compared to countries at similar stages of development, access to
electriciy service in Jamaica as a whole is good. About 85% of all Jamaican
households have access to public electricity supply by virtue of being within
100 meters of existing lines, while about 52% are connected to the electric
power system. By comparison access to electricity service in Panama and in
Peru are about 65% and 36% respectively.



5-
Rural Electrification
1.20      Prior to the establishment of the Rural Electrification Program
Limited (REP) in June 1975 only about half of Jamaica's rural population had
access to the public service electricity system. Since then, with financial
assistance from the Government of Jamaica and three loans from the IDB
totalling about US$21.2 million, REP has constructed about 29,000 new
connections covering an area of about 1,560 miles in about 600 villages.  By
the end of the REP program period in June 1982 public service electricity
supply will be accessible to about 70% of Jamaica's rural population.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.21      The principal constraint faced by the power sector is the lack of
sufficient human resources at the principal sector entity - JPS - to allow
for an orderly development of the sector.  The problem has been exacerbated
in the last years by the loss, through emigration, of experienced sector
personnel. The project includes technical assistance and training components
which should result in strengthening JPS and thus alleviate this constraint.
1.22      A second constraint relates to the ability of JPS to raise
sufficient financial resources internally to contribute to the financing of
the sector investment program.  Revenue covenants included in the proposed
loan agreements related to the project (para 5.09) are aimed at mitigating
the effect of this constraint.
History of Bank Group Involvement with the Sector
1.23      JPS benefited from the first Bank loan to Jamaica's power sector
(1966; 454-JM - US$22 million) which helped finance the foreign cost of
generating plant (121 MW) and associated transmission and distribution
facilities for the greater Kingston area. The project was completed in 1972,
substantially within the original schedules and cost estimates.
1.24      JPS benefitted from the second Bank loan for power (1978; 1516-JM -
US$20 million) which helped to finance the foreign cost of a US$36.1 million
project for the expansion of the transmission and distribution systems in
urban centers, plus technical assistance for the improvement of operating and
maintenance practices and the preparation of contract documents. As of May
1982, US$17.3 million of the loan had been disbursed.  The project will be
completed substantially within original cost estimates but about nine months
later than the appraisal schedule.
1.25          JPS' power plant operations and maintenance practices improved
somewhat with the assistance of consultants engaged under the second power
project to assist in developing operations and maintenance procedures. JPS
because of financial constraints was unable to fully implement the
consultant's recommendations concerning repairs and overhaul of its boilers
and turbine at Old Harbor station l/ The level of maintenance and opera-
tions is still far from adequate resulting in the current unreliable state of

CRAPTER 2
THE BORROWER
Government Ownership and Organization Structure
2.01      The proposed borrower, JPS, is a government-owned power utility
charged with exclusive responsibility for the generation, transmission, and
distribution of electric energy for public consumption in Jamaica. In 1971,
the Government, through the Electricity Authority, acquired controlling
interest in JPS from foreign, private investors; and presently owns 99% of
JPS' ordinary shares. Except for certain features requiring further
investigation (para. 2.07), the organizational structure of JPS, which is
shown in Annex 2.1 is satisfactory; but there are many deficiencies of
management, which are discussed below.
Management
2.02      Through immigration and resignation, there has been a dispersal of
the competent group of managers who were operating JPS at appraisal (1978) of
the Second Power Project (1516-JM). Lack of sufficient number of qualified
mid-level managers has contributed to: (i) poor operational and maintenance
practices at the power plants, which have resulted in frequent power outages
(para. 4.04); and (ii) delayed preparation of important financial,
accounting, and managerial data. For example, preliminary financial
statements for 1981 were not available before March 15, 1982. These
deficiencies have prompted the Board to take unusual remedial action.
2.03      Vested with corporate powers, the Government-appointed Board has
traditionally limited itself to setting broad, overall policies, leaving
daily decision making to management. However, because of the deficiencies
noted above, the Board formed in October 1981 three subcommittees to review
technical and financial planning and purchasing decisions; and in December,
after the Managing Director resigned, the Board Chairman took o-ver the posi-
tion of chief executive officer while JPS searched for a replacement. Given
the current difficult circumstances, these arrangements are reasonable; but
they are not expected to continue after JPS takes measures to improve manage-
ment, as described in the next paragraphs.
2.04      As the appointment of a permanent chief executive is indispensable
as a first step toward rebuilding management, the proposed loan agreements
require that JPS and the Government appoint a qualified chief executive
officer as a condition of loan effectiveness. In addition, the proposed loan
agreement requires any chief executive officer appointed by JPS to have
qualifications acceptable to the Bank.
2.05      JPS has begun the rebuilding of its financial administration by
hiring a controller and a budget specialist. JPS is actively searching for
a systems and methods manager to assist in the application of computers to
the solution of accounting and financial problems. The IDB is likely to
provide funding for the positions of controller and systems and methods
manager.



-8-
2.06      To continue implementation of the generation rehabilitation program
at Old Harbor and Hunts Bay, JPS agreed to engage under satisfactory terms
and conditions technical personnel who would assist in the supervision of
contractors at each plant. To rebuild the managerial capability of the
Production Department, JPS agreed to engage consultants who would assist the
production manager in the planning and maintenance functions (para. 4.20).
2.07      The current organization structure of JPS places system planning at
a tertiary level and burdens the Managing Director with direct supervision of
ten managers and directors. A consulting group, Overseas Advisory
Associates, Inc. (OAAI-USA), has made recommendations providing for reduced
supervisory burdens on the part of the Managing Director. These recommen-
dations will serve as the basis for further discussions between JPS and Bank
staff.
Staff Relations
2.08      Of the 1850 staff employed by JPS all but the top 16 or so belong
to one of four national labor unions.  Clerical, hourly and technical
personnel belong to either the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU)
affiliated with the governing Jamaica Labor Party or the National Workers.
Union (NWU) affiliated with the opposition Peoples National Party (PNP) and
supervisory staff and engineers belong to the Union of Technical and
Supervisory Personnel (UTASP), a national labor union founded at JPS in
1974. The fourth union, the managers union, consists of about 19 JPS cost
center managers (i.e. staff at the third level of management).
2.09      Given the base of their support, the labor unions have had the
upper hand in labor management negotiations. Frequent work stoppages and
other industrial action by the labor unions have interfered with JPS' ability
to provide efficient service. The issue of labor relations is a major risk
to the project, which can only be dealt with by the Government (para. 4.26).
Training
2.10      JPS carried out a training program emphasizing planning and mainte-
nance with US$480,000 from the second power loan (1516-JM) to cover foreign
costs. On the whole, the program met its objectives. As training is a con-
tinuing need of JPS, during negotiations, the Bank obtained-the agreement of JPS to
prepare a detailed training program acceptable to the Bank by Decemer 1982
with the assistance of suitable consultants and emphasizing general manage-
ment as well as power plant operations and maintenance. The proposed loan
includes about US$0.9 million to cover the foreign cost of JPS training needs
during the project period.
Management Information and Accounting Systems
2.11      JPS accounting records are maintained in accordance with regula-
tions prescribed by the Federal Power Commission of the United States in the
Uniform Systems of Accounts for Public Utilities, subject to the requirements
of the Companies Act of Jamaica and the All-Island Electric Licence under
which it operates. The company's accounting records are deficient. As
current accounting reports are prepared late, and as the JPS system of
financial planning, budgeting and cash flow forecasting also needs



- 9 -
Improvement, the new accounting, budget, and computer specialists are
expected to strfngthen JPS in these areas (para. 2.05).
Audit
2.12      As required under the second power project, JPS repositioned
successfully the internal audit department to report to the chief executive
officer rather than to tlbe chief financial officer so as to enhance its
autonomy. However, the internal control mechanisms of the audit department
lack adequate documentation and are not based on a formal manual of proced-
ures. JPS agreed to evaluate, with the assistance of its external auditors,
its internal control systems and auditing procedures and to implement recom-
mendations acceptable to the Bank not later than June 30, 1983.
2.13      JPS' financial accounts have been audited satisfactorily by Price
Waterhouse and Co. JPS agreed to a repetition of the existing covenants
requiring JPS to appoint independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank
and to send its audited financial statements to the Bank within four months
of the end of each fiscal year. JPS' performance under the existing covenant
has been satisfactory.
Billings and Collections
2.14      Accounts receivable have been high in the past--up to the
equivalent of about 88 days of sales revenue--due to ineffective collections
procedures and laxity in the enforcement of the disconnection policy. Prior
to negotiaitons, JPS prepared a satisfactory program for speeding up its
collections and otherwise maintaining its outstanding accounts from customers
at reasonable levels. Its implementation is included in the proposed loan
agreements. It is expected that the target levels of accounts receivable
would be the equivalent to 70, 65, and 60 days of sales in, respectivel',
1982, 1983 and 1984.
Insurance
2.15      The company continues to insure its assets on a replacement cost
basis against most common risks such as boiler explosion and fire in accord-
ance with common public utility practices. Major works under construction
are insured by contractors' all-risk policies and the proposed third power
project would have similar coverage.
Import Duties
2.16      The Government does not impose import duties on JPS for its pro-
curement of equipment used for generation, transmission or distribution of
electricity. However, equipment which would be used for purposes other than
the above, such as motor vehicles and computers, when procured by JPS, are
subject to normal import duties. Estimated expenditure for these items
included of the total project cost is about US$2.5 million.

CHAPTER 3
MARKET AND THE MEANS TO MEET IT
Historical Market
3.01         The trend in electric energy sales has paralleled the trend in
economic activity in the country.  Between 1970 and 1973 electric energy
sales increased at an annual rate of about 9.7% while the real GDP average
annual growth rate  recorded for the period was 4.5%. The slowdown in
economic growth in 1973-1974 was accompanied by a similar slowdown in
electric energy sales. Energy sales which reached a peak of 1,136 GWh in
1977 declined thereafter; by 1980 the accumulated decline in sales was about
10% while the GDP declined by about 6% in real terms, during the same
period.
3.02         While the trend in electricity sales has been negative since
1977, the number of consumers supplied with electricity has increased
appreciably. Between 1978 and 1981 more than 30,000 new customers were
connected to the JPS system, resulting in an average annual increase of about
4%. This relatively high growth in consumers reflects the sucess of the IDB-
financed rural electrification program (para 1.20) as well as the success of
the JPS program to provide service to urban low income dwellers. The average
use of electricity per residential customer declined at an average annual
rate of about 8.1% during 1977-1981.  This trend reflects energy conservation
efforts as well as the fact that the majority of the new customers have been
marginal consumers. The evolution since 1965 of the JPS energy sales, number
of customers and average electricity consumption is shown in Annex 3.1.
Load Forecasts
3.03      To prepare load forecasts JPS uses a multiple linear regression
model which takes into account economic activity, population trends and the
price of electricity. The load forecasts (Annex 3.2) upon which the proposed
project was developed have been prepared on this basis. In contrast to the
annual decline experienced during the last four years, energy sales are
forecast to increase at a modest annual rate of about 2.7% during the
1982-1985 period.   This reversal in the sales trend is consistent with
anticipated developments in general performance. The load forecast for the
project period is reasonable. A long-range load forecast will be financed
under the proposed project (paragraph 4.20).
Energy Losses
3.04      Energy losses in the JPS system are excessive.  Energy losses,
expressed as a percentage of net generation, were at a level of about 15%
in 1978.  Since then, the level of losses has increased steadily to an
estimated 21% in 1981. This is the result of inadequate maintenance of the
transmission and distribution network as well as increased unauthorized use
of electricity. To ensure that losses are brought down to an acceptable
level, JPS prepared a program of loss reduction acceptable to Bank. This
program is designed to identify and reduce technical losses and losses
associated with system theft or unaccounted for consumption. The program



- 11 -
set;3 a target of not more than 15% losses by A984 and 12% by 1987.  The
proposed loan agre, n:ts (side letter) include target loss ratios and dates
agreed during negotiat;.ons for implementing th-e loss reduction program.  JPS
generation requirements have been prepared assuming this improvement in loss
reduction.
Energy and Capacity Balance
3.05      JRS wi l continue to generate abckut 90 percent of its energy
requirements with conventional oil-fired power plants through 1985
(para. 1.15). JPS peak load has been forecast to grow from 223 MW in 1981 to
246 MW in 1985. System heat rates are expected to improve during the period
1982-1985 (from 14,650 Btu/kwh to 13,500 Btu/kwh). It is expected that the
rehabilitation program to be implemented during the project period will
enable JPS to meet both the capacity and energy requirements adequately with
the existing installations.

CHAPTER 4
THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Background and Objectives
4.01       The electric power service furnished by JPS has for a number of
years been highly unreliable due to an excessive number of outages in all
parts of the system.  Since JPS does not record outages, its associated
losses to the system can only be estimated (para. 6.04). Load shedding
caused by unavailability of generating units is the major problem. Although
installed generating capacity is more than sufficient to meet system peak
demand, inadequate maintenance, negative labor attitudes and lack of capital
expenditures for improvements have caused frequent and prolonged unavailabil-
ity of the larger and more efficient generating units. As a result during
1981 and early 1982 Jamaica experienced an almost daily series of power cuts
each lasting several hours which not only caused customer inconvenience but
also seriously hampered the country's productivity. While generating
reliability remains a critical problem, JPS is improving its transmission and
distribution system reliability by implementing an ongoing program of needed
improvements and additions; however, progress is limited by financial con-
straints for capital investment. JPS has prepared a program for recording
customer outages which was agreed upon during negotiations and its implemen-
tation is included in the loan agreements. 2/
4.02       JPS's 1982 to 1985 construction program, estimated at US$86 million
(para. 4.15), of which 62% is foreign exchange, is required to provide ade-
quate service to existing and new customers, reduce system outages, improve
generation thermal efficiency (heat rate), and reduce transmission and dis-
tribution losses. The program's cost was estimated by JPS, its consultants
and the appraisal mission on the basis of prevailing prices during the last
quarter of 1981. Program and project financing are discussed in paragraphs
5.09-5.11.
4.03       The proposed Third Power Project, described in para. 4.17, was
prepared by JPS and IBRD personnel and discussed with the Government during
1981 and early 1982. Taking into account the poor financial position of JPS
and the system's projected moderate load growth, the project is designed to
keep construction investment consistent with providing adequate service
during the project execution period.
Generation
4.04       JPS, with a reserve capacity of almost 100%, is unable to meet the
system peak demand of about 223 MW. Annex 4.1 lists installed generating
units and scheduled retirements. Assuming a 2.5% average annual load growth,
the 'nstalled capacity, if rehabilitated to design conditions and taking into
account scheduled retirements, should be able to meet peak demand until about
1988. A generation planning study is included in the proposed project

losses, thermal heat rate, outages, and power-plant availability.

4.05       The investment program includes rehabilitation of the four existing
steam units at Old Harbor (206 MW) and units 5 and 6 at Hunts Bay (84 MW) as
well as overhaul of the three 20 MW gas turbines. Rehabilitation of the
steam units includes repairs to the boiler air preheaters and gas ducting,
replacement of defective boiler tubes, installation of low excess air burners
and major overhaul of the turbine generators.  Also, improvements will be
made to the boiler feed water treatment systems by additions of reverse
osmosis equipment and degasifiers at Old Harbor and Hunts Bay stations. The
program which commenced in mid 1979 is expected to be completed in late
1983 3/. The target is to improve Old Harbor station performance from 40%
to 80% availability and its heat rate (thermal efficiency) from 15,706 to
13,200 BTU per kWh. At Hunts Bay, station unit No. 5 has a capability of
only 10 MW, about one-half its design output because of defective boiler
tubes and gas ducting and deferred turbine maintenance. Unit No. 6, although
still operating at design conditions, has not had a major overhaul since its
installation in 1976. JPS's consultant BEI will provide engineering services
including assistance in design, procurement, installation and training for
the above program.
4.06       JPS's installed hydropower capacity, 21.4 MW, furnishes an average
of 120 GWh/y which is about 9% of 1982 net generation. With the assistance
of consultants, the Government is carrying out feasibility studies of new
hydro sites scheduled to be completed not before December 1982. The eight
run-of-river sites selected as most promising (see map) have a total
estimated capacity of 19.8 MW and 92 GWh/y average energy supply. Total
estimated construction cost for the eight sites (1981 price) is US$53.4
3/   A consulting firm (British Electricity International - BEI), commenced
work in 1979 with financing from Loan 1516-JM. Rehabilitation of
HB-5, OH-3 and OH-4 should be completed by mid 1982. Rehabilitation
of OH-1, OH-2 and HB-6 should be completed under the proposed Bank
project by late 1983.



million. 4/  It is estimated by the appraisal mission that construction of
the selected sites could commence in mid 1984 allowving about 18 months for
design, preparation of biddin.g documents and contract award.  IDB has
Informed the Bank that it plans to finance the foreign exchange costs for the
total hydro program including completion of feasibility stu,dies, engineering,
design, bid documents and constructzton=
4.07       JPS and the Government have given consideration to the procurement
of about 40 MW of large diesel generation capacity to be andided to the system
for the purpose of improving system thermal efficiency and thereby reducing
fuel costs.  These diesels have a desigri heat rate of about 99000 to 10,000
BTU/kWh as compared to the JPS system standard or target heat rate of 13,500
BTU.  Motor Columbus, a Swiss consultant, completed an evaluation of diesel
enigines for JPS elictric power generation in September 1981 with favorable
conclusions for adding 40 MW of diesel capaoity. Bank review of the
evaluation in December 1981 considered diesel heat rate, uinit availability
and financing terms as presented by the consultant to be over optimistic.
JPS is currently reanalyzing the economic feasibility of purchasing the
diesels using more realistic data. The clause in the existing loan agreement
requiring JPS to conisult the Bank before undertaking any najor investment
provides an opportunity for the Bank to scrutinize the t.n'hnical, economic
and financial feasibility of the diesels. 5/
Transmission and Substations
4.08      The proposed expansion program for transmission lines and
associated substations, which includes about 25 miles of Lnew 69 kV lines and
6.25 MVA of 69 kV transformer capacity, is a continuatior. of the master plan
developed in 1978 as part of the Second Power Project.  The objective of the
plan is to improve reliability of service particularly to the north coast and
to allow greater utilization of the most efficient generating units by
improving the tie line around the Kingston area and between, the major
generating stations.
4.09      The transmission system as now completed or under construction
consists of about 170 circuit miles of 138 kV line and 370 circuit miles of
69 kV line (see map).  The lines and substations included in the program are
as follows:
69 kV lines: Annotto Bay - Port Antonio (25 miles).
Reconductoring of about 105 miles of existing 69 kV
wood pole line.
Substations: Port Antonio (new) 6.25 MVA
Annotto Bay (extensiorn)
4/   Costs associated with the Leasibility studies and construction of
hydro works have not been included in the defined expansion program as
no final decisions have been taken concerning implementation and
responsible agencies.
5/ Costs for the diesel engines have not been includdec in the defined
expansion program as no final decision has been tuaken, pending the
results of a re-examination of the justification for purchasing the
diesels.



- 15 -
Distribution
4.10      The proposed distribution program for the period 1982 to 1985 is
designed to improve service to existing customers and provide power to new
customers.
4.11      The program includes the addition or rehabilitation of about 900
circuit miles of 24 kV lines, representing about 17% of the 1985 total
listri-2tion circuit uiles; 68 MVA of distribution transformers; an increase
of 8%; 60,000 meters; about 55,000 distribution extensions; 30 MVAR of
capacitors and 2,500 street lights.
General Property
4.12 The investment program for general property includes two major items,
expansion of the existing supervisory control and automatic data acquisition
(SCADA) system and procurement of about 75 maintenance and operating
vehicles.
4.13      The existing SCADA equipment, installed in 1974, requires
significant additions and improvements in order to monitor properly and
control JPS's expanded generation capability and transmission network and,
also, to perform additional computerized functions necessary for efficient
system planning and operations. The proposed program would provide
equipment, materials, services and training as required to expand the
minicomputer, console display capability and peripherals, and to increase the
number of remote terminals to serve the existing system and to provide for at
least 10 years expansion.  Software would be supplied in the program to
provide for improved monitoring and control functions, energy management and
power system analysis.
4.14      As of December 1981, JPS had a fleet of 49 cars and 158
commercial-type trucks or vans for a total of 207 vehicles. Given the
physical size of JPS's system and the number of employees and customers
served, there is a need for additional vehicles in the program period.
During 1981 JPS utilized an average of 15 rental cars to supplement its fleet
and provide transportation to construction sites and to contract employees.
Considering an economic lfe of 8 to 10 years for vehicles, it would be
necessary to provide about 20 vehicles per year for replacement only. The
program includes procurement of some 75 vehicles from 1982 to 1985. About
80% will consist of commercial-type trucks and vans to be used by operation
and maintenance crews and the remaining 20% will be cars or station-wagons to
provide necessary work related transportation. Procurement of these vehicles
is necessary for implementation of the program and operation and maintenance
of the system.

prevailing as of December 31, 1981 and found to be reasonable by the Bank.
Engineering and administration costs are included in the base estimates. The
cost of consulting services has been estimated on the basis of about
US$10,800 per staff-month, including salary, costs, fees, international
travel and subsistence. Transmission and distribution costs are based on
similar work now in progress. Allowances for foreign and local price
increases have been made using the following annual percentages: 1982, 8.5%;
1983 to 1985, 7.5% p.a. and 6% p.a. thereafter. As Jamaica has a compara-
tively open economy, forecast foreign and local inflation rates are expected
to be the same.

These costs have been calculated on the same basis as those for the complete
program (para. 4.15).  Local costs would be financed by JPS with Government
financial assistance. JPS would finance interest during construction.
Implementation
4.19      Engineering, preparation of bidding documents and supervision of
construction for the project would be performed by JPS's staff. This is
acceptable since JPS has experience in similar work either recently completed
or under construction. Contractors would build the new 69 kV line and
install the substations and SCADA equipment since JPS does not maintain
in-house construction capability for these works. Also contractors would be
employed to assist in rehabilitation of the generating units at Hunts Bay and
Old Harbor as JPS does not have sufficient specialized technical personnel
such as certified welders for boiler repairs and turbine technicians to
perform the work in a timely manner. JPS personnel would install the
distribution equipment and distribution extensions. JPS has agreed to engage
consultants acceptable to the Bank to assist in the supervision of the power
plant rehabilitation work. The project would commence in mid 1982 and be
completed by December 31, 1984. The project implementation schedule is
detailed in Annex 4.2. JPS has confirmed its intention to meet the schedule.
Consultant Services and Training
4.20      The proposed project includes the services of-consultants to be
engaged by JPS under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to assist in
the following:



- 19 -
(a) Generation Planning Study: JPS with increasing energy costs needs
to develop a long-range generation plan to assure least cost
development of the system.  The consultant will render advice and
recommendations to JPS concerning the technical and economic
aspects of load projections and generation scheme, including
conservation, utilization of peat, coal and bagasse, and develop a
20 year generation expansion scheme. The consultant will be
engaged by October 31, 1982;
(b) Financial Planning Study: JPS's system of financial planning,
budgeting and cash flow forecasting does not provide timely infor-
mation for the use of its management. JPS has hired consultants
(Price Waterhouse Jamaica) to assist in computerizing its account-
ing as a first step towards improving its capabilities in these
areas. Consultants would be engaged to analyze, evaluate and
recommend improvements and corrective actions necessary to improve
JPS's financial administration 'Including financial planning,
budgeting, purchasing and internal financial controls. The consul-
tants would be engaged not later than April 1983. It is expected
that the new financial team (para. 2.05) will assist in the prepar-
ation of the terms of reference for the financial planning study;
(c) Power Plant Rehabilitation: a consultant will be selected to
continue assisting JPS in implementing the generation rehabilita-
tion program at Old Harbor and Hunts Bay generating plants. The
consultant will provide experienced the technical personnel to
assist in supervision of the contractors at each power plant and to
assist JPS's production manager in implementing the rehabilitation
program. The consultants will commence the assignmert by September
30, 1982;
(d) Transmission and Distribution System Operation and Maintenance:
consultants will be selected to assist JPS to implement improve-
ments in the operation and maintenance of the transmission and
distribution system including planning, reliability, reduction of
losses and safety practices. The contract will be signed by
September 1982.
(e) Power Plant Management Assistance: JPS needs to improve its
production management capabilities (para. 2.06). JPS will engage
consultants to strengthen its managerial capacity and assist the
manager of production in the development of planning and
maintenance functions. The consultants will be engaged by
August 31, 1982.
Procurement
4.21      Procurement of goods and services for the project, except as shown
below, will be through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with Bank guidelines for procurement and Bank guidelines for use of consul-
tants. Local manufacturers are expected to supply materials with a total
cost not exceeding US$250,000.  Jamaican manufacturers will receive a margin
of preference of 15% or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower for
bid evaluation. Local contractors are expected to be successful bidders for



- 20 -
construction of the 69 kV wood pole lines, substations and primary distribu-
tion lines.  It is expected that a foreign firm will be selected by limited
international tendering for the generation rehabilitation work. SCADA equip-
ment which must be compatible with the existing system would be procured by
limited international tendering from suppliers who would also furnish tech-
nical assistance to local contractors during installation. JPS furnished an
implementation plan acceptable to the Bank for installation of the SCADA
equipment. Equipment for substations and turbine generators (estimated at
about US$450,000) may be procured only after justificaion to and prior
approval of the Bank from original suppliers where standardization of
specific items is necessary for compatibility with existing equipment or is
proprietary and obtainable from only one manufacturer.
4.22      In March 1982, JPS signed a letter of intent with Foster Wheeler
(Canada) for rehabilitation of generating units 3 and 4 at Old Harbor Station
which is scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1982. Contracting procedures
should be similar to that outlined above for the rehabilitation work to be
financed under the project. Since this work is complementary to the plant
rehabilitation component of the Bank financed project, the Bank has
requested a copy of the contract in order to ensure that the proposed project
is compatible with work being performed. These works will not be financed
from the proposed loan.
Retroactive Financing
4.23      Because the more efficient thermal generating units are out of
service, JPS is supplying electricity with inefficient and less reliable
units (4.05). This situation has resulted in increased fuel costs which are
estimated by JPS's consultant (BEI) to be about US$1 million per month. In
order to meet the schedule for rehabilitating the thermal units at Old Harbor
and Hunts Bay power plants, it will be necessary to order materials and
service prior to Board approval. It is recommended that a provision be made
in the proposed loan to cover expenditures made after May 1, 1982 for a total
of US$200,000 of retroactive financing for initial orders for services and
materials for the generation rehabilitation program.
Disbursement
4.24      Disbursements from the loan account would be made for 100% of the
ex-factory cost of locally produced items and for 100% of foreign expendi-
tures for:
(a) equipment and materials;
(b) contracts for services, installation and erection of works;
(c) consultant's services, and
(d) the training program.
Disbursements would be fully documented. The closing date would be
December 31, 1984, six months after estimated completion of the project.
Because of the continuing nature of transmission and distribution work, any
undisbursed amount of the proposed loan would be applied to system improve-
ments similar to those in the project, after consultation with the Bank. In



- 21 -
estimating disbursements for the proposed project, the project implementation
schedule and the general trend of the sector disbursement profiles for power
projects were utilized to estimate percent disbursed in relation to time from
date of expected Board approval. Recent record of actual disbursements under
the previous power loan to JPS was not used due to the short (2 year) time
span of the proposed loan. Assuming loan approval by June 30, 1982, the
following table shows estimated loan disbursements:

Environment
4.25       JPS has carried out  previous projects as well as on-going works
which are similar to the proposed project with due regard to environmental
protection and would do so in this project. Line routes consist mostly of
conversion or upgrading of existing lines and will, in most cases, follow
established rights-of-way with land clearing and visual impact kept to a
minimum.
Project Risks
4.26       The procurement and construction schedule assumed for the project
is reasonable and takes into account normal engineering, administrative and
construction procedures but with no provision for unusual delays. Timely
completion of the project by the borrower will depend to a large extent upon
strengthening JPS's managerial capacity, improving employee morale and the
ability of construction firms to maintain schedules. Provision has been made
to engage consultants to improve JPS's management capability and to assist
JPS in implementation-of the generation rehabilitation program. Notwith-
standing changes in JPS's upper level management and Government's recent
appointment of a Minister of Public Utilities with extensive union experi-
ence, it will be difficult to moderate long standing union practices that



- 22 -
encourage labor unrest (strikes) which in the past have caused delays in
implementing the generation rehabilitation program and constructing the
138 kV transmission lines. Delays in Government actions necessary to assist
in improving JPS's poor financial position may affect project implementation
because of lack of funds for local costs.

CHAPTER 5
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Summary
5.01       During the years 1977-1981, the financial performance of JPS
deteriorated because tariff increases allowed by the Goverrnent were not
sufficient to enable JPS to comply with earnings provisions contained in
existing loan agreements. The Loan Agreement for the Second Power Project
(1516-JM) required JPS to earn rates of return rising from 8% in 1978 to 8%
in 1981. The operating inefficiencies of JPS also contributed to its poor
financial performance. Because of the difficult economic problems of Jamaica
and the unreliable service of JPS, the Bank did not take action under the
Loan Agreement, especially as tariff levels (US$0. 143/kwh in 1981) are
already among the highest in the Latin American and Caribbean region.
5.02       Recently, JPS has suffered frequent power outages due to poor oper-
ating and maintenance practices and a lack of foreign exchange for the
purchase of spare parts to repair its generators (para. 4.01). Public
reaction to the frequent power outages has been very adverse. In these
circumstances, the Government has been reluctant to amend the current
arrangement for raising tariffs, which consists of a fuel adjustment clause
and a monthly increase (1% compounded) of the basic tariff. However, further
tariff increases are necessary if the company is to be able to generate
sufficient funds from its operations to maintain the supply of electricity at
an acceptable level of reliability.  Such increases must be implemented on a
phased basis to ensure their acceptability. To this end, the proposed loan
agreement includes revenue covenants which would allow for gradual restoration
of JPS financial viability by the end of the project. The implementation of
such a program will require moderate increases of the base tariff
(Annex 5.2), plus full recovery of fuel costs; and is expected to permit JPS
to self finance, in 1982-1984, about 41% of its funding requirements, which
is satisfactory. These requirements include an investment program reduced to
the minimum level consistent with providing adequate service during the
project execution period (para. 4.03). The following paragraphs discuss JPS'
past and expected financial performance.
Earnings History and Financial Position, 1977-1981
5.03       During the years 1977-1981 although the debt-equity ratio improved
from 44% to 32% as a result of the revaluation of assets, the rate of return
fell from 5.9% on net average revalued assets to negative 2.4%; coverage of
debt service and dividends by internal cash generation fell from 1.3 to 0.6;
and the self-financing ratio declined from from 16.0% to negative 102.6%
(Annex 5.1). A major contributing factors to the declining financial perfor-
mance of JPS has been the operation of the fuel-adjustment clause, which
limited tariff increases to less than fuel-cost increases.
5.04       While the basic tariff provides for minor recovery of fuel costs --
J,2.77 per kWh of net generation -- the balance of fuel costs are recovered
through operation of the fuel adjustment clause. This recovery is determined



- 25 -
by the extent to which JPS meets standards for fuel efficiency (in the form
of a target or standard heat rate) and distribution efficiency (in the form
of losses as a percent of net generation).  The fuel adjustment clause
currently allows for a neat rate of 13,500 BTU/kWh and system distribution
losses up to 15% (of net generation). In 1980, the system heat rate achieved
was 14,502 BTU/kWh and the distribution loss ratio achieved was 20%. In
1981, the corresponding data were 14,395 BTU/kWh and 21%. As JPS was not
able to meet the fuel-consumption and distribution-loss standards, the fuel
adjustment clause did not provide for full recovery of fuel costs. In 1980,
the fuel clause provided about J$12.6 million less than the full fuel expense
-- about J$6.9 million due to the system heat rate and about J$5.7 million
due to the loss factor. In 1981, the corresponding data were J$10.3 million
and J$9.2 million (Annex 5.10). Annexes 5.2-5.4 set forth details on the
earnings history and financial performance of JPS during the period
1977-1981.
5.05      The feature in JPS tariffs limiting the heat rate and system losses
is a desirable feature. It serves as a measure of managerial efficiency.
The Bank supports retention of the 15% limitation on distribution losses.
Because of the high level of consumption unaccounted for (estimated at about
6% of net generation), there are measures such as enforcing disconnection
policies more stringently, devoting resources to the combat of theft and
irregular consumption and correcting clerical errors which JPS management can
and should take to reduce distribution losses to the 15% limit (para 3.04).
5.06      As the heat-rate standard (which was outside the control of JPS
management) has contributed to the declining state of JPS finances and effi-
ciency, the Bank favors immediate adjustment of the heat rate to a level
which the system can reasonably be expected to achieve (about 14,500
BTU/kWh). After such an adjustment, JPS would not expect to change this heat
rate for billing purposes before 1986.  This adjustment should help JPS to
avoid in the future the financial problems of the past.  To promote
efficiency, JPS agreed to heat-rate targets which have been incorporated into
a side letter to the proposed loan agreement.
5.07      Due to its revenue insufficiency, JPS' internal cash generation was
negative for 1977-1981, requiring JPS to finance its requirements with loans
(J$119.1 million) and Government contributions (J$37.6 million). Another
factor contributing to its funding problems has been the high level of
accounts receivable, which have varied from 89 days to 75 days of sales. If
during this period, JPS had been able to hold accounts receivable to about 55
days of sales, (which is considered reasonable for its system), it would have
been able to reduce its funding requirements by J$42 million (including
financing charges). 6/
5.08      In April 1980, a refinancing agreement was reached between the
Government of Jamaica, which was experiencing balance-of-payments problems,
and certain foreign commercial banks. The agreement rescheduled the foreign
6/   At 55 days of actual sales revenue in 1977 and 1981, the levels of
accounts receivable would have been J$15.0 and J$39.1 million,
respectively. Avoided financing charges would have amounted to J$18.0
million (J$24.0 million compounded at 15% p.a. for five years.



- 26 
debts of certain Government entities (including JPS) falling due between
March 31, 1979 and April 1, 1980. JPS's debt repayment amounting to J$24
million was rescheduled to the period 1983-1986. Nevertheless, JPS has
carried a heavy burden of debt service payments: the debt-service coverage
ratio was 0.9 in 1980 and 0.6 in 1981. At the end of 1981, the long-term
debt of iPS had a weighted average maturity of 10 years and three months and
a weighted average interest rate of about 9.0%. These reflect JPS's heavy
reliance, in recent years, on medium-term borrowing from commercial sources
-- a reflection of JPS's revenue insufficiency and the prevailing
inflation-distorted conditions in world financial markets. After 1982, the
financial performance of JPS is expected to improve, as discussed below.
Earnings Requirements and Financing Plan, 1982-1984
5.09       The financial performance of JPS in 1982 will be unfavorable.  The
company is expected to earn a negative 1.5% on average revalued net fixed
assets. The proposed loan agreements replace the existing tariff convenant
with provisions requiring the Government to allow tariffs to be set at levels
enabling JPS to earn rates of return on its average revalued net fixed assets
of 5% in 1983, 8% in 1984, and 8.5% in 1985 and thereafter. They further
condition effectiveness of the loan to the Government's taking specific
action to enable JPS to achieve a 5% return, as discussed duiring
negotiations.
5.10      A key element of the proposed financing plan is expected to be
Government equity contributions of about J$5.0 million in 1982 and non--Bank
financing under suitable terms of about J$ 15.0 million (from local insurance
companies and pension funds). A definite commitment for these funds has been
received.
5.11      Under the financing plan summarized below, JPS would self-finance
about 41% of its total requirements and cover its debt-service requirements
by 1.5.

The financing plan reflects the assumption that JPS would retain all earnings
other than those needed for operations and payment of debt service, taxes,
and preference share dividends. However, JPS does not expect to pay income
taxes during the project period. Under the Loan Agreement for the Second
Power Project (1516-JM), JPS may not assume overdraft or demand debt exceed-
ing one-sixth of its cash operating expenses during the preceding twelve
months. Furthermore, the same loan agreement obligates JPS to seek Bank
agreement for (i) additional long-term borrowing unless its gross internal
cash generation exceeds its maximum future debt service by a ratio of 1.5;
and (ii) the construction of works additional to the agreed program and
exceeding the equivalent of one percent (1%) of the value of gross fixed
assets. The proposed loan agreement for the proposed loan repeats these
covenants. The performance of JPS under these covenants has been
satisfactory. Annexes 5.2 to 5.10 set forth details on the proposed
financing plan.
Security
5.12      JPS has Sterling den minated debentures which are secured by a
Debenture Trust Deed carrying a first floating charge. To ensure that the
Bank loan will have equivalent ranking with the debenture holders it is
proposed that JPS agree to issue, should the Bank so request, additional
debentures supplemental to the Debenture Trust Deed as security for the
proposed loan.

CHAPTER 6
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01       Generation:  There is no additional new generation capacity
included in the proposed program since JPS has sufficient installed capacity
to meet projected loads. The rehabilitation of existing thermal units is
necessary to improve efficiency and capability to near design conditions.
During the program period about US$14.1 million will be used to finance
rehabilitation of Old Harbor and Hunts Bay, a total of 290 MW. This
investment is the least-cost solution to improvement of generation
capability. Other technically feasible alternatives - the installation
of readily available diesels or gas turbines - are not economically viable
because they would require higher capital investment and operating costs.
6.02       Transmission and Distribution:  The 138 kV lines and 24 kV primary
distribution feeders were selected by JPS and its consultants as early as
1975 as the least cost solution for future expansion. JPS, during program
preparation in 1980 and 1981, conducted studies using updated load flows, and
fuel and construction costs which confirmed the above voltages as least-cost
solutions for present expansion and upgrading of the system. The Annotto
Bay-Port Antonio 69 kV line when compared with viable alternatives was found
to be the least-cost solution for discount rates up to 20%. Because of
limited funds and construction capability, only feeders showing the highest
economic return of those needed to serve new customers are included for
upgrading and reconductoring in the proposed project.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
6.03       Because the Bank-financed project is intertwined with the remainder
of the 1982-1985 investment program it is difficult to isolate its benefits
distinctly from those of the rest of the program. The economic rate of
return has therefore been calculated for the entire 1982-1985 investment
program.
Economic Benefits
6.04       The economic benefits to be derived from the proposed 1982-1985
investment program include: (i) allowing JPS to meet its incremental sales
for the period; (ii) achievement of fuel savings resulting from a reduction
in the trangsmission and distribution losses and from an improvement in the
efficiency of JPS generating plants; and (iii) reduced incidence of forced
electrical outages with a corresponding decrease in productive output
foregone as a result of power cuts. The justification for each of the above
benefits and the procedure for its quantification are indicated below:
(a) Incremental Sales: The state of the existing power network is such
that JPS will be unable to meet any sales over and above the 1981
level without the power plant rehabilitation program and the
associated investments in transmission and distribution facil-
ities.  All incremental sales during the 1982-1985 period are



- 29 
assumed to be met as a result of the program.  The program benefits
have been valued at the January 1, 1982 average tariff. The
program is assumed to yield benefits for a 20 year period.
Incremental sales over the 1985 level (i.e., incremental sales
after the conclusion of the investment program) have been assumed
to be met as a result of post 1985 investments;
(b) Loss Reduction: It is anticipated that by the end of the program in
1985 the level of system losses would have declined from the 21%
level 7/ to a more reasonable 15%. This improvement is expected
to result from a combination of technical improvemets in the
transmission and distribution system brought about by the
investment program as well as from the enforcement of procedures to
reduce unauthorized use of electricity. These procedures, which
are not directly related to the investment program, are estimated
to account for about half of the projected reduction in losses.
The investment program will account for the other half. The losses
so avoided result in lower energy generation for any given level of
sales. The benefits were quantified as the associated cost of fuel
at the January 1, 1982 price levels. 8t
(c) Improvement in Generating Plant Efficiency: Through the
implementation of the 1982-1985 investment program, the efficiency
of JPS generating plants is expected to improve significantly so as
to reduce the amount of fuel required to generate each kWh of
electricity. The associated benefits were derived as the
difference between the fuel costs (in constant January 1, 1982)
prices valued at the existing heat rate of about 15,000 BTU/kWh and
fuel costs valued at the projected heat rates that will result from
the program (Annex 5.1).
(d) Reduction in Outages: The proposed program will enable JPS to
supply electricity more reliably. Forced electricity outages will
be reduced and consequently the associated losses in industrial
output and in residential leasure time as well as wastage of
household goods, normally induced by power outages, should be
reduced. The valuation of the estimated benefits associated with
the reduction in outages was not included in the calculation of the
program's economic return because the project is sufficiently
justified without their additional benefit. 9/
7/   Expressed as a percentage of net generation.
8/   For incremental sales beyond 1981 the benefits from reduced losses (and
improved heat rates) were incorporated into the computation in
subparagraph (a) above. Therefore, to avoid double counting, the
benefits in subparagraphs (b) and (c) were computed at the 1981 sales
level.
9/   JPS has estimated that the cost to the economy of a kWh not supplied at
a level of about J$0.46 (1978 prices).  The Bank obtained the agreement
of JPS to record outages starting in 1982 (para. 4.01).



- 30 -
Economic Costs
6.05      The cost of the capital investment program valued at constant
January 1, 1982 prices, has been included in the program's economic costs.
Other economic costs are the fuel and non-fuel operating and maintenance
costs associated with the incremental energy sales.
Return on Investment
6.06      Annex 6.1 shows the costs and benefit streams associated with the
program as described above. The discount rate which equates the two streams
was used as the program's internal economic rate of return.  The rate of
return so obtained was about 23% which compares very favorably with the
economic cost of capital in Jamaica estimated at about 11%.
6.07      Tests were performed to determine the sensitivity of the internal
economic rate of return to various key parameters. The results were as
follows:
Scenario                                Rate of Return (%)
Base case                                        23
Capital costs up             15%                 18
All benefits down            25%                 12
Sales down                   20%                 20
Benefits from reduced
losses down                40%                20
Benefits from heat rate
improvement down           40%                 14
The results above indicate that the economic raturn of the program,
on which the project is based, is adequate and that the economic return is
unlikely to be affected significantly by any errors in valuation of the basic
parameters used to derive it.  A high economic rate of return would be
expected from a long overdue system of rehabilitation expansion program.

CHAPTER 7
AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
ConditioT of Effectiveness
7.01      Before loan effectiveness, the Bank should receive:
(a) notification that a satisfactory individual has been engaged to
fill the position of chief executive officer at JPS (para. 2.04);
(b) evidence that appropriate actions (including tariff adjustments)
have been taken to produce for the Borrower revenues yielding in
fiscal year 1983 an annual rate of return of not less than 5%.
Loan Covenants
7.02      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following:
(a)   Government and JPS will appoint and maintain a chief executive
officer at JPS acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.04);
(b)   JPS will prepare a detailed program acceptable to the Bank covering
its 1983-1984 training needs by December 31, 1982 (para. 2.10);
(c)  JPS, with the assistance of external auditors, will evaluate and
strengthen control systems and auditing procedures acceptable to the
Bank not later than June 30, 1983 (para. 2.12);
(d)  JPS will implement a program satisfactory to the Bank to reduce accounts
receivable in accordance with a schedule agreed during negotiaitons
(para. 2.14);
(e)  JPS will implement a program acceptable to the Bank to reduce energy
losses in accordance with a schedule agreed upon during negotiations
(para. 3.04);
(f)  JPS will engage consultants under terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank to assist in: (i) generation planning; (ii) financial
planning; (iii) power plant rehabilitation, and (iv) system operation
and maintenance (para. 4.20);
(g)  Government will permit JPS to implement specific tariff measures
discussed during negotiations enabling JPS to earn a return of 5% in
1983. Government will permit JPS to increase tariffs sufficiently to
earn a return of 8% in 1984 and 8.5% in 1985 and annually thereafter
(para. 5.09);
(h)  JPS will issue, if the Bank should so request, additional debentures
supplemental to the Debenture Trust Deed as security for the proposed
loan (para. 5.12).
7.03      Agreements of the proposed loan repeat existing covenants with
respect to:



-. 32 -
(a) the submission of an audited financial statement to the Bank within
four months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 2.13);
(b) limitation of short-term borrowing to one-sixth of cash operating
expenses during the preceeding twelve months (para. 5.11); limita-
tion of long-term borrowing unless gross internal cash generation
exceeds maximum future debt service by a ratio of 1.5 (para. 5.11);
and limitation of construction of works additional to those agreed
with the Bank to no more than 2% of gross fixed assets in operation
until the project shall have been completed (para. 5.11).
Recommendation
7.04      With the above assurances the project would constitute a suitable
basis for a loan to JPS of US$30.5 million under applicable terms and
conditions for Jamaica.

1/  All the hydro plants  are of the run-of-the-river type and output varies with
available stream flow. Maximum continuous rating to meet peak demand does not
include hydro capacity and so is only 439 MW.
2/  Retirement will depend upon availability of spare parts, reserve-demand ratio and
economic cost of replacement.
3/  HB-6 and OH 3 and 4 should be derated about 11.6% to limit boiler furnace heat
release rates (Management Audit Report of JPS by OAAI).
