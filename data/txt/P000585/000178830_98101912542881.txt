FEDERAL ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF THE COMOROS
SECOND HIGHWAY (MAINTENANCE) PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      The Comoros archipelago, located at the northern end of the    2
Mozambique Channel, consists of four islands yith a land area of22,166 km
Three o5 the islands--Grande Comore (1,148 km ), Anjouan (424 km ) amd Moheli
(220 km )--constitute the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros (see Maps);
the fourth island--Mayotte (374 km )--is under French rule. The islands are
of volcanic origin and characterized by a rugged topography with steep, rocky
coastlines. Rainfall, up to 400 mm per month during the six-month rainy
season, combines with rich laterite soils to produce a lush vegetation.
During the rainy season devastating cyclones occasionally occur causing
economic havoc and disrupting the transport and communications systems. Being
a country of three islands also presents special problems. Each island
requires airport and minimal port facilities as well as its own road mainte-
nance crews and plant repair facilities. Also, the rocky coastlines without
harbors impede coastal shipping, and land transport is hampered by the islands
rugged topography, steep gradients, clayish soils and heavy rains all of which
make road construction and maintenance expensive.
1.02      The population was estimated at 400,000 in mid-1980 with an average
annual growth rate of ab2ut 3.5%, which gives the Comoros a very high popula-
tion density (325 per km  of agricultural land).  The islands of Anjouan and,
to a lesser extent, Grande Comore are becoming overpopulated and, given the
limited opportunities for employment, are suffering from unemployment and
underemployment problems.
1.03      The Comorian economy is based on agriculture which contributes an
estimated 40% of GDP. Agriculture provides nearly all export earnings through
four principal crops: ylang-ylang (used in the manufacture of perfume), copra,
vanilla and cloves, whose prices can fluctuate widely thereby making it
difficult to estimate the country's export earnings. The only significant
industrial activity is the distillation of ylang-ylang. The service sector
contributes another 40% of GDP while the transport sector contributes 2% of
GDP. The GNP per capita is estimated at US$260, one of the lowest in East
Africa.
1.04      When the Comoros became independent in 1975, France, the principal
source of financial and technical assistance, suspended all aid. Most of
the French community departed, causing an immediate adverse impact on the
economy since the French manned many of the key public services. It is
estimated that GDP reached US$71 million in 1974, having grown at a rate of
between 6 and 7% p.a. in real terms over the previous five years. As a
consequence of the events surrounding independence, real GDP fell 13% in 1975.
The new Government had to cutback drastically on most activities and total



- 2 -
public expenditure was halved. The Government's appeals for help initially
brought free food and medical supplies in early 1976, followed by a US$10
million loan from the Special Arab Aid Fund for Africa and a US$10 million
suppliers' credit from the People's Republic of China. Since then Arab
sources have provided aid for specific projects, and in 1979 France resumed
budgetary aid. Multilateral sources, mostly the African Development Fund
(AfDF), IDA, the European Development Fund (EDF) and the UN have been providing
technical assistance and project aid. The Comoros' budgetary problems are
still critical and will continue to restrict Government contributions to
development projects. These problems are being taken into account in project
design to avoid implementation delays.
B.  The Transport System                                         *
The Transport Network
1.05      The Comoros' transport system consists of about 762 km of roads,
two seaports, and one international airport and three airfields. There are no
railways or navigable rivers. The principal features of the system are: a main
road network essentially comprising a coastal ring road on each island,
linking the settlements in the export crop producing areas to the ports; a
system of feeder roads and tracks, penetrating inland to the highlands where
food crops are grown; two artificial harbors, one each on Grande Comore and
Anjouan; and airports to accommodate international and interisland traffic,
particularly passengers. Road transport dominates internal transport, while
maritime transport Ls the main mode for both exports and imports and inter-
island freig'-.
Ports and Sea Transport
1.06      Mutsamudu on Anjouan is the country's main port; it can accommo-
date only one 3,000-ton ship or two small vessels at one time due to limited
port infrastructure. The port of Moroni on Grande Comore can accommodate
ships up to 500 tons. At both ports larger ships must anchor offshore and
lighterage is undertaken by dhows, but even this is often impossible during
the cyclone season. Moheli has no port; small boats must be handled at the
beach near Fomboni. The ports are run by a state company, and the Government
is a part owner of the interisland shipping company.
1.07      International trade and communications are hampered by long
distances to foreign markets, mostly Europe and North America, and by the
lack of a natural deep-water harbor for oceangoing vessels. Oceangoing
vessels must use ports in neighboring countries for transshipment, the island
of Reunion being the most frequently used for this purpose, or undertake
lighterage operations. Because of these difficulties, higher value imports
and exports are carried by air. The Government is considering the construc-
tion of a deep-water harbor on Anjouan (para. 1.13).



-3-
Airports and Civil Aviation
1.08      Grande Comore has an international airport (at Hahaya) with a 2,900 m
runway, long enough to accommodate Boeing 707-300-type aircraft. Each island
has a small airport with paved runways capable of handling DC4s.
1.09      The Comoros is served by weekly Air France flights between Paris
and the international airport on Grande Comore. Both Air Comoros, a para-
statal company, and Tanzania Airways provide regional service between the
Comoros, Kenya, Tanzania and Mauritius. Air Comoros' main function is to
provide air service between the islands, generally two to three flights a
week. Even though air fares are considerably higher than ship (about double),
Air Comoros is the principal means of interisland passenger transport, carrying
*        about 85% of the traffic.  Interisland air freight traffic is minor and likely
to remain so in the future.
Roads and Road Traffic
1.10      Details of the highway subsector are given in Chapter II.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
1.11      The Government does not have a formal transport plan.  However, a
UNDP-financed planning team recently arrived to assist the Government in (i)
preparing a development plan to be ready in 1982, and (ii) creating a planning
capability in the Ministry of Finance by training Comorian staff.
1.12      Pending the finalization of a formal transport plan, the Government
places high priority on the improvement of transport infrastructure and
services. One objective is the upgrading of the road network on all three
islands to facilitate rural development and agricultural production. The
Association is supporting this objective; both the First Highway Project and
the proposed project include road improvement components to assist in upgrading
earth roads to gravel standard. More ambitious road improvements involving
upgrading of earth and gravel roads to paved standards, as proposed by the
Government, do not seem to be economically justified given the present level
of economic development and traffic. Far more important are the maintenance of
the existing road network and improvement of earth roads to gravel standard.
At negotiations it was agreed that during implementation of the proposed proj-
ect the Government will consult with the Association before undertaking any
other project in the highway subsector.
1.13      A second transport objective is the construction of a deepwater
berth at Mutsamudu on Anjouan to accommodate oceangoing vessels and thereby to
avoid lighterage and transshipment through neighboring countries. Given the
Comoros' small volume of trade, the economic justification of such a project
seems marginal and is being reviewed. Other aims are the construction of a
small port on Moheli and improvement of the international airport (provision
of freight and aircraft hangars and a radar cyclone-tracking system).



- 4 -
1.14      Transport coordination is not an issue in the Comoros.  The trans-
port system is simple and straightforward and problems of intermodal competi-
tion do not arise. Last year the Government created a Ministry of Transport,
Tourism, Post Office and Telecommunications to oversee, inter-alia, all
transport activities except road construction and maintenance which remain the
responsibility of the Ministry of Works. A Minister of Transport and Tourism
has been appointed and the Government is in the process of staffing the
ministry. For the time being the Ministry of Finance will continue to be
responsible for whatever limited planning there is. However, in the future
the new transport ministry will play a role in planning port and airport
development.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The road network totals 762 km, of which 377 km (49%) are paved
and the remaining 385 km (51%) are gravel and earth roads (Table 2.1).
Annex 1, Table 1 provides a listing of the roads by island. Since 1972 the
road network has increased by 58% while the length of paved roads has increased
by 82%.

In 1979 the Ministry of Equipment and the Environment (MEE) classified the
main roads -- mainly paved roads -- as national roads and the rest as regional
roads. This system, however, has not yet been officially approved by the
Government. Road density is about 425 km per 1,000 km2 or 1.9 km per 1,000
inhabitants, which is above average for East African countries and sufficient
for the country's needs.



-5-
2.02      The condition of the paved roads is fair to good.  However, a number
of cuilverts and retaining walls need to be repaired, and worn-off pavement
edges need to be restored to their original width on some short sections.
Numerous earth roads need upgrading to gravel standard.  Each year after the
rainy season many of them have to be reconstructed as they are eroded by water
from the torrential rains which races down the islands' steep slopes.  While
the roads are closed, the villages and settlements they serve are cut off from
the rest of the island. The First Highway Project is assisting the Government
to repair the paved roads and improve earth roads. The proposed project will
reinforce and extend these efforts (paras. 3.04-3.06).
B. Road Use
Vehicle Fleet
2.03      The current vehicle fleet is estimated at roughly 1,800 vehicles
of which about 15% are heavy vehicles. Available information on the vehicle
fleet is limited to the number of new, privately owned vehicles regis-
tered each year and an estimate of Government-owned vehicles. Annual vehicle
registration is not required and vehicles are not deleted from the registration
lists when they are no longer in service. Information indicates that new
registrations declined sharply during the years immediately after independence
as expatriates left the country but have steadily increased since 1977.

To improve its information on the vehicle fleet, the MEE is implementing a new
system for the registration of vehicles (para. 2.10). More precise informa-
tion on the vehicle fleet will be available during 1981 as the new system
becomes fully operational.



-6-
Traffic
2.04      There were no systematic traffic counts in Comoros until 1979
when MEE, assisted by consultants BCEOM (France), began semi-annual traffic
counts at important points on the network. That year traffic counts were
taken on all paved roads on Grande Comore and Anjouan islands; they were
extended to the paved roads on Moheli island in 1980. MEE intends eventually
to include regional roads upgraded to gravel standard in the counts.
2.05      The highest traffic volumes, around 300 vehicles per day, are
registered in the vicinity of Moroni, the capital, and on the road between
the capital and the international airport. The average daily traffic on paved
roads for the country as a whole is about 100 vehicles. Traffic volumes on
Grande Comore are higher than those on the other two islands reflecting its
relative economic importance.
Road Transport, Industry and Regulation
2.06      Public passenger road transport is provided by owner-operated
vehicles. In the cities Renault 4s are used as group taxis to carry up to
four passengers. For longer trips 1-ton pick-up vehicles carry up to 17
passengers or freight. There are no buses for public transport.
2.07      In 1979 the Government (i) introduced an axle load limit of 8
tons which is enforced by MEE, and (ii) inaugurated a vehicle registration
and inspection system which is administered by the Public Works Department.
While damage to the roads through overloading has not been a problem, the new
regulations are designed to prevent any future problems. Passenger fares are
established by MEE in collaboration with the various prefectures and are
generally adhered to by the operators. They are adjusted from time to time
for inflation. Fares are based on length and type of road and terrain and
reflect operating costs. As soon as a road is improved, transport savings are
passed on to users as lower fares. There are no official tariffs for freight,
since the heavy vehicles are generally owned by the Government or by contractors
and traders for their own use. Entry into the road transport industry requires
a license from MEE. This license is routinely provided at a nominal fee and
does not include any restrictions as to itinerary or goods to be carried.
Automotive Fuel Prices and Costs
2.08      Gasoline and diesel oil are imported mainly from Kenya and
Madagascar. The following table summarizes prices and costs as of December
1980.

Retail fuel prices in the Comoros are higher than in other countries of the
region. For example, retail prices (including taxes) for gasoline in Kenya
and Madagascar are 15% and 27% lower, respectively, and for diesel oil 30% and
55% lower, respectively, than in the Comoros. This difference in prices
between the countries is generally true for other imported goods as well.
C. Administration
2.09      MEE is in charge of all public works through its Public Works
Department (PWD), which administers all matters related to the entire road
network, including urban roads. It establishes construction, improvement and
maintenance programs; prepares economic and engineering studies with its own
staff or with consultants assistance; follows up contracts for civil works
and procurement of equipment; supervises force account operations and work-
shops; and runs the soils and materials laboratory. MEE is also responsible
for the enforcement of vehicle regulations and for vehicle registration and
inspection. PWD performs its functions through three regional departments
(one for each island), each of which operates its own workshop.

2.10     The existing highway organization follows recommendations of a
consultants study financed by the Project Preparation Facility under the
ongoing First Highway Project. Technical assistance experts financed under
that project are assisting the Government in establishing the procedures for
and operation of MEE and the three regional Public Works Departments. So
far, the Government has introduced procedures for programming, budgeting,
cost accounting, vehicle registration and traffic counts and for procuring,
storing and maintaining equipment. While the overall progress in setting up
a highway administration has been satisfactory, actual implementation of the
procedures has just begun and some technical assistance, albeit limited, is
still needed to consolidate gains and further improve efficiency. The
proposed project provides for this (para. 3.09).
D. Training
2.11     The Comoros has no higher education facilities for staff in road-
related specialties, but the limited size of the road network and the small
number of experts needed do not warrant a specialized training facility.



- 9 -
Higher level staff, mostly engineers, lab technicians and workshop managers,
has been trained abroad and subsequently on the job by engineering consultants
and civil works contractors. The First Highway Project followed this pattern
by providing assistance to train Comorian staff. Since January 1979, 149
persons, including 12 road technicians, 58 foremen, 5 operators, 39 skilled
laborers, 8 administrators and 27 mechanics, have had some training in road
maintenance, equipment repair and workshop management.
2.12      Most trainees in road maintenance have acquired the basic skills
required to execute their tasks, and since mid-1980 all maintenance units are
*        managed in the field by Comorians.  Although much progress has been made and
performance is reasonably satisfactory, most maintenance personnel still need
technical support and periodic field visits by experienced technical assistance
personnel.  Local foremen lack the necessary experience to organize operations
efficiently; in addition, the level of skills of the mechanics is low and
needs to be raised. Though on a considerably smaller scale than under the
ongoing project, the proposed project will continue to provide technical
assistance for on-the-job training for both workshop and road maintenance
personnel to reinforce and expand the knowledge and skills they have already
acquired (para. 3.09). In addition a few Comorians will be selected for
training at schools abroad (para. 3.10).
E. Planning
2.13      Overall planning is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance,
but it lacks an experienced and well-trained planning staff. As mentioned in
para. 1.11 a planning team, funded under a UNDP project for which the Bank
has acted as executing agency, recently arrived in the Comoros and has
started its work. One of the team's responsibilities will be to draw up a
development program for the highway sector in close collaboration with MEE;
this should be available in 1982. MEE itself does not have a formal planning
unit and none is recommended, given the fairly limited task of such a unit
and the need to economize the small number of experienced planning staff in
the Comoros.  Planning can be handled centrally in the Ministry of Finance,
supported by technical expertise and information (traffic counts, etc.)
provided by MEE, once the necessary staff has been trained by the UNDP
team.
F. Financing
2.14      Because of the Government's very tight financial position, road
construction and maintenance, including most operating costs, are largely
financed by bilateral aid (Kuwait and Saudi Funds, Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation (FAC) and multilateral sources (AfDF, IDA, Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and EDF); the Government's financial
contribution from general revenue is and will continue to be minor. During



- 10 -
the period 1974-1982 expenditures for construction will total US$34.89
million equivalent (Annex 1, Table 2). In 1981, the first year in which all
road maintenance equipment acquired under the First Highway Project will be
fully operational, maintenance operations (including equipment depreciation)
will total an estimated US$2.8 million equivalent with routine maintenance
accounting for US$0.4 million and periodic maintenance for US$2.4 million.
The Government's contribution will amount to 13% or US$360,000.
2.15      Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and duties
on fuel, vehicles and spare parts (Table 2.4) and through annual road-user
license fees. The major sources of revenues are the duties and taxes on fuel,
which, based on fuel consumption in 1980 and the corresponding prices, tax
rates and duties, should have amounted to CF 200 million (US$800,000), short
cf the funds needed to adequately support road maintenance operations. In
order to augment its Road Fund revenues, the Government recently increased
fuel taxes (para. 2.17).

2.16      Not all the revenues collected from road users, however, are allo-
cated to road maintenance. Since January 1980, a portion of the taxes on
gasoline (CF 10/liter) has been earmarked for financing road maintenance
operations and deposited in a separate Road Fund account. The Road Fund
tax is levied by customs at the time the gasoline is imported, along with
the import duty and a consumption tax. Hydrocarbure, the Government company
which imports and distributes petroleum products, is responsible for paying
the taxes to customs. Although there has been a Road Fund for a number of
years, its revenues have been used as part of general revenue. Thus far MEE
has not been provided funds from the Road Fund to help finance road mainte-
nance. As of December 31, 1980, CF 13 million (US$52,000 equivalent) had



- 11 -
accumulated in the Road Fund from the year's receipts, whereas based on
actual gasoline imports, the year-s receipts should have been CF 35 million
(US$140,000 equivalent). The reason for the shortfall lies principally with
the state electric company and other Government agencies which are slow in
paying their bills to Hydrocarbure; the latter, in turn, is unable to make
timely payments to customs. The problem of the delay in collecting the
revenues for the Road Fund and how to remedy it is being studied by the
Government and was discussed during negotiations. To ensure that the
Government will be able to finance an increasing share of the wages of
temporary local staff engaged in maintenance and improvement operations,
during negotiations the Government agreed to set up an advance account in the
Treasury of the Comoros to serve as a revolving fund. It also agreed to
replenish the account at the beginning of each quarter in amounts sufficient
to cover its share of the aforementioned wages for that quarter (para. 3.17).
Revenues for this account are expected to come from the Road Fund. A condition
of credit effectiveness will be that the Government make an initial payment of
CFlO.0 million (US$40,000 equivalent) into the advance account.
2.17      The ultimate, long-term objective is to enable the Government to
carry the full cost of road maintenance using its own resources. With this
objective in mind, the Association has suggested that the Government, as a
first step, gradually increase Road Fund revenue over the next few years so
that by FY1984 (the end of the proposed project) enough revenue would be
generated to finance the entire local personnel cost of road maintenance and
improvement (Table 3.3). In July 1981, the Government (i) increased the tax
on gasoline from CF 10 to CF 13/liter and (ii) introduced a new tax of CF
5/liter on diesel oil for automotive use, to be increased to CF 10/liter in
January 1982 and to CF 15/liter in January 1983. As a result of these
measures, the Road Fund should have accumulated CF 407 million by June 1984
based on estimated gasoline and (automotive) diesel oil consumption and
assuming no delay in collection (Table 2.5).

G. Engineering
2.18      The Public Works Department-s Studies, Program and Control Section
is responsible for the initiation and execution of feasibility and detailed
engineering studies and carries out preliminary investigations for minor road
and bridge design. A laboratory for soils and materials testing, established
under the First Highway Project, will assist MEE in performing these func-
tions. Feasibility and engineering studies for larger projects exceed the
section's capacity and are therefore carried out by foreign consultants.
There are no domestic consulting firms.
2.19      Engineering standards follow French design practices and take
into account traffic volume, maximum axle load (8 t), topographic conditions,
available construction materials and safety requirements (Annex 1, Table 3).
Alignments of improved roads generally follow existing tracks to minimize
earthworks and to take advantage of existing drainage structures. Due to the



- 13 -
rugged topography, curves are sharp and 10 curves per km are frequent, slopes
are as steep as 10% on paved roads and considerably steeper on earth and
gravel roads. The width of earth roads generally is less than 3.0 m, while
the width of gravel and paved roads ranges from 3.5 m for older to 5.5 m for
newer roads. Paved surfaces consist of a double bituminous treatment on a
10-15 cm granular base. Retaining walls are mostly masonry work, bridges, all
of which are short spans, are designed in concrete.
H. Construction
2.20      Road construction in the Comoros is difficult and expensive.  The
terrain is rugged with steep gradients, the problem is compounded by adverse
soil conditions and torrential rains. In addition, mobilization costs are
high relative to the small size of the works. Nearly all equipment, materials
and staff (except for unskilled labor) must be imported.
2.21      For major road projects, MEE employs foreign contractors following
suitable prequalification and tendering procedures. There are no domestic
road contractors, but two foreign contractors with headquarters in Madagascar
and France are established in the Comoros. Equipment can be imported duty-
free on a temporary basis, and remittances abroad by contractors are not
restricted. Supervision of works is carried out by the Public Works Depart-
ment with the assistance of consultants.
I. Road Maintenance and Improvement
2.22      The ongoing First Highway Project is providing part of the necessary
assistance to resurrect road maintenance operations which had collapsed
completely when France withdrew its experts and other aid at independence.
The Public Works Department has been set up and given responsibility for the
maintenance of all roads through its three regional departments (para. 2.09).
Technical experts financed under the first project have helped re-establish
maintenance procedures and operations and are providing executive support for
carrying out a three-year road maintenance program and are training local
staff. Comorian staff have gained the basic skills required and have since
taken over most positions which had been filled by technical assistance
experts (para. 2.12). Field work was initially carried out by one mechanized
unit for improving earth roads to gravel standard, routine maintenance gangs
and one resealing and two patching units for paved roads. Equipment for
these units, financed by the Government, IDA, EDF, Kuwait Fund and OPEC,
arrived late and full-scale operations did not get under way until September
1980. The units were supposed to be shared among the three islands as
needed, but the Government has decided to assign an improvement unit and a
patching/resealing unit to each island. This arrangement is reasonable for
the routine maintenance gangs and patching crews since these activities need
to be carried out concurrently on all three islands. However, given the low
volume of improvement works to be performed on Moheli, this island will be



- 14 -
assi.gned a lighter unit for road improvement and resealing works under the
proposed project than the units stationed on Grande Comore and Anjouan for
this type of work (paras. 3.05-3.06).
2.23      The first project also provided for the construction and equipping
of a workshop on each island for equipment maintenance and repair with some
training for Comorian staff. The proposed project will provide technical
assistance experts to help complete the training of workshop staff and to
assist in carrying out repairs. Improvement of a roads laboratory and instal-
lation of equipment were satisfactorily completed under the project. FAC will
provide a soils engineer for three years. FAC has also been requested to
finance (a) fellowships for three engineers and (b) vehicles and additional
testing equipment. Two laboratory technicians have already received training
abroad but more trained laboratory personnel is required (para. 3.10).
2.24      Road maintenance and improvement in the Comoros are carried out by
equipment-intensive methods. When the First Highway Project began, there was
little choice but to employ equipment-intensive methods since the country
lacked the managerial, organizational, staffing and technical capabilities
that are required for labor-intensive techniques. With the experience gained
under the ongoing project and the skills acquired by the Comorians engaged in
maintenance and improvement works, it is an appropriate time to begin consider-
ing the possibility of phasing in labor-intensive techniques.
2.25      During appraisal of the proposed project the introduction of
labor-intensive techniques in road maintenance and improvement was discussed
with the Government. While the Government is indeed concerned about the
growing unemployment and under-employment in the Comoros and recognizes that
introduction of labor-intensive techniques is one way to help alleviate this
problem, it believes that it would be premature to introduce them at present.
The recently acquired road maintenance and improvement equipment (with some
additional supplementary equipment) is sufficient to do the work over the
next few years. Moreover, introduction of labor-intensive techniques at this
stage would unduly strain the still limited managerial and administrative
capacity of MEE and thereby jeopardize the progress made over the last two
years. The Government indicated that inclusion of a substantive labor-
intensive component in a future Third Highway Project (1984/5-1986/7) would
be more appropriate and that in preparation thereof, the issues involved
should be studied and an action program formulated in the course of the
proposed project (para. 3.11).
J. Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
2,26      The Bank Group began lending operations in the Comoros with the
ongoing First Highway Project (Credit 852-COM, US$5 million) which became
effective January 29, 1979. The project's objectives were (i) to re-establish
road maintenance organization and procedures, (ii) to implement a three-year
road improvement and maintenance program, and (iii) to improve the existing
road network to reduce transport costs, halt deterioration and increase



- 15 -
accessibility to isolated areas. The project included (i) construction of
20.4 km of road and reconstruction of 700 m of main road on Anjouan, (ii)
establishment and operation of maintenance and improvement units, (iii)
improvement of three workshops and establishment of a soils laboratory,
procurement of equipment, and on-the-job and overseas training of personnel,
and (iv) feasibility and engineering studies.
2.27      In order to carry out the project effectively and to cope with
increasing road improvement and maintenance demands, the Government reorga-
nized its public works administration in May 1979. The new organization
is working reasonably satisfactorily (para. 2.10). The road construction
and reconstruction components have been completed. The Government set up
maintenance and improvement units which are operating satisfactorily. While
the patching units have covered the entire network, the resealing and improve-
ment units will be able to meet only about 30% and 70% of their targets,
respectively, due to delayed procurement of equipment. This delay was due
to the Government's unfamiliarity with the Bank Group's procurement procedures
and the time needed by technical assistance staff to start effective opera-
tions. All workshop and laboratory facilities have been set up and equipment
delivered. About 150 staff at different levels have been trained. A feasi-
bility study for construction to paved standard of a 20-km road section on
Moheli, which was to be carried out under the project, showed a rate of
return of only 6%. Detailed engineering for this road section was therefore
deleted from the project.
2.28      Owing to the Government's budgetary constraints during the initial
phase of the First Highway Project, it proved impossible for MEE to pay the
wages of temporary labor attached to the four maintenance and improvement
units that were being established at the time. In order to permit operations
to start as scheduled, the Government and the Association later agreed to
finance such wages under the project at a decreasing annual rate (100% in
1980, 75% in 1981 and 50% in 1982). Under the proposed project the Associa-
tion will continue to assist the Government in financing these wages (para.
3.17).
2.29      A second unforeseen claim on IDA funds under the project arose from
the fact that the Kuwait Fund did not provide the considerable technical
assistance input (three mechanics for three years each) that had been expected.
As a result, the cost of this assistance was fully financed by the IDA Credit.
Because of these two additional claims plus an increase in the cost of the
workshops over the original cost estimate, project funds were largely exhausted
by the end of June 1981. Since by then about two thirds of the three-year
program had been implemented, the remaining one third will be absorbed by the
proposed project.
2.30      Given the crisis conditions at the time the First Project was
launched and despite the problems encountered during its implementation, the
project's overall accomplishments to date are significant. A maintenance
organization was created where none existed before and road maintenance and
improvement activities, discontinued since 1975, got underway. In addition,
and perhaps more important in the long-term development perspective of the
Comoros, the First Project has succeeded in laying a proper foundation for
effective, future maintenance and improvement of the road network.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The proposed project is aimed at continuing, consolidating and
extending the effort started under the First Highway Project to strengthen
the Government's road maintenance and improvement operations. Its objectives
are: (a) to continue improving the condition of the existing road network to
reduce transport costs and increase accessibility to isolated areas and to
prevent a relapse to the situation following independence and before the first
project; and (b) to continue increasing the road maintenance capability of the
MEE through on-the-job and formal training of local road maintenance personnel
at all levels and executive assistance from technical assistance experts.
B. Project Description
3.02      The proposed project consists of:
(a) a three-year program for (i) the improvement of about 186 km of
earth roads to all-weather gravel standard, (ii) the resealing of
about 240 km of paved roads and (iii) the routine maintenance
of the gravel roads in (i) above and the gravel roads constructed
under the First Highway Project, and regular patching of the entire
paved road network;
(b) technical assistance to help the Government execute the project and
train local staff,
(c) fellowships for overseas training of local staff; and
(d) a study on the use of labor-intensive techniques.
3.03      To these ends, the project will assist in financing the following;
(a)  purchase of additional road construction and maintenance equipment
and spare parts;
(b) purchase of materials and supplies including cement, fuel and
lubricants,
(c) wages of local staff engaged in road improvement and incremental
road maintenance,
(d) technical assistance,
(e) fellowships, and
(f) a study.



- 17 -
Three-year Program to Strengthen Road Improvement and Maintenance Operations
3.04      The proposed project covers a three-year road improvement and
maintenance program (mid-1981 to mid-1984). The program includes (a) the
improvement of 186 km of earth roads to all-weather gravel standard, (b) the
resealing of 240 km of paved roads, and (c) the routine maintenance of the
gravel roads in (a) and those constructed under the First Highway Project,
and the regular patching of the entire paved road network. This program
(Annex I, Tables 4 and 5) was agreed upon with the Government at negotiations.
It was also agreed that during project implementation the Government will
submit for the Association's review and approval three months before the
beginning of each fiscal year (i) an updated annual road improvement and
maintenance program, including an economic justification of the proposed road
improvements, and (ii) the proposed corresponding budget allocation.
3.05      The proposed improvement works on the earth roads will include
(a) reshaping with or without roadbed widening, (b) gravelling and (c) build-
ing, repairing and reinforcing drainage structures. The roads to be upgraded
to gravel standard are listed in Annex 1, Table 4. Two road improvement units
will be needed to carry out this work; one will be assigned to Grande Comore
and the other to Anjouan. A lighter unit for both road improvement and
resealing works will be assigned to Moheli. Maintenance will include reshaping,
filling potholes, removal of pronounced corrugations, and clearing ditches,
drains and drainage structures. Three maintenance units, one for each
island, will carry out routine maintenance of the entire gravel road net-
work. The composition of the units (Annex I, Table 6) and the design standards
for the improved gravel roads (Annex I, Table 3) were agreed upon at negotiations.
3.06      The proposed works on paved roads will consist of resealing, filling
potholes, repairing pavement edges, surface sections and reconstruction of
shoulders, and, where critical, minor improvement of the alignment and widening
of the pavement. In line with a six-year resealing cycle, about 240 km of
paved roads are also expected to be resealed during the project period.
Annex 1, Table 5 identifies the roads selected for resealing. To carry out
this work, the following units will be needed; (a) two resealing units, one
assigned to Grande Comore and one to Anjouan, (b) three patching units, one
for each island, (c) two shoulder reconstruction units, one assigned to Grande
Comore and one to Anjouan; and (d) five drainage units whose main function
will be to line ditches with stone masonry and to build and improve culverts,
two of these units will be assigned to Grande Comore, two to Anjouan and one
to Moheli. In addition, Moheli will be assigned a lighter unit (para. 3.05)
for both road improvement and resealing works. The type, number and composi-
tion of the patching and resealing units, also detailed in Annex 1, Table 6,
was agreed upon at negotiations.
3.07      It was originally intended that improvement and patching/resealing
units set up under the First Highway Project could be shared among the three
islands as needed. Also, since that was the Bank Group's first highway
involvement in the Comoros, the exact equipment needs were not known. The



- 18 -
experience so far has shown that at least two improvement units, two resealing
units and three patching units are needed. The composition of the existing
units will be modified in some cases to reflect experience to date. The
composition of the proposed units is shown in Annex 1, Table 5. The proposed
project will provide the additional equipment needed to modify the units'
composition. The list of equipment to be procured (Annex 1, Table 7) was
agreed upon with the Government at negotiations.
3.08      The proposed project will also finance the purchase of materials
(fuel, lubricants, spare parts, bitumen, cement, steel, gravel and wood) as
well as salaries and wages of local personnel. Annex 1, Table 8 gives a list
of materials and supplies to be procured.
Technical Assistance
3.09      While the First Highway Project has trained Comorian staff,
continued technical assistance, though on a considerably reduced scale 1/,
will be required to properly organize and implement road improvement and
maintenance operations. The proposed project provides 186 man-months of
technical assistance to aid the Government in continuing to build MEE's road
improvement and maintenance capacity including on-the-job training of local
staff. The technical assistance will comprise the following personnel;
(i)  a highway engineer (for three years) to head the
consultants' team and to assist the MEE in plan-
ning, coordinating and implementing the road
improvement and maintenance program and in train-
ing local staff in these areas;
(ii) three assistant workshop managers (for three years
each) to assist the workshop managers in organizing
and supervising the maintenance and repair of equip-
ment and in training workshop staff,
(iii) a mechanical engineer (for a total of six months) for
short term advisory services to the consultants' team
leader; and
(iv) two road foremen (for 18 months each) to be attached
to the road improvement units to help organize and
execute road improvement works, they will also be
available to aid the paved road units if needed.
Technical assistance personnel will devote about half their time to formal and
on-the-job training of local staff. The latter will include continued training
for about 10 road engineers and technicians, 30 road foremen and 100 mechanics
and equipment operators. The experts' outline terms of reference, required
qualifications and schedule of assignment was agreed upon with the Government
at negotiations (Annex 2).
1/   The First Highway Project financed 320 man-months of technical assistance.



- 19 -
Fellowships
3.10      To complement the on-the-job training provided by the technical
assistance personnel (para. 3.09), the project provides 60 months of fellowships
for overseas training of key local staff as follows:
(i)  three foremen of mechanized road maintenance units
(for seven months each);
(ii) three assistant workshop managers (for seven months
each);
(iii)  three surveyors for MEE's Program and Control Section
(for three months each); and
(iv) three laboratory technicians (for three months each).
Study
3.11      The project provides for consultants services (6 man-months) to
undertake a study on labor-intensive techniques in road maintenance and
improvement (para. 2.25). This study will identify the options, estimate
their financial and employment implications, and recommend a program for
implementation in the subsequent highway project (Highways III). The Associa-
tion will aid the Government in the preparation of the terms of reference and
the supervision of the study. During negotiations the foregoing was discussed
and the Government agreed to engage consultants to undertake the study by
September 30, 1982, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.
C. Cost Estimates
3.12      The total project cost including contingencies is estimated at
US$14.70 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$11.80 million or
80% of total project costs. Excluding taxes and duties (US$1.20 million),
the total cost is US$13.50 million. The base cost figures refer to mid-1981,
the expected time of credit negotiations.

3.13      Cost estimates for equipment, spare parts, materials and supplies
are based on recent bid prices and quotations in the Comoros. Operating costs
of equipment are based on experience of MEE's existing brigades. The cost of
wages and salaries reflect current Government scales.
3.14      The cost of technical assistance, assumed to be provided by a
foreign consulting firm, is estimated at US$12,500 per man-month including
salaries, overheads and profits, as well as reimbursable expenses payable to
consultants, i.e. housing, travel and local subsistence. These are in line
with recent experience in the Comoros.
3.15      The cost of fellowships is based on the current cost of overseas
training in Europe and includes tuition, subsistence, travel and insurance.
3.16      A quantity contingency allowance of 10% for all project components
has been included in the cost estimates. Provision for future price increases
has been calculated using the following rates for all items:
Item                         1981         1982         1983        1984

D. Financing
3.17      The proposed IDA Credit of US$6.3 million plus parallel cofinancing
of US$5.8 million by the AfDF will finance 100% of the foreign cost and 17% of
the local cost of the project net of taxes. The Government will finance the
remaining local cost, which, excluding taxes of US$1.2 million, amounts to
US$1.4 million equivalent, or about 10% of total project cost. Specifically,
the Government will finance all salaries of permanent, local road maintenance
staff. In addition at negotiations the Government agreed to finance an
increasing percentage of total wages of temporary local road maintenance
labor during the project period: 25% in 1981, 50% in 1982, 75% in 1983 and
100% thereafter. AfDF will finance the procurement of new equipment, tires,
fuel, lubricants and bitumen.  IDA will finance the remaining operating
costs (spare parts, cement, steel, gravel and wood), technical assistance,
fellowships and a study. Table 3.2 presents the overall financing plan of
the proposed project, while Table 3.3 shows the financing of local personnel
by calendar year.

E. Implementation and Procurement
3.20       MEE, through its Public Works Department, will be responsible for
project execution including overall planning and budgeting for road improvement
and maintenance operations as well as for equipment maintenance and repair.
The technical assistance team under the project will assist the Public Works
Department in the execution of the project. The project will be implemented
as shown on the implementation schedule below. During negotiations the
Government agreed to this schedule.

3.21     Road improvement and maintenance works.  As under the first project,
this will be carried out by force account using mechanized units established
under that project and supplemented under the proposed project. The Public
Works Department will prepare the necessary work drawings and make engineering
surveys for the works to be executed; its laboratory will perform the site
investigations and soil and materials tests. Improvement, resealing and other
units, assigned to the three Regional Public Works Departments, will implement
the work program on the respective islands. The technical assistance team
will help execute and supervise the works and will ensure cost and quality
control and efficiency of the units. The Government has a core of personnel
trained under the First Highway Project and has agreed to assign additional



- 25 -
personnel, as required, to implement the road improvement and maintenance
program. Upon completion of the program under the project, the mechanized
units will continue their work in line with Government priorities.
3.22      Equipment (US$0.89 million) and tires, fuel, lubricants and bitumen
(US$3.80 million), under parallel financing by the AfDF, will be procured
under AfDF procedures. Spare parts (US$1.36 million) financed by the Assoocia-
tion will be procured through international competitive bidding; an exception
may be made for proprietary spare parts costing up to a total of US$500,000
which may be procured directly from original manufacturers or their agents.
Cement (US$0.42 million) financed by IDA will be procured through international
competitive bidding in line with Bank Group guidelines. The small amount of
steel (US$0.06 million), also financed by IDA, will be procured by limited
international tender in line with Bank Group guidelines. All items will be
bulked to the extent possible to make them attractive to international manu-
facturers and dealers. Some materials acquired locally (namely, gravel and
wood) together costing about US$500,000 can be procured under local competi-
tive bidding procedures acceptable to the Association. Lists of equipment and
material to be procured under the project are given in Annex 1, Tables 7 and
8. The Public Works Department, with the assistance of consultants under the
project, will be responsible for procurement. The above arrangements were
agreed upon with the Government during negotiations.
3.23      Technical Assistance.  The Government will select and employ
consultants for technical assistance on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Association. Consultants BCEOM's services under the First Highway
Project will be terminated by end of June 1981, but will probably continue
under the proposed project. The Government, however, has not yet decided.
Completion of technical assistance under the proposed project is expected by
mid-1984. The contract for consulting services will be awarded in accordance
with 1981 Bank Group Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.
3.24      Fellowships.  The Government agreed to submit to the Association
for its approval by March 31, 1982, a detailed program for the overseas
training of its local staff financed under the Project. This program will
include, inter-alia, the names of the candidates selected for overseas
training as well as their CVs; a description, timetable and cost of the
training; the training institutions; and an indication of the assignments of
the candidates upon return from overseas training.
3.25      Study.  The Government will select and employ consultants to
execute the study on labor-intensive techniques on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association.
F. Disbursements
3.26      The Credit Funds would be disbursed as follows:
(a)  75% of local wages for temporary road maintenance
personnel in 1981, 50% in 1982, 25% in 1983;



- 26 -
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures or 90% of local
expenditures for spare parts, cement, steel, gravel
and wood;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for technical assis-
tance and training; and
(d) 100% of total expenditures for fellowships.
Disbursements under (b), (c) and (d) will be fully documented. Disbursements
under (a) will be made against statements of expenditure certified by the
Director of Public Works and retained in the Project Unit for inspection by
the Association during supervision missions. An estimated schedule of dis-
bursement is given in Annex 1, Table 9; the Credit's closing date is June 30,
1985. The Government will open a special account in the Treasury of the
Comoros to finance those local expenditures to be reimbursed by the Asso-
ciation. The Association will make an initial deposit into the special
account of the Comorian franc equivalent of US$200,000. Arrangements for
the operation of the special account were agreed at negotiations.
G. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Requirements
3.27      Project accounts, including statements of expenditures, will be
maintained by the Public Works Department with separate accounts for each
component and will be availab'_ f'r inspecticn b- the Association during
project supervision missions. MEEs financial controller, assisted by French
technical assistance, has been responsible for maintaining project accounts
under the First Highway Project. This arrangement has worked satisfactorily
and will be continued under the proposed project. During negotiations, the
Government agreed that all project accounts will be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association and that the audited accounts together
with the auditor's report will be submitted to IDA not later than six months
after the end of each fiscal year during project implementation.
3.28      During negotiations, the Government and IDA agreed on progress
reporting requirements (Annex 3), which should include indices for measuring
implementation progress, and submission of a project completion report in a
form satisfactory to the Association not later than six months after the
closing date of the Credit.
H. Ecology
3.29      The project is not expected to have any detrimental impact on the
ecology. In fact, soil erosion on the improved roads during the rainy
season will be less than at present as drainage facilities will be provided.
Dust formation and its detrimental effect on surrounding vegetation along
the improved roads during the dry season will be lower as a result of an
adequate layer of gravel on the roads.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Introduction
4.01      In the absence of: railways and navigable waterways, an adequate
road network, which permits low cost and reliable transport of people and goods,
is a sine qua non for economic development. Agriculture, the mainstay of the
economy, is entirely dependent on roads for transport of inputs and outputs.
Furthermore, access by the largely rural population to educational, medical
and administrative services would be critically hampered without an adequate
road network.
4.02      Because of the deterioration of the roads and the collapse of the
road maintenance organization after independence, the First Highway Project
concentrated on maintenance and imprqvement of the road network and building
up a maintenance organLzatjon. The proposed Second Highway Project will
continue the effort started in the first project with the same focus on
improving and maintaining the road network and building up a Comorian road
maintenance capability.
B. Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.03      The improvement of earth roads to gravel standard will enable year-
round travel on these roals, ii_prove the reliability of service, and result in
a reduction in transport costs which is passed on to the rural population in
the form of lower transport rates (para. 2.07). All three factors--increased
accessibility, improved reliability and lower transport costs--will stimulate
agricultural productior and provide improved access to health and educational
facilities and other Government services, thus raising the standard of living
of the rural populrition, In addition, with the upgrading of the earth roads
to gravel standare and r uDisequent routine and periodic maintenance, the cost
of annually 'reopning" tlue earth roads after the rainy season will be
avoided.
4.04      The p;itching and resealing of the main (paved) road network will
prevent the deterioration of these roads. As a result, an increase in vehicle
operating cost;s will be avo:ided and costly road reconstruction postponed.
Moreover, proper patching and resealing should not only prevent an increase in
vehicle operating (,sts but also improve driving conditions and reduce vehicle
operating cost:3 bXoJw, presiznt levels.  The benefits of the patching and
resealing acti'uit es are e:Kpected to accrue ultimately to the population at
large, both pr3duicers and consumers, given the adjustment of transport charges
tr improved road conditions.
4.05      The intititut:'on-bu-ildtng component of the project represents a
major benefit, even if not quantified (para. 2.09).  It wtll continue to help
improve road maintenance thereby reducing the waste of resources which results
from inadequate zaintenanc;e and high transport costs.

C. Economic Analysis
4.06      Costs and benefits have been calculated for (a) the improvement of
62 km of typical earth roads to gravel standard annually over a six-year
period and their subsequent maintenance and (b) the resealing of 80 km of
typical paved roads annually over a six-year period and the regular patching
of the paved road network. The overall rate of retuin of these two components
is 17% and the benefit/cost ratio is 1.3:1 assuming a. 10% cost of capital in
the Comoros.
Road Improvement Units
4.07      This project component accounts for 27% of tot:al project costs.
The cost/benefit analysis, including the detailed assumptions underlying the
calculation, is presented in Annex 1, Table 10.  The cos:s include (i) the
(replacement) cost at the beginning of the proiect period of the equipment
already in the Comoros (which recently arrived) plus the costs of some addi-
tional, complementary equipment to be financed under the project; (ii) the
operating costs of all equipment of the road improvemLent units during the
six-year life of the equipment (including fuel, lubri.cants, spare parts,
material, and local personnel); (iii) the cost of sul,sequent routine mainte-
nance of the gravel roads during the ten-year life oi the roads; (iv) the
cost of regravelling after five years; and (v) the ccjst of technical assis-
tance directly attributable to the operation of the road improvement units.
The benefits include:  (i) the avoided cost of annualAy "reopening" the earth
roads after the rainy season; and (ii) the vehicle op,rrating cost savings
(Annex 1, Table 11) estimated at US 40 cents per vehicle km, resulting from
upgrading the earth roads to gravel standard and takir.g into account a base
year traffic of 30 vehicles per day and an annual traf fic growth rate of 12%.
The estimated base year traffic of 30 vehicles per day consists of 15 vehicles
"normal" traffic reflecting the actual traffic volume at present observed on
typical earth roads plus an estimated 15 vehicles of "generated" traffic as a
result of increased agricultural production following r:oad improvement.
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the generated t:raffic estimate the
sensitivity analysis (para 4.09) considers the impact of exciuding 50% of the
generated traffic benefits from the economic analysis.  The ilnternal rate of
return of the improvement works, of which the economie Life. spans a 16-year
period, is 18% and the benefit/cost ratio is 1.3:1 aasumLng a 10% cost of
capital in the Comoros.
4.08      In addition to the economic analysis of thte entire roa,i improvement
program in terms of upgrading "typical" earth roads, referred to in para. 4.06
(a) above, a separate analysis has been undertaken of the roads i'o be upgraded
during the first year of the road improvement prograu . Annex 4 provides the
details.  The internal rates of return of t:he four roads involve&. range
between 25% and 41%.  Details of the analysis are sh,own in Anrex 4.

Patching and Resealing Units
4.09      This project component accounts for 60% of total project costs.
The cost/benefit analysis, including the detailed assumptions underlying the
calculation, is presented in Annex 1, Table 12. The costs include: (i) the
(replacement) cost at the beginning of the project period of the equipment
already in the Comoros (which recently arrived) plus the cost of some addi-
tional, complementary equipment, to be financed under the project; (ii) the
operating costs of all equipment of the patching and resealing units (including
fuel, lubricants, spare parts, material, and local personnel) during the
six-year life of the equipment; and (iii) the cost of technical assistance
directly attributable to the operation of the patching and resealing units.
The benefits include: (i) the avoided road maintenance cost, i.e. the
routine maintenance cost which would have been incurred in the absence of the
project (filling of potholes, cutting of grass, etc. by manual labor); and
(ii) the vehicle operating cost savings (see Annex 1, Table 11) which will
gradually increase from US 2 cents to US 14 cents per vehicle km during the
six years operation of the patching and resealing units (based on the
assumption that during that period, in the absence of the project, the roads
would slowly deteriorate to gravel standards), and gradually decline from US
14 cents per vehicle km to US 2 cents per vehicle km during the next six
years (based on the assumption that the roads would slowly deteriorate upon
the discontinuation of the patching and resealing operations). The rate of
return of resealing works, of which the economic life spans a 13-year period,
is 16% and the benefit/cost ratio is 1.2:1 assuming a 10% cost of capital in
the Comoros.
D. Sensitivity and Risks
Sensitivity
4.10      Road Improvement Units.  This component is not very sensitive to
reasonable changes in estimates of costs and benefits: reducing vehicle
operating cost savings by 15%, decreasing the benefits from generated traffic
by 50% or increasing the cost of equipment operation and routine maintenance
by 30% reduces the rate of return from 18% to 13%.
4.11      Patching and Resealing Units.  This component is more sensitive to
quite possible changes in estimated costs and benefits: reducing vehicle
operating cost savings by 15% reduces the rate of return from 16 to 11%.
Increasing equipment operating costs by 30% or assuming an annual rate of
traffic growth of 4% rather than 8% brings the return down to 10%.
Risks
4.12      Delays.  Implementation of the First Highway Project experienced
considerable delays not only because it was the first Bank Group project in
the highway sector but also because it was the first Bank Group project in the



- 30 -
Comoros. The Government and MEE--because of the First Highway Project--are
now in a better position to implement the proposed Second Highway Project
more efficiently. Implementation delays as experienced during the First
Highway Project are less likely to occur under the proposed project but
cannot be ruled out. Intensive supervision and constant monitoring of
progress under the proposed project are therefore imperative.
4.13      Local Financing.  Another problem encountered under the First
Highway Project was the Government's inability to provide the recurrent funds
to pay the wages of local temporary labor. Under the proposed Second Highway
Project, the Government is expected to finance 10% of total project costs
amounting to the salaries of all permanent maintenance staff plus an increasing
percentage of the wages of local temporary maintenance personnel (25% in 1981,
50% in 1982; 75% in 1983 and 100% thereafter).
4.14      Under the terms of the Credit Agreement of the proposed project the
Government will be obliged to provide the necessary recurrent funds while
during project implementation the Government's proposed budgetary allocations
for road maintenance will be discussed and agreed annually with the Asso-
ciation. Also, a Road Fund, of which the revenue is earmarked for road mainte-
nance, was established last year (para. 2.16) and the Government (i) increased
the fuel tax which generates the Road Fund revenue (para. 2.17) and (ii)
intends to speed up the tax collection process (para. 2.16). The estimated
potential Road Fund revenue available during the project period (Table 2.5)
will be more than adequate to cover the Government's financial contribution
to the project. Finally as a condition of credit effectiveness the Government
will establish an advance account from which its contributions to the project
will be financed (para. 2.16).
4.15      Despite these efforts, a recurrence of the Government's inability
to provide the necessary local funds cannot be ruled out. Because of the
Government's persistent very tight financial position, it may not be in a
position to allocate the necessary funds from general revenue and it may
decide at any time to revoke the earmarking of the Road Fund revenue and use
the money for other purposes. Also, the Road Fund tax collection may not
improve or may even deteriorate resulting in insufficient funds from that
source.
4.16      During implementation of the project, the Government's financial
contribution to the project should be given continued and careful attention to
avoid recurrence of the problem encountered under the first project. If,
nevertheless, the problem should arise again, remedial actions should promptly
be formulated and agreed upon with the Government to avoid any interruption in
project implementation. The proposed project is worthwhile in spite of these
risks.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During negotiations the following items were discussed and agreed
upon:



- 31 -
(a) the Government will consult with the Association before
undertaking any other project in the highway subsector
(para. 1.12);
(b) the Government will establish and thereafter make
quarterly payments into an advance account to cover its
share of local wages for road maintenance (para. 2.16),
(c) a three-year (mid-1981 to mid-1984) road improvement and
maintenance program, and submission to the Association for
its review and approval at least three months before the
beginning of each fiscal year of (i) an updated, annual
road improvement and maintenance program, including an
economic justification of the proposed road improvements,
and (ii) the proposed corresponding budget (para. 3.04);
(d) the composition of the two road improvements units
and the design standards for the improved gravel roads
(para. 3.05),
(e) the type, number and composition of the patching and
resealing units (para. 3.06),
(f) a list of road maintenance equipment to be procured
(para. 3.07),
(g) outline terms of reference, required qualifications
and schedule of assignment of technical assistance
experts (paras. 3.09 and 3.23);
(h) appointment of consultants to conduct a study on labor-
intensive methods in road maintenance and improvement
by September 30, 1982, on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Association (para. 3.11);
(i) the Government's financing of an increasing percentage
of total wages of temporary, local road maintenance labor
during the project period: 25% in 1981, 50% in 1982, 75%
in 1983 and 100% thereafter (para. 3.17);
(j) arrangements for the procurement of equipment, supplies
and material (para. 3.22),
(k) submission of a detailed overseas training program to
the Association for its review and approval by March
31, 1982 (para. 3.24);
(1) an audit of all project accounts by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association and submission of the audited
accounts together with the auditors- report to the Association
not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year
(para. 3.27), and



- 32 -
(m) an implementation schedule, a progress reporting system
and preparation of a project completion report (paras.
3.20 and 3.28).
5.02      The following will be conditions of effectiveness of the proposed
Credit:
(a) an initial payment of CF 10.0 million (US$40,000
equivalent) into the advance account (para. 2.16);
(b) notification by AfDF that all conditions precedent to
the disbursement of the AfDF loan, except for the
effectiveness of the IDA Credit, have been fulfilled
(para. 3.18); and
(c) establishment of a special account in the Treasury of the
Comoros to be used to pay local expenditures financed by
the Association (para. 3.26).
5.03      Agreement having been reached on the items listed in para. 5.01,
the proposed project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$6.3 million to the
Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros on standard terms.

SECOND HIGHWAY (MAINTENANCE) PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Outline Terms of Reference for
Technical Assistance for Three-Year Road Improvement
and Maintenance Program
I.        Objectives
1.01      The purposes of the consulting services are (i) to provide technical
assistance to the Ministry of Equipment and the Environment in (a) planning
and implementing the three-year road improvement and maintenance program
including procuring and handling of equipment and materials. For the imple-
mentation of the work program, the consultants will be required to (i) assist
the local managers of the three regional workshops in organizing and carrying
out the maintenance and repair of equipment and vehicles; (ii) assist the
local foremen of road maintenance and improvement units in organizing and
carrying out road maintenance and improvement operations; and (iii) train
existing staff, including tech]icians, workshop manaGers, mechanics, equipment
operators and drivers, and new staff required for the three-year program.
II.       Scope of Consulting Services
Technical assistance will be provided by a consultant's team of
experts who will act as advisers and trainers to their Comorian counterparts.
The consultant's team will comprise the following personnel:
-  a highway engineer, (team leader)                       36 months
-  three assistant workshop managers (36 months each)  108 months
-  a mechanical engineer                                    6 months
-  two road foremen (18 months each)                       36 months
TOTAL                186 months
The highway engineer will represent the consultant in dealings
with the Government.
The experts will be expected to devote about half their time to
formal and on-the-job training of local staff and will, therefore, need
to have adequate skills and sufficient experience in training. They must
also be fluent in French. Each expert will live on the island to which
he is assigned. Travel on the assigned island and inter-island travel will
be requested by all experts.

SECOND HIGHWAY (MAINTENANCE) PROJECT
STAFF APRAISAL REPORT
Economic Evaluation of Individual Roads
to be Improved during the First Year of the Project
1.        This Annex provides the economic evaluation of the four earth roads
to be upgraded to all-weather gravel standard and included in the first year of
the road improvement program (Annex 1, Table 4). These roads are:
Grande Comore:
RR 128, Ivembeni-N'Tsoundjini, (33 km)
Anjouan:
RR 203, Bambao-Jimilime, (19 km) and
RN 23, Moya-M'Remani, (17 km)
Moheli:
RN 32, Miringoni-Nioumachoua, (20 km)
2.        On the cost side, the economic evaluation takes into account the cost
of upgrading the earth roads to gravel standard, the cost of subsequent routine
maintenance and the cost of regravelling after five years. On the benefit
side, it considers for the first three roads -- because of the paucity of data
-- only the vehicle operating cost savings of normal traffic growing at 12% per
year and avoided routine maintenance costs (i.e the cost of reopening the earth
roads annually after the rainy season); for the Miringoni-Nioumachoua road - on
which there is virtually no traffic at present because of its very poor condi-
tion - it considers only the net value of the incremental agricultural
production which is expected to result from the upgrading of the road to all-
weather standard. Other possible benefits, such as increased access to health
and educational facilities, have not been taken into account. The life of the
upgraded roads is assumed to be 10 years.
3.        The cost data are based on detailed estimates of the work and inputs
involved and thus should be fairly accurate. The estimates of the benefits, on
the other hand, are less accurate because they are based on interviews with
knowledgeable staff of the Ministry of Equipment and the Environment and the
Ministry of Agriculture, supplemented with the appraisal mission's own
impressions. Because of the uncertainty involved, the estimate of the
benefits are somewhat conservative . Moreover, the sensitivity analysis, to
reflect the uncertainty of the benefit estimates, considers the impact on the
rate of return of a 15% reduction in vehicles operating cost savings for the
first three roads and of a 30% reduction in the net value of the incremental
agricultural production in the case of the Miringoni-Nioumachoua road.

4.        The following table summarizes the results of the economic
evaluation:
Roads                           IRR (%)      Sensivitity Analysis: IRR (%)
Benefits -15%
1.  Ivembeni-N'Tsoundjini         25                    19
2.  Bambao-Jimilime               41                    32
3.  Moya-M'Remani                 34                    27
Benefits -30%
4.  Miringoni-Nioumachoua         37                    19
The internal rates of return of the four roads range from 25% to 41%; the
sensitivity analysis indicates that, even with the reduction in benefits
specified in the previous paragraph, each of the roads remains economically
justified.
5.        Ivembeni-N'Tsoundjini.  This road is located in the southern part of
Grande Comore and links the east and west coasts of the island. The daily
traffic is estimated at 30 vehicles of which 15 are light vehicles and 15
heavier vehicles (Annex 1, Table 11).
6.        Upgrading the present track to all-weather gravel standard would no
doubt increase agricultural production - mainly maize - in the area. Because
of the scarcity of data, however, no estimate has been made of the possible
increase in agricultural production which will be attributable to the road
improvement.
7.        The internal rate of return of this road is 25%.  A reduction of 15%
in the benefits would reduce the IRR to 19%. For details see Annex 4, Table 1.
8.        Bambao-Jimilime.  This road is located along the northeastern coast
of Anjouan and is Jimilime's only connection with the rest of the island.
Daily traffic on this road is estimated at some 45 vehicles of which 25 light
vehicles and 20 heavier vehicles (Annex 1, Table 11).
9.        Upgrading this track to all-weather standards would stimulate
agricultural production. Present production in the area mainly consists of
cloves (200 ton/year) and food products. Because of the lack of more detailed
information, however, no attempt has been made to quantify the impact of the
road improvement in terms of the net value of the incremental agricultural
production.
10.       The internal rate of return of this road is 41%.  A 15% reduction in
the estimated benefits would lower the IRR to 32% which is still satisfactory.
For details see Annex 4, Table 2.



Annex 4
Page 3 of 4
11.       Moya-M'Remani.  This road is located in the southeastern part of
Moheli and forms part of the coastal road. Daily traffic is estimated at 40
vehicles a day equally divided between light and heavier vehicles (Annex 1,
Table 11).
12.       Agricultural production in the area mainly consists of cloves, copra
and vanilla; upgrading of the road is expected to stimulate the productionof
all three commodities. However, again because of the limited data, no estimate
has been attempted of the net value of the incremental agricultural production
resulting from the road improvement.
13.       The internal rate of return of this road is 34%.  A decrease in esti-
mated benefits of 15% would reduce the IRR to 27% which is still acceptable.
Annex 4, Table 3 provides details of the computation.
14.       Miringoni-Nioumachoua.  This road is located along the southern coast
of Moheli and forms part of the island's coastal road. Its present condition
is so bad that there is virtually no traffic using it.
15        The zone of influence of this road comprises one of the most fertile
agricultural areas on Moheli. However, due to a lack of data, only coconut
production can be quantified with any degree of accuracy. Aerial surveys taken
in 1970 for a study of the coconut sector indicate that there are approximately
212,000 palms in the Nioumachoua sector of Moheli which extends from Sambia to
just beyond Miringoni. About 70% of these, or 148,000 palms, would be between
Miringoni and Nioumachoua.
16.       A coconut tree produces an average 48 nuts a year.  Surveys indicate
that about 35% of these, or 17 nuts per tree, are lost due to rodent
damage 1/.Per capita consumption of nuts on Moheli is estimated at 181. Of
the 4,580,000 nuts produced in this area (148,000 x 31), about 540,000 (181 x
3,000 (population)) are consumed by the local population. The remainder,
4,040,000, is transformed into copra.
17.       Approximately 5.5 nuts are equivalent to 1 kg of copra so that
4,040,000 nuts equals 735,000 kg or 735 tons of copra. About 25% of this
amount, on 184 tons, is presently lost through spoilage due to the inaccessi-
bility of the area. If the area were more accessible, wastage would be reduced
dramatically. In addition, the area's inaccessibility makes it logistically
impossible for the Government to extend the rodent control component of the
IDA-financed Coconut Rehabilitation and Rodent Control Project to this zone.
18.       The principal quantifiable benefts of an all-weather road would be:
(a) the Government would be able to extend its rodent control program to the
area under question, thereby saving about 2,516,000 nuts (17 x 148,000 palms)
or 457 tons of copra per year and (b) wastage would be reduced thereby saving
an additional 184 tons of copra per year.
1/ Or 17 x 148,000 palms = 2,516,000 nuts for the area in question.

Annex 4
Page 4 of 4
19.       An all-weather road could be responsible for increasing production by
approximately 641 tons of copra/year with a current value of around US$270,000
f.o.b. Comoros. Allowing for collection, transport and other costs the
incremental copra production to be ascribed to the road has conservatively been
valued at 60% of the f.o.b. value or US$160,000 per year. This is assumed to
remain constant over the 10-year period of the life of the road.
20.       The internal rate of return of this road is 37%.  A 30% reduction in
benefits would lower the IRR to 19% which is still an acceptable rate of
return.  Annex 4, Table 4 provides details on the calculations.
