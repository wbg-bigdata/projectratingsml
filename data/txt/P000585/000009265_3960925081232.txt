PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF COMOROS
SICOND HIGHWAY (MAINTENANCE) PROJECT
(CREDIT 1188-COMI
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Highway
(Maintenance) Project in the Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros for which
Credit 1188-COM in the amount of SDR 5.6 million wa approved on
November 1981. The credit was closed on June 30, 1987, with a delay of two
years. It was fully disbursed. The date of the fiaal disbursement was
August 17, 1987.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of
the South Central and Indian Ocean Department of the Africa Region
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). On December 18, 1989, the
Bank sent Parts I and III to the Ministry of Planning, Equipment,
Environment, Urbanism and Housing with the request to prepare Part II by
February 15, 1990, but no reply was received.
This PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Credit, Guarantee, and Project Agreements, results of financial audits
prepared by auditors approved by IDA, a report prepared by consultants at
the end of the project containing pertinent material on the project's
course, correspondence between IDA and the Borrower, and internal IDA
memoranda.

SECOND HIGHWAY (MAINTENANCE) PROJECT
(CREDIT 1188-COM)
EVALUATION SUHMARY
Obiectives
1.   The project was conceived as a further effort to pursue the
objectives of the First Highway Project, to continue the consolidation and
extension of the effort started under the same, and to strengthen the
Government's road maintenance and rehabilitation operations.
The project served the following specific objectives of the highway
subsector.
a.   To adequately maintain the existing highway network, to Improve
the level of service the network provides and reduce transport
costs to road users.
b.   To develop a highway organization capable of managing the sector
inclusive of planning, coordination, and the maintenance of nie
network.
Co  To develop a training program to meet the staffing needs of
highway management.
A.   To establish suitable procedures for collecting revenues from
road users to meet subsector needs.
e.   To selectively upgrade and expand the road network when
economically justified and at times when the total scope of such
operations can be fitted into financial and management
capacities.
Prol ect Implementation
2.   The 4,ain variance between planned and actual project Implementation
consisted of a shift at mid-point in project execution from work by force
account to contracting, for betterment works. The reason for this shift
was the difficulty PWD had in keeping the project Implementation schedule.
The cause of this was PWD institutional weaknesses which though foreseen in
the SAR, were nevertheless underestimated as to their strength. To ease
the management burden on PWD, IDA recommended a shift from force account to
work by contract. This turned out to be beneficial in all respects,
quantity, quality and cost effectiveness terms. It was also beneficial for
the development of a local contracting industry.



- iiI_
The SAR Identified three project risks namely, institutional
weaknesses, the Government's ability to provide its financial share of the
project cost, and likely slippage i. project execution following these two
risks. With hindsight it now appears that they were underestimated during
appraisal.
Proiect Results
3.   The quality of the executed works was good. The road sections that
were rehabilitated and maintained resulted in much improvement In the level
of tervice provided by the road network to users. Only 71.61 of the volume
of maintenance and rehabilitation works foreseen in the SAR were executed.
For the levels and volumes of skill availability and the strength of
institutional weaknesses encountered these results are satisfactory.
Workers that did the maintenance work were in many cases those that were
trained undet the project. At later stages productivity went up.
Training aspects produced good results for operators and other
skilled maintenance workers. Some of the trainees subsequently left PhD,
and went over to work for private contractors. However, from the view
point of the national economy there was no loss of their skills.
The training for the professionals managers and other PWD
administrative staff was successful to a limited extent only. The reason
given for this by the consultants is the late appointment of the staff by
the government, and once appointed their availability for project related
work and training purposes only on an intermittent basis.
The institution building component of the project was not a success.
There is little left in place at project completion to Justify the effort
that was mounted on account of this particular project component.
Paradoxically this failure was also caused by the high degree of success
achieved in the project's private sector development component.
Proiect Sustainability
4.   The project is likely to maintain an acceptable level of net benefits
over a limited number of years due to the good auality of the work
performed which initially needs little follow up for it's sustenance.
However, beyond a three to four year period and through the end of its's
useful economic life, the project is not likely to maintain an acceptable
level of benefits unless it is continued on a 'more of the same" basis
under a third highway project.
Findinas and Lessons Learned
5.   The most important lesson from the project of applicability to other
future highway maintenance projects is the strategic dilemma on which way
to go when establishing the particular technical assistance, training and
actual execution mix the project is promoting, related assumptions on
borrower's financial and other abilities and on the rate of progress that
can realistically be expected from efforts at institution building from a
given starting point.



- iv -
Institution building under circumstances such as those prevailing in
the Comoros Is a long haul proposition requiring protracted and sustained
effort before any lasting results can be obtained. For projects with
important institution building components, there is a need for a
perspective over at least a ten year time horizon as to what level of
achievement at Institution building is being aimed at. The specific but
limited project objectives can then be formulated in the context of the
same, over the limited project time horizon. On this basis realistic
project mixes and related targets can be established.

SECOND HIGHWAY (MAINTENANCE) PROJECT
(CREDIT 1188-COM)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I
PROJECT REVIEW FROM IDA'S PERSPECTIVE
Introduction
1.          The Comoros Second Highway Maintenance Project was the second such
project financed by IDA in the transport sector and highway subsector. Its date
of effectiveness coincided with the completion date of the First Highway project.
The project was conceived in an effort to pursue further the objectives of the
First Highway Project, to continue the consolidation and extension of the effort
started under the same, and to strengthen the Government's road maintenance and
rehabilitation operations.
2.          Over the last years, the Government of the Comoros has and is
continuing to pursue the following two objectives in the transport sectors
a.    The upgrading and adequate maintenance of the  islands'
transport   infrastructure  to  help   rural  development,
agricultural production and serve all road users.
b.    The upgrading of port capacity to accommodate ocean going
vessels and avoid trans-shipment through neighboring countries.
The project served the first of the above objectives and the
following of the highway subsectors
a.    To adequately maintain the existing highway network, to improve
the level of service the network provides and reduce transport
costs to road users.
b.    To develop a highway organization capable of managing the
sector inclusive of planning, coordination, and the maintenance
of the network.
c.    To develop a training program to meet the staffing needs of
highway management.
d.    To establish suitable procedures for collecting revenues from
road users to meet subsector needs.
e.    To selectively upgrade and expand the road network when
economically justified and at times when the total scope of
such operations can be fitted into financial and management
capacities.



- 2 -
3.          The above objectives ace listed In order of priority.  They are
wholly consistent with and supportive of macroeconomic and agricultural sector
policies. The chief aim of the last is to encourage agricultural productiov
both in food produce and in the islands' staple exports.   As the project
concentrated on maintenance rather tb%n on investments to expand the network,
it was consistent with macroeconomic policy which aims at limiting investments
in the public sector to levels the economy needs and can afford.
Prolect Description
4.          The project comprised of the following componentst
a.    A three year program for the improvement of 186 kms of earth
roads, the sealing of about 240 kms of paved roads and routine
maintenance of the earth roads.
b.    Technical assistance to build a highway organization, offer
training and help the Government implement the proposed
psoject.
C.    Fellowships for overseas training of local staff.
d.    A study on the use of labor intensive techniques in  .ghway
maintenance.
Proiect Design and Organization
5.          The conceptual design of the project was clear to IDA. The project
followed the previous one, rather closely, and was not particularly innovative.
However, it was well-tailored to the highway needs of a small country of limited
opportunities and resources, such as the Comoros.
6.          The data in the files shows that a limited effort went into preparing
the project. IDA staff did most of the preparation work following a preparation
mission preceding appraisal.
7.          During appraisal, the Government provided the mission with as wuch
data as was available on traffic, vehicle operating costs, road inventory and
the agricultural sector, to appraise the project. However, given the rather
simple dimensions of the island's economy and its highway network, the absence
of detailed data wa not a constraint for appraisal purposes. The timing of the
Project would have bean carried out satisfactorily, had the Government taken the
steps required for its implementation, in a timely manner. The project clearly
defined the roles and responsibilities of the institutions and agencies
responsible for its implementation. They were understood fully by all parties.
Project design was entirely satisfactory at conceptual and planning levels.



-3-
Project Implementat_ion
8.          There were two noticeable variances between planmed and actual
project implementati'   >-e first was a shift at mid point in project execution
from work by force accouni. to contracting, for betterment works. The reason for
this shift was the difficulty PWD had in following the project Implementation
schedule. The cause of this was PWD'8 institutional weaknesses which although
foreseen in the SAR, were not seen as a major hurdle to project implementation.
To ease the management burden on PWD, IDA recoamended a shift from force account
to work by contract. This turned out to be beneficial in all respects - quantity,
quality and cost effeztiveness terms. It was also beneficial for the development
of a local contract:Lng industry.
9.          The second variance concerns total project cost measured in US$. In
the implementation process, the financial envelope for the project was reduced
by about 10X compared to the SAR estimate.  Despite this reduction, technical
assistance project share went up to nearly US$ three million and in relative
amounts from a planned 191 to about 301 of the reduced financial project
envelope. Only 701 of the works programed at SAR stage were executed. about
two thirds of the resulting un4t cost increases were absorbed by the price
contingency allowance in the project. The remaining third can be attributed to
the indirect cost of training the labor force which executed the project.
10.         The SAR  identified three prceect  risks namely,  institutional
weaknesses, the Government's ability to provide it's financial share of the
project cost, and likely slippage in project executiton following these two risks.
These risks were identical to those born in the First Highway Project. With
hindsight, it now appears that these risks were underestimated during appraisal.
The only action taken during project course that significantly effected the
outcome was the decision to shift to contracting of whose beneficial effects are
mentioned above.
Proiect Results
11.         Works Execution QualitX and Quantity Aspects.  The quality of the
executed works was good. The road sections that were rehabilitated and maintained
resulted in much Improvement in the level of service provided for by the road
network to users. Only 71.6b of the volume of maintenance and rehabilitation
works foreseen in the SAR were executed. Taking into account the levels sand
volumes of skill in availability and the institutional weaknesses encountered,
these results are satisfactory. Workers that did the maintenance work were in
many cases those who were trained under the project. At later stages productivity
went up.
12.         There were significant differences in the extent to which SAR targets
were achieved for the different line items.  For patching, pothole repairs,
surface treatment, and gravel road resurfacing, project targets were largely
exceeded. In all others, mostly related to routine maintenance activity, the
quantitative performance targets were not achieved. Examples which can be cited
are vegetation clearing, the maintenance of ditches and civil structures, and
carriageway rim repair. For a statement of quantitative project targets by line
item, and the degree to which they were achieved, see Note 1.



- 4 -
13.         The  record  of  physical  achievements  shows  new  gravel  road
construction, which does not appear in the agreed project scope. In the latter,
targets were also exceeded. This element was inserted into the program at project
start-up. It represented 4.72 of total physical works then programmed. Its
share in final quantities executed was 9.71
14.         Training.  Train!ng produced good results for operators and other
skilled maintenance workers.   It was successful for all types of training,
namely, classroom training, on the job training in the country and overseas
training. Some of the trainees subsequently left PWD, and went to work for
private contractors. This shift did not necessarily effect the national economy.
15.         The  training  for  the  professional  managers  and  other  PWD
administrative staff was successful to a limited extent. The reason given for
this by the consultants is the late appointment of the staff by the Government.
Additionally, once appointed their availability for project related work and
training purposes was only on an intermittent basis.
16.         Institution Building.  The institution building component of the
project was not a success. There is little left in place at project completion
to justify the effort undertaken for this particular project component.
Paradoxically, this failure was also caused by the high degree of success
achieved in the project's private sector development component.
17.         Economic Rates of Return. Data availability at project completion
stage is partial and in same cases, not sufficiently specific. Economic rates
of return were recalculated, making the best use of the data that is available.
When lacking specific data, broad coefficients representing project averages were
applied.
18.         The consultants who are working on the preparation of preparing a
future third highway project have found that vehicle operating costs, under
different highway conditions in the island, were underestimated. But for road
improvement components, the benefit differentials in absolute amounts were
overestimated by a ratio of two for improvements included in the project. For
routine maintenance patching and resealing the consultants confirm the
coefficients used in the SAR.
19.         Fuel consumption data collected by the consultants in a recent study
showed fuel consumption declined at an annual rate of 3.21 between 1983 and 1986.
Such data is a good indication for the overall traffic volume trend. The new
traffic count data that is available on project roads from the same data source
shows that in some cases traffic is substantially higher than SAR estimates and
in some cases substantially lower. In one particular case, where SAR showed
benefits on account of value of induced agricultural production alone, the
consultants counted some traffic which significantly boosted the ERIR of the
project component.
20.         Overall contingency costs were not built into SAR estimates.
Also, the cost of technical assistance was higher and the productivity of
maintenance teams was lower than assumed in the SAR.



- 5 -
21.         For detailed revised ERR's for individual project components,
riference is made to Part III. Traffic data and the amount of savings In vehicle
operating costs following improvements are the main factors contributing to
differences in SAR results for road improvement components.   For routine
maintenance patching and resealing ERR differences are mostly explained by cost
escalation. For the majority of cases, ERR's are lower than those estimated in
the SAR.   However,  when data becomes available on  induced traffic and
agricultural production, this could change.
22.         Other Proiect Results.  It is too early to evaluate project impact
on macrolsectoral growth and policies.   However, it can be stated, without
qualification, that by keeping the highway network, through adequate maintenance
execution of the realistically dimensioned and affordable rehabilitation works
included in the project, the project contributed significantly to the
sustainability of the economy.
23.         The project contributed to human resource development in key skilled
worker categories, which was beneficial to PWD and to the private contracting
sector.   The project had similar impact on the technological environment.
Project impact on the social environment was indirect but positive. It is too
early to evaluate it's effect. Resources would be required to generate the
appropriate data required for such an evaluation. The project had little if any
impact on national or local institutions except on private sector development.
Perhaps there may be an increased awareness now of the need to maintain the
highway network and allocate the necessary resources and attention for this
purpose over and above the international financial resources that may become
available under a new project.
23.         Prolect Sustainability.   The project is likely to maintain an
acceptable level of net benefits over a limited number of years due to the good
quality of the work performed, whbch initially will need little follow-up for
it's sustenance. However, beyond a three to four year period and through the end
of it's useful economic life, the project is not likely to maintain an acceptable
level of benefits unless it is continued on a 'more of the same' basis under a
third highway project.
24.         Institutional building under circumstances such as those prevailing
in the Comoros is a long haul proposition requiring protracted and sustained
effort before any lasting results can be obtained. The risk factors for further
efforts are identical to those mentioned above, namely, institutional, financial
staff qualifications and motivation. In a future project they could be addressed
by continued dialogue with the Government and by installing a set of pre-
appraisal conditionalities.   All this is possible provided that targets,
especially financial ones, are more realistically set. For some proposals on
conditionality based on the experience gained from the present project, refer
to note 4.



-6-
Bank Performance
25.         The Bank performed satisfactorily under rather difficult operational
conditions. Even with hindsight, the only recourse to achieve better project
results at the preparation and appraisal stages would have been to initiate steps
with Government agreement to generate adequate data for appraisal purposes, to
further deepen and energetically pursue the dialogue with the Government for a
better understanding of the project and to postpone the operation until such time
as the probability of achieving them was higher. However, it is doubtful if this
would have helped. Perhaps there now exists a higher probability of success for
the future, as now there is a record on the implementation of the project
accessible to all sides.
26.         Prior to credit signature, IDA's considerable efforts to confine
the project to maintenance rather than emphasize new construction met with'
substantial success. Efforts were made to solidify the Government's commitments
to finance its share of the project through getting explicit commitments from
Government on how the road fund would operate.   However, this effort only
translated indirectly into a credit conditionality.
27.         At the supervision stage, supervision missions identified all main
problems, and informed Government about them. One such problem, which had good
results, involved the shift of force account work to contracting. Concerning
the road fund, the missions were in a difficult position as there did not exist
an adequate condition of credit which could apply.
28.         Important lessons which need to be addressed in future highway
maintenance projects would be the followings the strategic dilemma involved when
establishing technical assistance; the training which the project is promoting;
related assumptions on the abilities of financial clients; and on rate of
progress which can realistically be expected from institutional building. This
is particularly applicable in countries with small populations such as the
Comoros, which sometimes lack a critical mass of professionals and other skilled
personnel out of which a highway maintenance organization can be developed.
29.         For projects with Important institutional building components there
needs to be a long range perspective, of at least ten years so as to establish
a realistic level of achievement for institutional building. The specific, but
limited project objectives can then be formulated in this context. On this
basis, realistic project mixes and related targets can be established.
30.         See Note 4 for further suggestions for processing a future project
based on the experience acquired in the present one.
Borrower Performance
31.         The main weaknesses of the borrower's performance were his inability
to supply qualified staff to participate in the management of maintenance and
betterment operations, and to finance its programmed share of project costs in
accordance with the agreed schedule in a timely manner. The borrower's response
to letters addressed to him by the Bank following supervision missions was slow.
Equally slow was his observation of credit covenants. In one particular case,

namely the presentation to IDA of his highway bettenment and investment programs,
he did not observe the credit covenant. To this day, budgetary information on
the revenues and expenditures of the highway sector is inadequate.
32.         The project auditor mentions, in his last audit of March 1987, that
the Government did not present a budget performance document that could be
audited. In addition, the auditor mentions that the Government did not provide
receipts for entries into the road fund, and that he had to reconstruct the
entries out of secondary sources from treasury accounts.
33.         Due to the Government's inability to execute its commitments, project
execution was slowed down, starting with the date of effectiveness which was
postponed by six months immediately following credit signing. Project execution
took five years, instead of the two and a half years' period which was
programmed. For the AfDB-financed project component, project execution took five
and a half years.
Prolect Relationships
34.         The IDA-Borrower relationship was good. The project difficulties
were objective rather than relational, such as the Government's resource
availability. Relations between the donors financing the project, including
IDA, were good. All the donors appeared to be doing their part. No information
is available on the relations between the Government and other donors, although
no evidence was encountered suggesting that they were other than satisfactory.
Consultina Services
35.         The consultants participated as program implementors, technical
assistance suppliers and trainers. The resources needed for the consultant's
program implementor role were underestimated and hence perhaps the need to
increase their budget would be needed in a future project. The consultants
warning signals on project problems were not always timely. Some shortfalls in
the Consultants' reports are mentioned in Part III. Generally, the consultant's
performance was satisfactory, especially in view of the rather difficult
situation they were facing.
Project Documentation and Data
36.         The legal agreement did not pose any problems.  Not all the
conditionalities appearing in the SAR were present in the legal documents. In
one particular case, concerning the Government's financial obligations, the
wording of the legal agreement committed the Government more clearly.
Nonetheless, the lack of a conditionality on the road fund, mentioned earlier,
turned out to be an impediment.
37.         The SAR provided a very useful framework for IDA during project
implementation. Any problems which occurred during the project, were mentioned
in the SAR as possible risks.
38.         Data availability for calculating ERR's during project appraisal
was rather limited. Data availability at project completion stage is somewhat
improved but not sufficiently comprehensive and specific.

PART II
PROJECT FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
40.   Parts I and III were sent to the Borrower on December 18, 1989 with the
request to provide part II by February 15, 1990 but none was received.

Project Completion Report
First Highway Project
The report date- from June 27 1983 about a year from the date the Second
Highway Project became effective. Tho following are report highlights.
1. The construction part was satisfactorily completed.
2. Out of tho four studies included in the project throe wer.
not carried out.
3. Only about SOX of the maintenance program Included in the project
could be achieved.
4. The institution building project cmpoes"n was
only partly achieved for the following reason.
- an 18 month delay in the contitution and deployment of mointenance
due to organixational weknesses.
- The Governmntsa Inability to collect taxes ond duties to foed a re-ostablished Road Fund
which led to a continuous shertage of local funds.
- Shortage of qualified local counterparts.
It may be too optimistic i; caes  i;ke th  Comoros where project entities are being orgnised and
built up from scrotch that this *ould be accomplished early enough
for the program to be lmplem_ted oevr the stipulated schedule.
