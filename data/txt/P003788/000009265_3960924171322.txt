(CREDIT 946-IND)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Yogyakarta Rural
Development Project in Indonesia, for which Credit 946-IND in the amount of
US$12.0 million was approved on July 12, 1979. The credit was closed on March
31, 1989, two years behind schedule. Last disbursement was on October 25,
1989 and an outstanding balance of US$842,270 was cancelled.
The Preface, Evaluation Summary and Parts I and III were prepared by
the Operations Unit of the Resident Staff in Indonesia, Asia Regional Office,
and were sent to the Provincial Planning Agency for Yogyakarta, BAPPEDA TK. I,
on February 20, 1990 for completion of Part II of the PCR. However, no such
inputs were received as of June 1, 1990, and hence this PCR has been finalized
without Part II.
Preparation of the PCR was initiated in late February 1989, in the
course of a supervision of the project by RSI staff. It was followed by
additional short visits by RSI Staff. The PCR was prepared based, inter alia,
on the Staff Appraisal Report (Number 2336 IND); the Credit Agreement
(946 IND); minutes of credit negotiations; summary translation of the
component reports prepared by Bappeda; correspondences between the Bank and
the Borrower; internal Bank memoranda; supervision reports; draft working
papers of the FAO/CP preparation team for the proposed Yogyakarta Upland Area
Development Project, and discussions with officials of the implementing
agencies in the province.

YOGYAKARTA RURz;L DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 946-IND)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.       Obiectives.  The Yogyakarta Rural Development Project (YRDP), loca!IN
known as Bangun Desa (village development), was designed to be the first phase
of a longer term developv.-.nt program in the Province of Yogyakarta
(Paras 2.01, 2.02, 4.01). The overall objectives were to: (i) improve the
income and living standards of the people and the socio-economic and phvsical
infrastructure in two of the poorest districts (kabupatens) of the province,
Gunung Kidul (GK) and Kulon Progo (KP); (ii) promote soil conservation
measures on the critical uplands; and (iii) strengthen local level
institutions and the framework for community participation (Paras 3.01-3.02).
2.       Implementation ExDeriences.  The project was implemented over a
period of nine years and eight months, which is considered by all, including
GOI officials, to be a rather long time for a pilot first phase. Despite an
encouraging start-up, implementation during the first two years was
unsatisfactory because of: (a) delays in the release of budgeted funds;
(b) the _elative inexperience of the implementing/coordinating agencies in the
implementation of a multi-sectoral project; (c) absence of base/thematic maps,
aerial photographs and other resource data required for implementation of some
of the sub-components; and (d) shortage of vehicles. Implementationi, however,
improved during,the 81-82 fiscal year, and physical targets for most of the
components of the project had been exceeded by the end of FY 85-86, some six
months and one year ahead of the stipulated project completion and closing
dates, respectively (Table 4). The project was, however, granted two
extensions for 'keeping the momentum' until a second phase project was ready,
'replicating' into other areas, 'completing' on-going activities, and
preparing a follow-on project. For these purposes the savings (US$2.6 m)
arising from the devaluations of Indonesian Rupiah were used
(Paras 8.04-8.05).
3.       Results.  Available data indicate that gross incomes of upland
farmers in the project area increased substantially but the actual
contribution of the project to such increases l-- not been quantified (Paras
6.01-6.02). Project objectives for improving the overall living conditions
and socio-economic infrastructure by improving the roads network, health
services and drinking water supply were substantiallv achieved (Table 6). The
project was instrumental in getting research attention to upland crops and it
promoted a major change in cropping pattern in the pilot areas, at least for
the short term. Diversification of the production and income base was



- iv-
promoted through the livestock and home garden components, and to a lesser
extent by the fisheries component. Hamlet Funds (Bantuan Dusun) operated
successfully and opened access to short-term credit to many poor families.
However, one of the key objectives of the iroject, i.e. introducing a
replicable technology for soils stabilization, was not satisfactorily
achieved. Although the project's objectives for institutional (ID) and human
resource development (HRD) were only partially fulfilled, the overall
contribution, nonetheless, should be considered to be satisfactory
(Para 6.03).
4.       Sustainability.  It was necessary to extend the project, even though
physical targets had been achieved, in order to 'sustain the momentum' until a
follow-on project was on board. and absorption of incremental project staff
has so far been difficult, which raises questions about the institutional and
financial sustainability of the project.  Sustainability of the high cost
project interventions (soil conservation, artificial insemination and land
titling, for exar le) are also open to question. Detailed data are not
available, but it appears that following cessation of subsidies for terrace
construction and distribution of free seasonal inputs: (i) there has been
fairly widespread reversion to pre-project cropping practices; and (ii)
farmers have not provided sufficient: resources for proper maintenance and
upkeep of the terraces. O&m resources for rural roads are also not being
sufficiently provided, while the commitment of the rural communities for
maintaining some of the upgraded roads appear to be declining (Para 7.01).
5.       Findings and Lessons Learnt.  The overall performance of the project
was mixed, as it has been with other upl-.nd development projects. The
project's value as a pilot operation, however, remains questionable because it
has fallen short in developing an upland soils stabilization technology and
approach that could be replicated on a wider scale. It appears that the
project should have concentrated more on developing alternative techniques for
soils management and crop development on the uplands under diverse agrb-
ecological conditions, which apparently is becoming an important focus of a
proposed follow-on operation.
6.       The principal lessons learnt from the implementation of the project
are as follows: (a) high cost soil conservation measures are often
unsustainable and should be replaced with appropriate low-cost technology;
(b) soil conservation measures have to cover whole micro watersheds to improve
sustainability; (c) soil conservation measures combined with agricultural
improvements must offer potential for sustainable income increases;
(d) judgement on the success and replicability of pilot interventions should
not be based only on the achievement of physical targets; (e) Bank supervision
should focus more on the development impact than on physical achievements;
(f) supervision of projects dealing with complex technical interventions
should emphasize scrutiny of the technical soundness of project interventions,
for which mission staffing should include appropriate expertise;
(g) satisfactory arrangements for monitoring and evaluation, particularly in a
pilot project, should be a condition of loan effectiveness as a minimum; and
(h) to the extent possible, implementation arrangements outside the normal
governmental structure should be avoided.

2.   Proiect Background and Sectoral Context
2.01. Java, with a total population of about 106 million and a
population density of about 800 people/km2 (1988), has traditionally been
the most densely populated area of Indonesia. All lowlands and most of
the better uplands are totally utilized, and cultivation has extended on
to erodable watershed areas, including some two million ha of "critical"
lands. Cultivation of annual foodcrops on such marginal uplands, without
the required soil and land management practices, has led to excessive
run-off, increased erosion, down stream sedimentation and flooding.
These have threatened the income, employment and welfare of the
inhabitants in these watersheds, particularly in the upper watershed
areas or uplands. Some of the incidences of severe poverty and
deprivation are indeed found in these Java uplands.
2.02. GOI's primary objective in the agricultural sector has been to
ensure accelerated growth in the production of the basic commodities and
to maintain self-sufficienzy in basic staples, particularly rice.
Nonetheless, poverty alleviatior., regional balance in development and
conservation of the natural resources and the environment have also been
important policy objectives. Therefore, the deteriorating agro-
ecological and socio-economic conditions in these uplands, particularly
in Java, have been a matter of concern for GOI and'it has sought
assistance from a wide range of bilateral and multilateral donors for
addressing the problems. The Yogyakarta Rural Development Project



-2-
(YRDP), locally known e- Bangun Desa (village development), was the first
comprehensive Bank operation to address the socio-economic and resource
management problems in the agro-ecologically critical areas of the Java
uplands. However, prior to this project GOI instituted an Area
Development Programme in ten "critical" areas with high population
density and low per capita incomes. Two pilot projects in Aceh and
Central Java Provinces - were also initiated with USAID support. The
YRDP, therefore, fitted into the GOI's overall sector and macro-
objectives and was also supportive of its goals for local level
institutional strengthening and community participation in development
planning and implementation.
3.   Project Obiectives and Description
3.01. Objectives. The overall objectives were to: (i) improve tne
income and living standards of the people and the socio-economic and
physical infrastructure in two of the poorest districts (kabupatens) of
the province, Gunung Kidul (GK) and Kulon Progo (KP); (ii) promote soil
conservation measures on the critical uplands; and (iii) strengthen local
level institutions and the framework for community participation.
3.02. Components. The project components as appraised were as follows
(proportion of total baseline costs indicated in parentheses):
(a) Agricultural DeveloRment (45%), including: (i) Tech-,ical DeveloRment
through soil conservation measures, improvement of cropping practices and
specialized technical training for project s 'taff; (ii) Inland Fisheries,
including construction of new fingerling stations and rehabilitation of
existing ones, and technical training and improvement of fisheries
extension; (iii) Livestock, including parasite control, marketing
improvement, extension of artificial insemination, and technical support;
and (iv) Incremental Agricultural Credit; (b) Non-Farm DeveloRment (14%),
including: (i) Small-Scale EnterRrise SuvDort, to develop and upgrade
small enterprises having good prospects for growth; and (ii) Incremental
Credit; (c) Social Services Support (13%), including: (i) Rural Health to
help implement a low-cost preventive health system based on trained
village voluntary health workers and school-teachers; and (ii) Water
Supplies by provision of rainwater catchment tanks in areas of critical
need; (d) Rural Infrastructure (15%), introducing new road building
methodologies for rehabilitation and upgrading of rural roads.
(e) Institutional Development (13%), including: (i) Proiect Organization
and Coordination improving provincial planning, coordination, monitoring
and evaluation and project preparation capability by strengthening
BAPPEDA through reinforcement of staff and traini.ng; and (ii) Community
Participation through communication and leadership training for
Government staff, project staff, and project participants.



-3-
4.   Proiect Design and Organization
4.01. The project was built on ths USAID/UNDP financed Upper Solo
Watershed Project and essentially designed as a multisectoral area
development project. It was to be t.e first-phase of a longer term
development program in the Province of Yogyakarta. It was conceived at a
time when the government's policy or national program for rural/area
development and resource conservation was still in elementary stages, and
the technical packages and institutional arrangements for implementing
such programmes were relatively undeveloped. However, GOI's interest and
commitment to such programmes were growing, and the project was timely in
supporting the evolution of GOI's policy and strategies in these
respects. Areas covered by the project were appropriate to the overall
project objectives although one could argue that given that Yogya is a
small province, the project, even as a pilot, could have had a province-
wide orientation.
4.02. Project design gave clear recognition to two strategic
considerations: first, direct measures for reducing soil erosion and
improving farm income and living conditions in the uplands have to be
complemented with actions to reduce dependance on upland resources; and
secon , integrated planning and implementation of the various activities
are necessary to gain synergistic benefits. The project components and
activities reflected these basic concepts, which resulted in a somewhat
complex project when considered against the provincial and national
capacity (resources, pe..sonnel and experience) to effectively supervise
and monitor the implementation of a multi sectoral project. However,
there was no better alternative to such an integrated approach, and
exclusion of some of the componert-s/activities (i.e. small scale
enterprise, upland fisheries devz.opment, land titling) through stricter
prioritisation would have made the project only marginally simpler.
4.03. Notwithstanding the above strong points in the overall design of
the project, two important weaknesses in the conceptual framework should
also be noted. First, it was over-optimistic in evaluating the returns
to a high input (financial and labor) land management technology and over
estimated the availability of farm-family labor; and second it did not
recognize that under conditions of agro-ecological and socio-economic
diversity, as in the project area, technical interventions have to be
based on a range of feasible options (menu) rather then one single
package. As it turned out later failure to take the above into full
cognizance in project design lead to problems of technical, economic and
social sustainability of the key project interventions (Paras 6.02 and
7.02)
4.04. Except for the agricultural technical development component, which
was to be implemented through a network of newly established Agricultural
Technical Development Centres (ATDC) outside the normal structure of the
provincial agriculture department, institutional arrangements for
planning and implementation called for a project organization within the
existing government structure. Project design paid detailed attention to
the issues of coordination, linkages between project entities at the



national, provincial and kabupaten levels, involvement of the NCOs,
beneficiaries' participation, and emphasized the need for proper
monitoring and on-going evaluation. In line with GOI's overall
institutional development objectives, Bappeda was given a central role in
coordination of planning and implementation, as well as in monitoring and
evaluation. Implementation responsibilities for the individual
components were vested with the respective provincial av--icies but, quite
inexplicably, Department of Land Rehabilitation and Conservation was left
out. The ATDCs were successful in the speedy development and
dissemination of the upland agriculture/soil conservation programs, which
would not havt been otherwise possible given that the existing structure
and orientation of agricultural extension services in the province are
essentially low-land mono-crop (rice) ori3nted. However, the ATDCs were
envisaged as ad-hoc arrangements for eventual integration into the main
structure of agricultural services, but the bureaucratic obstacles to
this were not recognized.
5.   Proiect Imolementation
5.01. Project documents are confusing regarding the stipulated
implementation period. The SAR (Para 4.02) and the working papers
envisaged a five year implementation period, but the legal document
(DCA 946- IND) provided for seven years eight months from Board
presentation to credit closing. At the end, however, the effective
implementation period was nine years and eight months which is considered
by all, including GO'E officials, to be a rather long time for a pilot
first phase.
5.02. The project was off to a good start. Even before the credit
became effective (12/05/79), the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and the
Project Steering Committee had been established (although only the PCU
had been staffed), working papers prepared by the appraisal team had been
translated into Bahasa Indonesia and distributed to th.e concerned GOI
agencies and prefinancing was budgeted for the firsc six months of the
fiscal year. All these bear testimony to the governments' commitment and
support for the project.
5.03. Despite the encouraging start-up, implementation during the first
two years, however, was unsatisfactory. Delay in the release of budgeted
funds - a systemic problem constraining all GOI development projects, the
relative inexperience of the implementing/coordinating agencies in
managing a multi-sectoral project, non-payment of salaries of incremental
staff, shortage of vehicles, and, absence of base/thematic maps, aerial
photographs and other resource data required for effective implementation
of some of the sub-components, were some of the constraining factors.



- 5 -
5.04. The pace of implementation, however, picked up during the
1981-1982 fiscal year, and except for the Small Scale Enterprise (SSE)
development component, physical targets for all other compolLents of the
project had been exceeded by the end of FY 85-86, some six months and one
year ahead of the stipulated project completion and closing dates,
respectively. The two extensions granted were for 'keeping che momentum'
until a second phase was ready, 'replication' into other areas,
'completion' of on-going activities, and preparation of a follow-on
project by utilizing the savings (US$2.6 m) arising from the devaluations
of Indonesian Rupiah. There were differences among t~he concerned Bank
staff (see paras 8.04-8.05) on the rationale for extending a pilot
operation on the above basis.
5.05. A number of variances between planned and actual implementation,
which had implications for institutional development as well as
sustainability of project interventions, are observed. First, on the
institutional side, the PCU was established as a new entity within the
Bappeda TK I, and not as an integral part of its Evaluation and
Coordination Division. This ad-hoc arrangement has since been dismantled
with the completion of the project and therefore the project's impact on
strengthening the key Bappeda functions of monitoring, evaluation and
coordination of development activities may have been diminished.
-Second, tandE activities did not develop as stipulated which has made
impact evaluation of the pilot phase diff_ult.  Third, most of the 269
incremental project staff were not absorbed in the government during the
project period or after its' closing, thereby reducing the project's
impact on Institutional (ID) and Human Resource Development (HRD). On
the technical side, first, the criteria and technical specifications laid
out in project documents for soil conservation works were not always
followed because of lack of information on ground slopes, inadequate
supervision and guidance by project staff, shortage of farm family labor
and reluctance of farmers to give priority to estate crops over basic
staples. Alternktive soil conservation measures were also not tested as
envisaged in the SAR; secon, land titling was concentrated mostly on the
home-gardens and not on the areas with the most need for soil
conservation, which defeated an important purpose of this activity;
third, the operational linkages between the project's soil conservation
staff and the agricultural Dinas's extension staff envisaged at appraisal
were not fully achieved, and lastly. component shares of project costs
changed with agriculture accounting for only 25%, and roads nearly 50%,
compared to SAR allocation of 45% and 15% respectively, because of: (i)
lower costs of terrace construction, (ii) higher civil works costs for
rural roads construction; and (iii) increased physical targets for roads
and bridges construction.
5.06. Proiect Costs. The estimated costs at appraisal was US$19 million
with a foreign exchange component of US$2.7 million. Based on available
data the final cost is about US$18.6 m of which US$3.5 m were foreign
exchange costs. The SAR targets were achieved and/or exceeded at a total
cost of about US$15 million (a cost underrun of about 20%) by the
original credit closing date.



5.07. Disbursement data are in Table 3. By original credit closing date
ot.ly about 622 had been disbursed, which was well below the relevant
disbursement profile. At actual loan closing (March 31, 1989) there was
an outstanding balance of US$1.9 m (i.e. 16X of credit). Final
disbursemcns were made on October 25, 1989 and an outstanding balance of
about 0.8 m was cancelled. The original loan allocations were not
revised but categories under civil works and equipment were overdrawn by
112 and 412, respectively.
6.   Project Results
6.01. Project objectives and physical achievement. The overall
performance of the project was mixed, as it has been with the other
upland projects. As mentioned earlier, most of the physical targets of
the project were achieved or exceeded, except for the SSE development
component. Available data indicate that gross incomes of upland farmers'
in the project areas increased substantially. However, their return per
man-day (Rp.2.900) was substantially lower than that of the ron-
participants (Rp.6.000) because adoption of the new technology increased
labor requirement by about 123Z (also see 6.02 below). Project
objectives for improving the overall living conditions by improving the
roads network, health services and drinking water supply were
substantially achieved. Although not quantified or sufficiently
detailed, expansion and improvement of the rural roads' network have
clearly benefitted the rural communities by improving access to markets
and non-farm employment opportunities, facilitating the movement of
labour and non-labour production inputs, and improving the delivery of
other rural services. The project was instrumental in getting research
attention to upland crops and it facilitated a major change in cropping
pattern in the nilot areas, at least in the short term. Some
diversification of the production and income base was also promoted by
the livestock and home garden components, and to a lesser extent by the
fisheries component. Available information also suggest that the Hamlet
Funds (Bantuan Dusun) operated successfully and opened access to short-
term credit to many poor families without access to institutional credit.
However, one of the key objectives of the project, i.e. introducing a
replicable technology for soil stabilization was not satisfactorily
achieved. It appears that ten years of experimentation has not resulted
in the development of an upland soils stabilization technology that could
be implemented on a wider scale, even within the same project area. And
that immensely reduces the value of this project as an experimental one
(Para 7.01)
6.02.  Project Impact.   The project was implemented at a time when
Indonesia as'a whole and the island of Java in particular was
experiencing rapid growth in agricultural production and income due to
increased availability of fertilizer at subsidized prices, expanded
agricultural support services, diffusion of high yielding varieties of
rice, and a more favorable paddy: fertilizer price ratio (1.07 in 1979



-7-
versus 1.93 in 1982 and 1.59 in 1987). In the absence of reliable data
it is difficult to determine the actual contribution of the project to
the improvements in Yogyakarta vis-a-vis the other variables external to
the project. However, available data shows that during 1981-87 the
incidence of poverty in Yogyakarta declined at a faster rate than in the
other provinces of Java. It is yet too early to fully evaluate the long-
term impact of the project on upland agricultural and soil conservation
programmes, again because of a lack of reliable data. However, subsidies
for cerrace construction and free distribution of inputs appear to have
benefitted disproportionately the larger farmers because project
assistances were related to land area and without any ceilings. Project
interventions resulting in bench terracing and annual cropping on slopes
earlier abandoned for crop production might even have had negative
effects on some upland soils. Distribution of fish fingerlings at
subsidized and lower than market prices had negative effects on the
development of a thriving private sector in fingerling production.
6.03. However, the project's contribution to the process of developing
an operational strategy for addressing the socio-econcmic and agro-
ecological problem of the uplands should be considerable. The projest
exposed the provincial agencies and government officials to the
organizational, operational and technological rigors of planning and
implementing a complex project - an experience which should prove
valuable in the future. A large number of technical and management staff
were trained through formal courses as well as on-the-job, and the
province now has a pool of such trained personnel with potential for
significant contribution in the future.
6.04. In hindsight, it appears that the project should have concentrated
more on developing alternative techniques for soils management and crop
development on the uplands under diverse agro-ecological conditions,
which apparently will be an important focus of the proposed follow-on
operation.
6.05. Economic Rate of Return (ERR). At appraisal, an overall ERR for
the project was not estimated although ERR for three components -
Silivipasture (13Z), terracing (14Z) and rural roads (11Z) - had been
calculated. Recalculation of ERR for the project as a whole or any of
its components is rendered difficult because the required data on
benefits relevant to the various components are not available. For
example, there are no data on: (a) the project's actual contribution to
yield and income increases; (b) the number of beneficiaries continuing
with the improved soil management and cropping pattern promoted under the
project; (c) the extent of negative impact of the project on soils
stabilization; and (d) road user savings. One could make some heroic
assumptions based on anecdotal information but that would not result in
any meaningful ex-poste economic analysis.

7.   Proiect Sustainability
7.01. It was necessary to extend the project, even though physical
targets had been achieved, in order to 'sustain the momentum' until a
follow-on project was on board, and absorption of incremental project
staff has so far been difficult. Both of these perhaps point to the
problems of institutional and financidl sustainability of the project.
Sustainability of the high cost project interventions (soil conservation,
artificial insemination and land titling for example) are also open to
question. Although detailed data are not available, it is reported that
following cessation of subsidies for terrace construction and
distribution of free seasonal inputs: (i) there has been 'fairly
widespread' reversion to pre project cropping practices (sole crop
cassava and low-input maize/cassava); and (ii) farmers do not provide
sufficient resources for proper maintenance and upkeep of the terraces.
On the positive side, however, it appears that some non-project farmers
have spontaneously improved their old terraces following the project
demonstration, but reliable data on this are not available. O&M
resources for rural roads are also not being sufficiently provided, while
the commitment of the rural communities for maintaining such roads have
been declining because these roads are no longer considered to be
'community roads' as they are now used by people from far and distant
places. On the other hand, there are also instances where the district
authorities have upgraded a number of the village roads improved by the
project into kabupaten roads.
8.   Bank Performance
8.01. The project was identified by Bappeda TK I, and the Gajah Mada
University (GMU). The Bank supported its preparation through local and
international consultants. It was appraised some 30 months after GOI
asked for Bank assistance, which appears to have been a long elapsed time
considering that the project involved a relatively small geographic area
(two Kabupatens covering some 2000 km2) in an easily accessible province.
Appraisal and the first two supervisions were done by the Rural
Development Division of the former Agriculture and Rural Development
Department. Thereafter, beginning mid 1980, supervision responsibilities
were transferred to Lhe Bank's Resident Staff in Indonesia (RSI).
8.02. Bank's involvement in supervision was substantial. Average
supervision inputs during 1980-85 and 1987-89 are estimated at over 17
and 18 staffweeks per year. Most supervision missions had 4-5 staff.
Mission reports were detailed, provided exhaustive tables showing
physical/financial progress as well as revised work programmes, and,
barring few exceptions, mission recommendations were promptly
communicated to the government and followed up. The project was not,
however, supervised (or no supervision reports were prepared) for a full-
year between March 1985-March 1986, and supervision since 1985 was less
intense than in the prior years.



-9
8.03. Supervision concentrated on monitoring physical achievements
against SAR targets and identifying the key managerial and financial
issues, with inadequate attention paid to evaluating the technical
soundness of the soil conservation programmes or the project's
developmental impact. Missions did not include any experienced soil
conservation specialist. Consequently critical technical deficiencies
and variances from SAR proposals (see para 5.05), were not identified
and/or highlighted for remedial action. Bank did not also succeed in
getting an effective monitoring and evaluation system going. Consultants
hired for MandE support were required to get substantially involved in
general project management and new project preparation.
8.04. Bank's handling of extension of closing date, and further project
preparation was not consistent. As early as March 1985, the Bank wrote
to the GOI advising that: (i) estimated savings of over US$2 m should be
cancelled; (ii) all on-going field activities should be completed by
September 1986, and disbursement by March 1987, and (iii) closing date
would be extended only under exceRtional circumstances. The rationale
for GOI's request for an extension and/or a follow-on phase was rightly
questioned on the following grounds: (a) all SAR targets had been
completed and no extra-ordinary circumstances for extension had been
demonstrated; (b) benefits of first phase activities had not been
quantified and/or evaluated and (c) replicability of the technical
interventions had not been established.
8.05. At the end, however, the loan closing date was extended by two
years in order to extend the 'successful' interventions over a wider
geographic area, and support preparation of a second phase, although
there are no evidences to suggest that the Bank's concerns under (b) and
(c) above had been satisfactorily met. It appears that under the above
circumstances the Bank should have closed the project as originally
scheduled, cancelled the savings arising from currency devaluations as
required under Bank guidelines, done a full evaluation of the phase I
activities and based on that decide on the future course of action.
8.06. The principal lessons learnt from the implementation of the
project are as follows: (a) high cost soils management measures such as
terracing are often unsustainable and should be replaced, wherever
possible, by low cost measures such as vegetative means, in combination
with farming systems providing soil cover; (b) soil conservation measures
have to cover whole micro-watersheds to improve sustainability; (c) the
wide variety of soil and cropping conditions in the uplands require area
specific approaches; (d) soil conservation measures combined with
agricultural improvements must offer the potential for increasing
farmers' income, beyond one-time subsidies; (e) judgement on the success
and replicability of pilot interventions should not be based only on the
achievement of physical targets; (f) Bank supervision should focus more
on the development impact than on physical achievements; (g) supervision
of projects dealing with complex technical interventions should emphasize
continuous evaluation of the technical soundness of project
interventions, and mission staffing should include appropriate expertise



- 10
for this purpose; (h) satisfactory arrangements for monitoring and
evaluation, particularly in a pilot project, should be in place as a
condition of loan/credit effectiveness, as a minimum; and (i) to the
extent possible, implementation arrangements outside the normal
governmental structure should be avoided.
9.   Borrower Performance and Project RelationshiR
9.01. The government was successful in taking the required action for
a timely start-up of the project (para 5.02) but the momentum was not
maintained and project implementation during the first two years
stagnated. There were also delays in fulfilling certain disbursement
conditions, and covenants relating to setting up and staffing of
project entities (PCU, SSE Technical Cell, ATDC). However, with the
passage of time GOI responded positively to most of Bank
recommendations, as a result of which project implementation improved
substantially. It took timely action (setting up a task force) for
clearing up back logs in reimbursement applications whiich resulted in
appreciable increases in disbursements (from US$1.3 m in June'82 to
US$3.5 m in June '83). However, its efforts for the timely
integration of project entities (PCU, ATDC) and incremental staff with
the existing GOI structure, establishing effective linkages between
project activities and the routine development activities in the
province, and for MandE activities were less fruitful. On the whole,
however, the national and provincial governments had given the project
full political commitment and support.
9.02. Bank relationship with the government agencies at all levels,
National, Provincial and Kabupaten has been good and effective.
10. Consulting Services
10.01. All international consultants (182 man months) were provided by
the consulting firm of SGV and Co; local consultants (88 mm) were
individually recruited (for implementation support and evaluation) as
well as firmed out (for phase II project preparation). Performance of
the land use / soil conservation and the agricultural economics
consultants were found to be unsatisfactory, both by Bank supervision
staff and -he local officials. Their work relationship with local
staff wer( 7'30 unsatisfactory, partly because of communication
problems e   to language difficulties.  Consultants' contribution in
ensuring technical soundness of soil conservation and crop development
programmes, instituting an effective HandE or in generating useful
baseline socio economic data appear to have been minimal. Preparation
report produced by them for the proposed phase II project was also
found to be lacking in content and analysis.



11. Project Documentation and Data
11.01. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) along with the working papers
provided detailed guidelines for project implementation. The SAR
explained the overall concept and strategy of the project well but was
weak in its treatment of the project's risks. Project documents were
also confusing on the project implementation period (Para 5.01).
11.02. The provincial government has been generally cooperative in
providing the data for PCR, although delays were experienced because
of the demands on Bappeda staff by the FAO/CP and World Bank
preparation and preappraisal missions for the proposed phase II
project. Bappeda TK I has produced their own PCR in Bahasa Indonesia
which essertially provides data on the physical and financial
implementation of the project with inadequate analysis of project
impact.
