APPRAISAL OF GURI POWERHOUSE 23XTENSION
C.V.G. ELECTRIFICACION DEL CARONI C.A.
SUMMARY
i.        C.V.G. Electrificacion del Caroni C.A. (EDELCA) has requested
a Bank loan of US$31 million equivalent to assist in financing the foreign
exchange costs of extending the powerhouse structure of the Guri hydro-
electric project from the present three unit capacity to the full ten unit
capacity contemplated; installing the fourth unit; and installing the
embedded parts for the remtiining six units. The total estimated cost of
the proposed Project is US$62 million equivalent including interest and
other charges payable during the construction period, of which about $36
million would be foreign exchange. The Bank has made two Loans to EDELCA
aggregating US$100 million equivalent for the initial phase of Guri and
extra-high-voltage facilities to transmit the power to the Caracas market
area. Guri Dam and the three-unit powerhouse are essentially completed,
and the transmission system is well advanced and on schedule.
ii.       The proposed Project has been satisfactorily designed and engi-
neered, and the cost estimates contain a large contingency allowance,
prudent in view of past experience with major civil works in the same river.
Even when this generous allowance is taken into account, EDELCA's expansion
program is economically justified, with an internal return on the additional
investment estimated at about 17-18%, valuing output at current tariffs.
iii.      The total Project cost of $62 million equivalent would be met by
the proposed Bank loan (50%), government investments (27%) and retained
earnings (23%).  The loan would finance only the foreign exchange costs of
the civil works, the equipment, and the engineering. EDELCA will finance
interest charges during construction. Procurement will be on a broad inter-
national basis.  Any surplus loan funds would be cancelled.
iv.       EDELCA continues to be capably managed by executives and staff
well known to the Bank. Past and short-term future financial performance
have not been and are not expected to be as good as originally forecast.
This is attributable principally to the failure of sales to other utilities
to develop as anticipated. This in turn stems from delays in converting the
private system serving Caracas from 50 to 60 cycle operation, and the delays
in completing Guri precluding sales to another government-owned power agency.
However, the performance criteria established in the first two Loans should
be met, although with a delay of two years, approximately commensurate with
the lag in projected power sales. The frequency conversion is well under-
way, and a long-term power sales agreement was recently signed by EDELCA and
its two principal utility customers.
v.        The proposed Project would form a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$31 million equivalent for a term of 20 years including about 5 years
of grace.

APPRAISAL OF GIJRI POWERHOUSE EXTENSION
C.V.G. ELECTRIFICACION DEL CARONI C.A.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In September 1963 and in January 1967, the! Bank made two power-
development Loans to C.V.G. Electrificacion de] Caroni C.A. (EDELCA) of
US$85 million (353-VE) and US$15 million equivalent (482-VE) for the con-
struction of the initial stage of the Guri Hydrolelectric Project, and for
an extra-high-voltage (EHV) transmission system to the Caracas market
center, respectively. The first stage of Guri is nearing completion with
three 175 MW units as planned, although a little more than a year behind
the original schedule because of difficulties experienced by the general
contractor. Power generation began November 8, 1968. The EHV system,
under construction from Guri to Caracas, is expected to be in service
during the third quarter of 1969 as initially scheduled.
1.02      The Guri Project and associated EHV transmission system are de-
signed to serve primarily the north-central population and industrial center
comprising the Caracas-Maracay-Valencia area and environs, and the rapidly
growing industrial center of Ciudad Guayana whose development is being
aggressively promoted by the autonomous regional agency, Corporacion Vene-
zolana de Guayana (CVG), the parent of EDELCA. In the north-central area
EDELCA will wholesale power to two other power systems, while in the Ciudad
Guayana area the principal eustomers are major foreign-owned industrial
companies and electrometallurgical subsidiaries of CVG. These several
regions, as well as intermediate zones, form the logical market area for
Guri power, and it is now clear that Guri will be the prime source for this
growing market over the next decade.
1.03      The Caroni River is one of the major rivers of Latin America, its
annual average flow being'about 5,000 cubic meters per second at the Guri
site. The topography of the area upstream of the Guri project is such that
a large reservoir has been created, some 11,000 million cubic meters. This
feature together with the Caronits large flow enable the development of some
1,600 NW of dependable power. The regulation of the river also guarantees
the capability of an existing 365 1I4W downstream installation, Macagua.
1.0h      Guri is designed to be expanded in several stages over several
decades, by installing additional generating units and later raising the
height of the dam proper twice. The original design took this into account,
and contemplated the installation of ten 175 MW units during the late 1960's
and the 1970's before raising the dam.   As noted, three units are now in-
stalled. (An additional 400 MW can be developed in the first 10 machines by
raising the dam modestly. A second powerhouse wiould be constructed in
connection with raising the dam the second time.) EDELCA now plans to ex-
tend the existing powerhouse to its full size as soon as possible, and to
purchase and install the remaining seven units between now and 1980. The



- 2 -
basic powerhouse construction would be completed during 1969-72, with the first
additional unit, No. 4, coming into service in 1973. The remaining units would
be erected and placed in service one each year except 1974.
1.05      The total cost of completing the entire powerhouse and installing
the last seven units is estimated to be about US$91 million equivalent, of
which about US$61 million would be in foreign exchange, including interest
charges on the proposed Bank loan. (This compares with a total of approxi-
mately US$187 million EDELCA will have invested to complete the initial phase
of Guri with three units, and the EHV facilities.)  LDELCA has requested Bank
assistance in financing the civil engineering works of the powerhouse extension,
Unit No. 4, and the embedded parts of Unit Nos. 5-10. The total cost of this
phase, to be carried out during 1969-73, is estimated to be equivalent to US$62
million (including interest charges on the proposed Bank loan during the con-
struction period) of which US$36 million would be in foreign exchange. A loan
of US$31 million equivalent is proposed, with EDELCA financing the approximately
US$5 million of interest charges during the construction period.
l.O6      During the construction of Guri dam, certain difficulties were ex-
perienced by the general contractor Consorcio Guri, a group of U.S. and Danish
firms managed by Kaiser Engineers & Constructors Inc. These difficulties not
only contributed to the delay in execution of the work, but have also given rise
to claims, not yet settled, of substantial magnitude. Consorcio Guri and EDELCA
completed financial arrangements in mid-1967 under which EDELCA has made certain
payments to Consorcio (including disbursements from Loan Account 353-VE) the
final disposition of which may not be known for five years. This situation is
discussed more fully in Chapter II, "The Borrower".
1.07      This report was prepared by F. H. Howell, and is based upon informa-
tion obtained from engineering studies by EDELCA and its consultants; a continu-
ous liaison with CVG and EDELCA since mid-1962; an appraisal in Venezuela in
November 1968; and upon a visit to Venezuela in March 1969 to review recent
developments.
II. THE BORROWER
2.01      EDELCA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVG, the nationally chartered
regional authority responsible for development of the area known as the
"Guayana" surrounding the confluence of the Orinoco and Caroni Rivers. TPhe
Guayana has considerable natural resources, among them abundant hydroelectric
potential, natural gas, high-grade iron ore and vast areas of land which could
be made productive by control of the Orinoco. CVG is active in many fields:
(i)  Iron and steel production through another wholly-owned
subsidiary PTanta Siderurgica del Orinoco (SIDOR) which
operates an olectric iron smelter, steel conversion
facilities, a pipe factory and has under construction
a rolling mill.



- 3, -
(ii)  Aluminum production through another subsidiary jointly
owned with Reynolds Metals Company, Aluminio del Caroni S.A.
(ALCASA) operating a 12,500 m ton aluminum smelter;
capacity is now being doubled, and rolling facilities are
being planned.
(iii)  Land reclamation in the Orinoco delta, as part of a general
plan to encourage migration to the Guayana.
(iv). Urban development, centered around expansion of the new
Ciudad Guayana, embracing the corrmunities of Puerto Ordaz
and San Felix.
(v)  Tourism, through construction with Intercontinental Hotels
of a new hotel in Ciudad Guayana.
CVGIs promotional activities are important to EDELCA's market, because the
Guayana is expected to account for 36% of EDELCA's revenues during 1969-80.
2.02      EDEICA was created in August 1963 to assume ownership and opera-
tionis of CVG's electric power properties, then principally the 365 MW Macagua
hydroelectric plant constructed to serve SIDOR. EDELCA's Charter and By-Laws
were drafted-in close consultation with the Bank. The Charter requires that
the President must at all times be a person of proven experience and executive
capacity: breach of this provision would constitute a default under both Loan
Agreements. This provision will be continued in the proposed loan. The
current President has been in charge of EDELCA since its creation, and has as
well continuously directed CVG since its founding in December 1960. He is a
very capable man, in large measure responsible for the cooperation between the
public and private power sectors. He is assisted by a competent staff who are
successfully operating Macagua, completing construction of Guri and the EHV
system, and planning the proposed expansion of Guri powerhouse. Suitable
personnel have been appropriately trained to operate Guri and the EHV facilities,
and CVG has furnished key personnel for operation of the interconnected systems
discussed in Chapter III, 'Power Sector".
2.03      EDELCA (and CVG before it) has retained the services of Harza
Engineering Company InternEtional (IJSA) throughout the design and construction
of Guri. EDELCA intends to continue to employ Harza in connection with the
expansion of the powerhouse. Certain specialized engineering and supervisory
services necessary to carry out construction of the EHV system are being
provided by Kennedy-& Donkin (UK) and Techint (Italy).  These arrangements
have proven satisfactory, and with them EDELCA is capable of executing the
proposed program of expansion. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that these or sim-larly satisfactory arrangements will be continued.
2.04      In early 1967, the general contractor at Guri, Consorcio Guri,
requested financial assist4nce from EDELCA, outside the scope of the contract,
alleging changed conditions caused it to suffer grave damage. Consorcio



4-
clairned it would otherwise be forced to abandon the job, its losses during
1963-67 having reached such proportionsl/that most members of the joint
venture were unwilling to put more money into the contract. After consider-
able negotiations, during which the Bank offered its good offices, an agree-
ment was reached under which Consorcio obligated itself to complete the job,
and EDELCA obligated itself to make certain payments to Consorcio in contem-
plation of Consorcio's continuing to work. The principal features of this
Financial Agreement are:
(i) Consorcio would continue to work to completion, and
EDELCA would pay Consorcio regular Contract Revenues
in accordance with the provisions of the general
contract.
(ii) Consorcio would render an accounting of its-costs to
prosecute this work, and EDELCA would make Special
Advances under the Financial Agreement equal to the
amount Consorcio's costs exceeded Contract Revenues.
That is, EDELCA would reimburse all Consorcio's
expenditures.
(iii) The aggregate amount of Special Advances would not
exceed the face amount of Consorcio's performance bond
of (about) US$37 million. At the same time, the
sureties who wrote the bond agreed to an amendment
whereby they bound themselves to promptly reimburse
EDELCA directly for the Special Advances if Consorcio
abandoned the work prior to its completion.
(iv) Any claims presented by Consorcio and accepted by
EDELCA would cancel a corresponding obligation of
Consorcio to repay the Special Advances.
(v) Any Special Advances outstanding upon completion of
the contract would be repaid promptly by Consorcio,
except for armounts equal to unresolved claims. Two
years would elapse during which an attempt would be
made to settle claims. Following this period,
Consorcio woiad be obliged to repay the unsettled
balance of the $pecial Advances in three equal annual
payments.
1/ During inauguration of the work November 8, 1968, Edgar Kaiser
representing Consorcio stated in his public address that losses
had reached more than US$60 million. The estimated original
value of the general contract was about US$72 million.



- 5 -
At the present time the work required by the General Contract is almost
complete, but the full extent of Consorciols claim is not yet known, nor
can EDELCA estimate how much it is likely to accept.
2.05      As of March 1969, EDELCA had made aggregate Special Advances
to Consorcio of US$26.9 million, and expects to make additional Advances
of about US$0.4 million by June 1969 when the works will have been completed.
Following the accord reached by EDELCA and Consorcio which led to the Financial
Agreement in mid-1967, the Bank agreed to disburse .rom Loan Account 353-VE
an amount up to US$13.h million pari passu with EDELCA, for purposes of the
Special Advances.l/ EDELCA has in turn agreed that one-half of any repayments
made by Consorcio under the Financial Agreement will be applied to reduce
Loan 353-VE by prepaying the last maturities.
2.06      It would be imprudent to speculate as to the extent of Consorcio's
claims and how much EDELCA would accept. Therefore, while it is obvious the
settlement of claims may have a major impact on EDELCA's future financial
position, it cannot be quantified. For purposes of making the financial pro-
jections in this report it has been assumed that Consorcio wifl present and
EDELCA will accept claims equal to the total amount of Special Advances,
i.e. US$27.3 million. This would seem to be the most pessimistic view.
III. THE POWER SECTOR
3.01      Located on the Caribbean coast of South America, Venezuela had a
population estimated at 9,351,600 at the end of 1°67. Per capita GNP was
equivalent to US$984 in 1966 (measured at market prices); petroleum continues
to be the largest sector (26% of GDP at factor costs). The nation is rapidly
industrializing, and produces a range of basic metal products, automobiles,
electrical appliances, construction materials, etc. More than 65% of the total
population, which tends to be concentrated in the major cities, has electric
service available. Per capita use, excluding the petroleum sector, was 750 kwh
in 1967, ranking Venezuela among the highest in Latin America.
Composition of the Sector
3.02      Public power supply in Venezuela is provided both by privately-owned
companies, and by government agencies at the municipal and federal level. The
more important enterprises are the following:
(i)  EDELCA, serving directly the industrial Guayana market
and providing bulk power for the utilities serving the
eastern and central regions of the country.
1/ These funds were available in the Loan Account from the usual provision
for contingencies, as well as the considerable savings realized by
purchasing the Project's electro-mechanical equipment under extremely
favorable market conditions. The full US$13.4 million has been disbursed,
and future payments will be borne entirely by EDELCA.



-6-
(ii) Compania Anonima de Administracion y Fomento Electrico
(CADAFE), a government-owned agency providing service
throughout most of the country, which operates 568 MfW
of thermal generating plants, as well as transmission,
and distributioh facilities. CADAFE serves 466,000
customers directly, and a large number of municipal
systems at wholesale.  Except for the industrializing
Maracay and Valencia areas, the market is primarily
smaller communities and rural areas so that load
density is inherently low, while investments and
operating expenses are inherently high. CADAFE
operates a 230-kv transmission system financed by
Loan 391-VE, which integrates its eastern and central
systems with EDELCA's plants on the Caroni River and
forms an important link in the transmission of Caroni
power to the Caracas market.
(iii) Compania Anonima La Electricidad de Caracas
(La Electricidad), a wholly-Venezuelah privately-owned
company which has been supplying Caracas and its
environs for nearly 70 years. La Electricidad operates
a 620 MW, 50 cycle system now being converted to
60 cycle operation, the national frequency standard.
(iv) C.A. Energia Electrica de Venezuela and C.A. Energia
Electrica de Barquisimeto, Canadian-controlled companies
which operate in the major cities of Maracaibo and
Barquisimeto, respectively. There are other Venezuelan-
owned private companies operating in Ciudad Bolivar,
Valencia, Anaco and Puerto Cabello.
(v) The municipal systems which buy bulk power from CADAFE.
Total public supply capacity was about 2200 MW at the end of 1968. In addition,
the petroleum sector ownp and operates nearly 500 MW in captive plants, which
provide power for well and refinery operation, but whose production is not
generally available to the public. In 1967, these plants accounted for about
17% of all electricity produced in the country. Average annual growth in
public supply production during 1962-68, exclusive of captive plants, was over
15%.
3.03      La Electricidad and the Canadian companies operate large thermal
plants, as does CADAFE to serve its central market area which lies within the
Caracas-Valencia-puerto Cabello area, and includes the large water-pumping
load of the Caracas water-supply system operated by the Instituto Nacional de
Obras SAnitarigs. Except for the EDELCA hydroelectric plants on the Caroni,
most of the rest of the pouRtry is served from smaller, old conventional steam
plants, gap turbines, or isqlated diesel units. CADAFE in particular has a
long-range program of interconnecting isolated communities at 115 kv and



7-
integrating regions at 230-kv so that service can be provided from larger,
more efficient central stations. It is anticipatE'd that this will be the
pattern in the east and west of Venezuela.
The Frequency Unification Problem
3.04      On the other hand, market development in -the north-central in-
dustrial zone and the Caracas area itself as well as in the Guayana will
be met from Guri. In 1963, at the time of making Loan 353-VE for the
initial phase of the Guri Project, the Bankc noted that its economic justi-
fication hinged upon the inclusion of the important Caracas load in the
market to be served. The Government agreed, and through a series of
executive and legislative measures arranged to have La Electricidad's
system converted to 60 cycle operation, and provided the funds to defray
the cost of doing so. At the same time La Electricidad agreed to limit its
expansion of generating capacity when Guri power became available, and to
buy its future requirernents from EDELCA. The studies and negotiations
leading to these results proved to be more complex and difficult than had
been visualized. The work of frequency conversion has started only recently,
and will riot be complete until mid-1971 instead of 1968 as had been planned
in 15;63. In spite of these delays, the working out of the agreements and the
actual beginning of the physical conversion must be considered an outstanding
example of cooperation between the public and private sectors.
3.05      Based upon conversion of La Electricidad's system, EDELCA, CADAFE
and La Electricidad have entered into a long-term power sales agreement whose
fundamental feature is to require CADAFE and La Electricidad to cease the
acquisition of generating capacity in the Guri market area, and purchase power
from EDELCA until the first stage 1,750 IlW capacity of Guri is completely
absorbed, now expected about 1980. This agreement was not reached until all
parties--particularly CADAFE and La Electricidad--had been satisfied such a
program was in their own best interests. La Electricidad will purchase power
at the northern terminal of EDELCA's EHV system, while CADAFE will purchase
there, and at I4acagua and El Tigre as well.
3.f06     The task of analyzing, programming, and actually carrying out the
work: of frequency conversion is complex and difficult. La Electricidad has
formned a subsidiary company for this purpose alone, Ca.mbio de Frecuencia
Coinpania Anonima (CAFRFCA). A census of consumers and their equipment was
taken, and a program of conversion drawn up. Work began in mid-1968, and is
progressing well. Three 25 MW generating units have been converted, as has
about 75 MW of load (as of March 15, 1969). A 60 cycle tie-line is in service
between La Electricidad and CADAFE. At present about 7 MW of load are being
converted monthly, and when full-scale operations are achieved, a rate of about
20 Pif per month is anticipated.  La Electricidad's load is now about 400 MW,
and is growing about 3 MW per month. The regions experiencing the most rapid
growth are being converted first.



-8-
3.07      The three interconnecting parties are setting up an operating arm,
the final legal status of which has not yet been determined. It will be
responsible for daily operation of the interconnected pool under the terms
of the power agreement, and is currently called Operacion de Sistemas Inter-
conectados (OPSIS). At present, OPSIS has-only a skeleton staff, but is
training operators in Venezuela and abroad. When frequency conversion is
complete and full pool operation achieved, OPSIS will direct the generation
of the three interconnected parties in accordance with system requirements.
IV. EDELCA'S PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
4.01      The three-party interconnection agreemenit is based upon the con-
tinuous expansion of Guri to meet market growth until the first stage (ten
175 MW units) is complete. At present, it is estimated this will be required
by 1980. At that time, the overall load/capacity situation will be critically
reviewed, and it is likely new thermal generating facilities will be con-
structed in the north-central region before the Guri dam is raised for the
second stage expansion. Thus EDELCA's expansion program over the next 12 years
will consist of:
(i)  irmnediate expansion of the existing powerhouse to
its ultimate size for ten units;
(ii)  sequential installation of generating units h through
10 during 1973-80;
(iii)  construction during 1973-75 of a second 400-kv (EHV)
transmission system, from Guri to the north-central
region, possibly west of Caracas; and
(iv) construction as required of lower voltage trans-
mission facilities to serve major industrial customers
in the Guayana region.
4.02      EDELCA and its consultants Harza have studied the possibility of
extending the powerhouse civil works piecemeal as additional units are
required, and compared the costs with carrying out the complete extension
now. Their studies indicate that the differences among the present values
of the costs (calculated at a discount rate of 12%) of the several schemes
are smaller than the margin of error inherent in making engineering estimates. /
Thus the timing of the wQrk-is a matter of indifference as regards its costs.
EDELCA plans to initiate the entire extension in the immediate future and the
Bank agrees with these plaps. EDELCA will, however, run the risk of having

1% of the estimated total construction cost. The present value of the
different cost estimates is remarkably insensitive to the discount rate.

a prematurely completed powerhouse in the event there should be slackening
of demand in the late 1970"3. The magnitude of this risk is reduced by the
operation of the interconnection agreement which! in effect fixes five years
in advance the amount of power and energy CADA'EV and La Electricidad are
obliged to purchase. (See paragraph 5.0Q.) Thiis, for example, they will be
obligated to purchase in 1975 amounts determine6 by a forecast to be made in
1970.
4.03      EDELCA proposes to purchase all seven additional generating units
in the immediate future. There is likely to be a price advantage over buying
units singly or in pairs, and there is an obvious advantage in standardization.
The contracts would provide for phased delivery, and would contain correspond-
ing provisions for payments over the entire delivery period of 1969-80.
EDELCA would control the timing of the delivery of future units. Certain of
the embedded parts of all the turbines and generators would be delivered early
and be erected and installed by the general contractor for the powerhouse
civil works.
4.04      The total estimated cost of all the components of the program is
equivalent to US$129.5 million. The new work to be undertaken will cost the
equivalent of about US$116 million, while during 1969 EDELCA will be spending
about US$13.5 million equivalent on the completion of the two Bank-financed
projects, i.e., the initial phase of Guri and the first 4OO-kv transmission
line. Details are shown in Annex 5.
The Project
4.05      The Project for which Bank financing 1s proposed would include the
following:
(i)  Complete civil works for the full ten-unit powerhouse;
(ii)  Installation of Unit No. 4 complete;
(iii) Installation of embedded parts for Units 5-10; and
(iv) Engineering and supervision during procurement and
construction.
h.o6      The existing three-unit powerhouse, located at the toe of the main
concrete gravity dam, will be extended completely across the river. Openings
have been provided in the dam to accommodate the penstocks for the future
units. The powerhouse foundation is on rock in the river bed, the downstream
area being flooded by the tailrace and spillway. The area in which the
extension will be made is under water, and so must be isolated by coffer-
damming between the !existing powerhouse and the spillway. The excavation and
construction would take place in the dry behind the cofferdam.
4.07      The general contract for the civil works would be placed on a unit
price basis after international competition among prequalified contractors or

consortia of contractors. (Consorcio would be included, but it is not
certain the sponsors would wish to participate in the bidding.) The
electro-mechanical equipment would also be procured on a broad inter-
national competitive basis. The estimated cost of the work proposed for
Bank financing is surmarized below and presented in more detail in Annex 2.

Disbursements from the loan account would be made for foreign exchange costs of
the general contract and equipment, and the consultants' services.  Funds deter-
mined to be surplus at such time as the works are sufficiently advanced would
be cancelled.
4.08      The civil works and erection of Unit No. 4 would be completed by mid-
1973. To maintain this schedule, which is fairly tight, the process of selecting
the general contractor will have to begin soon to enable him to move in before
the low water period occurs in the Caroni, beginning around January 1970.
EDELCA. plans to purchase with its own funds local sheet piling and have it on-
site before the contractor moves in. This is the critical material for placing
the cellular cofferdam needed to permit excavation in the dry. EDELCA plans to
erect Units 5-10 by force account under the direction of factory engineers. An
undertaking has been obtaiaed that EDELCA will carry out this work as market
developments require.
V. JUSTIFICATION OF PROJECT
The Market Forecast
5.01      The load/capacity situation in the Guri market area at the end of 1968
was as follows:
Installed      Peak
Capacity      Demand
Cormpany                                MW           MW
La Electricidad                        518          414
CADAFE                                 319          310
EDE4CA                                 545          310



La Electricidad's market is heavily urban in nature, and has experienced
a long-term rate of growth which has exhihitted remarkably little tendency
to vary.  The Company's plarning division has Jound that forecasts based
upon past; trends yield results fully as accur;ite as more elaborate tech-
niques. Their f'orecast is based upon a continuation of the historic rate
of nearly 10% per year for the next several ye:rs, but. assumes that this
will fall to the equivalent of only 7.5% in the later 1970's. Thus, the
estimate of La Electricidad's market development is probably pessimistic over
the long run.  La Electricidad has under construction now a 60 MW jet-engine-
powered 50/60 cycle unit expected in service late June 1969. This unit was pur-
chased when it became known Guri would be delayed. In addition, certain
modifications are being mqde to the boilers in two plants to permit supple-
mental firing which may develop as much as 3", NW additional capability. Both
these factors reduce La Electricidad's requixernment Lo buy from EDELCA in the
future.
5.02      CADAFE's market on the other hand incltudes industrial operations,
and as new industries are connected, load growth occurs in steps imposed upon
the general trend. There has been a tendency Ln the past to plan power
facility expansion around the expectation of load increases without obtaining
contractual commitments from the potential customers. CADAFE's management is
aware of the dangers in this approach to system planning, particularly in view
of the obligation it now has towards EDELCA, explained in paragraph 5.04. The
long-term growth trend of CADAFE's major market area has been estimated to be
about 10% per year for the next six years, and then decreasing linearly to 7%
by 1981.
5.03      EDELCA's direct consumers include only the industrial operations in
the Guayana, and in particular CVG's steel and aluminum facilities SIDOR and
ALCASA. Both are presently undergoing expansions: SIDOR's load will increase
modestly, while ALCASA's will double in 1969, and is expected to double again
in the mid-1970's as production increases from the present 12,500 m tons per
year to 25,000 and finally 50,000.' Concurrently, general use in the Ciudad
Guayana area will grow as the city itself grows. Population has increased from
2-3,000 in the early 1950's before CVG began i;ntensive operations to over 75,000
today.
5.Ob      EDELCA's sales will thus be relatedl to the growing requirements of
CADAFE, La Electricidad, and its own immediate customers. Since they are pro-
hibited from adding capacity of their own, EDELCA's market is in a sense guaran-
teed, so long as there is growth in the markets served by La Electricidad and
CADAFE. Given the nature of these markets one would have to postulate a
general stagnation of the economy to assume no growth in EDELCA's sales. The
three parties must agree each year on a five-year sales forecast which commits
the purchasing parties to "take or pay" for the amounts forecast.
5.05      During negotiations, it was deemed prudent to obtain an undertaking from
the Government that it will require its own agency CADAFE promptly to pay its
accounts with EDELCA. In the past CADAFE has had difficulty in collecting from
other government enterprises, notably the Caracas water supply system,. and
there is a general tendency to overlook delinque.nt intragovernmental accounts.

below in condensed form. Annex I presents more detail.

2,413   5,632   7,503   9,880  11,695
EDELCA's sales will apparently grow at a rate greater than those of CADAFE
and La Electricidad because Lhe base year - 1968 - shows very modest sales and
nearly all the growth of lnad in the other systems will be furnished by EDELCA.
5.07      The market forecast summarized above was arrived at by the three
parties jointly, and corresponds very closely to an independent survey made
by International Middle West Company (US), consultants to the interconnecting
parties. It differs from the forecast made in September 1966 in connection
with the appraisal for Loan 482-VE principally in that frequency conversion
has been delayed, arid certcin loads expected by CADAFE have failed to
materialize. The two forecasts are in fact closely parallel, but the later
lags the earlier by somewhat less than one year. The present forecast is
reasonable wider currept c:rcumstances, and forms a suitable basis for planning.
In any event, the power sales agreement assures EDELCA that CADAFE and La
Electricidad will pay for Guri generating capability once they have scheduled
future purchases based on jts availability, whether or not they use it.
Internal Rate of Return
5.08      Based upon the jointly-accepted market forecast, the operation of
the interconnection agreem iiL would require all ten generating units to be in
service by 1980.  This com*plres with a projected schedule made ipi 1966 during
the appraisal of the EHV facilities as shown in the table below.

*t - not estimated in 1961K-
The present schedule represents a delay of b-twoen two and three years.
This is attributable to several principal factors:
(i)  The delav of about 16 months in completion of
Guri dam itself and initial commercial operation
of the first three generating units;
(ii)  The delay in initiating frequency conversion of
La Electricidad's system, and thle purchase of the
60 MW aviation-engine gas turbine plant;
(iii)  The failure to materialize of certain loads
projected by CADAFE, and the i:?stallation of
gas-turbine peaking capacity in the Guri market
area.
The delays in market development and the installation of the gas turbines have
led to commensurate deferments in making the investments in the additional
units at Guri.
5.09      A calculation was made of the internal rate of return on all the
additional investment in the powerhouse and Units )4-10. Expenditures were
assumed to occur over the 12 years 1969-80, a,nd sales to continue for 20
years until 1988 in accordance with the contract La Electricidad entered into
with the Government in which it so obligated itself, in return for the guaran-
tee that the costs of conversion would be paiJ by the Government. These
assumptions should lead to a pessimistic view of the probable return since the
life of the facilities exceeds 20 years and sales based upon their capacity will
continue well beyond 1988. Using contractual prices for, power and energy, the
calculatioli indicates the return lies between 17% and 18%. Such a high return
is of course, due to the fact that the dam is treated as a "sunk cost".

VI., FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Performance
6.01      At the time Loans 353-VE and'482-VE were made in 1963 and 1967,
it was not expected that EDELCA's sales, revenues, or income would be
significant until the initial three Ouri units had been completed, and
La Electricidad's system converted to 60 cycle operation. As seen, Guri
is somewhat more than a year behind schedule, and frequency conversion a
further 1-1/2 years. These two effects have of course combined to produce
operating results somewhat less favorable than had been forecast earlier.
Results of 1968 operations are condensed below, together with comparable
figures forecast in October 1966.

EDELCA's accounts are audited by Price Waterhouse and are kept on an accept-
able and consistent basis.
6.02      Financial resources have been sufficient for the execution of both
Guri and the EHV Project. A temporary shortage of funds developed in mid-1967
as a consequence of EDELCA's obligations to Consorcio under the Financial
Agreement (paragraphs 2.04- 2.05) but'this was swiftly corrected with CVG
borrowings in the U.S. which allowed it to make advances to EDELCA. Both CVG
and EDELCA have enjoyed access to the federal budget for investment funds.

recovered from ConsQrci.o, EDELCA will repay,the Bank.

Projected Operations
6.o4      Except for certain industrial operations not yet firmly committed,
EDELCA's revenues from sales will be developed from contractual tariffs.
The principal tariffs are:
(i) La Electricidad and CADAFE, which contain prices for
demand and firm energy, and economyl/ (or fuel re-
placement) energy. The levels represent the result
of the bargaining leading to the interconnection
agreement.
(ii)  SIDOR and ALCASA, which are based solely on energy
consumption.
Until the mid-1970's when sales to CADAFE and La Electricidad become more
important, average sales revenue will be equivalent to about US3 mills per
kwh. From then on, average revenue will be about US4 mills. Details of the
tariffs in effect are shown in Annex 3.
6.05      Projected Income Sta!tements are shown in Annex h. Operating ex-
penses are projected from experience at Macagua, plus estimates for Guri and
the'EHV transmission system. Depreciation is calculated in accordance with
rates agreed upon in connection with Loan 353-VE.
6.o6      Both Loans 353-VE and 482 -VE contain performance criteria that re-
quire EDELCA to earn not less than 6% on its average net plant in 1973 and
later years. It is unlikely this target will be met, due primarily to two
factors:
(i) the failure of sales to develop as forecast earlier; and
(ii) EDELCA's decision to complete the powerhouse in one step,
making what had been originally conceived of as a fairly
well spread investment into a "lumpy" one.
The projections in this report assume all the civil works will be placed in
the :plant account when completed in 1973.2  The 8% target should, however,
be achieved in 1975 and later years. This estimated performance is consistent
with the several-year delay in market development. It would be reasonable to
waive the requirement for 1973 and 1974, particularly since the events leading
to the delays were beyond EDELCA's control.
1/ &ergy that is supplied on a "when available" basis, not under contract.
Its u§e generally enables the purchaser to reduce generation by thermal
units.
2/ Ifadjusted to prorate the investment in civil works over the last seven
units, the 8% target would still not be achieved. Results would be about
7.1% in 1')73 and 7.5% in 1974.

Financing Plan 1969 - 1980
6 07      The twelve-year period extending to the completion of the first
scage of Guri with 1,750 SW installed in 1980, can be conveniently divided
at the end of 1973 when the civil works for the powerhouse are expected to
be completed.  The iProject proposed for Bank financing will be executed in
the first five years of this period. The financing plan is presented below
in summary form and in detail in Annex 5.

6.08      EDEICA will require additional Government investments in ,970,
1971 and 1974, aggregating Bs 65.2 million, or equivalent credits.-/ These
could be on fairly short term, provided repayments were fixed for 1975 and
later. The proposed third Bank loan would complete the financing plan.
The future construction program beyond 1974 could be financed wholly from
internal sources, while at the same time EDELCA could begin to pay a cash
dividend on CVG's very large investment. This would be possible beginning
1975, and during 1975-80 would represent an average return of a little over
9%.
6.09      The financing plan is satisfactory.  During negotiations an under-
taking was obtained as to the sources of the funds needed in 1970-71. It
is expected that a law authorizing EDELCA to borrow from the Bank will contain
specific provisions for these funds.
6.10      The special provisions included in the previous Loans would be
maintained:
(i) A prohibition on cash dividends to CVG; this will be
extended to 1975;
(ii) The tariff covenant requiring a rate of return of 8%
in 1973 and later years; this will be waived for 1973
and 1974;
(iii) The debt limitation covenant, with an historic earnings
vs future maximum debt service coverage of 1.4 times.
VII. CONCLUSIONR
7.01      The proposed Project has been satisfactorily engineered, and the
cost estimates are conservatively stated. This is prudent in view of the
experience in the execution of the civil works for the initial phase of Guri.
7.02      Current construction programs for Guri Units Nos. 1-3 and the first
EHV system are proceeding satisfactorily. It is unlikely the final cost of
Guri, or the disposition of EDELCA's Special Advances to the general con-
tractor will be known for several years. The projections in this report assume
the most pessimistic (and unlikely) view that none of the Advances will be,
recovered.
7.03      Past operating results have not been as g9od as anticip,ate4, but
have not affected EDELCA's ability to carry out its large construction program.
Projected results are in general satisfactory, but the 8% rate of return target
of Loaps 353-VE and 482-iVE will not be met in 1973 as required.  This wiLl be
waived until 1975.
1/ The 1969 funds shown in Annex 5 as "Government Investment" for that year
are already budgeted.

7.Ob      The Project would form a suitable basis for a third loan of
US$ 31 million equivalent, for a term of 20 years including a period of
grace of about five years. During negotiations, EDELCA and the Govern-
ment confirmed that:
(i) satisfactory engineering arrangements will be continued
(paragraph 2.03);
(ii) EDELCA will complete the installation of Units 5 through
10 in a reasonable time (paragraph 4.08);
(iii) CADAFE will promptly pay EDELCA for all purchases under
the power sales a#,reement (paragraph 5.05);
(iv) funds to complete the financing plan in 1970 and 1971
will be arranged on satisfactory terms (paragraph 6.08);
and
(v)  the special provisions of Loans 353-VE and 482-VE re-
lating to the President's capabilities (paragraph 2.02)
and financial performance (paragraph 6.10) will be
maintained with appropriate amendments in the proposed
loan.

ANNEX 3
VENEZUELA
EDELCA
Tariff Structure
1. Interconnected System
EDELCA will furnish firm power (contract demand) to both CADAFE
and La Electricidad in accordance with 5-year load forecasts as provided
for in the interconnection agreement. This power carries with it
5,256 hours use of demand annually, corresponding to 60% load factor.
In addition, CADAFE and La Electricidad may purchase secondary hydroelectric
energy at a much reduced price. The prices fixed by the agreement are
summarized below:
Contract Demand         Secondary Energy
Bs per kw per month       centimos per kwh
CADAFE                        8.250                   0.495
La Electricidad              12.375                   0.600
These prices are, in the case of La Electricidad, equivalent to US$33 per
kw-year, and US1.3 mills per secondary kwh. CADAFE's prices are lower on
two accounts:
(i) CADAFE is providing 230-kv transmission facilities
between the Guayana region and the north-central
market area; and
(ii) CADAFE's fixed charges for alternate thermal generating
facilities are less than La Electricidad's by virtue of
CADAFE's lower earnings and lower taxes on income.
2. Guayana Industries
Industrial sales in the Guayana are based on simple energy tariffs,
without regard to demand. The principal tariffs are shown below, with their
equivalents in United States currency.
