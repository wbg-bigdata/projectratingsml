BHUTAN
DEVELOPMENT CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 The Kingdom of Bhutan
Beneficiary:              Bhutan Carbide and Chemicals Ltd. (BCC)
(a Joint Venture Enterprise)
Amount:                   Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 9.4 million
(US$9.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                    Standard
Relending Terms:          The Government will relend the Credit to BCC for a
a term of fourteen years, including a grace period
of four years and interest at 10.25% per annum.
BCC will bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project Objectives        Bhutan is endowed with large-scale deposits of
and Description:         coomercially exploitable limestone, dense and
maturing forests that can provide wood for
charcoal for use as a reductant, and substantial
hydroelectric power potential which is beginning
to be exploited. The project aims at utilizing
these basic inputs for production of calcium
carbide, mainly for export, to help Bhutan earn
much-needed foreign exchange revenues for its
economic development. The project would augment
the country's limited industrial base, increase
financial self-reliance and help train manpower in
industrial production, mining and forestry. The
project, with a capacity to produce 22,000 tons
per year of calcium carbide, would be located at
Pasakha in Southern Bhutan. The project would
include: (i) a calcium carbide plant; (ii)
limestone mining; (iii) forestry; and (iv)
charcoal plants. In addition, the project
provides for necessary infrastructure, technical
assistance and training.
Risks:                    The successful operation of many similar carbide
plants in India indicates that there would be no
inordinate technical risks. However, there could
be potential risks due to the need for
considerable coordination in project execution,
lack of trained manpower, delays in start-up and
commissioning, difficulties in sustaining high



- vi -
capacity utilization, and problems in marketing
calcium carbide. To address these risks, the
Government would establish an Inter-Ministerial
Committee for overall project coordination and
implementation of infrastructure and upstream
facilities. Under the project, foreign
consultants and technical advisory services (until
two years after project completion) would be
engaged. Suitable and experienced personnel would
be recruited from neighboring countries and
counterpart staff given training locally and
abroad. Technical performance guarantees would be
obtained from the contractors and implementation
supervised by experienced consultants. Bhutan's
long-term sales arrangements, already concluded
with Indian companies, would reduce marketing
risks.

BHUTAN - CALCIUM CARBIDE PROJECT
I   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Royal Government of Bhutan (RCB) has requested the
International Development Association (IDA) for assistance ln financing a
Calcium Carbide Project (the Project) to be built on a greenfield site at
Pasakha, about 10 km from Phuntsholing town, in southern Bhutan, close to
the Indian border (IBRD Map 18520). The Project will be implemented and
operated by Bhutan Carbide and Chemicals Limited (DCC), a joint venture
company established in October 1984, with 80 equity participation from the
Government and 202 from Tashi Commercial Corporation (TCC), a leading
private company in Bhutan. TCC will provide management assiatance and the
key personnel for the Company during the project lmplementatlon and
subsequent operation.
1.02      The Project is the first major chemical Industrial complex
in Bhutan; it will produce calclum carbide matnly for export to neighboring
India and Bangladesh. The Project is part of an overall plan of the
Government to achieve greater financial self-reliance by utillsing the
country's natural resource endowment to increase foreign exchange and
public revenue earnings.
1.03      Bhutan has comparative advantage in the production of caleium
carbide for export because of the availability of large reserves of qualtty
limestone, extenalve wood resources, proximity to the main market (i.e.
steel and engineering Industries In Eastern India) and, with the completion
of the 336 MW Chukha Hydroelectric Project in 1985/86. an ample source of
cheap power. Quality limestone, a good grade carbonaceous reductant (e.g.
charcoal) and electric power are the basic inputs required for calcium
carbide production. Bhutan has an abundant endowment of limestone. The
limestone/dolomite reserves are etimaLed at approximately 28 btillion tons.
of whIch about 11 billton Lons are In southern Bhutan. The chemical grade
limestone (of over 922 calcium carbonate content) of the types required for
the Project is conservatively estimaLed at 10 of the total reserves.
1.04      Calcium carbide is a brsic inorpanic chemical with varied
industrial uses, the most stgntficant of which Is the prodiction of
acetylene gas used for CutLing steel plates and weldinx In engtnecrinR
industries. Other uses include Lhe manUfacture of Acetylene black, used in
dry-cell battery producLtion; desulfurizatton compound. used in the
producLtion of low sulfur carbon steel; chlorinated solvents, used in the
chemical industry: and carbide fines, used for the early ripening of
fruits, e.g. pineapples, marngoes, bananas. etc. Further. low pressure
acetylene gas is used In some cases for rural illumination.  Liquifted
petroleum gas (LPG) could compete Vith aceyLvene for cutting Llhin steel
plates and for low temperaLtre weldinK. However, LPG: would not he able to
replace aceLylene for ctiLL[ng thick plates and high temperature weldingt.
Although acetylene use In deculfurizing compounds and chlorinated solvents
might face limited competition frnm sLbwtftt,tes. this ts not l1kelv to he



- 2 -
significant, especially In the proposed prolect's marketing areas.
Acetylene use In the nanufacture of dry-cell batteries does not face any
competition from substitutes.
1.05      The use of carbide for the purposes mentioned above Is expected
to grow In the world. However, its use as the ch-mical faedatock for the
production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), acrylates, vinyl acetate monomer,
vinyl fluoride etc., has declined over the years in the face of competition
from hydrocarbons. This trend is likely to continue in the future, but it
will be offset by Increases in the non-chemical uses explalned In para 1.04
above. These market trends have been taken into account In reviewing the
export market prospects for carbide from the proposed Project.
1.06      The Project will have a capacity to produce 22,000 tons per year
(tpy) of carbide using an econosic lse 12 megavolt ampere (MVA) open
rotating type furnace. The capaclty of the Project has been determined
taking into account the export prospects to India and Bangladesh. (The
Company has already made long-term marketing arrangements for the sale of
products from the Project). Apart from the furnace, the main components of
the Project are the limektln, raw materlal storage and handling systems,
product handling and packaging units, water and power distribution
facilitles. office and amenity huildings, and faclittles for meeting the
main raw material requirements of this Project (i.e. limestone, wood and
charcoal).
1.07      The Project is estnmated to cost about USS23.9 million, Including
US$19.6 million in foreign exchange. IDA Is co-financing this Project with
the Kuwalt Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) and the Government of
Norway. IDA will provide a credit of US$9 million equivalent, while KFAED
will provide KD 2 million (US$6.6 million equivalent). The Government of
Norway Is considering a grant of NKr 35 million (USS3.9 millton equivalent)
for Lhe procurement of the carbide furnace and related equipment and
services from Norway. one of the leading producers of such equlpment.
1.08      The Project would be the largest commercial project undertaken in
BhuLan after the Chukha Hydroelectric ProjecL and the Penden Cement Plant.
Considering Lhat Bhutan is a small country (pop. 1.2 million) with limited
experience in industrial project evaluation and implementation, IDA has
been playing an lmporLanL role in ensuring that the projlect-sponsors paid
adequate atLention to Improving the project scope and designing adequate
Lraining, tmplementarion and operational arrangements.
1.09      Since one of Lhe major raw materials for carbide produccton Is
charcoal produced from wood, che success of the Project is closely linked
to the efficient management of Bhutan's forestry resoures. IDA Is already
Involved in the development of Lhe forestry secLor In Bhutan, having
approved in FY 1984 a USS5.5 milllon credit for the Forestry Development
Project (CrediL No. 1460-lHU). Wood from this projecL which focuses on
reforestation, would be used to meet part of the charcoal needs of the
Carbide Project.

1.10      The Project wVs appraised in June 1984 by an IDA mission
conoisting of Messrs. Y.T. Shetty (Chief), R. Bhan, K.S. Misra (Consultant)
and H. McCarty (Consultant). A post-appraisal mission consisting of
Messrs. Shetty, M.N. Srinivas (Consultant) and Gunter Antonius (Consultant)
visited Bhutan in September 1984 mainly to firm up the raw material supply
arrangements and also to review the sociological impact of the Project.
II. RHUTAN'S ECONOMY AND INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A.   Resource Base
2.01      Bhutan lles In the heart of the vast Himalayan mountain ranges.
In the west and east are the hill districts of India, in the south, the
Indian plains; and in the north, the Tibet region of China. It has a total
area of 47,000 square km and its population is estimated to be about 1.2
million. The country is mountainous with three separate climatic zones:
Upper Himalayas In the north and northeast (3,000-7,500 meters above the
sea level, Renerally snow-bound or covered mainly with dry vegetation);
Inner Himalayas in the central region (1,000-3,000 meters high, covered
mAinly with coniferous forests); and the Southern Foothills (up to 1,000
meters high, which have tropical climate and are covered with hardwood
forests).
2.02      Bhutan has immense forest wealth with more than half of the
country covered with woods, At the lower altitude, species such as sal,
trak, khair, sisso, gamari. mahogany, and champ are plentiful; the central
foothills are cloaked with oak, walnut, noplar, maple, chirpine, and birch;
and at the higher reaches are the conifers--blue pine, fir, spruce, larch,
hemlock, juniper, etc. Northern Bhutan has mostly soft woods (which make
weaker charcoal) while the southern part has hardwood forests (good for
quality charcoal).
2.03      Considering its small size, relatively abundant mineral deposits
are found in Bhutan, especlally of limestone, dolomite, slate, graphite,
gypsum, coal, copper, etc. The largest known mineral is limestone/dolomite
whose rcerves of various grades are estimated at 28 biliton tons. High-
quality (chemical grade) limestone has been found at Hauri Khola, Purbia
Khola. Kaleshwar, Mirchang, Nangalam, Ha, and Paro. Bhutan also has vast
hydroelectric power potential. The present installed capacity is, however,
small--only 5 MW. It is expected to increase sharply when the 336 MW
5hukha Hydroelectric Project on the Wangchu River is completed in stages
during 1985-86. This would make Bhutan surplus in power for many years to
come as its requirement is not likely to exceed 40 MW by the end of this
decade. The surplus will be exported to India.
B.   Economic Development
2.04      Bhutan's economv is predominantly agricultural, providing
livelihood for about 90% of the population. The main farm crops are rice,
wheat. barley, corn and millet. Agriculture accounts for about half of the
gross domestic product. Since 1961, the development process has been



- 4 -
guided by the national five-year development plans. The first three plans
concentrated on public works (particularly road construction), road
transport systems, agriculture, health and education. The Fourth Plan
(1976-81) and the Fifth Plan (1981-86) have expanded the focus to i.aclude
development of power, forestry, mines and industry.
C.   Industrial Sector
2.05      The major constraints to industrial development in the past have
been inadequate power, communications and trained manpower, and a limited
domestic market. The power problem is being overcome with the construction
of the Chukha Hydroelectric Project. The necessary communications for the
development of industries in selected locations have been made available.
The Government is encouraging export-o,!ented industries to overcome the
constraint of limited local market and also to help earn the much-needed
foreign exchange and public revenues. The shortage of trained manpower for
construction, operation, maintenance, management, marketing, etc., is being
covered by hiring expatriates, mostly from the neighboring countries (e.g.
India, Nepal and Bangladesh). As wage rates and salary scales for
expatriates are higher than those received by then in the neighboring
countries and as expatriate earnings are tax free, Bhutan faces no problem
in attracting adequate expatriates. At the same time, the Government is
making concerted efforts to develop educational institutions in the country
and to train abroad an increasing number of its nationals.
2.06      General education starLed in Bhutan about 30 years ago.   Since
then, considerable progress has been made in setting up primary and
secondary schools and technical training institutions. There are two
polytechnics: the Royal Bhutan Polytechnic at Phuntsholing, which trains
annually 30 electrical and 30 civil diploma technicians; and the Kharbandi
Technical School, which trains annually 33 mechanical and electrical
technicians. There being no local institute for engineering degree,
selected Bhutanese students study abroad, mostly in India, Bangladesh, the
UK and the US. There is thus considerable dependency on training outside
the country, particularly for higher education. There is also a plan to
strengthen the existing Institute of Management. In the Government and
associated agencies, local people at the higher levels are well educated
and exposed to external environment.
2.07      There is at present very limited industrial activity in the
country. Apart from cottage industries producing handicrafts, and some
small-scale industries, there are very few medium and large-scale
industries. The latter consist of one fruit processing plant, one cement
plant, one resin plant, and a veneer/plywood plant at Gedu. A particle
board project near Phuntsholing is under construction.
2.08      Since Bhutan has a small population, and much ot it engaged in
agriculture, it is difficult to get labor for construction and industrial
work.  Even agricultural labor is scarce especially at the harvest time and
is quite expensive.  However, it is to be noted that people are quite
capable of learning skills and are hardworking. While there is shortage of
local labor, there is also a desire to keep down the involvement of
expatriate labor for social reasons, to avoid disruptions in the local



culture. As a result, the country appears to opt for capital-intensive
medium and large-scale export-voriented industries whici require relatively
limited labor for operations. The small industries would continue to be
associated with rural and agricultural activities, providing secondary
employment to the local population.
2.09      The economic development strategy of the country is to utilize
the country's natural resources where it has a competitive advantage. In
this context, the country is trying to use: (i) forest resources to produce
timber, charooal, plywood, particle board, veneers, match splints, pencil
slats, resin, turpentine, calcium carbide, etc.; and (ii) mineral resources
like limestone, dolomite, marble, slate, graphite, slate, coal, etc., to
produce building materials (e.g. cement, limAe, bricks, etc.) and processed
products (e.g. calcium carbide); and (iii) agricultural resources to
produce rice flour, edible oils, dairy products, wool, etc. In order to
attract industry to certain locations, a few industrial estates are being
proposed, including the one at Pasakha, adjacent to the proposed Calcium
Carbide Project.
2.10      Development of institutions for industrial finance has been a
rather recent activity. Today industrial finance is available from the
Bank of Bhutan, the Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan (RICB), and the
Unit Trust of Bhutan. The Government's policy is to stimulate industrial
and related activities, as far as possible through private and joint
enterprises. The Government does not participate in small-scale enter-
prises (with an investment of less than US$1 million equivalent). The
Government also encourages private participation in medium and large-scale
plants. The Government emphasizes that even in companies where it holds
majority interest, they should be managed as autonomous corporations with
professional management, and with clearly-defined management autonomy and
financial accountability. Once a plant is established and operating well,
the Government intends to allow the sale of its shares to private
individuals, with the aim of ultimately reducing its participation to about
20% in such joint ventures.
III. CODMPANY AND SPONSORS
A.  Company Organization and Management
3.01      The Project will be implemented and operated by Bhutan Carbide &
Chemicals Ltd. (BCC) which was incorporated as a limited liability company
in October 1984 under the Companies Act of Bhutan, and has its headquarters
in Phuntsholing. BCC has an authorized share capital of Nu 90 million
(approximately US$6.2 riliion equivalent) of which the Government would own
80%, and Tashi Commercial Corporation (TCC) the remaining 20%. Further, in
line with its industrial policy, the Government intends to sell the
majority of its shares to the general public after the Project is
commissioned and operating well, thus ultimately reducing its equity in the
corporation to 20%.
3.02      BCC has a five-member Board of Directors of whom four are
nominated by the Government and one by TCC. The term of the directors is



- 6 -
for five years aaid they are eligible for re-appointment. The Chairman of
the Board is one of the members nominated by the Government; the Managing
Director is nominated by TCC. The Board has to meet at least four times in
a year; special meetings of the Board could be convened by the Chairman or
the Managing Director if at least half the board members request such
meetings. Currently, Deputy Planning Minister is the Chairman of the
Board. The other three Government board members are: Secretary, Ministry
of Trade, Industry and Mines; Managing Director, Royal Monetary Authority;
and Director of Forests. The proprietor of TCC, a leading Bhutanese
industrialist, is the Managing Director of BCC, and the fifth Board member.
3.03      The Managing Director has autonomy in managing the day-to-day
operations of BCC. He has the right to frame new rules and modify the
existing ones for better management of the Company, Re is empowered to
determine the remuneration (wages and salaries, and fringe benefits) of the
employees and has the right to hire and fire. He also has adequate
financial powers to authorize expenditures and make payment arrangemwLLts
for efficient operations and maintenance of the Company. He couid delegate
all or any of the powers vested in him. Following this provision, the
current Managing Director will appoint by June 30, 1986 a competent General
Manager with extensive experience in operating calcium carbide plants.
A capable and experienced Project Manager who is responsible for project
implementation has already been appointed (para 6.02).
3.04      The top management of BCC would receive technical advisory
services for implementation, commissioning and initial operation of the
Project from Shriram Projects and Engineering Services (SPES), of Delhi
Cloth Mills (DCM), India. DCM is one of the leading producers of calcium
carbide in India and has extensive experience in project implementation and
operation (para 6.01). The Indian firm has already been contracted for
this purpose. Agreement was reached that the technical advisory services
will be used by BCC during the project implementation period as well as for
at least two years after the Project is commissioned. Further, TCC, under
a Shareholders' Agreement between the Government and TCC, will provide the
necessary management support and key personnel, recruiting them as
necessary with the help of the technical advisory firm. Signing of the
Shareholders' Agreement will be a condition of Credit effectiveness (para
3.06).
3.05      The Company will require about 500 employees.  Most of the
engineering, management and accounting personnel, and technicians are
expected to be hired from the neighboring countries (mostly from India) as
there is shortage of trained manpower in Bhutan (para 6.08).
B.  Tashi Commercial Corporation (TCC)
3.06      As noted, TCC is participating with the Government in
establishing the proposed Calcium Carbide Project. TCC is a sound, well
managed private corporation with diversified operations. It started as a
trading company and moved into manufacturing, mining and forestry
development. Today it owns 17 small and medium-size companies almost all
of which have been showing profit. Its annual sales amount to about Nu 250
million (US$19.2 million equivalent) and its total assets are estimated at



Nu 97 million (US$7.5 million equivalent). The Company has strong trading
ard product marketing capability and has developed a marketing network in
India to supply agro-industrial products. The Company's financial position
is sound. Its audit report for 1983 shows a current ratio of 3.5:1 and a
debt/equity ratio of 5:95 for the Company. Considering its financial
soundness and past profitable operations, TCC is not likely to face any
problem in finding from its internal cash generation the Nu 18 million
(US$1.14 million equivalent) over a three-year period for its equity
participation in the Project. TCC has already established a modern
charcoal plant (capacity: 1,000 tpy) and first priority will be given to
supply the charcoal from this plant to the proposed Project at a reasonable
negotiated price. Further, TCC will '-e prepared to invest in more charcoal
plants in case there is need and if the Government requests TCC to do so.
The obligations of TCC regarding the Carbide Project have been specified in
a draft Shareholders' Agreement between the Government and TCC which was
reviewed by IDA during negotiations. As noted, the signing of the
Shareholders' Agreement will be a condition of Credit effectiveness. The
Shareholders' Agreement includes commitments from the Government and TCC
that they will ensure that adequate measures are taken to provide adequate
living quarters to the construction and operating labor for the proposed
Project which includes facilities in different locations for limestone
mining, forestry, charcoal making and carbide production. In addition, the
Shareholders' Agreement specifies that the Government and TCC will jointly
provide an overall input supply commitment to the Project covering
quantity, quality and timing consistent with the Project's operating
requirements and schedule.
IV. MARKET, MARKETING ANn PRJ5ES
A.     Uses of Calcium Carbide
4.01      Calcium carbide is a versatile product.  It is used to produce
acetylene for metal cutting and welding in the engineering industries.
Purther, carbide is needed for the production of desulfurization compound
which is, in turn, used in the steel industry to produce low-sulfur carbon
steel. In addition, carbide is required for the manufacture of acetylene
black which is used for the production of dry-cell batteries. It is also
used in the production of chemicals such as polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl
chloride (PVC), polyvinyl alcohol, acrylonitrile, neoprene rubber, acetic
acid, chloroprene, trichlorethylene, perchloroethylene, etc.
4.02      Acetylene is the most common fuel gas used along with oxygen for
brazing, cutting, welding and hard surfacing operations in the engineering
industries. The other fuel gases used are hydrogen, propane, and butane.
These gases, which give lower heat and temperature compared to acetylene,
are used generally for cutting thin plates (less than one inch thick) and
for low temperature welding. Acetylene is very effective for cutting thick
plates (more than one inch thick) and for high-temperature welding.
Acetylene is, therefore, preferred to LPG for cutting and welding thick
metals in reactors and pressure vessels, etc. Acetylene is also used to
produce: (i) acetylene black which is used in the manufacture of dry-cell



batteries; and (ii) chloro-solvents which have chemical uses. While the
use of carbide-derived acetylene is expected to increase for the above
uses, its use for the manufacturing of PVC and related chemicals have
registered a decline in the world because of competition from hydrocarbons
(e.g. natural gas and naphtha). However, following the steep increases in
hydrocarbon prices during the 1970s, the substitution has slowed down and
some countries (e.g. Japan) are showing renewed interest in acetylene-based
chemical processes.
B.     World Outlook
4.03      Statistics on world capacity, consumption, production and trade
are not readily available. The Bank staff who tried to gather information
from different sources, have been able to get fairly detailed data for 1981
and very limited data for the following years. The world carbide capacity
was about 8.5 million tons in 1981. The capacity is expected to show some
contraction in the future because of the ongoing structural changes in the
the carbide industry which is highly energy-intensive. Plants which have
easy access to low economic cost power and high-quality limestone and
carbonaceous materials (coke, charcoal, etc.) are stabilizing their
position while those facing constraints with respect to power and
high-quality raw materials are phasing out. New addition to capacity would
come mainly from countries which have a sound base for efficient production
of calcium carbide and which are close to markets (as transportation of
carbide is expensive). In less developed countries, the restructuring of
the carbide industry is not as pronounced as in the developed countries,
particularly because of comparatively lower energy costs and the reluctance
to close the existing plants because of social reasons. Further, the
consumption of carbide in developing countries tends to be more intensive
than in developed countries because of the tradition of repairing and using
the existing machinery and equipment and vehicles as long as possible.
4.04      Such repair work involves the use of acetylene for welding and
metal cutting. The following table shows world consumption, production,
exports and imports of calcium carbide in 1981 by main regions/countries:

4.05       Eastern Europe is the leading consumer of calcium carbide
followed by Asia and the Far East. The consumption of carbide is low in
the US because about 75Z of its acetylene needs are met from hydrocarbons
and the remaining 25X from calcium carbide. China is the leading producer
of calcium carbide in the world followed by the German Democratic Republic
(GDR) of Germany, the Soviet Union, Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany
(FRG), Poland, and the US. Romania is the leading exporter of carbide
followed by Norway, Poland, Taiwan, Federal Republic of Germany, China and
Czechoslovakia. The USSR, the UK, Indonesia, Hungary, Japan,
Belgium/Luxembourg and Pakistan are the leading importers of carbide in the
world.
4.06      As noted, calcium carbide is not a commonly traded commodity over
long distances because it cannot be transported in bulk. It could be
exported only in drums. The total world exports of carbide represents a
relatively small share (6Z) of world production. North America, Latin
America, Australia and Africa do not export carbide in any significant
quantities. By and large, Eastern Europe is the leading exporter of
calcium carbide but it is not exporting to India under any trading
arrangements. The main market for the Bhutanese carbide would be India
where there is an acute shortage of carbide but imports are discouraged
with high tariffs (140%). However, as noted, under the existing free trade
arrangements with India, Bhutan will be able to export carbide to that
country without any tariffs. Even if India were to reduce the tariffs
in the future, Bhutan would still be in a competitive position to supply
the Indian market because of the proximity and its comparative advantage in



- 10 -
the production of carbide. As the quantity of carbide traded in the world
is limited, the risk of dumping that product in India by any country is not
high. Pakistan, Singapore, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are some of the other
importers (see above table) to whom Bhutan would be able to supply on a
competitive basis.
C.   World Prices of Calcium Carbide
4.07      The world prices of carbide vary considerably depending on the
size of the drums in which it is packed. For example, in February 1985,
the carbide prices (f.o.b., Western Europe) were about US$500/ton for
carbide supplied in 50 kg drums; US$470/ton for carbide exported in 100 kg
drums; and US$400/ton for carbide supplied in 2.5-ton containers.  As
carbide has to be used soon after the drums are opened to avoid absorption
of moisture by carbide, exports in smaller containers help avoid wastage.
By and large, 100 kg containers are used for exporting carbide as is
envisaged under the proposed Project in Bhutan. However, some large users
prefer to import in larger containers because of the price advantage.
4.08      The carbide export prices show considerable fluctuations as in
the case of chemicals and fertilizers. At 1984 terms, the average price
(for carbide exported in small, medium and large containers) in 1970 was
US$564/ton but it declined in the following years, reaching low levels in
1975, 1976 and 1980 largely because of the industrial recession in the
world. However since 1981, the average prices have recovered
significantly as shown in the following table:
Ave. Carbide Prices (FOB, Western Europe)
(In 1984 US$/ton)
1981                           345
1982                           386
1983                           400
1984                           430
1985 (est.)                    450
Even though average carbide prices have risen to the level of US$450/ton
and they might go up further partly because of the world economic recovery
and partly because of contraction of the world capacity due to the
restructuring efforts underway in the world carbide industry (para 4.03),
an average price of US$430/ton (f.o.b., Western Europe) is conservatively
used for the economic rate of return of the Bhutanese Project.
D.   Market for Bhutan's Carbide
4.09      The present consumption of calcium carbide in Bhutan is hardly 50
tpy and the scope for growth of demand there is not significant. The main
market for calcium carbide from the proposed Project would be India. Part
of the production could also be exported to Bangladesh which currently
imports annually about 3,000 tons and its import requirements could double
during the next decade. It is assumed that Bhutan would be able to export



- 11 -
approximately 3,000 tpy to Bangladesh and the rest (19,000 tpy at full
production) to India. As the main market is in India, a detailed analysis
of the carbide demand/supply situation there is presented in the seccions
below.
1.   Carbide Industry in India
4.10      There are at present seven calcium carbide plants in India.  Of
these, two plants (capacity: 78,000 tpy) are captive units -- one estab-
lished in 1965 and expanded in 1975, and the other commissioned in 1963 --
producing calcium carbide exclusively for the captive production of
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and related chemicals through the acetylene
route. Though the acetylene-based PVC production has declined in India in
line with the world trend, the two Indian companies (both private)
producing PVC based on calcium carbide find their operation still economi-
cally viable, considering the sunk costs, and intend to continue producing
PVC based on calcium carbide. Therefore, it is assumed that che two
companies will continue to produce calcium carbide for captive production
of PVC and related chemicals. There are five other producers (capacity:
105,400 tpy) who produce merchant calcium carbide for outside users, mainly
engineering, steel, dry-cell battery, and chloro-solvent industries. The
demand for merchant calcium carbide in these industries is expected to show
a continual increase. To meet part of the future demand, three new plants
(capacity: 46,000 tpy) are currently under implementation. Once these
plants are completed (most probably by 1987/88), the total merchant carbide
capacity in India would increase to 151,100 tons. No capacity expansion is
likely beyond this level considering the fact that the quality of limestone
available in India is generally poor and the current serious shortage of
electric power is not likely to be overcome fully for many years to come.
As noted, electric power and high-quality limestone are two of the three
most important inputs for carbide production (the third important Input is
charcoal).
4.11      Primarily due to the lack of power and quality limestone, the
capacity utilization in the existing carbide plants in India has been low.
The average capacity utilization in 1980/81 was about 66% for the merchant
plants. The capacity utilization is projected to increase from the current
level of 66% to about 80X by 1985/86 as the power supply situation improves
in India. As for the three new plants, two of which are expected to be
commissioned by 1986/87 and one in 1987/88, the capacity utilization is
forecast to rise gradually from 60Z in the first year of operation to 70%
in the second year and 80% in the third year and onwards, assuming the
power supply situation in India improves considerably by then. Based on
the above assumptions, the total merchant carbide production is likely to
reach 123,000 tons by 1989/90 (Annexes 4-1 and 4-2). The completion of one
of the merchant plants, i.e., the Orissa plant (capacity: 14,850 tpy),
which received a letter of intent from the Government of India in 1972, is
not yet certain because the private sponsors are reevaluating the viability
of the project in the context of the power and limestone constraints in
India. If that plant is not completed, the total merchant production would
be only 115,000 tons by 1989/90.

Industry, India.
4.13      The total carbide consumption reached 92,460 tons in 1982/83, but
it dropped in 1983/84 mainly because of the slower than anticipated growth
of the engineering and steel industries, and the lower than expected
capacity utilization in the carbide plants because of the power supply
problem. It is estimated that the consumption in 1984/85 would reach about
96,000 tons (para 4.23). The average annual growth rate of carbide
consumption works out to 9.5% during the last decade (1974/75 -1984/85).
3.   Demand in Engineering Goods Industry
4.14      The engineering industry is the largest user of carbide in the
form of acetylene which is generated by the reaction of water on carbide.
Acetylene when Ignited with oxygen emits very high temperatures
facilitating welding, metal cutting, etc., in the fabrication of
engineering goods. Acetylene for this purpose is supplied mostly in
cylinders by dissolved acetylne (DA) gas plants. There are at present 74
DA gas plants in India with an installed capacity of 22.8 million Nm3. An
additional 64 plants have been licensed with a total capacity of 12.4
million Nm3. The total capacity of the existing and licensed plants Is
35.2 million. It is projected that the total operational capacity of those



- 13 -
plants would reach at least 30 million Nm3 by 1989/90. Assuming that one
ton of carbide on average gives about 255 Nm of acetylene gas, the carbide
requirement for DA gas production is projected at 118,000 tons in 1989/90.
In addition, there are small in situ producers of low-pressure acetylene
gas mainly to meet the needs of welding and metal cutting in small
workshops for repairing motor vehicles and farm equipment. Such workshops
require at present about 20,000 tons of carbide. This requirement Is
expected to increase to about 28,000 tons by 1989/90. At full production,
the producers of both dissolved and low-pressure acetylene gas would
require about 146,000 tpy of carbide by 1989/90. However, considering the
power and other infrastructure constraints in the country, it is unlikely
that these plants would be able to operate at more than 80% capacity by
that time. Based on this assumption, it is projected that the acetylene
gas plants could consume about 117,000 tpy of carbide by 1989/90 to produce
acetylene for the engineering goods industry.
4.15      As noted, the engineering goods industry is a major user of
acetylene produced from calcium carbide. India has a well-developed
engineering goods industry which consists of: (i) basic metals and alloys
(steel and steel casting, steel pipes and tubes, transmission towers,
structurals, aluminum, copper, lead/and zinc); (ii) metal products (wire
ropes, weldlng electrodes, bolts, nuts and rivets); (iii) non-electrical
machinery (boilers, diesel engines, earthmoving equipment, cranes,
power-driven pumps, compressors, ball and roller bearings, agricultural
tractors, road rollers, machine tools, air-conditioners, refrigerators,
sugar machinery, mining machinery, metallurgical machinery, chemical and
pharmaceutical machinery, and cement machinery); (iv) electrical machinery
(power transformers, electric motors, radio receivers, dry cells, etc.);
and (v) transport equipment (rail wagons, commercial vehicles, cars, jeeps,
scooters, three-wheelers, bicycles, etc.). Today the engineering goods
industry accounts for more than one-third of the total industrial value
added and 30% of the total non-traditional exports of India.
4.16      During the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1984/85-1989/90), India
proposes do give concerted attention to: (i) the modernization and
expansion of the traditional industries producing mass consumption goods
like sugar, vegetable oils, drugs, textiles, paper, and consumer durables;
(ii) the removal of bottlenecks in the development of the country in the
field of power, coal, and communications; (iii) better maintenance and
increased capacity utilization in the existing industries; iv) expansion of
the energy sector with emphasis on oil exploration, production,
refining/conversion, gas gathering and distribution, energy conservation
and inter-fuel substitution; (v) increased use of gas for chemical and
petrochemical production; and (vi) rapid expansion of transport equipment
sector (especially biczcles, commercial vehicles, three wheelers, cars,
scooters, and rail wagons).. As a result of the above factors, the
engineering goods industry production in India is expected to expand
rapidly during the next decade. The primary emphasis is on optimizing the
existing capacity in this industry (the capacity utilization in many of the
engineering goods industry in 1983/84 was less than 60%). As increased
capacity utilization is achieved along with capacity expansion in the
sector, the average annual growth of production in the engineering goods
industry is expected to reach at least 10 during the next decade with the



- 14 -
anticipated easing of the infrastruCture constraints. The Sixth Five-Year
Plan (1979/80-1984/85) target for the growth of this industry is 10.2%.
However, the actual growth rate for 1980-1985 is not likely to exceed 7%
because of Lhe industrial recession and infrasLructure bottlenecks.
4.17      The demand for calcium carbide by the engineering goods industry
to meet its aceLylene needs is estimated at 72,300 tons for 1984/85. The
demand is projected to grow at least at 7% a year in line with the average
annual rate during the past five years but below the 10% rate of growth
forecast by the Government of India for the engineering industries. On
this basis, the demand for calcium carbide by this industry is projected to
reach 101,405 tons by 1989/90.
4.   Demand in Steel Industry
4.18      The total steel ingot capacity is expected to increase from about
14.4 million tons in 1982/83 to 20.3 million tons by 1989/90. A major part
of the increase in capacity would be for low-carbon steel whose production
capacity is expected to rise from 1.7 million tons in 1982/83 to about 4.5
million tons by 1989/90 as result of the modernization/expansion programs
underway at the existing steel plants at Durgapur (which is expected to be
completed in 1988) and Burnpur (to be completed in 1989), and the
establishment of the new steel plant at Visakhapatnam (to be completed in
1990). Every ton of low-carbon steel requires 8 kg of desulfurizing
compound. On this basis, the total requirement of desulfurizing compound
would be about 35,500 tons by 1989/90. Currently, India has only one
desulfurizing compound facility (capacity: 10,200 tpy), established as a
part of the Rourkela Steel Plant in northeast India. Every ton of
desulfurizing compound requires 0.75 tons of calcium carbide. Based on
this and assuming that by 1989/90, the existing low-carbon steel unit at
Rourkela would operate at 80% capacity and the other three units being
established would operate at 70% capacity (in the second year of their
operation), the total requirement of calcium carbide for the production of
desulfurizing compound for the steel industry would be about 19,640 tons by
1989/90. The existing and proposed capacity for low-carbon steel and
desulfurization compound and the requirement of calcium carbide in 1989/90
for desulfurization compound are given below:

In addition, the Tata Iron and Steel Co. (TISCO) has plans to modernize and
expand Its steel complex at Jamshedpur. Under this program, It in planning
to produce about I million tons of low-sulfur carbon steel. If this
program is also completed by 1989/90, the total requirement of calcium
carbide in India for desulfurizing compound may go up to about 25,000 tpy.
The requirement by TISCO is not taken into account in the projections as
its expansion plans have not been firmed up so far.
5. Demand in Dry-Cell Battery Industry
4.19      The use of acetylene black, a calcium-carbide-based product, is
increasing rapidly in India for Lhe production of dry-cell batteries for
use in torch lights, transistors, etc. Each ton of acetylene black
requires about 4 tons of calcium carbide. In 1984/85, the demand for
acetylene black is estimated at 2,850 tons, requiring about 11,400 Lons of
calcium carbide. The demand for acetylene black is projected to grow at an
average annual rate of about 7X in line with the expansion of the dry-cell
battery industry. On this basis, the demand for acetylene black Is
expecLed to reach 4,00' tons by 1989/90, requiring 16,000 tons of calcium
carbide for its local production. At present, there are two acetylene
black plants in India with a total capacity of 4,000 tpy.
6. Demand in Chloro-Solvent Industry
4.20      As noted, calcium carbide is also used for the production of
chloro-solvents such as perochloroethylene and trichloroethylene. The
chloro-solvenL industry requires at present about 3,500 tpy of calcium
carbide. The demand is projected to increase by about 7% a year, in line
with the overall projected growth for the chloro-solvent industry. reaching
about 4,850 tpy 1989/90.
7. Total Demand
4.21      On the basis of the above demand projections for the main end
users of carbide-based intermediate products such as acetylene, acetylene
black, desulfurizing compound, etc., and a review of the existing and
proposed capacity expansion of industries using carbide-based intermediate
products, the total demand for merchant carbide in India is projected to
develop as follows:

The 1984/85 estimate ti based on the actual consumption of carbide during
the four monchs for which data Is available (i.e., January I to April 30,
1984). During Lhese four months. the actual consumption rate was about
104,000 tpy, and the consumption for the entire fiscal year (1984/85)
ending March 31, 1985, is expected to reach at least 96,000 tons. The
above carbide demand forecast of 141,895 for 1989/90 in substantialiy
lower than the projections for that year of 202,230 Lons by ICB Private
Ltd. (which carried out the Feasibility Study for the Project) and of
210,000 tons for 1989/90 by the Planntng Comission of the Government of
India. The impltcit average annual growth rate in the forecast In the
above table Is approximately 8% during 1984/85-1989/90. This rate is
reallstic considering recent shortfalls in consumptlon and future plans
for the expansion of the cailclum carbide user tndustries as explained
above.
B. Supply/Demand Balance
4.22      Based on Lhe supply forecasts presented in Annex 4-2 (excluding
the output from the proposed Project) and the demand projections shown In
para 4.21, there would be a substaotial shortage of carbide in India as
shown below:

The above table shows that the deficit would range from 18,895 tons to
26,895 Lons by 1989/90 depending on whether the Ortssa Calcium Carbide
Project is completed or no.. On a very conservative estimate, BCC should
be able to market at least 17,000 tons in India by 1989/90. with the
remaining approximately 3,000 tons (at 90% operation of the plant) going to
Bangladesh. To minimize the market risk, BCC has already made long-term
marketing arrangements for the sale of 16,000 tpy to India (para 4.26).



- 17 -
9. Prime Mrketing Area
4.23      As the project would be located near the Indian border in the
northeast, the prime marketinR zone for the Project would be eastern India
(West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa States). This area
represents the steel belt of India. The carbide requirements of the steel
plants there are projected to increase by 12,150 tpy to 13,080 tpy to make
deosulfurizing compoind needed to produce low-sulfur carbon steel. In
addition, there are 16 acetSlene gas units with an annual capacity to
produce nearly 3 million Nm of acetylene, requiring about 13,000 tpy of
carbide. The acetylene gas capacity In the region In expected to increase
to about 4 million Nm3 to meet the demands of the engineering goods
Industry in eastern India, with the carbide requirement rising to
approximately 17,335 tons of carbide. In addition, about 6,000 tons of
carbide would be required for the production of acetylene black and
chloro-solvents. Thus the total requirement of carbide in Eastern India
would be about 36,415 tons by 1989/90.
4.24      Eastern India is currently served by one carbide plant, belonging
to Birla Jute Industries, which has an installed capacity of 15,500 tpy.
Possibly in 1987/88, a new plant of Indian Carbides may come on stream with
an annual capacity of 10,000. Even If these plants operate at an average
capacity of 902 by 1989/90, there would be a shortfall of approximately
13,465 tpy in Eastern India. As noted, it is not yet certaln whether the
new plant would be completed considering the constraints of India such as
the non-availability of high-grade limestone, shortage of electric power,
rising power tariffs, etc. If that plant is not completed, the shortfall
of carbide in Eastern India would be higher (22,465 tons).  Thus,
Irrespective of whether this plant Is completed or not, the production from
the proposed facility In Bhutan would be able to market a major part of Its
products in Eastern India.
10. Letters of Intent and Purchase Contracts
4.25      There are four major carbide-using comprntes In Calcutta:  Indian
Oxygen Co., Asiatic Oxygen Ltd., Asiatic Oxygen and Acetylene Co. Ltd., and
Hindustan Gas Industries Ltd. As requested by the BarK, BCC has signed
letters of intent with these four companies for the rurchase of the entire
production from the proposed Project in Bhutan.
4.26      Among the four companies mentioned above, Indian Oxygen Co., a
subsidiary of British Oxygen (UK), is one of the largest producers of
acetylene and oxygen in India. In addition to their four acetylene gas
plants in Eastern India, they have eight more plants In other parts of
India. The total capacity of their acetvlene gas plants is 3.32 million
Nm3, requiring 13,000 tpy of calcium carbide. Currentlv, their operation
is adversely affected for lack of reliable supply of quality carbide from
Indian sources. Imports from foreign sources are costly because of the
heavy (140x) import duty. As carbide from Bhutan could be sold without
import duty in India under Lhe free trade arrangements between the two
countries, and as Bhutan has quality limestone and ample power resources,
this companv Is showing keen interest in buying carbide from Bhutan on
long-term purchase arrangements. It is also showing interest in providing



- 18 -
technical assistance to establish downstream facilities in Bhutan based on
carbide. It is expected that the commercial relationship between BCC and
Indian Oxygen Co. would be close. The latter has already proposed to buy
about 10,000 tpy of carbide from BCC on a long-term basis twith a price to
be negotiated annually. In addition, DCM (India) which is serving as
Technical Advisor to the Project in Bhutan, has signed a long-term contract
to buy from BCC 6,000 tons of carbide annually. These long-term sales
arrangements were reviewed during negotiations and agreement was reached
with BCC that it will finalize long-term sales contracts for the sale of
additional quantities of calcium carbide (raising the contracted anount to
at least 40% of the annual production) by April 1, 1987. Further, as
noted, since the transportation costs to Bangladesh are not high, it is
expected that part of the production (3,000 tpy) from the proposed plant in
Bhutan could be sold Lo that country. BCC should lso explore the
possibility of exporting carbide to Pakistan and Sri Lanka. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with BCC that it will prepare and
submit to IDA a detailed carbide marketing strategy by April 1, 1987, one
year before the commissioning of the Project. While reviewing the
marketing strategy, IDA will also review the long-term sales contracts
signed by BCC with particular reference to the ade<uacy of the quantity of
production covered under such contracts.
11. Pricing of Calcium Carbide in India
4.27      The Government of India removed price controls on calcium carbide
in 1968. Currently, the price is negotiated between the local supplier and
the buyer. Imports are discouraged by the Government by imposing a high
import duty (1402). At present, the purchase price of carbide for user
industries is about 8,250 (US$635) per ton. In our analysis, however, to
account for the cost of transportation from Bhutan, the cost of market
entry, and a possible decline in Indian prices due to reduction in import
duties, it is assumed that the average financial ex-factory realization of
BCC would be about Rs 7,200 (US$554) per ton. As production of carbide in
India is adversely affected by power shortages and the rising cost of
power, Indian carbide consumers are showing keen interest in purchasing
carbide from Bhutan which has ample power for carbide production based on
local high-quality limestone. Further, under the free trade arrangement
between India and Bhutan, no import duty is imposed on carbide from
Bhutan. Should the Government of India remove the duties on carbide
imported from third countries and also withdraw the current tariff
exemption to Bhutanese products exported to India, BCC would still be able
to realize a net ex-factory price of about Rs 6,500 (US$500) per ton at
March 1985 prices (based on the estimated economic price) which is adequate
to ensure a reasonable return on investment on the Project (see Chapter
IX).
V.   THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives and IDA Role
5.01      The main objective of the Project is to produce for the first
time 'fn Bhutan calcium carbide, a basic inorganic chemical with varied



- 19 -
industrial uses, mainly for export to India. The basic inputs required for
the production of carbide are limestone, a good grade carbonaceous reduc-
tant (e.g. charcoal), and electric power. As noted, Bhutan is endowed with
large deposits of commercially exploitable limestone, dense forests that
can provide charcoal for use as a reductant, and large-scale bydroelectric
power potential which is beginning to be exploited under the Chukha
Project. As the project is export-oriented, it would help the country earn
much-needed foreign exchange. Further, interest, taxes and dividends paid
by the Company would also contribute significantly to public revenues.
5.02      The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGB) gives high priority for
developing the natural resources of the country and achieving increasing
financial self-reliance through exports to neighboring countries. IDA
country strategy supports this goal. In this context, after careful
review, the proposed Calcium Carbide Project has been selected as one of
the most promising export-oriented ventures for Bhutan. IDA has played an
important role in helping Bhutan to prepare it. The success of this
Project depends on careful planning for institution building as well as on
appropriate implementation, training, operation and marketing arrange-
ments. IDA is ensuring the provision of technical assistance in this area
while helping to arrange cofinancing with the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development (KFAED) and the Government of Norway. By being involved in
this Project, IDA can help ensure cost-efficient implementation arrange-
ments through the use of international competitive bidding procedures, and
the use of suitable consulting and engineering firms.
B.   Project Scope and Technology
5.03      The proposnd Project would have an annual capacity of 22,000 tpy
of calcium carbide based on limestone and charcoal from wood, (which at 90%
capacity utilization would yield 19,800 tpy). The capacity has been chosen
on the basis of ready marketability as well as economic size considera-
tions. The Project includes four components: (i) the calcium carbide
plant; (ii) limestone mining; (iii) forestry; and (iv) charcoal production.
5.04      The Calcium Carbide Plant Component: This component of the
Project includes: (i) a 12 MVA open rotating type, submerged arc furnace
along with raw material proportioning and charging system, product tapping,
handling and packing facilities; (ii) a 100 tons per day (tpd) lime kiln;
(iii) raw material storage and handling systems; (iv) a producer gas plant
to allow the flexibility for using producer gas from coal instead of fuel
o3il in the limekiln; (v) water treatment and supply facilities; (vi) work-
shop and drum manufacturing unit; (vii) service facilities for laboratory
testing, fire fighting, etc.; (viii) office and plant buildings; and (ix)
infrastructure facilities including housing and social facilities, roads,
and transmission lines for power supply from the sub-station to be estab-
lished near the Project by the Ministry of Power. The plant layout is
shown in Annex 5-1 and a process flow diagram is shown in Annex 5-2. The
layout has been prepared taking into account the possibility of future car-
bide capacity expansion, and the development of downstream facilities for
production of acetylcne black, desulfurizing compound, etc. The technology
selected for the Project is modern, well proven and energy-efficient
(Reference I of Project File).



- 20 -
5.05      The limekiln would be designed for dual firing, i.e., with either
fuel oil or producer gas. However, for about two years, until personnel
for operation and maintenance gain practical experience in the Project and
until the production is stabilized at high levels, the limekiln would use
imported fuel oil (10 tpd) as the operation of the limekiln with fuel oil
is easier than with producer gas. However, from the third year onwards,
the Project is expected to start using producer gas from local coal to
reduce operating costs. Besides, the Company intends to review with their
Technical Advisor the feasibility of adding at a later stage units for
making briquettes from charcoal, petroleum coke and lime fines for use at
the furnace, and also for producing acetylene using off-size carbide fines.
5.06      Limestone Mining Component:  At full production, the carbide
plant would require about 50,000 tpy (i.e. 150 tpd) of high-grade
limestone (see paras 5.10-5.13 for details). As the limestone requirement
is limited and its quality control is crucial, BCC with assistance from the
mining division of TCC will undertake mining of the limestone deposits
which are near the carbide plant site, including the Hauri Khola, Purbia
Khola and Kaleshwar deposits. As it would be open pit mining, the mining
operation is not complex and expensive. There would be a laboratory at the
mine to ensure that only limestone of acceptable quality is mined. In
addition, a washing plant is included to ensure that phillites
intercalations (silica contaminants) in the limestone supplied to the
Project would be within the tolerance limit. The proposed limestone mining
areas are not prone to flooding.
5.07      Forestry and Charcoal Components:  To supplement the available
local sources of fuel wood, a Forestry Component has been included in the
Project to develop a 1,000 ha forest plantation near the Carbide Plant site
in the Phuntsholing area (see paras 5.17-5.20 for details). To produce
charcoal from fuel wood for use in the production of calcium carbide, a
Charcoal Component is included in the Project. Under this component, seven
charcoal plants each with a capacity of 1,000 tpy will be established in
selected areas. These plants would be able to meet about 45% of the
charcoal requirements of the Carbide Plant, with the rest of the charcoal
to be supplied by local private companies (paras 5.14, 5.15, 5.16 and
5.21).
C.   Project Location
5.08      Five locations--one at Kaleshwar, two at the Singhi-Barsa area,
one at Ha and one at Paro--have been studied by TCC with the help of their
consultants, ICB Private Ltd. (India), taking into account environmental
considerations, availability of plain land, infrastructure requirements,
and transportation costs for equipment, product and inputs (local and
imported). After detailed investigations, Pasakha in the Singhi-Barsa
area, about 10 km from Phuntsholing town, was selected as the location for
the Project. This location is close to the main marketing area (i.e.,
eastern India), has easy access to local and imported inputs as well as to
the developed infrastructure in and around Phuntsholing. About 58 acres of
land with sparse population is available for the Project at Pasakha, of
which 28 acres of forest land belong to RGB and the remaining 30 acres
belong to two private individuals who currently use it to grow mainly corn



- 21 -
and millet. TCC has completed the acquisition of land for the Project.
Land surveys and contour mapping have already been completed. The soil
condition is good, and the land is not prone to flooding. It is a fairly
flat area, 500-540 meters above the sea level, dipping toward the Barsa
Stream in which the water flow is perennial. The site is free of any
permanent homesteads. The area has tropical climate with an average
rainfall of 250 centimeters. TCC has contacted Indian firms for carrying
out detailed soil testing to find out the load bearing capacity. The
southern part of Bhutan where the Project is located falls under a seismic
zone. This aspect will be given particular attention while designing civil
works at the detailed engineering stage. The selection criteria, the
analysis carried out and the final choice of the Project site are
satisfactory.
D.   Infrastructure Arrangements
5.09      To facilitate access to the Project site, BCC has carried out the
levelling of the pathway from Phuntsholing, through the beds of the two
streams, to Barsa. The Government has completed a 2-km new all-weather
road from Barsa to the Project site under the Development Plan of the
country. Further, the Government is building a permanent all-weather road
from Kharbandi (which is on the main highway about 6 km north from
Phuntsholing) up to the Barsa Stream and work on this road is about 80%
complete.  Once this road is completed, it will be connected to the
newly-completed 2-km road to the Project site through a small
(approximately 7 meter) steel bridge across the Barsa Stream. The cost of
this bridge (about US$40,000) is included under the Project. Agreement was
reached with BCC that it will complete the bridge by June 30, 1986.
Further, the Government has agreed to complete the Kharbandi-Barsa road by
September 30, 1986. Near Phuntsholing, there are two Indian railway
stations--one at a distance of about 10 km (meter gauge) and the other, 50
km away (broad gauge). Imported equipment and materials will be
transported from Calcutta to the railway station;. and from there they will
be transported by trucks to the Project site. Water for construction as
well as operation of the Project will be drawn from the nearby Barsa Stream
which has perennial waterflow. Pbwer supply connections have already
reached the site.
E.   Raw Materials
1.   Limestone
5.10      The production of calcium carbide requires high-quality (chemical
grade) limestone. Accordingly, the Project will be designed to use the
limestone of the following specifications: calcium carbonate (CaCO3), 92%
minimum; magnesium oxide (MgO), 2% maximum; and silica (SiO2), 3Z
maximum. Besides, the limestone should also be very low in phosphorus (P)
and sulfur (S) content. The tolerable limit for P and S in limestone to be
used for carbide production depends on the P and S content in the other two
raw materials--charcoal and petroleum coke--required for the Project.
Based on the P and S content in the local charcoal and imported petroleum
coke (from the refineries in northeastern India), BCC has estimated with
the help of the Technical Advisor that the tolerable limit is 0.0068 -



- 22 -
0.0085% for P and 0.18 - 0.22% for S, depending on whether the
charcoal/petroleum coke feed ratio is 70/30 or 90/10. It is proposed to
initially use the 70/30 feed ratio until the production is stabilized at
high levels and then change the feed ratio to 90/10 to reduce operating
costs.
5.11      With the help of the Bhutan Unit of the Geological Survey of
India (GSI) and the Geological Survey of Bhutan (GSB), RGB and TCC have
been assessing the availability of chemical grade limestone (of 92 - 98%
calcium carbonate content) in Bhutan and have identified some highly
promising nearby deposits. On the basis of the present status of sampling
and drilling, chemical grade limestone (along with lower quality limestone
which could be used for cement production) is available within a radius of
10-30 km at Hauri Khula, Purbia Khola, Kaleshwar and Mirchang. The
following table shows the chemical-grade limestone (excluding lower grade)
estimates in these deposits.
Reserve Estimates
(tons)
Proven           Probable         Possible
Hauri Khola                 100,000           200,000         1,800,000
Purbia Khola               100,000               -                -
Kaleshwar                  200,000            160,000          100,000
Mirchang                    200,000           200,000              -
600,000           560,000         1,900,000
At present, the proven reserves from the nearby deposits are about 600,000
tons. Among the deposits mentioned above, the largest chemical grade
limestone reserves are at Hauri Khola. Surface sampling and initial
drilling done there show promising results. The latest available estimates
show probable and possible reserves of about 560,000 tons and 1.9 million
tons, respectively. However, to get a more reliable estimate of proven,
probable and possible reserves, detailed drilling and sampling work has
been accelerated. Results of such work so far show that the proven
reserves are adequate to meet the requirements of the Project for about 12
years. Hauri Khola shows strong indications of turning out to be the
primary source of quality limestone for the Project. The secondary sources
would be Purbia Khola, Kaleshwar and Mirchang. The Government has given
BCC the exclusive mining rights for the deposits at Hauri Khola, Purbia
Khola, Kaleshwar and Mirchang. If necessary, chemical-grade limestone
could also be drawn from farther away deposits, i.e., Nangalam.
5.12      Detailed sampling and drilling work has been done at Purbia Khola
and Mirchang. In Kaleshwar, this work started in early December 1984.
In Hauri Khola, this work began in January 1985. Agreement was reached
that the Government will provide all the necessary financing for the
drilling/sampling work at Kaleshwar and Hauri Khola, and ensure that the



- 23 -
work is carried out by March 31, 1986. In this context, IDA has approved
the use of US$300,000 for the drilling/sampling work under the Technical
Assistance Credit (Credit No. 1416-BHU). Assuming that at least 50% of the
probable and 25X of the possible reserves would be proven following the
drilling/sampling work, the chemical-grade limestone available for the
Project would be about 1,400,000 tons, adequate to meet the requirements of
the Project for about 27 years. In the unlikely event that the
availability of limestone from the nearby limestone deposits becomes
adequate only for half this period (i.e. approximately 14 years), the
Project could still meet its requirements for the outer years from farther
away deposits such as Nangalam, 250 km from the Project site, where 4-6
million tons of chemical grade limestone are available. As Nangalam is on
the plain, transportation of limestone from there to Pasakha (Project site)
would not pose a serious problem. However, the delivered price of
limestone would be higher at about Rs 250 ($19)/ton compared to the average
delivered price of Rs 100 (US$8)/ton from the nearby deposits. This
increase would not be very significant for the Project as limestone
accounts for less than 5% of the production cost. The economic viability
of the Project would be marginally affected even if the Project has to
depend on the Nangalam deposit to meet its limestone requirement after,
say, 14 years of production assuming a very conservative scenario of
chemical-grade limestone availability from the nearby deposits mentioned
above.
5.13      The BCC mining operation would begin in Hauri Khola and extend to
Purbia Khola and Kaleshwar. Calcination tests as well as testing of
limestone for P and S have been carried out along with drilling/sampling
work at those deposits and the test results are satisfactory. BCC would
proceed to mine at Mirchang only if the reserves from the closer deposits
are not adequate. To facilitate selective mining and ensure quality
control, BCC would have a testing laboratory at the mine site. A chemical
laboratory already establisbed at Phuntsholing, is being used to analyze
the core samples from the nearby deposits with particular reference to
calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide and silica. Further, provision has been
made for a washing plant at the Project site to wash possible phillites in
the limestone. Agreement was reached that BCC will carry out the limestone
mining in a timely manner.
2.   Charcoal and Firewood
5.14      The Project will be designed to use domestic charcoal (from local
firewood) and imported petroleum coke on a 90/10 ratio.  However, during
the initial years (until 1991), for ease of operation and to stabilize
production at high levels as soon as possible, a 70/30 charcoal/petroleum
coke ratio will be used. Accordingly, at full production of carbide, the
annual requirement of charcoal would increase from about 12,320 tons to
15,840 tons by 1992, while the requirement of imported petroleum coke would
decline from 4,400 tons to 1,500 tons. The petroleum coke of the required
quality (with a fixed carbon content of at least 89%) is available from the
refineries in eastern India. The charcoal, to be supplied primarily from
local sources, should have at least 72% fixed carbon content and the
moisture content should not exceed 5%. In both charcoal and petroleum
coke, the volatile matter should not exceed 10%. Provision has been in the
Project for a two-ton per hour (tph) drier to ensure that the charcoal feed



- 24 -
for the Project does not contain moisture beyond the tolerable limit
(5%). The local charcoal has been tested in the operating carbide furnace
of DCM in India and is found suitable for carbide production.
5.15      Assuming an average capacity utilization rate of 45% in the first
year of operation, 70% in the second year, 80% in the third year, 90% from
the fourth year onwards and, based upon the charcoal/petroleum coke ratio
as explained in para. 5.14, the total requirement of charcoal and the
firewood required to produce it would increase as follows:
Charcoal and Firewood Requirements
Charcoal/Pet.        Charcoal          Firewood
Coke Ratio       Needed (tons)      Needed (m3)
1st year               70/30               5,545            26,350
2nd year               70/30               8,625            40,970
3rd year               70/30               9,855            46,810
4th year               70/30              11,090            52,670
5th year onwards       90/10              14,260            67,735
5.16      As shown in the above table, the Project requirement of firewood
increases gradually from 26,350 m3 in the first year o.f operation to 67,735
m3 in the fifth year and onwards. Most of the firewood for the Project as
well as for other industrial and househcld uses is expected to be available
from the logging centers (Reference J of Project File). There are
currently seven logging centers in Bhutan with a total logging capacity of
105,000 i3. In addition, the Government plans to establish three
additional logging centers by 1987 to alleviate the log shortages
experienced by the veneer/plywood mill at Gedu and also to increase log
exports to India.  When these new centers are established, the logging
capacity would go up to 180,000 m3. Under normal circumstances, the ratio
between firewood (wood remnants after logging) and sawlogs volume in
logging operation should be 1:1. On this basis the existing logging
facilities should be able to generate 180,000 mA of firewood, enough to
satisfy the needs of the country. However, due to the inefficient
operation of those centers at present, the ratio is low at approximately
0.5:1 in Bhutan. The low recovery rate of firewood is mainly because:
(i) the logging conditions are difficult because of the difficult terrain,
requiring equipment such as skyline cable cranes to maximize recovery of
firewood; and (ii) the market ie not well developed for firewood for
industrial use and the prices available for firewood are low at present.
The Government is giving concerted attention to increasing the efficiency
of the overall logging operation by procuring the necessary logging
equipment to extract as much wood, including wastewood (firewood), as
possible under its forestry development and reforestation program.
5.17      Wood for charcoal production can also be utilized partly from
plantations currently being developed in Southern Bhutan under the Forestry
Development Project being financed by IDA (Credit No. 1460-BHU). Under
this proJect, RGB is clearing 3,800 ha of forest land and reforesting 2,800



- 25 -
ha of the cleared land over a four-year period (1984-88). This project
represents the initial phase of the Government plan to eventually reforest
50,000 ha of degraded forest lands mainly for watershed protection (erosion
control) and partly for augmenting the supply of wood for industrial use.
Though the IDA project covers only four years, it will be continued, either
through additional IDA credits and/or through credits from other financial
sources. IDA is currently considering a second project for reforestation.
5.18      Under the forestry project underway, the Government is
reforesting two main areas of equal size, one near Phuntsholing around the
Carbide Project site and the other near Gaylegphug, about 100 km away fron
the site. Of the total 2,800 ha reforested, 1,050 ha would be under the
short-rotation species (industrial plantation) and the remaining 1,750 ha
would be of the medium- and long-rotation species, mainly for erosion
control. From these plantations, the availability of firewood in Bhutan
is expected to increase gradually from about 25,000 m3 in 1990 to 50,000 n?
by 1993 and to 85,000 m3 by 1998, assuming reforestation is continued at
the rate of about 1,000 ha a year after the first IDA-financed forestry
project is completed in 1988.
5.19      From the sources mentioned above, enough firewood is expected to
be available for the proposed Project as well as for other industrial and
household uses in Bhutan. However, this depends on achieving better
efficiency of operation in the logging centers (para. 5.16). Further,
considering the usual difficulties that beset a forest-product industry, it
is prudent to have a supplemental source of wood to meet the charcoal needs
of the Project. This is because the logging operation at times could be
adversely affected by external factors such as the fluctuations in the
capacity utilization of the local veneer/plywood mills due to technical
problems and the fluctuations in the demand for logs in the neighboring
countries (especially India). In such situations, logging operations are
cut back and, as a result, the availability of firewood also decreases.
Therefore, the development of a supolemental source of wood for the Project
is necessary; that source need not meet the full requirements of the
Project but should make enough wood available to meet any supply
constraints from the logging centers. Such source could be the fast-
growing, self-perpetuating, short-duration tree plantations. Accordingly,
provision has been made in the Project to develop a 1,000 ha forestry
plantation in the Phuntsholing area, near the Project site. It was agreed
that BCC will carry out this plantation in a timely manner. The Government
has already allocated to BCC 1,000 ha of land in the Phuntsholing area for
this purpose. Further, agreement was reached with the Government that it
will complete the Karbandi (near Phuntsholing) to Barsa road by June 30,
1986 (para 5.09) and allow BCC to use the tree nurseries being developed by
the Forestry Department at Phuntsholing for the development of the forestry
component of the Project.
5.20      While making adequate wood supply arrangements, the Government is
encouraging private investors to build small-scale (1,000 tpy) chemical
recovery and charcoal retorts in each of the existing as well as proposed
logging centers. TCC has already set up a 1,000 tpy retort at the
Chimakothi Logging Center as a demonstration plant. It has facilities for
extractirg chemicals from wood (e.g. calcium acetate, methyl alcohol, tar,



- 26 -
etc.) while producing charcoal. This retort has shown that it can recover
its production costs from the sale of wood chemicals alone, with the sales
revenue from charcoal representing profit. Considering the high
profitability of such retorts, private companies are expected to come
forward to invest in such facilities whose average cost is about US$0.15
million equivalent per unit. In light of the low investment costs and the
prospects of high profitability, a few other private companies have
approached the Government for permission to set up charcoal plants with a
total capacity of 6,000 tpy. Taking into account the capacity of the plant
already established by TCC, the total charcoal in the private sector would
be about 7,000 tpy. The facilities for producing an additional 7,000 tpy-
seven plants each with an annual capacity if 1,000 tpy--would be set up by
BCC as part of the Project. During negotiations, the Government and RCC
have submitted a detailed plan for ensuring adequate wood supply for the
Project. It was agreed that BCC will prepare by October 31, 1985, a
detailed plan for the production and supply of charcoal required for
Project and subsequently implement the plan. In this context, it was also
agreed that BCC shall make arrangements satisfactory to IDA for the supply
of charcoal to supplement its production of charcoal. Further, BCC has
signed a letter of intent to purchase up ti 5,000 tpy of charcoal from the
State Government of Bihar in India to meet any temporary shortages of local
charcoal.
F.   Utilities
5.21      Power Supply:  The Project will require 15 MW of power at 11 KV
at peak demand. This requirement will be met from the 336 MW Chukha
Hydroelectric Project which is at an advanced stage of construction: about
85Z of the civil works have been completed, and one of its four 84 MW units
is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 1985 and the rest in 1986.
This power project as well as the power distribution system is being
financed by India, which will purchase the surplus power from that
project. Under the power distribution system, a substation at Pasakha,
adjacent to the Project, is planned by the Power Department of the
Government. From Chukha, a 220 KV line will be laid to this substation
where power will be stepped down to 66 KV and finally to 11 KV for the
carbide plant. From the Pasakha substation, a new 66 KV line will be laid
to the existing Phuntsholing substation which is already connected by a 66
KV line to the existing grid at Chukha. This network will give the Carbide
Project the flexibility to receive power from either one of the two lines,
i.e. from either the new 220 KV Chukha-Pasakha line or the existing 66 KV
Chukha-Phuntsholing line. The new 220 KV Chukha-Pasakha line is scheduled
to be completed by December 31, 1986, and the interconnection between the
Pasakha substation and the existing Phuntsholing substation has been
completed recently. The above schedule is well within the schedule for the
Project which is planned for mechanical completion by January 1, 1988 and
for commissioning by April 1, 1988. Agreement was reached with the
Government that the power distribution system will be completed as planned
to meet the full requirements of the Project in a timely manner. At the
construction stage, the power requirements of the Project will be
supplemented in emergencies from a 1.8 MVA diesel generating set. After
project completion, this generating set will be used for meeting the
emergency power requi%.ments of the Project.  The cost of this generating



- 27 -
set as well as the cost of stepping down the power supply from the grid
from 66 KV to 11 KV at the Plant is included in the Project cost estimate.
5.22      Water Supply:  The water requirements of the Project would be
about 1,')OO cubic meters (m3) per day. Water will be drawn from the Barsa
Stream wh'ch flows near the site and provides perennial water supply.
Water will be pumped from the river to a reservoir (of 500 m3 capacity) and
from there it will be supplied to a water treatment plant. After treat-
ment, the water will be distributed through an overhead tank (capacity:
300 m3). The processed water will be used mainly as make-up for cooling
water for the carbide furnace. A recirculation cooling water system
(including a cooling tower, and recirculation pumps) for the furnace will
be installed. Potable water will be distributed through a eeparate network
of piping.
5.23      Plant and Instrumental Air:  To meet the air requirements of the
limekiln as well as a possible producer gas plant in the future, a
compressor with a capacity of 80 m3/hr will be installed.
G.   Packing and Loading Facilities
5.24      The workshop for preventive and routine maintenance will also
have facilities for making electrode casing and carbide packing drums (of
100 kg capacity) using imported steel. The packed and sealed drums will be
marked as per the regulations of the Indian Standards Institute and trans-
ported to a warehouse through a trolley system. The warehouse design and
the storage of packed drums will be done according to the latest carbide
handling manual. For safety reasons, no electric connection will be
provided to the warehouse. The packed drums will be loaded manually on to
trucks for dispatch by road. Part of the product will also move by rail
from the nearby railway stations.
H.   Other Facilities
5.25      To the extent local manpower is not forthcoming, manpower for the
Project will be recruited from the neighboring countries. As there is an
acute shortage of trained personnel in Bhutan, expatriate manpower is like-
ly to comprise a high percentage of the work force. Particular attention
will be given to train selected local personnel at home and abroad. A
local training facility included in the Project will have audio-visual and
other training equipment.
5.26      Housing facilities for the Carbide Plant personnel are available
for rent at Phuntsholing and neighboring towns. Therefore, only limited
housing facilities will be developed at the Project site. These facilities
would be mainly for the critical operating and maintenance staff. The
company will provide a bus service to transport staff from Phuntsholing to
Pasakha.
5.27      The furnace operation could be hazardous if the moisture content
in the charcoal goes beyond 5%.  As Bhutan gets heavy rains over a four-
month period in a ;ear and as the moisture content in charcoal could exceed
the 5% limit especially during the monsoon season, a two tons/hr drier has
been included in the Project to help ensure safe operation of the furnace.



- 28 -
I.   Environmental Considerations
5.28      Adequate pollution control measures wlll be adopted by installing
effluent treatment and discharge facilities to handle potential
pollutants--solid, liquid and gaseous--from the Project. Dust extraction
systems including suction hoods and ducts will be used to exhaust dust
generated during the material transfer, crushing, screening and conveyor
operations in bunkers, feeders, conveyors, bucket elevators, screens,
crushers, charging and discharging ends of the lime kiln. Pneumatically
operated bag filters will be installed in the furnace. After the dust is
removed, the gases from the furnace and the limekiln will be vented to the
atmosphere using a sufficiently high stack. The purge water from the
cooling water circuit and waste from floor washings would be treated before
discharge.
5.29      The Project will be designed and operated to meet the rigorous
liquid effluent standards and limits for gaseous emissions according to
Indian Standards which are comparable to standards applied for such
facilities in developed countries. In this context, BCC will assign within
its Project Department at least one experienced person equipped with
appropriate laboratory facilities to monitor pollution levels in
cooperation with operational staff responsible for effluent treatment.
Agreement was reached with the Government and BCC that the Project will be
built and operated in accordance with environmental standards acceptable to
IDA.
5.30      Further, while licensing the construction of charcoal units to
supply charcoal for the Project, the Government should get commitment
from prospective iavestors to take adequate measures to control the release
of pollutants to the atmosphere. Those pollutants should be incinerated
and not released to the atmosphere. Agreement to this effect was reached
during negotiations.
5.31      The proposed Project would require a substantial amount of wood
to meet its charcoal requirements. In this context to prevent the denuding
of forests that might lead to ecological problems, agreement was reached
with the Government that it will furnish a reforestation program
satisfactory to IDA by December 31, 1985.
J.   Sociological Aspects
5.32      The Government of Bhutan is committed to preserving Lne
traditional values and culture of Bhutan. In this context, the Government
is paying attention to minimizing migration of rural people to towns.
(Currently, 90-95% of Bhutan's population lives in the rural areas). In
order to help check migration, the Government is trying to satisfy the
basic needs of the rural people, i.e., education, health and water supply.
However, Bhutan's agricultural economy is essentially a subsistence
economy, with little savings surplus to provide the resources to satisfy
the basic needs. Traditionally, the country has relied largely on foreign
aid to finance social projects. The Government, however, is aware that
education and other social services involve recurrent expenditures which
require a permanent source of income, which cannot be financed from foreign



- 29 -
aid. In order to be able to obtain a continuous source of income for the
provision of social services, the Government has decided to develop a few
export-oriented industrial projects based on domestic natural resources.
The calcium carbide project is one of those projects.
5.33      As noted, the project site covering 58 acres is away (about 10
km) from the Phuntsholing Town on the Bhutan-Indian border, and there are
only two homesteads in that area. The India-Bhutan border being an open
border, there is free movement of people between the two countries. Around
Phuntsholing, on each side of the border, most of the Lnhabitants are of
Nepalese origin. They share the same ethnic, cultural and religious
backgrounds. The constructlon labor would be drawn largely from these
people. Therefore, it is unlikely that the labor of Nepalese origin
working on the Project would cause social tension. Further, as noted,
provision has been made under the Project to develop: (i) a sound
organizational and staffing plan, taking into account the availability of
local personnel and using expatriates only when local personnel are not
available; (ii) a reforestation program for the country. An IDA consultant
will visit Bhutan in mid-1985 to exchange views with BCC and the Government
on the sociological aspects of the manpower and reforestation plans under
the Project. The consultant will also review those plans when they are
prepared and submitted to IDA for comments (paras 5.31 and 6.09).
VI. PRDJECT MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTION
A.   Project Management and Implementation
6.01      In January 1985, the Project sponsors, in consultation with IDA,
contracted Shriram Projects and Engineering Services (SPES), of DCM Group,
India, an established operating company which has extensive experience in
calcium carbide production and which is familiar with the local conditions
in Bhutan, as Technical Advisor (TA) for management assistance. The TA
would assist the BCC management in: (i) preparation of legal contracts
with suppliers of equipment and services; (ii) project implementation;
(iii) development of organization and management structure; (iv)
recruitment of personnel; (v) development and implementation of a training
program, along with the preparation of operation and maintenance manuals;
(vi) project reporting to financing institutions; (vii) installation of a
modern financial and accounting system; and (viii) initial operation of the
plant for about two years after commissioning. Detailed terms of reference
for the TA services are attached as Annex 6-1. SPES has agreed for a
negotiated price of Nu 6 million (US$462,000) to provide 300 man-months of
TA services over a period of five years. Considering the fact that the
Company is fully acceptable, the price quoted by it is very reasonable, and
the Company has offered to assign well-experienced personnel for the
assignment in Bhutan, and also in view of the critical importance of TA
services for the success of the Project, IDA has agreed to firance the TA
contract.
6.02      The project sponsors have appointed an experienced chemical
engineer who has more than 20 years of experience in implementing and
operating calcium carbide plants, as Project Manager. He is in the process



- 30 -
of building up a project management team (PMT) which will be responsible
for the moniLoring and conLrol of project implementation, within the
stipulated rime and cost, by coordinating Lhe activities of the foreign and
local firms with the help of TA selected. The Project implementation
organization proposed is shown in Annex 6-2.  The Project team will have at
least 10 experienced and qualified personnel including a consLruction
manager, a productlion manager, two project engineers (one for supervising
the furnace contracc and che other to deal with the engineering contract),
one mechanical engineer, one electrical engineer, one civil engineer, one
finance manager, one commercial manager and one chief of planning and
coordination. The Project Manager will report directly to the Managing
Director of the Company. TCC, under the Shareholders' Agreement (para
3.06), will assist BCC in recruiting (with the help of the TA) and
assigning these key personnel in BCC. Further, the Government has deputed
a senior official from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Mines as Chief
of Planning and Coordination. He is capable and experienced and will play
a key role in promoting coordination between the Ministries of Trade,
Industry and Forests, Public Works and Finance In implementing not only the
Carbide Project but also the limestone mining, forestry development and
charcoal production facilities necessary for the timely supply of adequate
raw materials for the Project. He will be assisted by the Finance Manager
and Lhe Commercial Manager, and will report directly to the Managing
Director. Further, agreement was reached with the Government that it will
appoint by August 1, 1985, an Inter-Ministerial Committee with members from
the Ministries of Trade, Industry and Mines, Public Works and Finance to
coordinate the activities on the Project and the related infrastructure
including the upstream facillties.
6.03      As the Project advances towards mechanical completion, the
Company proposes to hire an able executive with extensive experience in
managing carbide plants as General Manager. Agreement was reached with BCC
that a General Manager, with qualifications and experience acceptable to
IDA, will be engaged by December 31, 1986, well in time to supervise the
training and staffing program (para 6.09), and Lhe commissioning of the
Project.
B. Engineering Arrangements
6.04      The Project would be executed under two main contracts:  (i) the
furnace contract; and (ii) Lhe engineering contract. The Furnace
ContracLor (FC) would be responsible for the supply of the carbide furnace
equipment, along with the bag filter for pollution control, supply of scope
drawings for civil works and load data for foundation, for the furnace
installation, and the supervision of its erection and commissioning. The
Furnace ContracLor would give the performance guarantee for the entire
furnace operaLion, while taking necessary back-up guarantee from the
Engineering Contractor for the civil and erection work related to the
furnace. The Engineering Contractor (EC) will appoint separate
sub-conLractors for the overall civil and erection work for the entire
project, after competitive bidding among Bhutanese and Indian firms,
prequalified by the Engineering ConLractor, and approved by the project
sponsors and IDA. The Engineering Contractor will also be responsible for
Lhe detailed engineering, procurement and commissioning for all units



- 31 -
except for the furnace. Further, the EC would provide guarantees for the
correctness of engineering, civil works and erection for the entire Ptoject
except performance guarantees for the limekiln and drum-making plants,
which would be provided by the respective suppliers.
6.05      For the engineering contract, TCC has received bids from four
established Indian firms. These firms include: ICB Private Ltd.,
Metallurgical and Engineering Consultants (MCON), Development Consultants
Private Ltd., and Engineering Projects (India) Ltd. After reviewing the
proposals, BCC has selected ICB as the EC. IDA staff have reviewed the
capability of these firms and are satisfied that any one of then can carry
out the engineering services for the Project. The Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development (KFAED) has agreed to finance this contract.
6.06      As for the FC, BCC has negotiated with ElkeT  (Norway), one of the
leading carbide furnace suppliers in the world, who submitted their bid at
the end of 1984. The Government of Norway has agreed to provide a grant of
35 million Norwegian Kroner (US$3.9 million) to finance the Furnace
Contract.
6.07      For mining as well as the forestry and charcoal components of the
Project, BCC will be depending on expatriate experts, mostly from India and
Bangladesh. Agreement was reached that, in addition to those experts, BCC
will hire by September 30, 1985 foreign consultants, acceptable to IDA, on
a recalner basis, to be called upon to review and advise at critical phases
of planning and Implementation of those components.
C.   Employment and Training
6.08      As noted, there Is an acute shortage of trained manpower in
Bhutan (para 2.05). There is also a shortage of Construction labor. As a
result, most of the employees at the construction and operation stages of
the Project are expected to be recruited from the neighboring India, Nepal
and Bangladesh with assistance from the Technical Advisor. Because of the
comparatively higher wage and salary scales In Bhutan and   ' the tax
exenption of income earned by expatriates, the necessary manpower Is
expected to be easily available from the neighboring countries.
6.09      At the construction stage, about 500 laborers vould be required.
Of these, about 80% are expected to come from the nearby boider towns of
India and Bangladesh. After the Project is completed, the Company would
require about 500 employees Including 14 for key management positions. In
the technical category, the Project will require 15 trained engineers and
100 technicians. On the basis of the existing number of Bhutanese students
studying engineering in India, Bangladesh, the U.S., and other countries,
and the technicians coming out annually from the two existing local
polytechnics, not more than three engineers and 20 technicians from Bhutan
are likely to be available for the Project. These qualified local
personnel need to be recruited and given traininR. It is also necessary to
train semi-skilled local personnel in operations and maintenance.
Concerted attention will be given to recruit local personnel, wherever
possible, and to train them. Agreement was reached with BCC that a
detailed organizational and staffing plan including a Lraining program will



- 32 -
be developed by March 31, 1986 and will be subsequently implemented in time
for project commissioning and operation. This is an important part of the
functions of the Technical Advisor. Selected local personnel will also
receive training abroad. The capital cost estimates for the Projects
includes about US$150,000 for the training program.
D. Project Status and Schedule
6.10      BCC has selected the Technical Advisor for the Project and the
Engineering Contractor for the Carbide Plant (the Main Component of the
Project). The contracts with them are expected to be effective from April
1, 1985. As for the Limestone Mining Component, drilling/sampling work on
the deposits close to the Carbide Plant site is going on with technical
assistance to BCC from the TCC Mining Division and the Geological Survey of
Bhutan. As for the Forestry and Charcoal Components, a forestry consultant
is currently helping to finalize detailed plans for the development of a
1,000 ha forestry plantation in the Phuntsholing area, and to select
locations for the establishment of seven charcoal plants. One charcoal
plant in the private sector has already been established by TCC (para
5.20). Applications for licenses to establish eight more charcoal plants
needed to meet the full requirements of the Carbide Plant have been
received by the Government from local private enterprises.
6.11      The Calcium Carbide Component is expected to be completed in 36
months from the date of effectiveness of the contract with the Engineering
Contractor signed on April 1, 1985). This schedule takes into account the
risks of delay associated with constructing the Project on a greenfield
location, away from the nearest sea port (i.e. Calcutta), in a country with
limited experience in industrial project implementation. A bar chart
shoving the implementation schedule on this basis is attached as Annex
6-3. As for the Limestone Mining Component, the implementation period
would be two years starting from July 1985.  Work on the Forestry
Component, started in April 1985, would continue until 1991. As for the
Charcoal Component, the implementation period is one and a half years,
starting from January 1986. These schedules (Annex 6-3) are reasonable.
VII. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
A.  Project Capital Cost
7.01      The total financing required for the Project is estimated at
US$23.9 million equivalent (Nu 311.3 million), including US$19.6 million
in foreign exchange. The estimate includes provisions for physical and
price contingencies. It also includes the infrastructure investments
needed for a bridge and the access road (from the bridge to the site),
power supply connection from the Pasakha substation to the plant,
facilities for water supply, housing, etc., as well as the investments
required on upstream facilities (i.e., for the production of the main raw
materials--limestone, wood and charcoal), but excludes the proposed private
sector investmencs on nine charcoal plants. Details of the financing
required for the Project, given in Annex 7-1, are summarized on the
following page.

7.02      The capital cost estimates are based on the Feasibility Study
(April 1983) prepared by the sponsors' consultant, and subsequently revised
in the light of the budgetary offers received from Demag (of the Federal
Republic of Germany) and Elkem (of Norway) in mid-1984, modifications made
in the project scope at the appraisal stage, and the actual bid price
quoted by SPES (India) for technical advisory services. The revised base
cost estimate is in March 1985 prices. The cost estimate is based on an
exchange rate of US$1.00 = Nu 13.00 = Rs 13.00. Physical contingency has
been estimated at 10% of the base cost estimate. Price contingency has
been estimated using annual price escalation of 5% for 1985, 7.5% for 1986,
8.0% from 1987 to 1990, and 5% thereafter for foreign currency (excluding
Indian rupee) expenditures; and 7.0% for 1985, 7.5% from 1986 to 1989, and
5.0% thereafter for Indian and local expenditures. On this basis, the
total price escalation amounts to 17.6% of the base cost plus physical
contingencies. The working capital requirement of the Project is estimated
at Nu 27.8 million (US$2.1 million equivalent).
B.   Financing Plan
7.03      Based on the above capital cost estimates and a debt/equity
ratio of about 65/35, the following financing plan has been drawn up:
Financing Plan

=
a/   The grant from the Government of Norway would be passed on as RGB
equity.
7.04      Of the equity funds totalling US$8.3 million equivalent, about
US$1.4 million equivalent would be generated by the Project in the initial
operating years and would finance a portion of the working capital, and
expenditures to be incurred after commissioning. The remaining US$6.9
million equivalent would be contributed by the Government and the Tashi
Commercial Corporation (TCC) on a 80/20 ratio. As for the total debt of
US$15.6 million equivalent for the Project, US$9 million will come from
IDA, and the remaining US$6.6 million equivalent from KFAED.



- 35 -
7.05      The IDA Credit will be made to the Government on standard IDA
terms. It will onlend the proceeds of the Credit to BCC for 14 years
including four years of grace, at not less than 10.25% interest per ailnum.
The subsidiary loan will be denominated in US dollars, witb BCC taking the
foreign exchange risk. The execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
between the Government and BCC under terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA will be a condition of Credit effectiveness. IDA funds would be used
to finance mainly the Technical Advisor contract and a list of selected
equipment packages.
7.06      KFAED would lend KD 2 million (US$6.6 million equivalent) on
concessional terms to the Government which would onlend it to BCC for 14
years, including four years of grace, at an annual interest rate of 8%.
KFAED funds would be used to finance the Engineering Contract including
sub-contracts for civil works and erection, and to finance a list of
selected equipment packages.
7.07      The Government of Norway has agreed to provide 35 million
Norwegian Kroner (US$3.9 million) as a grant to the Government to procure
the carbide furnace and related equipment from Norway, one of the leading
suppliers of such critical equipment. Along with the supply of that
equipment, a total of 35 man-months of service will be required to
supervise the installation and commissioning of the furnace. This has been
included in the grant financing from Norway. The Government is channeling
the Norwegian grant as equity to BCC. In this context, the following has
been specified as a remedy under the IDA General Conditions: The Kuwait
Fund Loan or Norwegian Grant Agreements shall have failed to become
effective by July 31, 1985, or such later date as IDA may agree.
7.08      TCC would provide US$1.4 million by way of equity participation.
The Government, which would account for 80% of equity participation, would
provide US$5.5 million equivalent, including the US$3.9 million equivalent
from the Norwegian grant. Further, the financing plan assumes US$1.4
million equivalent would come from internal cash generation to finance a
part of the working capital needs, and expenditures to be incurred after
commissioning.
7.09      The Shareholders' Agreement between the Government and TCC
specifies that they promptly provide BCC, on terms satisfactory to IDA,
any additional funds required to cover any shortfall in: (i) the financing
plan due to unexpected cost increases; and (ii) any cash shortfalls until
the Project shall have produced at 80% capacity for 12 consecutive months.
Further, it was agreed that the Government will take all necessary steps to
ensure that all funds, including foreign exchange, are available on time to
allow completion of the Project and to bring it to full production in
accordance with the implementation schedule.
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
7.10      Equipment financed by the IDA Credit will mostly be procured
through international competitive bidding (ICB) and partly through other
procedures such as limited international bidding (LIB), consistent with
Bank Group guidelines. Items which are critical for efficient project
execution and operation, and small items costing less than US$200,000 may



- 36 -
be procured through limited international bidding after inviting bids from
qualified suppliers from at least three eligible countries. The total
contract value of such items will not exceed US$2 million, equivalent to
approximately 22% of the IDA Credit. For purposes of bid evaluation under
ICB, qualified local suppliers will receive a margin of preference of 15%.
The IDA Credit, as noted, will also be used to finance the contract for
technical advisory services during project implementation and initial
operation of the Project for two years, and also to meet the foreign
exchange cost of training.
7.11      The equipment  and services for the Project would be divided Into
four groups to facilitate procurement; (i) one for financing by Norway:
(ii) one for financing by IDA; (iii) one for financing by KFAED; and (iv)
one for financing by IDA and/or KFAED. This arrangement would help
effective use of funds from different sources.
7.12      Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below:

IDA would disburse against 100% of foreign (CIF) and local (ex-factory)
expenditures for equipment, material and spares procured through ICB, LIB
and LCB, and 65% of off-the-shelf items procured through local competitive
bidding. Disbursements against consultants, technical advisory services,
and training would be 100X.
7.13      To expedite project execution, it is recommended that the IDA
Credit finance retroactively up to US$0.5 million of eligible expenditures
for technical advisory services and down-payments for procurement of
long-delivery items incurred after January 1, 1985. Further, IDA Credit
will finance the establishment of a Special Account of US$500,000 to
expedite procurement of items costing less than US$50,000 equivalent. All
disbursement will be fully documented. It is anticipated that the IDA
Credit would be fully disbursed by September 30, 1990 in accordance with
the disbursement schedule shown in Annex 7-2. The disbursement period
(slightly more than 5 years) is close to the standard disbursement profile
for industrial projects. The Closing Date for the Project will be June 30,
1991.
7.14      Five initial equipment packages as well as all packages costing
more than US$500,000 to be financed by IDA will be subject to prior
review. Of the equipment and spares to be financed by IDA, about US$5.5
million equivalent worth are expected to be procured under international
competitive bidding, US$2 million equivalent worth under limited
international bidding. In addition, off-the-shelf small items costing
about US$500,000 are expected to be procured under local competitive
bidding. As noted, sixty-five percent of the cost of those items would be
financed by IDA.
7.15      A significant part of the equipment and services for the Project
Is expected to be provided by Indian firms under ICB.  In this context, the
Government has indicated that they would like to use their surplus rupee
funds (earned from trade with and development assistance from India) to pay
for equipment and services from Indian firms (when those firms are the
winners under competitive bidding) and claim reimbursement in foreign
exchange from IDA and KFAED. KFAED has agreed to accept the Government
request. IDA would also show such flexibility in case the Indian firms
could accept the payment in rupees for items and services won under
competitive bidding following IDA procedures.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenues and Operating Costs
8.01      As discussed (para 6.11), the calcium carbide plant is expected
to be mechanically completed by January 1, 1988, and commissioned by April
1, 1988, 36 months after the zero date (signing of the Engineering
contract). The plant is expected to operate at 45% capacity for 9 months
in 1988, 70% in 1989, 80% in 1990, and 90% thereafter. At 90% capacity
utilization, the project would produce 19,800 tpy of calcium carbide, 3,960
tons of lime fines, and 1,013 tons of chemical liquor.



- 38 -
8.02      As discussed in Chapter IV, most of the calcium carbide produced,
would be marketed in India; about 3,000 tpy would be exported to
Bangladesh. The Government of India does not regulate calcium carbide
prices. It protects local manufacturers, however, by imposing a high duty
(140%) on imports. As a result, Indian prices are significantly higher
than international prices. As noted, under the treaty governing trade and
transit between the two countries, the Government of India does not impose
any duties on imports from Bhutan. This benefits the project as it can
sell its output at high Indian prices without having to pay Indian import
duties. Based on the existing prices, discussions with Indian consumers,
and the overall market/supply situation of calcium carbide in India, the
ex-factory calcium carbide price is expected to remain constant in real
terms at about Nu 7,200 (US$554) per ton in March 1985 prices. The two
by-products: lime fines and liquor are expected to be sold at Nu 400
(US$31) and Nu 5,000 (US$385) per ton respectively, mostly in India.
8.03      The operating costs of the Project are given in Annex 8-1 and
summarized in the following table:

8.04      As shown in the above table, electric power is the most
significant cost component in the production of calcium carbide: even at



- 39 -
its comparatively low price of Nu 0.20 (US$0.02) per Kwh, it would account
for about 16% of the total operating costs. Access to abundant and
inexpensive electric power is the Project's greatest advantage over its
Indian producers, who face serious power shortages and often pay over Nu
0.40 equivalent per Kwh.
8.05      The production cost estimates are based on a 70/30 ratio of
charcoal to petroleum coke. After production is stabilized at high
capacity levels, the ratio is expected to be changed to 90/10. Due to
difference in the price of charcoal and petroleum coke-Nu 750 per ton of
charcoal compared to Nu 3,500 per ton of petroleum coke--the projected
Increase in the proportion of charcoal would reduce operating costs by
about Nu 6.9 million (US$0.5 million) per year, or Nu 347 (US$27) per ton
of product, at 90% capacity utilization.
B. Financial ProJections
8.06      Projected financial statements (income statements, balance
sheets, and statements of changes in financial position) for BCC, and
assumptions used, are given in Annexes 8-1 to 8-4 and summarized below.
These projections were prepared in accordance with Bank projections of
inflation and exchange rates (7.02).

a/  Current ratio and acid test ratio are unusually high because there
is no current portion of long-term debt in current liabilities for
1988.
8.07    The Project is financially very attractive and will generate sound
profit right from the first year of operation. Sales revenues and net
income will increase rapidly between 1988 and 1991 as capacity utilization
increases from 45 to 90 percent. Subsequently, volume sales are expected
to remain constant at about 19,800 tpy of calcium carbide, and growth in
revenues would be due to inflation. The annual internal cash generation
from the Project would reach about Nu 79.0 million (US$6.1 million) by
1991, the first year at 90% capacity utilization. As a result of good
internal cash generating capacity, the company would also have sound debt
servicing capability. The debt service coverage ratio is projected to
remain above 2.0 times. Future liquidity and solvency position of the
Company would be sound. The current ratio is expected to remain above
1.3:1; the debt/equity ratio at 64/36, or better. As a result of its high
profits, the debt/equity ratio of BCC is expected to improve to 54/46 by
1990 and 37/63 by 1992.



- 41 -
8.08      The high profitability of the Project is also reflected in its
low profit and cash breakeven levels. Profit breakeven is estimated to
increase from 33.7% of capacity in 1988 to 45.2% in 1989, the first year
that Interest charges would be charged to the income statement; interest
charges until 1988, would be capitalized as interest during construction.
Beyond 1989, as interest on long-term debt decreases and the revenues
continue to increase, profit breakeven will gradually decrease to 33.0%
capacity by 1992. Cash breakeven point will reach its maximum level of
41.3% in 1990, the year loan principal repayments begin, beyond which it
will gradually decrease as principal repayments remain constant and
operating income continues to Increase. By 1992, cash breakeven point
would have decreased to about 32.4Z.
C. Financial Rate of Return (FRR) and Sensitivity Analysis
8.09      The base case financial rate of return (before tax) is about
24%. The high financial return reflects the high price of calcium carbide
in India, and PHlutan's comparative advantage over its Indian
competitors,because of access to adequate electric power, charcoal and high
quality limestone, and its proximity to the large market in eastern India.
Financial cost and benefit streams and assumptions used for the rate of
return calculations are included In Annex 8-5. The results of the
sensitivity analysis are presented in the table below:
Financial Rate
of Return (%)
a) Base Case (before tax)                                23.5
b) Base Case (after tax)                                 19.6
c) Revenue down 10%                                      18.9

j) Capacity utilization down 20%                         18.0
k) Charcoal/petroleum coke ratio                         22.5
remaining at 70/30 beyond 1992
Variable                  Switching Values at 10% Discount Rate (X)
Benefits                                   -26.8
Capital Cost                              +113.2
Operating Cost                             +55.6
Capacity Utilization                       -44.7
8.10      The above analysis indicates that the Project will be able to
withstand significant changes in the major financial parameters, though
changes in calcium carbide prices would have a greater impact on the rate
of return as compared to changes in capital costs, operating costs, and
capacity utilization. From 1992 onwards, in order to benefit from the low



- 42 -
price of domestic charcoal (Nu 750 per ton) compared to the price of
imported petroleum coke (Nu 3,500 per ton), the charcoal to petroleum coke
ratio will be increased from 70/30 to 90/10. Even if for tech,tcal or
other reasons, the plant has to be operated with a 70/30 ratio, the
financial rate of return will remain above 22%.
D.   Financial Covenants
8.11      Agreement was reached that BCC will follow prudent financial
practices, and maintain at all times: (a) a maximum long-term debt to
equity ratio of 65/35 until December 31, 1989, and 60/40 thereafter, (b) a
current ratio of at least 1.3:1; and (c) a debt service coverage ratio of
at least 1.5. In addition, the following covenants were agreed to: (i)
BCC will not form any subsidiary without prior consultation with IDA; (ii)
without IDA consent, BCC will not declare dividends or make any other
distribution with respect to its share capital, unless after such dividend
has been paid or other distribution has been made its current assets would
equal or exceed 1.4 times current liabilities; (iii) during the period of
project implementation, BCC will undertake no investments on fixed assets
other than those required for the Project without prior approval of IDA;
(iv) after project completion, BCC will not invest more than US$1 million
per year (except for maintenance purposes) without IDA consent until the
Project produces an average annual level of 80% capacity for 12 consecutive
months.
E.   Auditing and Reporting
8.12      The Company will have its accounts and financial statements for
each fiscal year audited by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA. The
Company will inform IDA of the qualifications and experience of auditors to
be assigned for this purpose. The accounts of the Special Account (para
7.13) established with IDA funds will be addressed separately in the
auditor's report. The Company will submit annual audit reports, including
income statement, balance sheet, and statement of changes in financial
position, to IDA along with any other relevant material issued by the
auditor (e.g. a Management Letter commenting on deficiencies or weaknesses
in the Company's internal control, or recommendations for improving it)
within six months of the close of its fiscal year. In addition, within six
months of the close of its fiscal year, the Company will also submit a
letter from the auditor certifying the Company's compliance with IDA
financial and accounting covenants. The Company will install financial
accounting and internal control systems adequate to record and report all
Project-related transactions. These systems will be operable when the
project expenditure commences. Further, BCC will submit monthly progress
reports on the Project and quarterly financial statements of the Company,
in a format satisfactory to IDA.
F.   Major Risks
8.13      The Project does not face any major technical risk which could
seriously affect its viability since its technology is commercially proven
and will be supplied by internationally known firms. However, in view of
this export-oriented project being implemented by a new company on a
greenfield site, the Project could face some potential risks concerning:



- 43 -
(i) delays in implementation of Infrastructure and also upstream facilities
for the production of limestone, wood and charcoal; (ii) lack of trained
manpower; (iii) problems during start-up and commissioning; (iv)
difficulties in stabilizing production at high capacity utilization rates;
and (v) problems in exporting calcium carbide. In order to reduce the
risks under (i), an Inter-Ministerial Committee has been formed to
supervise and coordinate the implementation of the required Infrastructure
and upstream facilities. The Government has assigned a top-level official
to work full-time with the Company as Chief of Planning and Coordination
(para 6.02).
8.14      As for meeting the shortage of trained manpower in Bhutan,
arrangements would be made to recruit qualified and experienced personnel
from the neighboring countries, after making concerted efforts to select
and train local personnel wherever possible.   No problem is foreseen in
recruiting competent personnel from India as salary scales In Bhutan are
higher than In India and the income of Indians working in Bhutan is
tax-free. TCC will assist BCC in selecting top and middle level management
and technical personnel for the Project (para 6.02). A comprehenslve
organization and staffing plan will be developed by the Company by March
31, 1986 and subsequently will be implemented with the help of the
Technical Advisor (pars 6.09). The Technical Advisor will also help the
company management in expediting project implementation and commissioning,
and also in operating the plant for two years after commissioning. As the
Company will have no difficulty in recruiting of qualified and experienced
personnel for management positions, TA personnel will not be in line
positions. When TA leaves after two years of plant operation, the Company
management would have adequate capability to operate the plant without
outside assistance.
8.15      At the stage of project implementation, there will be two
contractors for the main component (i.e. carbide complex) of the Project--
Furnace Contractor and the Engineering Contractor -- who will be working
closely, with the Engineering Contractor giving the overall guarantee for
correctness of engineering, civil works and erection (after taking the
necessary back-up guarantees from the Furnace Contractor), while also
providing the performance guarantee. With the Involvement of these two
contractors whose work will be supervised by the company management with
the help of TA, the risk of delay in project execution is minimized. As
for the limestone, forestry and charcoal components of the Project, BCC
will use foreign consultants to review the work at different critical
stages of planning and Implementation.   As the TA services will continue
for two years after project completion, potential difficulties In
stabilizing production at higher operating levels will be reduced.
Further, as the Government allows necessary autonomy to the Company and
since the Managing Director of the Company is from TCC, the private
shareholder, and as he has the right to hire the necessary staff at
competitive salaries, no problem Is foreseen In running the company with
competent professional management. The marketlng risk is reduced with the
long-term sales arrangements with Indian companies for a substantial part
of the annual projected production from the carbide plant.

IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Benefits and Costs
9.01      The assumptions used in the economic analysls of the Project are
given in Annex 9-1. All economic costs and benefits for tradeable items
have been valued at international prices estimated to prevail during the
economic life of the project and adjusting these prices to reflect the
appropriate transportation costs. For non-tradeable items, domestlc prlces
have been used and, where applicable, adjusted to reflect the economic
price of their internationally traded components. Local costs were
adjusted using a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.95.
9.02      Of the total expected production of nearly 20,000 tpy (at 90X
capacity utilization) about 17,000 would be marketed in India and the
remaining 3,000 in Bangladesh. As a result of the free trade treaty
between Bhutan and India, calcium carbide imported to India from Bhutan
would not be subject to Indian duties and taxes as would imports from other
countries. This would enable Bhutan to sell its product at over 502 above
the prevailing international prices. However, in our analysis we have
assumed that the economic price of calcium carbide is the c.l.f. price in
Calcutta (of imports from other countries) plus the transportation cost
differential for supply to the main consuming centers in Eastern India,
the prime marketing area for the carblde from Bhutan. This is based on the
rationale that the Project should be economically viable even without any
protection from Indian duties and taxes. Our analysis assumes that the
ex-factory price of calcium carbide would remain at US$500 per ton, at
March 1985 price level, during the life of the Project.
9.03      The economic capital cost of the Project, excluding working
capital, was estimated at US$16.9 million. This was obtained by deflating
the estimated financial capital cost at current terms to March 1985 levels
using approprlate deflation factors and by adjusting local costs by using a
standard conversion factor of 0.95.
9.04      Economic operating costs were obtained from the financial
operating costs after adjusting the prices of Imported inputs to reflect
their International prices and by excluding duties and taxes. The economic
cost of electric power, one of the most signiflcant inputs for the
production of calcium carbide is expected to remain at US$0.015 (Nu 0.20)
per Kwh in constant prices, reflecting the economic price that Bhutan would
obtain from exporting the surplus power to India. This price Is based on a
102 rate of return on investment.
B. Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Sensitivity Analysis
9.05      The base case economic rate of return has been calculated at
about 21% and the Net Present Value (NPV) at 102 discount rate at about
US$11 milllon. The high econo2ic return reflects the advantage that Bhutan
enjoys as a result of Its proximity to the main market (Eastern India) and
access to electric power, charcoal and limestone - the major raw materials
required for the production of calcium carbide. The economic cost and

benefit streams used for computatlon of the economic rate of return are
given in Annex 9-2 and the results of the sensitivity analysis are
euvmarized below:

Operating Cost                                    +44.0
Capacity Utilization                              -38.0
9.06      The table shows that the economic rate of return will not be
affected significantly by changes in most project variables, except for
changes In product prices. Although the rate of return is very sensitive
to changes ln product prices, prices would have to decrease about 22Z In
real terms before the rate of return falls below 101, the opportunity cost
of capital In Bhutan. Even if the proportion of charcoal to petroleum coke
remains at 70/30 beyond 1992, the economic rate of return will remain at
about 20 percent.
9.07      The difference between the financial and economic rates of return
is mainly due to the difference in product prices. The Indian Government,
in order co protect the local carbide Industry Imposes a heavy lmport duty
on imports, causing the local prices to be well above international
prices. Slce Bhutanese products can be sold freely in India and are
exempt from dutles and taxes, the netback to the project is well above
International prices and even above the net ex-factory prices of Indian
manufacturers who are subject to sales tax and excise dutles.
C. Other Benefits
9.08      The Project, one of the largest Industrial ventures undertaken In
Bbutan, represents a major step In the country's development efforts. The
Project would generate foreign exchange revenues of over USS10 million
equivalent per year from the export of products. The net foreign exchange



- 46 -
earnings of the Project during its 12 year economic life after accounting
for imported materials and services but excluding debt servicing has been
estimated at about US$65 million at March 1985 prices. The Project, as a
result of interest and corporate income taxes paid and dividends
distributed, would also become a major source of funds for the Government.
It would also stimulate the development of upstream facilities such as
limestone mining, forestry development and charcoal production, and
downstream facilities for production of acetylene gas, acetylene black,
oxygen, desulfurizing compound, etc. The Project would provide direct
employment to about 500 persons and indirect employment to at least another
500.  In addition it would also provide training for Bhutanese nationals in
several trades and thereby assist Bhutan in its goal of increasing the
number of trained personnel.

BHUTAN - CALCIUM CARBIDE PROJECT
Assumptions Used for Financial Analysis
A. Capital Cost
Project capital costs were estimated by ICB, the consultants, and
reviewed by the Bank mission. A 10% physical contingency and a 17.66Z
price contingency has been added to the base cost. Price contingency for
foreign cost (excluding Indian) was computed assuming that annual price
increases, in dollar terms, would average 5.0% in 1985, 7.5% in 1986, 8.0%
between 1987 and 1990, and 5.0% thereafter; price increases for Indian and
local costs are expected to be 7.0% in 1985, 7.5% from 1986 to 1989, and 5%
thereafter. Exchange rate is assumed to remaiil at US$1.00 - Nu 13.00 - Rs
13.00. Phasing of capital costs, including physical contingency but
excluding price contingency, has been assumed to be as follows:
(million Nu)
1985      1986       1987      1988      1989     1990
At 1984 prices      18.36     57.35      78.15      50.52    12.52      3.65
At nominal prices  18.64      62.55      91.83      63.95    17.08      5.23
Working Capital
Working capital requirements of the Project are shown in the
following table. About 70% of it would be built up during the first year
of operation and the remaining 30% during the second year.

Revenues
Ex-factory price of calcium carbide has been conservatively
estimated to be Nu 7,200 (US$554) per ton in Harch 1985 prices. The two
by-products lime fines and liquor, are expected to be sold at about Nu 400
(US$31) and Nu 5,000 (US$$385) per ton, respectively. Since the calcium
carbide selling price is expected to increase in line with the price of raw
materials, power and labor, in preparing financial projections for the
Project, we have assumed that in nominal terms, the calcium carbide price
will increase at the same rate as inflation. Prices of lime fines and
liquor are also expected to increase at the same rate as inflation.

Operating Costs
Project operating costs, at 100Z capacity utilization are shown
in the following table. All operating costs (excluding depreclation) are
expected to increase at the same rate as Inflation. In order to account
for inefficiencies that may be encountered during the initial years of
operation, variable costs have been adjusted to include a contingency of
25% in the first year of operation, 15% in the second year and 5Z in the
third year.

Interest Charges
We have assumed that proceeds of the IDA Credit and Kuwait Fund
loan would be onlent to BCC at an annual interest rate of 10.25% and 82,
respectively. The Norwegian grant would be passed on as Government
equity. Interest charges up to 1988, the year of project commissioning,
would be capitalized as interest during construction; from FY89 onwards,
they would be expensed and accordingly reflected in the income statement.

Capacity Utilization
The ProJect is expected to be commissioned around April 1, 1988.
Capacity utilization is expected to increase gradually from 45% for 9
months in 1988, to 70% in 1989, 80% in 1990, and 90% thereafter.
Economic Life of the Project
In estimating the financial rate of return of the Project, we
have assumed an economic life of 12 years, at the end of which 15% of the
capital cost and 100% of working capital would be recovered. The 15%
capital cost recovery is higher than the normal of 10% assumed for chemical
projects because of the forestry and mining components included in the
Project. The economic life of the forestry and mining components would be
significantly higher than the 12 years assumed for a chemical plant.
Dividend Payment
ECC is expected to start paying dividends from 1990 onwards,
after reaching an average annual capacity utilization of 80%. It is
assumed that BCC will distribute about 50% of Net Income as dividends.

BHUTAN - CALCIUM CARBIDE PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Capital Cost
1.        The economic capital cost of the Project is based on the
financial capital cost expressed in March 1985 prices and applying a
standard conversion factor of 0.95 to the local currency components of the
capital cost. Adjustment for dutles and taxes is not required as the
Project would not be subject to any import duties or taxes. Local and
Indian costs are converted to US dollars using an exchange rate of US$1.00
- NU 13.00 - Rs. 13.00. Phasing of capital costs (including 102 physical
contingency but excluding price contingency) has been assumed to be as
follows:

2.        Since the Project is export oriented, both monetary and
non-monetary components of working capital have been included in the
economic working capital as they reflect costs to the country. The total
economic working capital requirement of the Project is as shown In the
table below.

5.        Variable and fixed costs are assumed to remain constant in real
terms. In order to account for lnefficlencies that may be encountered
during the initial years of operation, varlable costs have been adjusted by
using a contingency of 25% during the first year (1988), 15Z in the second
year (1989), and 52 In the third year (1990).
E. Capacity Utilization
6.        The Calcium Carbide Project is expected to be commissioned on
April 1, 1988. Capacity utilization is expected to Increase gradually from
45% for 9 months in the first year (1988) to 70% In the second year (1989),
80% in the third year (1990), and 90% thereafter.

F.   Economic Life of the Project
7.        The Project is expected to have an economic operating life of 12
years at the end of which 152 of the capital cost and 100l of the working
capital would be re':overed. The 15X capital comt recovery is higher thdn
the normal of 102 asuumed for chemlcal projects because of the forestry and
mlning components included In the Project. The economic life of the
forestry and mining components would be significantly higher than the 12
years assumed for a chemical plant.
