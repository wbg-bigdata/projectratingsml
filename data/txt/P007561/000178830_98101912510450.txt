MEXICO
RAINFED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
General
1.01      Mexico has a land area of 197 million ha of which about 30 million
are considered cultivatable, 78 million are classified as range land, 44 million
are suitable for forestry and the remainder is either too dry, too poorly
drained, or too steep for any form of food and fiber production. Of the
estimated 30 million ha of potentially arable land, an average of 15 million
ha is presently cropped, including approximately 5 million ha under irrigations
The cropped area has remained constant since 1965 at about 15 million ha, and
production increased from 1965 to 1978 at a yearly average of only 1.4%, down
from 5% a year from 1945-65. Livestock production expanded during the same
period at about 4% yearly. As a share of national GDP, agriculture declined
from 14% in 1965 to just over 9% in 1978.
1.02      Despite increasing urbanization, agriculture employs about 40% of
the labor force in Mexico, providing a livelihood for some 4 million families,
1.3 million of which are landless. About two-thirds of this labor force have
earnings below the minimum wage.
1.03      External trade in agricultural products remains favorable.  Agricul-
tural exports in 1979 amounted to about 20% of total merchandise exports
(nearly 35% of non-oil exports), while the share of agricultural imports in
total merchandise imports was about 7%. However, the combined effect of rapid
population growth (3% a year on average during the 1970s) and the declining
growth in agricultural production has resulted in a significant increase in
food imports, particularly of maize, wheat, sorghum and oilseeds.
Rainfed Agriculture
1.04      Rainfed agriculture, including crop lands, grazing and forest,
covers a heterogeneous assortment of soils and climates, ranging from desert
to humid tropics. In terms of public investment, the rainfed areas have been
largely neglected; over the past three decades, nearly 90% of public expendi-
tures in the agricultural sector went for capital and current costs in the
irrigated areas. However, rainfed agriculture still accounts for over 70% of
the cropped area, and up to 50% of the value of agricultural output.
Government Policies and Strategies
1.05      The rate of expansion of irrigated areas, once the most important
underlying factor in the rapid increase of agricultural production in Mexico,
has slowed in recent years. Between 1952 and 1965, the area harvested under
irrigation went up from 1.6 million ha to 3.5 million ha (an increase of
about 150,000 ha/year) but the expansion slowed between 1965 and 1979 to
about 100,000 ha/year. While it is hoped that the current rate of expansion
can be maintained for at least 10 more years, it is recognized that the scope
for opening up new irrigated lands under large-scale schemes is becoming
smaller and such development is becoming more difficult and less cost



effective. Concurrently the rate of increase in crop production per unit
area has also slowed down due mainly to a lagging in technical innovation
and application and inadequate maintenance. As a result more emphasis is
being given to rehabilitation of existing irrigation areas, the development
of more small-scaLe (local) irrigation programs and the upgrading of tech-
nical services in both ongoing and new projects.
1.06      In addition to a shift in its irrigation development strategy in
recent years there has been a gradual change in Government policy towards the
promotion of rainEed agriculture which up to 1975 received less than 10% of
all public funds Spent in the agricultural sector. The reasons for increased
attention to rainEed areas are threefold. First, in areas of adequate rainfall
(above 700 mm annually) there is still important potential to increase produc-
tivity of rainfed crops and livestock through application of available tech-
nology and to increase cropped areas through improved drainage. The average
costs of bringing about  these changes are considered to be lower than those
of large scale irrigation. Second, investments in rainfedl agriculture are
also considered an important means by which to redress the social imbalance
now evident in Mexican agriculture: while rainfed areas produce only 50% of
the value of agriculture output, they comprise 87% of all farmers. Third, the
Government has been particularly concerned about growing imports of basic
staples, especialLy maize, beans and wheat, due to stagnating domestic produc-
tion of these commnodities; of the total cropped area under rainfed conditions
of eleven million ha, 8.6 million ha is under maize and beans, with average
yields that have changed little in the last decade.
1.07      The present administration took the first major step toward increased
public investment in rainfed areas in 1976 with the merging of the Secretariat
of Water Resources and the Secretariat of Agriculture into the new Secretariat
of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH). This was followed in March 1977 by
a presidential decree establishing the General Directorate of Rainfed Districts
and Units (DGDUT) within SARH with the specific objective to coordinate and
expand line agencies' activities in promoting rainfed production at the
district level (paras 2.03 and 2.04). In addition, early in 1980 the Government
announced a Food ])evelopment Plan which has, among others, the objectives of
promoting basic food production through higher guaranteed prices, better crop
insurance and improved input supplies. The Rainfed Districts were designated
as the main execulive arm to implement the productive part of the plan.
Present Bank Participation in the Sector
1.08      During the past six years (FY 1975-80), Bank participation in the
agricultural sector amounted to US$1.5 billion distributed over 13 projects as
follows:
(a) Irrigat:'on (Panuco, Sinaloa, Fuerte/Sinaloa, Bajo Bravo!
Bajo San Juan, and Apatzingan) - US$450 million;
(b)  Rural Development (PIDER I and II and Papaloapan Basin) -
US$280 niillion;
(c)  Credit 'FIRA Projects V, VI, VII) - US$650 million;
(d) Area Development (Tropical Agriculture) - US$56 million; and
(e)  Small-Scale Agricultural Infrastructure Development -
US$60 mi.llion.



1.09      Implementation of the above projects is generally satisfactory,
varying somewhat with the implementation capabilities of the agencies involved.
Especially relevant to this project is the experience gained under the FIRA
credit projects, and more recently that being obtained under PIDER and the
Tropical Agriculture Project. Under the PIDER projects and the Tropical
Agricultural Development Project, separate funds were provided to finance
the agricultural credit requirements of the project rather than obtaining
credit through the country-wide FIRA program. The established procedures
whereby the public and private banks rediscounted on-farm loans through
FIRA were used for these projects. This was done to enable the management
of each project to focus more sharply on its credit activities than would
have been possible if the funds had been obtained from general FIRA sources.
In particular, this approach enabled closer attention to be given to pro-
viding additional technical support to those recipients of credit under
those projects. Also by involving directly the agencies in SARH responsible
for providing technical support, particularly the extension service, better
opportunities were provided for improving the coordination between them and
the banking institutions than were possible under the FIRA country-wide proj-
ects. Increasingly the Bank has stressed lending to low-income producers and
greater emphasis on crop rather than livestock production. The proposed
project would be the first to provide funding exclusively for the rainfed
areas and thus it is congruous with the increased emphasis given by Government
to improving the productivity of farmers in such areas.
II. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF RAINFED AGRICULTURE
Introduction
2.01      In addition to DGDUT (para 1.07), more than 20 agencies are directly
or indirectly involved in promoting agricultural production in rainfed areas.
The most important are (a) those integrated in the various secretariats:
SARH, with the extension service (DGPEA), the national research institutes for
crops (INIA), livestock (INIP) and forestry (INIF); the small-scale irrigation
agency (OHDR) and the soil conservation service (DGCSA); the Secretariat of
Industry and Commerce with its buying and marketing agency for agricultural
produce (CONASUPO) and the Secretariat of Human Settlements and Public Works
(SAHOP) for the construction of rural access roads; (b) the public and private
banking system for credit to agricultural producers, foremost among them the
Government-owned BANRURAL; and (c) Government-owned autonomous organizations
such as FERTIMEX for fertilizer supplies and ANAGSA for crop insurance.
2.02      With regard to the agencies mentioned in paragraph 2.01, two per-
formance judgments are of general validity: performance on infrastructure
(i.e., roads, small irrigation systems, water supply) has generally been
better than on other development activities, at least in rainfed areas, and,
second, lack of coordination among these agencies at the field level has
reduced the productive impact of investments both in infrastructure and new
technology generation. In view of this, the Government's decision to create
DGDUT with the main objectives of (a) reinforcing extension, credit, and
research services in rainfed areas; and (b) obtaining maximum coordination and
participation of all groups involved at the local level, was an important step
in the right direction.



General. Directorate for Rainfed Districts and Units (DGDUT)
2.03      Following the pattern established earlier in the organization of
irrigation districts, the SARH General Directorate of Rainfed Districts and
Units (DGDUTJ) estaIished 124 rainfed districts (Distritos de Temporal (DT)),
covering 70% of the total area of the country. The main objectives are to
rein. force extensio-n, research and credit services and to encourage maximum
participation of aLl local groups involved (producers, banks, technical
services, inDutt and marketing organizations, and infrastructure agencies)
in order to increase olltput of crops, livestock and forestry products.
PlanniThg and budge-ing are at the DT level, with budgets developed through
discassiorn and agreement among the groups, both informally and formally
at the DT executive co=mittee level.  Each DT is responsible for managing
its owil budget once it has been approved by federal and state authorities.
2.04      Although the DGDUT has been operating for only two years, con-
siderable progress 'nas been made in getting the important line agencies to
work cooperatively., The state SARH representatives have allocated staff
to the DTs in their states and have designated (in collaboration with DGDUT)
chiefs for each of the 124 D'Is in the country.  DGDUT has also drawn up a
National Plan for Eainfed Agriculture Development (PLANAT) which sets up
the DT, consisting of several municipios within a single state, as the basic
development unit upon which to build a strong planning and execution capa-
bility, The operating program in each district is further sujbdivided into
Units and Zones (Annex 2, Chart 1) in order eventually to attain direct
contact: with and participation of the majority of farm families. This also
provides the structure for obtaining maximum participation of all the local
groups involved (p^ra 2.03).
2.05      A key feature of the DT organization is that, for the first time
-'n rainfed areas ir M.exico, extension coverage by SARH field staff has been
decentralized so that it should now be possible to provide technical services
4rn most rainfed areas in the country. Each district is subdivided into units
of about 6,000 to 10,000 ha based on municipal boundaries. The units are
subdivided into zones of about 500 farm families, with two to four zones
per unit.  The DT organization provides for one field extension worker to
be located in each zone with a unit extension officer (Unit Chief) respon-
sible for the zone extension officers in his unit. The Unit Chiefs report
to the Director of Operations who is responsible for all day-to-day opera-
tions in the district including extension. The Director of Operations reports
directly to the District Chief. Technical support for the field staff is
provided by resident specialists from each subsecretariat of SARH, Thus,
dependinig on the agricultural pattern, program offices for agrictulture, hydrau-
lic resources, livestock, and Eorestry could be located in a DT.  T2he subject
matter specialists from these offices would work closely with unit chiefs
and maintain close contact with the field level research teams from the
three research institutes, INIA, INIP and INIF, working in the DT.
2.06      The DT organization structure also provides for the followiu.g
administrative features: (a) a district executive committee, with member-
ship comprising representatives of all relevent line agencies concerned
with district development and producer groups. This committee functions as the
body responsible for formuilation of the district development plans and budget.



-5-
Once these plans have been reviewed and approved by SARH, COPRODE and the
Secretariat for Programming and Budgeting (SPP) at the state and national
levels, the committee is also responsible for execution; (b) a technical
committee to advise on all technical matters related to DT development and
provide the backstopping necessary to formulate the district development plan
and supervise its execution; and (c) the appointment of a district chief as
executive officer to carry out the decisions of the executive committee and a
chief of operations to assist him (see Annex 2, Chart 1).
Technical Services
2.07      Extension.  The SARH General Directorate for Production and
Agricultural Extension (DGPEA) is the public body responsible for extension
in Mexico. Government support for extension has expanded rapidly since 1970,
reaching US$67.8 million in 1979 (US$52.5 million normal budget, US$14.2
million PIDER, 1/ and US$1.1 million PRODERITH 2/). DGPEA now has a total
national staff of 8,787 of which 2,530 have professional level training, 4,780
have been trained at an intermediate level and the remaining 1,467 have lower
levels of training; on average, each field staff professional is responsible
for two or three intermediate level staff and about 2,000 farmers. With the
exception of most irrigation districts, the overall reputation of the exten-
sion service is not very high in Mexico. First, many of the staff are not
sufficiently trained and there is a dearth of subject matter specialists able
to back up extension agents. Second, staff is too thinly spread which,
together with a lack of transportation, results in too few contacts with the
farmer. Third, linkage between research and extension is inadequate and as a
result not enough tested technology is available to the extension worker.
Fourth, the fact that new budget appropriations do not become available to the
service until well into the fiscal year severely cuts down on operating
budgets in the agriculturally important early months of the year and further
limits effectiveness.
2.08      Livestock and Forestry Services.  Although the responsibility for
extension work with farmers is vested in the SARH Sub-secretariat for Agriculture
and Operations, other development services are provided to farmers by the
Sub-Secretariats of Livestock and Forestry. In the livestock sector, the
services of direct relevance to this project that are in need of strengthening
at the district level include diagnostic services, disease prevention and
parasite control. More investment is also needed in the small animal field to
improve home production and augment family meat supplies. In the forestry
sector, existing services for farmers are very limited. A small amount of
nursery material is provided and this activity requires expansion. Assistance
in introducing more rational approaches to wood production and exploitation is
also needed, including the establishment of firewood lots and distribution of
seedlings and technical advice.
1/   Rural development project initiated in 1973 which has had the support
of two IBRD loans (1110-ME and 1462-ME).
2/   Tropical Agriculture Development Program initiated in 1978 with funding
from IBRD Loan 1553-ME.

Research
2.09      Crop, livestock and forestry research is mainly the responsibility
of the SARH agencies:  INIA, INIP and INIF,  Other specialized single-crop
agencies (e.g., coffee and sugar) and the various universities also do some
research, but only INLA, INIP and INIF would be closely associated with the
rainfed districts project.
2.10      INIA.  INIA is the oldest and best developed of the three institutes.
Since its founding in 1960, it has had national respornsibility for crop
research. It has been allocated increasing funds (1979 budget was Mex$1,096
million (US$47.7 million) , up from Mex$192 million (US$15.4 million at 12.50/
dollar) in 1974), with which it has expanded its research staff and has improved
the scope and orientation of its work. In August 1977, significant organiza-
tional changes were made within INIA permitting it to tie its work more
closely to the needs of the agricultural producers in the rainfed areas. Of
the almost 10,000 experiments conducted in 1978/79, slightly more than 50%
were carried out under rainfed conditions.  Under its decentralization plan,
program coordinators have been moved from Mexico City to regional locations.
It has therefore delegated more responsibility to its 11 regional research
centers each with a network of experimental stations (54 in the 11 regions)
and has adopted a multidisciplinary team approach whereby teams work on
specific commodities or production systems on farmers' fields, Of the 917
professional staff, 10% have or are studying for the PhD degree, 30% have or
are studying for al M.S. degree and the balance have B.S. degrees.  Even so,
given the urgency of increasing basic food crop production, there is still a
need to further increase the number and upgrade the academic qualifications of
staff, as well as to improve physical facilities and equipment, continue to
strengthen applied research on farmers' fields in rainfed areas, integrate
research information into technological packages for the many agroecological
regions, and improve interaction with other research institutes and with the
extension service.
2.11      INIP.  Predecessor agencies in animal research, dating back some
40 years, were mosl:ly concerned with the production of vaccines and other
animal health products. However, since 1968 INIP has had national responsi-
bility for studying all problems limiting livestock production and today its
major emphasis is on animal production rather than animal health problems.
National program coordinators are located at its principal laboratories in
Palo Alto and coordinate national programs in the seven regional centers which
have a network of 25 experiment stations. Scientific personnel number 236
professionals of whom 1.1 have PhD degrees, 45 hold degrees and the balance
have undergraduate degrees. INIP has an urgent need to increase and upgrade
staff and research facilities and capabilities to permit greater success in
removing factors limiting production, particularly of smallholders who follow
a mixed livestock-crop production system. However, its 1979 budget was only
Mex$290 million (US$12.6 million).
2.12      INIFo  Although forestry research was initiated some 50 years ago,
INIF is the least developed of the three national research institutes. Begin-
ning in 1977 it initiated a process of transformation and growth which resulted
in a modification cf its structure and management. Currently it has three
principal activities: research, training and technical support services.



-7-
Research program coordination continues to be concentrated at the headquarters
in Coyoacan. However, it is decentralizing as fast as facilities are made
available at the six existing regional centers (two more are planned) and
related experiment stations. Field research is thus carried out mainly at six
locations, two of which are in arid, two in temperate and two in tropical
areas, but most of its efforts are concentrated in the temperate pine forest
region. Of the existing professional staff of 184, few have advanced degrees
and many were trained in fields other than forestry. The inadequate budget
(US$8.2 million in 1978) and paucity of trained staff are main limitations to
strengthening the Institute's research capability and to rapid expansion of
research and extension programs in forest production for rainfed districts.
Soil and Water Conservation.
2.13      The DGCSA is a fairly recently created and still small General
Directorate of SARH; it carries out its works through contractors and has a
total professional staff of only 125. Its program has been largely limited to
a single practice approach: erosion control, and mainly in areas of severe
erosion with limited importance from an agricultural point of view. Although
the quality of works has been adequate overall, questions have arisen as to
benefits. There is a recognized need to (a) shift emphasis in erosion control
work to areas w-ith lesser slopes which are still being cropped and where a
productive impact could be obtained; and (b) increase training and demonstra-
tion activities in the fields of soil and water conservation.
Credit, Insurance and Supply of Inputs
2.14      Credit.  The National Bank for Rural Credit (BANRURAL) was formed in
1975 through the amalgamation of three state-owned agricultural banks. With a
staff of more than 24,000 in 12 regional subsidiary banks and more than 400
branches, it is the biggest bank in the country. At the close of 1979, its
total assets amounted to Mex$70,991 million (US$3,141 million) and its total
loan portfolio to Mex$55,490 million (US$2,455 million), of which some 27% was
in arrears. BANRURAL's 1979 lending program amounted to Mex$37,000 million
(US$1,600 million) of which 90% was short term and 10% medium and long term.
2.15      BANRURAL lends to approximately 17% of Mexican farmers nationwide.
However, in rainfed areas - as opposed to irrigated areas - coverage is much
lower, at around 8% in any given year. The low level of penetration is mostly
due to infrastructural deficiencies which limit farmer access to credit and by
BANRURAL's restrictions on lending to farmers who are in arrears. Lending is
based on farm models specified on a per hectare or per livestock unit basis,
containing a calender of activities, a list of goods required for operation,
and a budget which implies no risk by incorporating normal year assumptions.
These models are used to develop a lending budget for each branch by estimating
the number of farmers that will apply and their categorization as to model.
Short-term loan appraisal does not evaluate loans in terms of general improve-
ments they might bring about in the farming system and to agricultural produc-
tion. Also, coordination with research and extension services is generally
absent.
2.16      BANRTRAL's overall financial position is weak and each year it has
to be supported by large Government subsidies. Interest rates it charges
vary fror 12"         5 tcr s_as aai credit and from 14.5% to 21.5% for medium-
and lon-termE se:il d;uer its normal operations.  Interest income in 1979



- 8 -
was 9.:L% of net interest-earning assets.  Against this, interest expense in
1979 was 7.2%, leaving it with a positive spread of 1.9%. This, however, was
not enough to cove: non-interest expenses, and net incomes from banking
operations before subsidies showed a deficit of Mex$3,672 million (US$162
million) in 1979. Nevertheless, this has not restricted the bank's operations
because of its access t:o Government resources and guarantees. Annex 1 shows
financial ratios based upon BANRURAL's balance sheets, operation and income
statements over the past five years.
2.17      The Government subsidy to BANRURAL covers BANRURAJ's reserves for
unrecoverable loans and a portion of BAIRURAL's administrative expenses.
These costs arise clue to several factors. First, BANRURAL's operations are
not well integrated with extension services. Borrowers generally receive
weak follow-tp technical assistance, frequently only from the BANRURAL
credit technician wFho must be both banker and extensionist because SARH
extension services have been nearly non-existent in most rainfed areas.
Second, the poor contact between BANRURAL technicians and SARH extension
and research technicians means that BANRURAL staff frequently do not have
the latest technical recommendations to give to their clientele. BANRURAL
lending is based on standard models, with little variation to compensate
for local conditiorLs and latest research findings; bank technicians therefore
have little flexibility to incorporate new technologies in farm lending. The
overall result is that most of BANRURAL borrowers in the rainfed areas get
little or no technical service and hence run a higher risk of crop failure and
loan default. With increasing demands for credit, BANRURAL's staff is being
stretched even thinner in a generally unsuccessful attempt to be both a
provider of credit and of technical assistance. Third, the Government uses
BANRURAL to channel as loans, payments which are really grants made for social
reasons with no expectation of recovery. Fourth, BANRURAL was created by
merging three public sector banks. The administrative economies that were
expected have not been achieved; staffing levels are excessive as BANRURAL
follows a policy of staff reduction through attrition. The correspondingly
high staff costs are an important reason for BANRURAL's high administrative
costs.
2.18      Crop Instrance.  The Government-sponsored crop insurance prog:ram,
implementated by the National Crop and Livestock Insurance Agency (ANAGSA),
covers all of the main cereals, oil crops and cotton. All crop production
loans made by BANRURAL are contingent on the farmer carrying appropriate
insurance. The insurance plan covers a maximum of 70% of the estimated
production costs for irrigated crops and 50% for non-irrigated crops. The
premium paid by the insured varies from 4% to 8.25% of total estimated produc-
tion costs and is collected out of the loan at the start of the crop season.
However, premiums collected from farmers cover only part of the indemnities
paid; on average, some 40% of indemnities are funded by Government.
2.19      Fertilizer Supp§ly.  In terms of both value and bulk, the most
important purchased input needed to increase Mexico's agricultural production
is fertilizer. The Government-owned corporations, Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX)
and Fertilizantes Mexicanos (FERTIMEX), are expanding productiLon of raw mate-
rials as well as the manufacture and distribution of fertilizer. A Bank-financed
project (Loan 1686-SE, 1976) is presently assisting to expand capacity to
meet expected increases in demand for phosphatic and nitrogenous fertilizers
through the early 1980s.



- 9 -
2.20      FERTIMEX is the only agency handling wholesale distribution of
fertilizers, including ammonia for direct application. However, it uses
several channels for distribution: in 1977, the company sold about 42% of the
fertilizer directly and the remaining 58% indirectly with the assistance of
four other organizations. FERTIMEX could usefully increase the number of
dealers located close to small farmers and this would require expanding the
distribution system. Fertilizer prices are not subsidized.
Marketing and Storage
2.21      Agricultural output in Mexico is marketed largely through private
channels, with floor prices provided by the National Marketing Corporation for
Basic Foods (CONASUPO) in the case of basic grains. Government plays a vital
role in setting floor prices for several staples and purchases basic grains
at the floor price. The Secretariat of Industry and Commerce determines prices
of a limited range of basic food commodities to the farmer, the processcr, and
the consumer, and CONASUPO administers (a) the farm support price system and
produce purchasing centers; (b) grain storage; (c) state retail distribution
outlets for food stuffs; and (d) several major agroindustries. The guaranteed
prices are set before the planting period so as to influence farmers' planting
decisions. Present guarantee prices are in line with world prices except for
the primary staple grain, maize, which is about 30% above.  Lack of transporta-
tion for moving the harvest to market has been a seasonal problem, but Govein-
ment is trying to correct it.
Infrastructure
2.22      Rural Access Roads.  Most road design and construction in Mexico
is handled by SAHOP. The Bank has a long history of operating with SAHOP
through seven highway projects and presently under the Highway Sector Loan
1671-ME. SAHOP has developed a large and competent staff and has some degree
of responsibility for all five categories of roads: federal highways, state
highways, local feeder roads, rural roads and toll facilities. Planning and
construction of local and rural roads are carried out by the local "Centros
SAHOP" after agreement with the State Highway Board and the municipalities
involved. These roads are aimed primarily at joining small towns and villages
with the nearest main road. SAHOP also has final authority for design standards
and specifications. SAHOP's standards and practices, which are summarized
in their engineering manuals, are satisfactory and are followed by the SREH
Sub-secretariat of Hydraulic Infrastructure which carries out some rural road
construction, usually related to works for irrigation and drainage projects.
2.23      Irrigation and Drainage Works.  Most small-scale hydraulic works in
Mexico are designed and constructed by the SARH Sub-secretariat for Hydraulic
Infrastructure (SIH) through its Directorate of Hydraulic Works for Rural
Development (OHDR). OHDR operates through four regional offices plus offices
in each state. Professional and technical support staff number more than
1,600, with some 400 at headquarters. OHDR has gained considerable experience
through a series of IDB loans, the present Bank Loan 1643-ME and financing
under PIDER I and II.



- 10 -
2.24      Each OHDR regional office is responsible for preparing its region's
plans, project design and the physical implementation of projects, be it
by force account or contract.  Project documentation is prepared according
to the standard guidelines set forth by the central office and includes:
detailed engineering studies, agricultural development plans, analysis of
social and economic benefits and a participation agreement (Convenio de
Participacion) signed by all beneficiaries. This agreement establishes that
the users' share in project financing will be equivalent to 30% of total
project cost. Of this, up to 10% can be contributed as labor and the remainder
will be in cash, either by financing, usually through credit, the purchase of
equipment or by means of annual payments to the Users' Association. Also, it
establishes, in the case of irrigation works, that the users will be responsible
for all operation and maintenance.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
3.01      All rainfed districts in the country are, to varying degrees, in
need of strengthening and expanding in order to provide more and better
organized services to farmers. However, satisfying these needs would have
required expanding the project beyond what is manageable, and, as a number of
innovations are planned that require field testing, it was decided to phase
the effort and to concentrate in the first phase on nine of the 124 rainfed
districts (IBRD Map 14946). The criteria for this choice were two-fold:
the districts should be representative of both the problems and potential for
rainfed agriculture in Mexico, and the areas should have rainfall sufficient
to respond to improved technology (thus excluding most of the arid North and
Northwest). Of the nine districts chosen, five are in the more populated
central plateau areas: Cholula (Puebla), Chilpancingo (Guerrero), Morelia
(Michoacan), Zapopan (Jalisco) and Jalpa (Zacatecas); and four are in the high
potential Gulf coast region: Cardenas and Villahermosa (Tabasco), Coatzacoalcos
and Martinez de la Torre (Vera Cruz). Land use and population details for the
nine districts are given in Annex 2, Table 1 while rainfall isohyets are
shown in IBRD Map 14946.
3.02      The five districts in the central plateau areas have rainfall
ranging from 400 mu to 1,200 mm annually, with a distinct wet season and dry
season. Due to heavy population pressures on the land, most farmers have
small holdings, with maize and beans being the basic and most widespread crops,
and dairying, pork and poultry as the most important livestock activities.
However, each district has its special characteristics. Ch,olula has a good
potential for improving fruit production and is relatively close to Mexico
City. It also includes the original area of the successful technical assis-
tance program, Plan Puebla, and the Chapingo Graduate School, which was con-
nected with this program, is continuing its applied research and training
program in this district.  Chilpancingo is a rugged mountainous district with
heavy concentrationls of population in fertile valleys. ApaLrt from the need
for better technical services and inputs, this district suffers from having
a poor internal road network. Furthermore, many of the farmers are indigenous
and speak little or no Spanish. Zapo an and Morelia are old agricultural
areas which are weLl developed by rainfed agricultural standards. In parti-
cular, they have good technical services and Zapopan has some of the highest



- 11 -
individual maize yields under rainfed conditions in Mexico. With the assis-
tance proposed under the project, it is planned that they be used for training
technicians and administrative personnel from other DTs. The uniqueness of
Jalpa is that it is a district in which the private banking system is actively
lending to small farmers. On the technical side, it has already made some
progress in the techniques of water harvesting. This technology, with further
experience, is expected to have widespread impact, particularly in the other
four DTs located in plateau areas. Overall, the agricultural impact of the
project in all five districts is expected to be mainly on the increase in
basic grain and bean yields, and in the improvement of livestock production.
3.03      The four districts in the humid gulf tropics have a favorable climate
and about 8.3 million ha of arable lands of medium to high potential, of which
about 3.6 million ha is virtually unused. Recent discoveries of oil and gas
and large public and private investments resulting from it have provided an
incentive to develop the agricultural potential of the area by greatly expand-
ing the local markets for crop and livestock products. Also, investments in
roads, drains, and other infrastructure have begun to open up previously
inaccessible areas which, before, were devoted exclusively to extensive
livestock production. Martinez de la Torre is one of the most developed DTs
in the Gulf Coast Region and one of the most promising with respect to the
ready acceptance by farmers of new technology. The district of Cardenas
encompasses some of the most developed crop lands in Tabasco and is well
served by the INIA/INIP research station at Huimanguillo and the SARH College
for Tropical Agriculture. One of the earliest large development programs, the
Chontalpa drainage project, is also located in this district. By contrast,
the adjacent district of Villahermosa is much less developed with respect to
annual and perennial crops. However, it has made substantial progress in beef
cattle production and many farmers have adopted pasture improvement programs.
Coatzacoalcos is the least developed of the four and has major communications
and drainage problems. The district's farmers have been largely neglected in
the past but have potential equal to that of farmers in almost all other parts
of the region.
3.04      The nine districts together represent a fairly large area in terms
of a first-phase project and the intensity of services to be provided make for
a fairly sizeable investment. However, the Mexican Government considers, and
the mission concurs, that the long neglect of rainfed agriculture makes it
imperative to move ahead with all means available, for the reasons outlined in
paragraph 1.06. In addition, Mexico has both the financial resources and the
manpower available to carry out the project and make it successful. Further-
more, most of the basic technologies to be promoted under this first-rhase
project have already been developed and tested as to their validity and the
project would enable them to be applied on a much wider scale and with greater
intensity.

IV. THE PROJECT
A.  Introduction and 0eciXeS
4.01      Tne Government of Mexico has requested Bank assistance in financing
an agricultural development program for the country's rainfed areas.  The
proposed project is the first phase of this program, coverirng nine of the
124 rainfed distric-ts in the country.  The project was prepared by DGDUT staff
and field staff of -he nine districts, including those of participating line
agencies, in close collaboration with the Bank.  The intensive preparation
effort look over two years to complete.
4.02      The principal objective of the project is to increase agricultural
production in rainfed areas through implementation of a development program
based on productivilt-y changes in existing areas and development of new areas,
where appropriate, in each district.  Tne key to achieving this objective
would be the establishment of an effective field level extension system
backstopped by coordinated field level research which would form the basis for
a natioTial program serving all rainfed areas. To this end, the project
would assist training and research activities on a national level to establish
the basis for similar programs in additional rainfed districts under a second-
phase project.  The project is expected to be implemented over a five-year
period.
B.  Proie tDescription
4.03      The proposed district development programs vary according to climate,
population density, accessibility and major areas of agricultural specializa-
tion.  The main planned activities, however, can be grouped as follows:
(a)  the promotion of various extension packages Which would combine
available improved cultivation and animal husbandry methods with
the provision of credit, both short and medium/long term, in
which some 36,000 farmers are expected to participate;
(b) production systems research and on-farm testing of new technology;
(c)  a soil and water conservation program, including various types of
terraces, contour furrows and small water storage reservoirs,
covering approximately 65,000 ha and benefitting about 7,000
farmers;
(d)  a rural works program, including the construction or improvement
of some 2,880 km of farm-to-market roads servicing some 70,000
farm families, 7,000 ha of small irrigation schemes to benefit
about 2,00D! farmers and drainage works covering some 30,000 ha
servicirng about 2,000 farm families; and
(e)  a forestry program covering approximately 10,500 ha of pine
plantations,3  900 ha of on-farm woodlots, and 2,000 ha of
windbreak :rees.  This program would involve about 1,000 farm
families.



- 13 -
4.04      In addition to the district programs, the project would provide
support at the national level for: (a) training--about 675 man-years at the
MS level and 100 man-years at the PhD level, primarily in research, extension
and soil and water conservation; (b) field training--three regional training
and information centers would be established by the extension service and
INIF would establish two forestry training centers, one for worker and one
for technical level personnel; (c) specialized consultant services in extension,
research, soil conservation, monitoring and evaluation--about 40 man-years;
and (d) research to strengthen technical programs in the first-Fhase districts
and to establish new and improved technologies for a second- hase project in
additional districts.
4.05      The project would be carried out over five years and would be
implemented by SARH except for the credit and rural roads components. BANRURAL
and FIRA would assist with credit activities and SAHOP would be responsible for
most of the road component.
C. Detailed Features
Promotion of Technology Packages
4.06      The promotion of extension packages entails advice and assistance to
the farmer to bring him to accept new or improved production systems in crop
cultivation, livestock production, and, in some districts, agro-forestry. It
also includes credit to finance the necessary cash outlays to apply these
technologies. These extension packages, also called development plans, take
many forms.
4.07      In the case of annual crop cultivation, for instance, the use of
"high yield demonstration plots," already started in the districts, would
be greatly expanded under the project. On these, a farmer prepares his land
at the right time, using rented machinery where justified, plants improved
seeds with greater seed density, applies fertilizer and intensive weeding
technologies, and controls plant pests as needed. The farmer pays for all
cash inputs, with the extension worker supervising and helping him to obtain
credit. The extension worker also arranges for frequent demonstrations
to other farmers during the growing season. This system has been quite
successful so far on a limited scale.
4.08      In the case of tree crops such as cacao, coconuts, citrus and
bananas, extension workers would usually work through established producer and
producer/processing associations to diffuse improved technologies on plant
material, disease/fungus and insect control, fertilizer applications, and
pruning. Here, too, demonstrations and farmer follow-ip by extension workers
are planned. Based on limited experience to date, substantial production
increases can be expected from rehabilitation of old plantings and the expansion
of area through establishment of new plantings.



- 1 4 -
4.09       In the case of beef, dalry, and dual-purpnse cattle, development
pians 1have been w,orked out that cover the full-farm system, including improved
pastures, purchase of stock and semren, fencing, and parasite and disease
control.  Improved pasture demonstration plots have already started, as have
demonstrations orn tick control, but would be expanded under the project.
Similar plans exist to increase production of small an'Lmals (chickens, rabbits,
turkeys and nogs).
Inttegration of Resarch, Extension and Credit
4,10       Although nu-ch of the basic technology for the packages mentioned
above already exists, conisiderable farmer-field level research is needed to
define more precisely the most productive farming systems for specific areas.
To achieve a widesDread impact, this research would be integrated with exten-
sion and credit, and all three services would be enlarged in the project area.
Over 70% of all district investments planned under the project are devoted to
this integration and improvement.,
4.11       Research.  In the case of research, there would be a substantial
investmnent for increased staff; training; specialist consultants; field and
regional center facilities; and equ:ipment for INIA, INIP and INIF.  To achieve
the necessary district coverage, each of the three research institutes would
establish interdiscirli4nary resear-h teams.  Each team would comprise about
six persons in the case of INIA and up to four in the case of INIP and INIF.
These teams would do much of their work in farmers' fields, particularly in
the case of INIA. They would also collect information about crop and animal
husbandry, forestry, input applications, equipment and farm management to feed
back to the region:al research centers.  Each farming system research program
would consist at aiy given time of three activities:  (a) identifying and
quiantifying technical., economic and social constraints through the study of
existing production systems; (b) research on farmers' fields and at research
centers aimed towa:-d solution of the constraints; and (c) testing of the
solutions on farmers' fields in collaboration with extension personnel.  More
specifically, the farming systems research undertaken by each of the three
*institutes would consist of the following:  INIA would concentrate upon field
and tree crops, ma:Lze, beans, rice, sorghum, wneat and temrperate and tropical
fruits with emphasis upon varietal selection, disease and insect control,
fertllzevr responses and cultural practices; soil and water management; and
improved pasture anid forage Droduction. Provision would a:Lso be made to
strengthen INIA's capacity for regional research on problems specific to some
or all of the nine PLANAT districts. In the case of beef cattle, dairy cattle,
sheep and goats, INIP would concentrate on production systems based on pastures,
ruminant nutrition,, breed improvement, reproductive efficiency, reproductive
diseases, and tick-borne diseases. Its pig and poultry programs would concen-
trate on: managemert systemns, breed improvement, nutrition (emphasizing the
uise of crop residues), reproduction and reproductive diseases.  Support would
also be given to expand INIP's existing regional centers programs to support
the field-ilevel teEm activities.  INIFs teams would mainly undertake surveys;
they would also collaborate with INIA and the extension service in agroforestry
activities in farming systems irt four of the nine DTs where forestry is
considered to have high potential.  However, the main assistance provided to
TNIF would strengthen its presently weak headquarters and regional center
national research Eupport programs (para 4.22) to backstop the modest district
level activities ir this first-phase project.



- 15 -
4.12      Extension.  In the case of extension, the project would achieve a
major reform of the extension system by decentralizing staff and intensifying
coverage; the ratio of zone staff to farmers would double -- from 1:1,000 to
1:500. Extension work would generally fit the model of the training and visit
system in all nine districts so as to: (a) provide frequent contact between
farmers and extension agents; (b) have extension workers concentLrate on
farmers who have accepted a development plan and attempt to reach a wider
number of farmers through demonstrations; and (c) provide regular contact
between farmers, extension agents and field research workers.
4.13      Credit.  Likewise in credit, a major advance is foreseen in increas-
ing lendiing to small farmers and ejidatarios. Present credit coverage is
expected to double. The key elements for reducing risk, increasing the
probability of good production returns for the farmer, and improving loan
recovery rates for the banks would be the back-up support provided by field
extension officers, subject matter specialists, and research staff. The
close cooperation of bank technicians with SARH technical staff in the oper-
ations of the DT would be promoted by bank technicians making visits on
a predetermined schedule to DT Zone and Unit offices. This practice has
three advantages over the current approach. First, the bank can concentrate
its technical staff in clearly defined geographical areas. Second, the closer
link between bank, extension, and research technicians will enable a wider
variety of technologies to be incorporated in the bank's standard lending
models. Third, bank technicians will be able to maintain closer, more regular
contact with their farmer clients. At present, bank staff work out of regional
branch banks that are distant from many farms.
Soil and Water Conservation Programs
4.14      Although the DGCSA would carry out land inventory, training and
demonstrations in all nine districts, work would be concentrated in the five
districts of the central plateau (Cholula, Chilpancingo, Jalpa, Morelia and
Zapopan) where erosion is more widespread and water harvesting would be most
needed in view of frequent dry spells in the rainy season. Soil conservation
works would be different from those implemented in the past in that they would
be concentrated on agriculturally productive soils with slopes not exceeding 6%.
4.15      The program envisaged under the project has been designed to (a) in-
troduce water harvesting practices; (b) promote terraces on slopes to retain
water and facilitate storage; (c) test techniques to conserve soil and water
on a small watershed basis; (d) develop a cadre of soil and water conservation
specialists knowledgable in the above techniques, which are mostly new in
Mexico; and (e) provide funds for studies giving a better understanding
of the control of soil erosion, water harvesting and soil texture, chemical
composition, and nutrients in related watersheds. The principal works would
be the construction of flat channel terraces to collect and hold water for
soil infiltration and contour furrows with level beds combined with small
water storage reservoirs to be used for supplemental irrigation (by gravity or
sprinkler systems).



1.6 -
4.16      The above program would bring soil and water conservation workers
into more contact srth farmers than before. Therefore, soil and water conser-
vation plans would be carried out only with the approval and participation of
the fa:mer, or groups of farmers, concerned.  As most of these works would be
new in MexicoE, It iS envisaged that off-farm cost would be fully borne by
project funds but t:hat farmers would contribute labor and, where appropriate,
the loan of farm machinery. However eventually, when the district farmers
become acquainted with the productive impact of the programi, all the works
would be finan. ced under credit.
Rural Works
4.17     Local Fee ler Roads.  The road program would concentrate mainly on
rehabilitation and upgrading of existing roads (some 70% of the total 2,880
km envisaged) and would be carried out mostly in the districts with the most
deficient feeder road network: Chilpancingo, Jalpa, Coatzacoalcos and
Villahermosa (76% of total investments envisaged). The majority of roads
would be improved through widening, reshaping, provision of drainage structures,
and all-weather su-rfacing, mostly with gravel and cobblestoning on steep
grades. In the hunid lowlands, considerable embankment construction would
also be required.
4.18      In the selection of road works to be carried out at the district
level, priority would be given to servicing municipalities with greatest
populatiotn densities which are currently poorly served and which have the
greatest potential for increasing agricultural production. Final selection
of rural roads to le included in district programs will be contingent upon
economic evaluatior. of each such project. The responsibility for evaluation
design, tendering, supervision of construction and maintenance would be mostly
SAHOP's; only in districts where SIH is particularly active with irrigation
projects would SIH assume responsibility for such activities. SAHOP's road
design standards wculd be used throughout. All works would be carried out by
local contractors; labor-intensive techniques would have limited application
because of the dearth of unemployed manpower during much of the year and
because the nature of the required improvements makes machinery use more
cost-effective. However, local labor would be employed during part of the year
for minor drainage works and cobblestone surfacing.
4.19      Small Irrigation and Drainage.  Small irrigation schemes, mostly
consisting of the construction of wells or small dams with related distribution
systems, would be carried out over a total of some 7,000 ha. Works would
be concentrated in the three central plateau districts of Chilpancingo, Jalpa
and Zapopan (73% of total investments envisaged). Drainage works would be
carried out only in the humid tropical lowlands, with most investments (82%)
concentrated in Coatzacoalcos, Cardenas and Villahermosa districts. These
would consist of a main drain discharging to a water course draining the
area, with related secondary and tertiary ditches spaced at 1,000 m and 400 m
intervals, respectively. These works are expected to cover some 30,000 ha and
would actually enable cultivation for the first time on about one-third
of this area.



- 17 -
4.20      Both small irrigation and drainage works would be carried out by
OHDR through its regional offices, which have gained substantial experience
with these types of works under three previous Bank loans (PIDER I and II and
Small Scale Infrastructure). Under the existing Federal Water Law the Gov-
ernment is permitted to recover a maximum of 30% in small-scale irigation
works but farmers are obliged to pay the full cost of operation and mainte-
nance. The policy of DGDUT is to achieve higher effective levels of capital
investment cost recovery by limiting public investment and encouraging farmers
to finance the bulk of infrastructure through long-term credit. For small-
scale irrigation works under the project, assurances were obtained that for
each sub-project, average public investment per family would not exceed
US$10,000.
Forestry
4.21      The main component of the forestry program would be the establish-
ment of 10,500 ha of pine forest plantations in three districts -- Chilpancingo,
Cholula and Morelia -- on sites where natural regeneration is not possible
because of over-grazing and erosion. This would be an expansion of the work
the forestry service is already carrying out on ejido lands in cooperation
with ejidos or associations of ejidos and on public lands and would follow
established procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. In addition, two
smaller innovative programs would be introduced: the establishment of 900 ha
of on-farm firewood lots and the establishment of 2,000 ha of windbreak/
forage trees, both in the aforementioned districts. For the execution of
these programs, the forestry service would cooperate with the extension and
soil conservation services within the district and obtain the necessary
participation agreement with the farmer or group of farmers. Here, as in the
case of soil conservation works, all investment costs would be financed under
the project because of their innovative nature, but farmers would contribute
labor and use of farm machinery. However, once the programs have been proven
it is planned that farmers would gradually increase their financial involvement
leading to their paying for the programs themselves through credit.
National Support Activities
4.22      In addition to the specific district development programs, the proj-
ect would strengthen institutions participating in rainfed agriculture develop-
ment at regional and national levels. Assistance in training, consultant
services and staff wuld be provided for the extension and soil conservation
services, and the three research institutes: INIA, INIP and INIF. The
support to the research institutes has two goals: to provide in-depth research
support at the regional level for the applied research programs in the nine
districts, and to build a technology base for additional rainfed districts to
be considered for a second-phase PLANAT project. It consists largely of the
recruitment and training of staff for field level teams for 40 more rainfed
districts in the case of INIA and a blend of staff and research infrastructure
for field level teams and regional center support for such teams in the case
of INIF and INIP. The training component for all participating agencies
provides for 478 man-years of overseas fellowships (because national graduate



-$ iS -
schools do not exist for animal and forestry produtction nor for extension and
soil and water conservatiorn); 340 man-years of local fellowships, about 1,900
man-months of short-term in-service training, and 486 man-months of specialist
consultant time. Although the investment is substantial, it is considered
necessary because of the relative neglect of rainfed agriculture in the past
and the variety o:- micro climates and soils for which better technology must
be developed and cested.  The national support proposed for INIF will be
particularly important given INIF's current low-level of research due to staff
restraints in sta:-f and facilities countrywide.  Thus, the proj ect would
emphasize the strengthening of INIF's regional center research and training
support in six high priority watershed locations outside the nine DTs.
D. Project Costs
4.23           Pro;ject costs are estimated at US$797 million, including a
foreign exchange component of US$232 million, or 29%. Base cost of the main
components, based on May 1980 prices, is estimated at US$606 million, physical
contingencies at US$42 million, and price contingencies at US$149 million.
Out of the total cost, the district programs account for 79% and the national
support programs, 21%.
4.24      Physical contingencies have been estimated on the basis of 15%
for civil works and 10% for equipment, machinery and vehicles and on-farm
investments financed through credit. Price contingencies are based on the
Bank's revised guidelines of 10.5% for 1980, 9.0% for 1981, 8.0% for 1982, and
7% for 1983-85. :[t has been assumed that deviations between international and
internal inflation would be offset by compensating changes in the exchange
rate. The amounts for duties and taxes which are included, are insignificant,
since equipment, agricultural machinery and inputs are exempt from import
duties. Project costs are summarized below and details are presented in
Annex 2, Tables 2 through 96.

E.  Ftnancing
4.25      The proposed Bank loan of US$280 million would be equal to the
projecr½s foreign exchange costs, of 29% and 6% of local costs.  Of the
remainling cost. the Government would finance US$317 million, or 40% of the
total, through regular budget appropriations, and the banking system wculd
provide those cred-'t resources not covered by Bank participation, estimated at
US$180 millionX or 20% of the total Vith farmers providing about US$20 million,
or 5% of the total, Assurances were obtained from Governmetnt that funds for
provision of credit would at al'L times be sufficient to cover demand.  Tfhe
Bank loan would be made to Nacional Financiera (NAFINSA) and wou'ld be for
15 years, including three years of grace.
F. Procurement
4.26      Civil works  would total US$125 million.  Because. of the size and
location of the works included in the project, and their spread over the
project area, it is expected that construction contracts would not be big
enough to attract non-Mexican bidders. Moreover, Mexico has a well develoDed
and competent construction industry capable of executing the works at competi-
tive international. costs.  Contracts for construction of ci vil works would be
procured following local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the
Bank. However, to encourage competitiorn and to facilitate Bank supervision,
60 percent of the civil works and buildings would be constructed under
contracts having an estimated value of US$350,000 or more and procured under
public competitive bidding. The remaining 40 percent could be done through
contracts awarded through direct negotiations with contrctors or by 'orce
account.  Tractors and equipment for on-farm development, valued at about
US$21 million would be purchased directly by the farmers from local suppliers,
considering local availability of spare parts and service, a practice applied
in the agricultura:L credit loans to Mexico. Other goods, including operation
and maintenance equipment, chemical reagents, farm, scientific, office and
information and documentation equipment, and vehicles would cost about US$38.8
million.  The goods listed above would be purchased by several agencies in
small quantities in accordance with implementation requirements. Most of the
equipment and vehicles for DT headquarters and supporting offices amounting to
US$2.2 million wou:Ld be purchased From local suppliers who offer a wide range
of international brands, adequate service, and sufficient supp'lies of spare
parts.
4.27      Except for goods fo  on-farm development financed through agricul-
tural credit, contracts for supply of goods exceeding US$350,OOO equivalent
would be procured ithrough international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines.  Smaller contracts could be procured under local procedures
which are satisfactory to the Bank.  Appropriate assurances relating to these
procedures were obtained at negotiations. Bidding documents would be kept in
the PLANAT office and made available for Bank review upon request.

G. Disbursements
4.28      The proposed loan would be disbursed against categories presented
below. Disbursements would be made against normal documentation except for
works by force account and salaries and operating expenses which would be made
against statements of expenditure duly certified by the DTs and agencies.
An annual phasing of project costs is presented in Annex 2, Table 138.
A disbursement schedule, assuming a date of effectiveness of March 1981,
is presented in Annex 2, Table 139.
4.29      To help assure a prompt initiation of the project, recruitment and
training of the extension and research personnel and Project Unit staff would
begin in the fall of 1980, as would the design and preparation of procurement
documentation for construction of buildings at the district and unit levels.
For this reason, retroactive financing of up to US$6 million is proposed
to help cover eligible expenditures after August 1, 1980, but before the
loan is signed.
4.30      The table below sets forth the categories of items to be financed
from loan proceeds, the amounts of the loan allocated to each category and the
percentage of expenditures financed in each category.

H.   Accounts and Auditing
4.31      Project accounts would be kept at four levels:  (a) each participa-
ting district would keep accounts of all expenditures in its district, including
those of line agencies with the exception of the research institutes, INTA,
INIP, and INIF; (b) INIA, INIP and INIF would keep separate accounts of both
the nine district programs and the national support program; (c) the extension
service (DGPEA) arLd the soil conservation service (DGCSA) would keep separate
accounts of their participation under the project in the national support
program; and (d) the PLANAT office within DGDUT (para 5.03) would keep separate
accounts of its irLvolvement in the project.
4.32      All agerLcies having to keep accounts under the project are dependen-
cies of SARH. SAMH accounts are subject to periodic internal audits conducted
by a special audit; division of the secretariat. At negotiations, assurances
were obtained that; the Government would: (a) maintain or cause to be main-
tained separate accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance with consistently
maintained sound aeCcounting practices, resources and expenditures, in respect
of the project, of' the departments and agencies of the Government responsible
for carrying out the project or any part thereof; (b) audit the above accounts
in accordance with the Government's internal procedures and annually furnish to
the Bank a summary statement of such accounts; and (c) furnish to the Bank
such other pertinent information concerning such accounts as the Bank shall
reasonably request; from time to time.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General Aspects
5.01      Overall Administration and Coordination.  The project would be
implemented over f'ive years (Chart 1). DGDUT would have overall responsibility
for administratiorL of the project including the coordination of the line
agencies, inside and outside SARH, involved in the project. Primary responsi-
bility for implementing the district activities supported under the project
would rest with the nine participating DTs. As described in Chapter II, the
organization of each DT calls for the activities of all SARH line agencies to
be placed under tEe control of a District Executive Committee with the District
Chief as the executive officer of that committee. The District Chief would be
assisted by a Technical Committee through which all technical programs would
be formulated before being passed to the Executive Committee for approval.
This local level decentralized decision-making and coordination process is now
functional in all of the nine project DTs although none of them has been fully
staffed. While experience varies widely among these DTs, the general consensus
is that the DT administrative structure has enabled the people involved to
work more effectively. This applies both to those from SARH line agencies and
those outside SARE: operating in the DTs. Furthermore, this structure directly
involves farmers' representatives as members of the District Executive Committee
and promotes the improved contact between farmers and technicians.



- 23 -
5.02      At the national level, the only means of contact between DGDUT
and the other SARH line agencies involved in the project has been
through existing cumbersome SARH bureaucratic procedures. Contact with the
line agencies outside SARH involved in rainfed agricultural development has
been on an informal basis. This has been a weakness in the overall DT admin-
istrative structure which has been addressed under the proposed project. In
addition, it has been recognized that while the basic DT field-level organ-
izational structure is sound, there is still much to be done to make it fully
functional. Some additional measures are needed in the nine project DTs in
order to provide the support needed to intensify field activities in these
DTs. Thus under the project a number of additional organizational measures
would be taken to strengthen capabilities at both National and District
levels to enable the acceleration of rainfed agriculture development in
Mexico. The measures proposed are described below.
5.03      National Level.  The project would comprise a major part of the
PLANAT program, at least in its early stages. The general director of DGDUT
has established a PLANAT office to act as a central project unit for the nine
districts, coordinate the national support programs, establish a project
monitoring and evaluation unit, coordinate the preparation of follow-up
investment programs and carry out feasibility studies. The PLANAT Chief has
been appointed at the sub-directorate level within DGDUT with the same status
as the four existing regional sub-directorates. In order to ensure better
coordination between the SARH line agencies involved in the project the
Secretary of SARH has established a Technical Coordination Committee (TCC)
comprising representatives of these line agencies with the general director of
DGDUT as chairman. The first meeting of the TCC has been held and operational
procedures and terms of reference have been drawn up.
5.04      The main tasks of the TCC would be to establish the priorities
for programs and expenditures of the various agencies involved in DT activi-
ties and to analyze the DT annual budgets, prepared by the DT staff and
approved by the Executive Committees (para 2.06), before presentation through
normal SARH channels to the Secretariat for Programming and Budgeting (SPP)
for inclusion in the national budget. The PLANAT office under DGDUT would (a)
act as executing authority for decisions taken by the TCC; (b) supervise,
monitor and evaluate all activities in the nine participating DTs; (c) review
and aggregate the nine DT budgets before presentation to the TCC; (d) operate
the revolving fund (para 5.05) for the nine DTs; and (e) submit progress
reports on a semi-annual basis and summarized project accounts on an annual
basis to the Bank.
5.05      In order to eliminate the problem of limited operating budgets for
SARH in the early months of the year due to delayed appropriations (para 2.07)
the Mexican authorities have streamlined the operations of the existing
general SARH revolving fund, administered by SARH's "Oficial Major"). The
fund would finance project operations wherever necessary during the first part
of the fiscal year and be replenished by budget appropriations to the respec-
tive agencies that have drawn upon the fund for operating expenditures. To
ensure more flexible operation of the revolving fund, SPP has given SARH



- 24 -
co-responsibility status from January 1, 1981.  Instead of having to approve
expenditures for some 80 SARH accounts as at present, SPP will need only to
approve expenditures for six accounts.
5.06       District Level.  The nine participating DTs would be operated and
managed essentiall y as described in paragraphs 2.03 and 2.04, under the
organizational set-up outlined in Annex 2, Charts 2 and 3. Because of the
importance of effective extension and extension/research coordination to
successful project implementation, key extension staff should be located in
each DT before project implem.entation. Details are given in paragraph 5.08.
Additional arrangemnents would also be provided under the pr oJect to improve
coordination between the SARH technical staff and the various agricult ural
credit institutions (particularly BANRURAL) operating in the nine DTs. A
Credit Coordinating Committee has been set up in each DT. The committee
membership comprises local representatives of BANRURAL and FIRA and a repre-
sentative of the p,rivate banks operating in the district. DT staff includes
the District Chief as chairman, the chief of operations, arid representatives
from each unit office in the DT.  The main functions of the credit commlittee
are: (a) draw up a program for regular visits by field credit officers to
those units and zones where credit coverage is presently inadequate; (b)
ensure that each loan to be financed under the project has the approval of
both the credit institutions and SARH technical assistance staff; (c) organize
training for field unit and zone extension staff in the use of credit and farm
evaluation methods; and (d) organize orientation programs for producers on the
use of farm credit.
Program Execution
5.07       Extension.  The DT organization offers a sound framework for a
comprehensive and effective extension service, and the fact: is recognized by
DGPEA, which has cooperated fully with DGDUT in allocating field staff to the
DTs. Although extension quality and coverage under the DT umbrella are
generally better than before the DTs were formed, mainly because technicians
are allocated to s5:ecific geographical areas and are in the process of moving
to live in them, there is still room for improvement, especially in the
training and organization aspects. Provision would be made to draw on the
experience of succassful extension projects financed by the Bank in other
countries by provi,ling funds for: (a) in-country training courses by DGPEA
on the training and visit methodology, assisted by consultant(s) experienced
in this methodology; and (b) visits by M4exican technicians to other
countries.
5.08       To guaraatee that field extension staff receive sufficient support
from the DT administration, an extension coordinator has been assigned to
each of the nine DIs, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, to
assist the Chief of Operations.  Also, subject matter specialists have been
assigned to the appropriate offices in the DT to ensure that field extension
staff have adequate technical support for the main production activi-ties of
each DT as agreed between DGDUT and the Bank.



- 25 -
5.09      Research.  The mobile field research teams responsible for farming
systems production research in the project districts would be administered
from the appropriate INIA, INIP or INIF regional center in whose areas of
influence the district is located, with appropriate national coordination
from each Institutes' headquarters. The individual research staff in these
multidisciplinary teams would belong to the department at the research center
appropriate to that officer's research discipline. The composition of the
teams would be determined by the needs of each district and the teams or
individual members of each team may be assigned to work in more than one
district, within the area of influence of the research center, depending
upon work load. It is expected that this would apply more often to INIP
or INIF teams because the research findings for animal and forestry produc-
tion are generally much less area specific than those for crop production.
In addition to the production-oriented research carried out by field research
teams, supporting research specific to the needs of individual DTs would
be undertaken at the regional centers and at headquarters for some Insti-
tutes. This research would be assigned to staff in the appropriate depart-
ment(s) at the regional centers and headquarters, depending on the nature of
the research problem. The heads of departments and commodity program coordi-
nators would be responsible for the DT support programs as part of their
normal activities.
5.10      The research programs of INIA, INIP and INIF would be drawn up
usually by the field research teams, after consultation with the district
technical staff (principally the district subject matter specialists and
unit extension chiefs), and reviewed and approved by the normal procedures
followed by each Institute. These district-level and Institute-approved
programs would be reviewed by the DT Technical Committee and approved by
the DT Executive Committee as part of the yearly program and budget process.
Once these programs and corresponding budgets had been approved through
this channel, each research institute would have full authority for imple-
mentation of its own program and budget. The DT organizaional structure
provides a sound basis for the rapid transfer of research findings via
the DT extension service to the producer. It also is designed to permit
the research worker to be informed quickly of technical field production
problems, the solution of which may require study by either the mobile
field research teams or by specialized researchers at the regional centers
or headquarters. These would be achieved in two ways: (a) through the
formal channels provided by the monthly meetings of the DT Technical and
Executive Committees; and (b) through informal contacts between the re-
search teams and the DT extension and other technical staff and producers.
The leaders of the mobile research teams would maintain close contact with
the DT subject matter specialists and jointly would organize visits by
field extension staff and farmers to the farm-level experimental sites.
Research staff from these mobile teams would also visit the farm demon-
stration plots established by field extension staff on farmer's fields.
Such visits would be made on a formal basis to support the extension
staff at organized field days or informally to discuss new technology
with small extension worker/farmer groups.



26 -
Jo11      At the national level, the TCC (para 5.03) would be responsible
for approving annual programs and budgets presented by the three research
institutes relating to research activities financed under the project
which are not related directly to the development in the nine DTs. In
addition to being responsible for the preparation of its own national
program, each research institute would be responsible for program execution.
To further improve rainfed research services, the three Research Institutes,
the Chapingo Graduate University and the Tropical College of Agriculture
are finalizing the establishment of an informal Research Coordination
Commission. The establishment would be important as it would bring about
much needed closer cooperation between the Institutes which could lead
to the formation of interdisciplinary interinstitutional field research
teams, achieving common objectives and the establishment of more uniform
operating/staff procedures for all Institutes.
5.12      Soil and Water Conservation.  Field staff of the DGCSA attached
to each DT would be responsible for formulating yearly programs. In
the early years of the project, they would be assisted by short-term con-
sultants who would also train district DGCSA staff in production-oriented
soil and water conservation techniques. Because of the strong production
bias of this program, DGCSA staff would cooperate closely with district
extension staff field level research teams and the district forestry
officers in selecting appropriate farm sites on which to carry out their
programs and in organizing field days and demonstration visits for unit
and zone extension officers and farmers. After these programs were
reviewed and approved by the DT Technical Committee and the Executive
Committee, they would be included as part of the annual DT budget
application.
5.13      Roads.  'he District Chief would coordinate the activities
of the local SAHOP staff, the SIH district representative and the DT
Chief of Operations in the preliminary selection of sub-projects for
inclusion in the diLstrict program and to determine the DT's requirements
for maintenance of roads constructed under the project. Once the pro-
posed works have been evaluated (para 4.18) and agreement between SAHOP,
the District Chief and SIH district representative reached on priorities,
final selection would be made by the District Executive Committee.
Agreement on whether SIH or SAHOP would carry out the works would also be
reached. In either case, the road works would conform to SAHOP standards
regarding evaluation, design, tendering, supervision of construction and
maintenance and be approved by the local SAHOP office.
5.14      Credit.  Assuming that all project farmers receiving credit would
participate with a minimum of between 5% and 10% of their own re-
sources, it is expected that incremental credit demand over the five-year
period would reach US$262 million, of which US$175 million would be medium and
long term and US$87 million would be short term. Private banks and BANRURAL
would provide cred:it in PLANAT districts. It is expected, however, that
participation by private banks would be considerably less than that of BANRIJRAL,
as BANRURAL has more branches in the project area than the private banks do,
and most beneficiary farmers are too costly to serve, at least initially, to



- 27 -
be of interest to private banks. Although private banks may have a more
important future role to play as the area develops, their participation in
project lending is not expected to exceed 10% of total lending over the
project period. Private bank loans to project farmers (about 20% of on-farm
lending under the project) would be discountable through the FIRA system, and
the Bank loan would reimburse FIRA for these discounted loans in the same way
as is presently done under the Agricultural Credit project (1891-ME).
Private bank short- and medium-term loans to project farmers (about 20% of
the on-farm lending under the project) would be discountable through the
FIRA system. The Bank loan would reimburse FIRA for the medium-term dis-
counted loans in the same way as is presently done under the Agricultural
Credit Project (1891-ME). Reimbursement of short-term funds to FIRA by the
Bank would be based only on those funds which are incremental to the previous
year's total for short-term credit disbursement by the private banks oper-
ating through FIRA in each of the nine project DT's. The short-term interest
rates under PLANAT would range from 15.5% for groups of farmers to 19% for
individual farmers.
5.15      In view of the major role of BANRURAL as a vehicle for providing
credit in the project area and the magnitude of additional resources required
for project subloans, the Bank loan would reimburse BANRURAL for part of its
short-, medium- and long-term loan disbursements to project farmers.  Credit
through BANRURAL would be channeled through FICAR, a trust fund which was
created some 10 years ago to operate primarily in irrigated areas and which
has a good record of sound banking operations. Following Government policy
not to create new trust funds, FICAR is to be renamed FICART to reflect the
fund's new dual function to service credit in both irrigated and rainfed
districts. Such trust funds are used widely by official financial institutions
in Mexico to support credit for specific activities and the most important of
these constitute the FIRA system used by the Bank in a number of projects.
The advantages of this arrangement to the donor include separate accounting
and easy monitoring. The advantages to the Government include a separation
of foreign lenders from the banking system, as well as separate accounting.
FICART would function separately from BANRURAL's general operations and would
be responsible to BANRURAL's Sub-Director General of Trust Funds, and its
own board of directors. Under the project, FICAT would provide advances to
BANRURAL equal to 100% of project subloans. FICAT would receive project funds
at no cost and on-lend them to BANRURAL at its going rates of interest, which
are 9% on short-term and 8% on long-term lending. FICAT would review each
subloan to ensure its compliance with project requirements. An agreement
acceptable to the Bank has been worked out between DGDUT and BANRURAL on the
cooperation between the latter's branch banks and FICAT offices in the project
area and the related DT offices. Furthermore, assurances were obtained that:
(a) BANRURAL's interest rates for medium- and long-term credit under PLANAT
would be the same as those applicable under Bank financed programs with FIRA;
and (b) BANRURAL's short-term interest rates would be the same as for the
private banks operating through FIRA (para 5.14). At negotiations, Government
agreed to adjust short-term rates not less than every twelve months.

This would p-rovide stronger technical quality control over leading programc,
ens-ure that :Loans under the project are for financially and technically viable
purposes, and remove political, or social subsidy, considerations from project
lending.  Moreover., Bank funding of 1loans made by BANRIURA  would be through a

Mon4tori_and Evaluation
5.17       DGDUDl through its PLANAT office would be respons.ible for monitoring
and evalu.ation of- the activities in the nine project districts arnd of the
national support activities financed under the project.  For these purposes,
the PLANAT project office have set up a special monitoring and evaluation
group,  Governzment has agreed that activities of this group will be based upoo
tne proposals made in a background paper prepared by a Bank consul.tant during
appraisal (Annex 3'  para. 49).  In collaboration with the participating
agencies, t:his gro-iup would establish and manage an information systema for:
(a) reportilng physical proeress of project activities; tb) evaluating t he
impact of these activi ties on an o-ngoing basis; and (c) idientifying short-
comtings in perfornance in a timely manner0  Since the central ob,ective of the
PLASNAT program is to increase production under rainfed conditions, major rol
would be olaced on measuring changes in crop/livestock output under t'he
project and to relate these changes to the various comporne-ats that would
compri.se the assistance packages to farmers.  In this regard, the mt. ares
would be to monitcr and evaluate:  (a) the DT extension activities:  (b) thV.e
eff.ectiveness of the research activities, particularly with respect to tttscr
reievance in solving the districts' production problems and the decree of
integration between district researcn and extension activities; (e) the 1mpa_ct
or the production-oriented soil and water co-nservation to be promoteT. :nde-

- 29 -
the district level. When shortcomings in project performance are detected,
the planning and evaluation staff would identify them for management and
recommend program modifications in order to facilitate prompt adjustment in
project implementation.
5.18      The PLANAT monitoring and evaluation group would be structured at
three levels. At DT level, evaluation would be the responsibility of the
Planning Office, which would have to be strengthened and provided with the
necessary human and material resources, including facilities for decentralized
data processing. At PLANAT's head office, a small group of technical special-
ists reporting to the management would be set up to carry out aggregate
analyses and to back up DT evaluation officers in specific fields such as
sample design, survey format, statistical analysis, data processing and
software, and analytical methods. The group would also identify areas which
warrant further study as constraints or unexpected positive effects which may
arise in the course of project progress. These in-depth studies would be
contracted outside, thus providing the third level of the evaluation process.
5.19      The semi-annual reports to the Bank (para 5.04) would include the
findings and recommendations of the monitoring and evaluation unit. In addition,
the Bank would receive a copy of the unit's annual report to DGDUT management
in which it outlined its accomplishments in relation to its tasks for the year.
This would be forwarded to the Bank within three months of the close of each
fiscal year. In addition, each of the three research institutes would submit
annual technical reports of project-related activities and results as well as
the proposed programs for the following year. Assurances were obtained that
reporting would be as specified here and in paragraph 5.04.
5.20      The PLANAT office would also prepare a completion report which
would include, in addition to physical achievements, an evaluation of project
impact. The scope and format of this report would be agreed mutually between
the Government and the Bank. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that
PLANAT would prepare a completion report along guidelines which the Bank may
reasonably recommend and submit it to the Bank and to the Government within
six months after the closing date of the project.

VI., PRODUCTION  MAKETIN   AND FARMER BENEFITS
Agricultural Production
6.01      Six development plans have been drawn up to illustrate the range
of the main crop/livestock activities in each district and the relative
importance of each activity.  They are based on the average farm size obtained
from surveys by DT field staff and are summarized in Table 6.01. They
form  the basis for the provision of loans.  Although the invJestment size of
individual loans would vary according to type of borrower and the principal
production activities most suitable to the particular farm, the average loan
size per district is expected to be as indicated in the plans. If the effort
is effective and development plans are being adopted at the expected rate, the
impact on crop and livestock production would be as described below.
6.02      Cultivated area in annual and perennial crops would increase from
about 138,000 ha to 183,000 ha by bringing non-used lands into production and
through more intensive use of presently cultivated lands, particularly where
supplementary irrigation is available. As a result of this change and the
increases in productivity expected under the project, the net value of crop
production would increase gradually over the development period Lrom about
US$40 million to US$106 million per annum. Details of the cropping patterns
are showrn in Annex 2, Tables 97 through 137.  Most of the increase in cropped
area would be under cacao, coconut, and citrus in the humid tropical districts
while areas of annual food crops (maize, beans, soybeans, chickpeas and
cereals) would be increased by over 40% in the mountain and plateau districts,
with smaller increases in fruits, vegetables and alfalfa.
6.03      Crop yield increases are generally expected to play an even more
significant role as new technical packages are developed by the districts'
applied research programs and proven by the extension teams. Hence, in drawing
up the investment plans, estimates of yield increases have been conservatively
based on those currently being obtained on the more productive farms and
ejidos in each district. Thus the total yield increases projected by full
development for maize, the principal food crop, vary from about 25% for
participating farmers in the better maize growing areas in Zapopan, Morelia,
Cholula and Chilpancingo up to 65 and 80% for the less developed areas in
Jalpa and the Gulf Coast districts. In the case of the perennial crops,
cacao, coconut and citrus, yields from plantings to be rehabilitated in the
Gulf Coast districts are expected to double. It can be expected that under
the project many farmers would achieve yields higher than those given in the
investment plans when the full impact of improved technical packages emanating
from the districts' production-oriented research programs is felt and banking
and extension services have been improved.
6.04      Under the project, livestock development is cons:idered an integral
part of on-farm investment planning. In all of the humid tropical districts
and in Chilpancingo and Jalpa, most farmers have relatively large areas of

1/ In Cholula, Morelia and Zapopan intensive pig and dairy activities would be financed
for village groups on the basis of ten participants. Investment plans for a 45 cow dairy
unit and a 25 sow pig unit have been drawn up. A total of 100 of each plan would be
financed in the three districts.
2/ Livestock development in Jalpa and Chilpancingo has been based on a plan for a 100 ha
group farm and prorated to the average individual size holding in the two districts.                                                                                                                 a



- 32 -
pasture land unsuitable for cropping which are presently underutilized and
poorly managed.  l'here is sufficient local experience to show that beef and
milk production fron these lands can be increased substantially by better
management coupled with pasture improvement, fencing and provision of stock
handling and waterirg facilities.  Thus, in the humid tropical districts,
carrying capacity wciL d be increased from the present value of about 1 animal
unit/ha to 2 antlnMal umniis/ha.  The average time to produce a 400-kg steer
would decrease from ovEr 3-1/2 years to about 2-1/2 years and the average
weaning rate would'. i-ncrea3e fro3r about 50 to 75%.  In the Chilpancingo
and Jalpa districts, dual-purpose beef and milk production would also be
increased significantly: lands which are presently carrying only 1 animal
uit per 3 or 4 ha would have a carrying capacity of 1.5 animal units/ha
at full development, with corresponding increases in the output of milk and
live animals.
6.05      In addition to these pasture-based beef/milk investments, it is
expected that there would also be a number of farmers or farmer groups who
would invest in intensive apg and dairy operations, particularly in the more
densely populated parts of the Cholula, Morelia and Zapopan districts close to
markets and where supplies of concentrate feeds are easily available.  Invest-
ment plans for 25 breeding sOws and for 45 holstein cows are shown in Annex 2,
Tables 131 through 137, and are based on the experience obtained by BANRURAL,
FIRA and the private banks.
6.06      At full development, incremental production of the basic crops
and feed grains (maize, beans, wheat, rice, chickpea, soybeans and sorghum)
would be about 180,COO m tons annually; cacao, coconut and coffee, about 14,000
m tons; banana and citrus, about 190,000 m tons; alfalfa (green), 124,000
m tons; fruits and vegetables, 50,000 m tons; beef and pork, 17,000 m tons; and
milk, 62 million liters. Full details of area, crop and year of development
are shown in Ann-ex 2 Tables 97 through 137.
Marketin    dtoe
6.07      The increased production of the export crop, cacao, can be easily
handled by the existing facilities, and market prospects are good. The
increased output of the food crops, feed grains and oil crops would be marketed
locally and would offset the growing import of these commodities.  In some
cases, local storage problems could occur but these would be dealt with as they
arise tmder the project. The small incremental production of frulits and
vegetables is not expected to present any problems since most would be sold
fresh in local markets. It is expected that most of the milk produced under
the project would be consumed fresh locally although in the humid tropics a
part would be so'Ld for prccessing into condensed and powdered milk. No
problems are envisaged for sale or storage of the meat that would be produced
under the projectX
Farmer Benefits
6.08      Tle project would offer extension packages supported by credit to
about 37,000 additional farm families in the nine participating DTs.  About
80% of these farm families would be 'Low to medium income fanners with annual



- 33 -
family incomes of less than US$1,500. The table below shows, for each
investment plan, the without and with project income per family, the percentage
rate of increases and the financial return on investments made. Although in
practice the investment mix may be different in individual cases, it is
expected that the figures below give a fair picture of the farmers' benefits
to be gained.

6.09      However, claiming benefits only for the 37,000 new recipients of
credit is conservative because some 50,000 farmers out of the estimated total
of 275,000 farmers in the project districts are currently using credit regu-
larly and those who would not receive any significant amount of additional
credit would, nevertheless, benefit from improved extension services. Also,
many of those who neither receive credit now nor would do so under the project
are expected to adopt many technical features of the packages being promoted
by the extension services. These farmers, estimated at 70,000, would use
their own resources in lieu of credit.
6.10      The rural roads proposed under the project would also be of sig-
nificant benefit to some 80,000 farm families located within their area of
influence. In most instances, farmers would, for the first time, have ready
and assured access to markets, losses due to transport spoilage would be
reduced and it would be possible to guarantee a regular supply of farm
inputs. These roads would also have social benefits to all families in
their areas of influence, particularly with respect to health, education
and social welfare.

VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
General
7.0l      The proposed project would build on the Governments' efforts over
the recent past to attack the problems of rainfed agriculture in a systematic
way. The project would strengthen the staff, equipment, training and physical
infrastructure of project agencies thus contributing to institution building.
It would also promote organizational improvements, such as the reorientation
of extension work l:oward the training and visit system, and considerable
expansion of applied research and field trials, which would - apart from
helping extension work directly -- also facilitate the flow; of information
about production problems to the Research Institutes for attention. The
project is consistent with both the Bank's and the Government's long-term
strategies toward agriculture in Mexico.
Economic Rate of Return
7.02      The project's economic rate of return is estimated at 21% (Annex 2,
Table 140) calculat:ed on the basis of the benefits derived from the invest-
ment plans adopted and carried out by some 37,000 families which will partici-
pate in the credit program as well as 55,000 additional families benefiting
from the technical assistance components of the project. The calculations
are based on the following assumptions: (a) the evolution of cropped areas
and crop and livest:ock productivity were as described in the investment plans;
(b) output prices J-or traded commodities were calculated according to Bank's
projections and ad-justed for handling, processing and transport costs to reach
an average farmgate equivalent; cattle prices represent changes in the base
period in respect t:o the index of changes projected by the Commodities
Division, while for other products prevailing farmgate prices were used
(Annex 2, Tables 141 and 142), production costs, except for unskilled labor
were priced at local market conditions on the grounds that they best reflect
their respective opportunity cost given their market structure and the current
Government policies; (c) 25% of the project costs at national level were
considered to be relevant to the nine participating DTs; the inclusion of all
costs at district :Level with the exception of roads for which 50% of the
costs are directly related to production programs supported under the project
in these districts:; and (d) with the exception of Villahermosa and Cardenas
districts, the opportunity cost of family labor was estimated to be 50%
of the equivalent maarket wage for unskilled labor on the grounds that there is
considerable family surplus at the farm level with very limited possibilities
for off-farm work. In the case of Villahermosa and Cardenas, the family wage
rate was consideredl equal to the market wage level because of the high possi-
bilities in the labor market due to the oil activities in the area. The
unskilled wage rate was estimated accordingly.

Sensitivity Analysis
7.03      The economic rate of return varies in the range of 19% to 18%
with assumptions of: (a) 10% and 20% cost overruns of components; and (b)
decrease in the benefits by 10% to 20%. The main factors that could delay
project benefits are adverse weather and less than anticipated organizational
efficiencies (para 7.04). These factors would not influence any specific
parameters in isolation such as individual crop yields, meat or milk output or
area cultivated but would have a general impact on all crop and livestock
benefits. Thus a switching value test on the assumption of delays in reaching
full development was performed. This test indicates that a delay of about
2-1/2 years would make the IRR equal to the opportunity cost of capital,
assuming that costs outlays would occur as planned (Annex 2, Table 143).
Project Risks
7.04      The main risks associated with the project would be (a) institutional
and (b) climatic. Regarding institutional aspects, the major problem would be
to ensure effective coordination between the various line agencies involved in
project execution. In this context the development of a strong decisive
district organizational structure would be a vital element. The most serious
climatic risk would be drought, particularly in the plateau and mountain
districts in areas where supplementary irrigation is not generally available.
However, under the project it is expected that this risk would be reduced by
adopting better conservation and farming practices.
Environmental Impact
7.05      The project is not expected to have harmful effects on the environ-
ment. On the contrary, the soil and water conservation and forestry programs,
although small relative to total need, would be of great importance in
demonstrating conservation practices, which, if proven, could be adopted more
widely and have a major role in the reduction of soil erosion, one of the main
long-term problems in Mexico's countryside. Although the use of agro-chemicals
would increase under the project, use would be limited to those with low
toxicity, and extension officers would stress safety and avoidance of excessive
applications.
VIII.  SUMMARY OF MAIN AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECONENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that:
(a)  Government would assure that funds for provision of credit
would at all times be sufficient to cover demand (para 4.25);



- 36 -
(b) participating agencies would keep separate accounts for the
project, and the Government through PLANAT would annually
furnish the Bank a summary statement of such accounts, together
with such other pertinent information concerning the accounts
as the Bank shall reasonably request from time to time (para
4.32); and
(c) interest rates for short- and long-term credit would be as
outlined in paragraph 5.15 or the Government would fully fund
BANRURAL for the provision of credit under PLANAT.
8.02      With the above assurance and conditions, the project would be
suitable for a Bank loan of US$280 million for a term of 15 years, including
three years of grace, at an interest rate of 9.25%.

A. BANRURAL Key Financial Indicators
1.        Five years of financial data are available for BANRURAL, covering
the period between its formation and the close of its financial year ending
December 31, 1979. These data are presented in balance sheet and income state-
ment form in Tables 1 and 2, while a summary review of BANRURAL financial
performance is provided below. All data are in millions of pesos except where
otherwise noted. The 1979 figures are preliminary and appear to reflect
certain discontinuities. Confirmation of significantly different operating
relationships in 1979 can be provided only by audited figures derived on a
basis consistent with accounting practices used in prior years. Figures in
brackets are negative.

B. Present Operating Procedures of the Trust Fund for
Credit in Irrigated Areas (FICAR)
2.        FICAR (Fideicomiso para Credito en Areas de Riego) is a Government
trust fund administered by BANRURAL. FICART, which is in the process of
establishment and is expected to be formed prior to Board presentation, would
extend FICAR functions to include rainfed areas.
3.        Trust funds are widely used in Mexico for funding specific programs,
having the advantages of separate accounting and specialized lending. Since
1976 FICAR has received more than US$90 million under three loans for
agriculture from the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB).
4.        FICAR advances funds to BANRURAL against subloans made under specific
projects. Advances cover 100% of qualifying subloans, which have been redis-
counted for BANRURAL at 8% while carrying a 13.5% rate to the subborrower. IDB
funds have been passed on to FICAR at a zero interest rate by the Government,
and the 8% spread has enabled FICAR to cover its costs and make modest addi-
tions to its reserves. In 1979 the volume of advances made by FICAR amounted
to Mex$3,750 million (US$163.0 million). Summary unaudited figures for
February 1980 indicated that outstanding advances against medium- and long-term
loans were Mex$4,933 million, out of total assets of Mex$5,852 million.
Amounts in arrears due FICAR stood at Mex$545 million.
5.        FICAR has its own administration, which is responsible to the BANRURAL
Subdirector General of Trust Funds and to a Technical Committee which is in
effect FICAR's board of directors. The Technical Committee is composed of
representatives of the Treasury (as chairman), NAFINSA, SARH, Agrarian Reform
and BANRURAL. BANRURAL's representative is the Operations Manager for Trusts.
6.        FICAR has a staff of 400, 40% in Mexico City and 60% at the offices
of BANRURAL's 12 regional subsidiaries. Field staff are organized into
12 residencias, and several of these are assisted by subresidencies. At
the field level FICAR coverage is equivalent to one technician per district.
The field staff develops lending budgets and operating plans for FICAR activ-
ities relating to the 12 banks, based on analyses by BANRURAL staff.
7.        Each  regional bank proposes a lending plan, which is modified, where
necessary, and incorporated into a loan agreement between the regional bank
and FICAR. Funds are advanced under each loan agreement as banks generate loans
which qualify for rediscounting. Each of these loans is analyzed by FICAR.
Loans of less than Mex$2 million are approved at the residencia level. Loans
of between Mex$2 and Mex$5 million are approved by regional credit committees.
Loans of between Mex$5 to Mex$7 million are approved by the FICAR Credit Sub-
committee, which is chaired by the BANRURAL Operations Manager for Trusts and
includes FICAR officers: the Assistant Manager for Credit, the Assistant
Manager for Finance, the Legal Advisor, the Head of the Credit Department, and
the Head of the relevant technical department. Loans in excess of Mex$7
million are reviewed by the FICAR Credit Committee, which is a branch of the



40 -
AgNNEX I
Technical Com- ittee, and then approved or otherwise disposed of by the
Technical Committee. This approval procedure is entirely separate frovn that
of BANRURAL.
8         n hANRLThAL 'Loans which are approved for rediscounting are summar ized.
every 10 days or so for submissi.on to FICARO  Advances are then made ,   F.i'R.
by transf ers to BAN RUPAL accounts with the Central Bank.  Subborrowers
repayments received by regional banks are remitted immediately to FICAR.
Maturity schedules for re(liscounts are the same as for the underlying loans  co
farmers.  When a subloan installment goes into arrears, the regional bank Jis
still required to remnit the amount due to FICAR.  Records are completed within
six weeks or so foilowing each transaction involving FICAR funds.
9.        FICAR's accounting system is independent of BANRURAL's and generates
disbursement requests on computers operated by the Financial Programming
Department.  Requests submitted to IDB consist of a summary and three annexesF
The first shows each project subloan, giving the amounts authorized, disbursed
for the period, and cumulative disbursements. The second gives the data
classified by regional bank, branch and municipio and shows the total number
of beneficiaries.  The third is organized according to loan puruose.
104       FICAR maintains 4,500 subloan accounts cover4ng approximateli' 332,OCC
households consisting of members of ejidos or other credit groups.
11.       FICAR's assets consist almost entirely of advances made against
BANRURAL loans to farmers and others in the agricultural sector. Its primar-y
sources of funding are capital subscriptions by the Federal. Government and
by the Interamerican. Development Bank (IDB). IDB subscriptions are made
under the terms of credit project loan agreements. FICAR's operatlons are
supported to only a limited extent by debt, as reflected in a capitalto-
assets ratio of alniost 90% in 1978 and of more than 99% ln February 1980.
The debt which it does use is from BANRURAL, covering short-term liquidity
requirements arising from its lending to BANRURAL.
12.       FICAR accounts are audited internally by the Auditing Department
for the Trust Operctions of BANRURAL and by BANRURAL's external auditors.
Income statements for FICAR are shown in Table 3 and balance sheets in
Table 4.
