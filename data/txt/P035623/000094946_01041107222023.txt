3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3. 1 Original Ojbective.
The objective of the project was to help Chad increase its capacity for economilic managemeit. In the
short-term. the project was expected to assist the Governmeit prepare and implement a reform program to
be supported by a series of single-tranche adjustmenit credits. The project was designed to support
objectives, which were part of Cliad's medium- to long-term economic management strategy, including (i)
rebuilding the administrationi around a civil service of modest size with a clear focus on core public sector
functionis, and in which transparenit and criteria-based recruitmenit, career planniniig, training and career
management would be targeted; (ii) restoring the Government's capacity to provide essential public goods
and services, improve its public finanice maniagemenit; (iii) improving the quality and efficiency of public
expenditures; and (iv) implementing the Government's divestiture program.
The project was a follow up to the Economic and Finanicial Managemiienit Project (GEF) approved in 1988
and restructured in 1994. The GEF project helped the Chadiani Govermiienit define and implement its
reconstruction program after years of civil war. It was restructured to focus assistance on three critical
areas for the implementationi of the reforn program adopted by the Governmenit in support of the
devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994. These areas were revenue collection, expenditure coiitrol
and economic policy design and implementation. The implementationi completion report (ICR) for the GEF
project, whichi was issued in May 1997, coiicluded that the outcome was satisfactory, but the sustainability
of the project was uncertain. The achievemenit of objectives was rated substantial for macro policies,
institutionial development, physical objectives, public sector managemenit and private sector development.
The objective of the Capacity Building Project for Economic Managemlienlt was clear, realistic and essential
for the success of the Governmenit's reform program. It was fully consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), which was discussed with the Board in February 1996. The CAS' objectives were to help
the Governmenit (i) restore critical public sector capacity; (ii) focus public expenditures on poverty
reduction; (iii) create an environimenit favorable for private sector development; and (iv) protect the
environment. The Capacity Building Project for Economiiic Managemenit was a critical instrUment for
achieving the first three objectives.
The project was basically a contilLuationi of activities initiated in 1994 ulider the GEF project. It was
designed taking into account the lessons from experience in implementing its predecessor. The main lesson
learned was that the GEF project was intended to increase capacity, yet failed to recognize the extremely
low implementationi capacity of the Governmeit. Project restructurinig in 1994 focused on a limited set of
activities aimed at achieving concrete results rapidly. Implementation improved considerably after project
restructuring. The new project was also focused on key priority areas where performance indicators were
clearly identifiable.
3.2 Revised Ohbective:
The objective of the project was not revised
3.3 Original Components:
The project included five inter-r-elated components in the areas of revenue collection, rationalizatioln of
expenditures, economic policy formulation, completion of the divestiture program, and civil service reform.
The project would finanice consultilng services, traininig, equipmenlt and office facilities for a numiiber of
government agencies, Hicluding the three Directorates in the Ministrv of Fiianice responsible for revenue
collection (Customs, Income tax and Property tax), the two Directorates in the Ministries of Finance and
Planning responsible for preparing and monitoring the budget (Directorate of Budget and Debt and
- 2 -



Directorate of Programming and External Debt), the Coordinatling Unit for the Adjustmenit Program and
the Directorates of Economic Planinlilg and Statistics in the Miniistry of Planniniig responsible for economic
policy formulation, the Privatization Secretariat for the divestiture program. and the M\1inistry of Civil
Service for civil service reform. All these agencies, with the exception of the latter, halc been involved in
the implementationi of tihe GEF project. During the 1996-98 period, the project was expected to finanice
about 120 person months of consulting services, a training program for 700 trainees, and logistical support.
Performance indicators were established for each project component.
Project implementationi was to be coordinated by the coordinating ulnit for the adjustment program, whicl
was established at the time of thle restructuring of the GEF project. The unit was also in charge of the
implementation of the componenits related to tlhe Ministries of Finance and Planniniig. T he Coordinatilig
Unit was responsible for the turn-around in project performance under the GEF project and had
demonstrated its capacity to implement well-focused programs.
3.4 Revised Components.
The project was not restructured. Additional activites were added durilig project implementationi to help
establish four new institutions, namilely, the oil managemiielnt ulnit, the cotton reforml unit, the techni1ical
committee for civil service reforn and tihe capacity buildinlg unlit. Support to these units was in line with
the original project objectives. It contributed, hoowever, to 11)A finanicilg a higher tlhan anticipated amounlt
of operating costs.
3.5 Quality tit Entry:
The quality at entry of the project is rated highly satisfactory. The project was a key element of the 1996
CAS. It was fully in line witlh government priorities. It built UpOIn the successful experience of the GEF
project following its restructuring in 1994. The Bank's safeguard policies were adhered to. Indicators
were defined to measure performance under the project. The major risk envisaged was the difficulties
associated with a strategy for chanige in public sector management in a fragile political situation. To
mitigate this risk, extensive consultations were held with parliamentarians, representatives of the private
sector, non-governmental organizations and union leaders during project preparation.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.] Outcomne/achievement of objective.-
The project had been designed to help Chad implement its reform program. The Bank also provided
support to the reform program througlh tlhree single-tranichie adjustment credits. The ICR for the three
adjustment credits, issued in March 2000, rated their outcome as satisfactory. The expected outcomes of
the reform program have been largely achieved. The projecl has contributed to increasing Chad's capacity
for economic management, as evidenced by the solid progress made under the reformi program. This
capacity is still weak, however. Weaknesses are found in most institutionis, reflecting the impact of almost
three decades of civil strife. The capacity of the public sectcr contilnues to be serious y constrained by lack
of qualified staff and adequate resources, and by an inadequate incentive system. Th- development of
capacity for economic management is a long process, and the project made a significanlt contribution to it.
Performance indicators are presented in Annex 1. Achieveiienlt of the objective is raled satisfactory.
4.2 Ouitputs by componenis.
Revenue mobilizationi. The revenue mobilizationi componenit was expected to help the Governmiiienit achieve
its objective of doubling its revenues in real terms during the project period (from 7.4 percent of GDP in
1994 to 11.5 percent of GDP in 1 998). With support from the project. Chad has macie considerable efforts
to increase fiscal revenues from a particularly low base. National accounts were revised durinig project
implementation, resulting in an increase in the estimated value of Gross Domestic Product over the period.
- 3 -



The ratio of revenue to GDP increased from 4.9 percent In 1994 to 7.6 percent In 1998, a 86 percent
increase in real terms, a commendable performance.
Increasling public revenues has been the single most important objective of the Govermilenit over the past
years. Implementation of this objective has targeted a narrow formal sector In a disproportionate way.
however. Further increasinig revenues from this narrow and fragile fiscal base would be counterproductive.
The Governmenit is fully aware of this constraint and has initiated with project support an effort to tax
smaller companies, i.e. those with an annual turnover less than CFAF40 million (about US$53,000). Tax
loopholes have been eliminated throughi the phase-out of special enterprise regilimes. Enihaniced revenue
mobilization and tight control over public expenditures have moved the budget from a currenit deficit of 5
percent of GDP in 1994 to positive balances in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, a small deficit was recorded (0.1
percent of GDP).
The revenue mobilization componenit of the project is rated satisfactory.
Rationalization of public expenditures. This componenit aimed at increasling allocations to priority sectors,
improving debt reporting, and strengtheninig the preparation and implementationi of the Public Investmenit
Program (PIP). The PIP process was to be rationalized by reducing the number of projects, identifying and
moving currenit expenditures into the current budget, making the PIP less donor driven, and improving the
efficiency of the PIP in supportinig the development impact and poverty reductioll objectives of the
Government program.
Budget preparation and implemenitationi have improved even thoughi serious shortcominiigs persist. Non
wage allocations to the priority sectors (education, healthi, social affairs and transport) have increased
aninually by more thani 20 percent in real terms from 1996 to 1998. This ias beeni made possible by a
reduction of the share of defense in currenit expenditures from about 19 percent in 1994 to 13 percent in
1998. The social sectors were the only ones allowed to hire additional personnel. The share of priority
sectors in total expenditures increased from 48 percent in 1994 to 62 percent in 1998, as envisaged ulider
the reform program. Outcomes in the social sectors improved substanitially. Gross primary enrollmelit
increased from 37 percent In 1994 to 50 percent in 1998 for girls and from 62 percent to 84 percent for
boys. Infanit and child mortalily decreased from 13 percent and 22 percent in 1993 to 10 percent and 19
percent in 1997, respectively.
Debt reporting and management has improved. The arrears on external debt were cleared in 1995 and the
arrears on the internal debt have been steadily reduced. There is no longer any accumulation of arrears,
includinig to civil servants. The wage bill is now paid regularly.
The investmenit budget has improved. The Governmeit has carried out aninual reviews of the PIP witil the
Bank to ensure consistenicy with its development and poverty reduction objectives. The investmenit budget
remains largely donor-driven, however, and continiues to include a large amount for recurrent spendilng,
financed by external assistance. The division of the budget between the currenlt budget, interinally-finianced,
and the investmenlt budget, mostly externally-financed, with the formier prepared by the Ministry of Finanice
and the latter prepared by the Ministry of Planiniiig, is an artificial one. It is an obstacle to a sound
managemenit of scarce public resources. The Governmeit is aware of the shortcominigs of its present
system and intends to consolidate the budget in 2001/2002.
The rationalizationi of public expenditures component is rated satisfactory.
Economic policy fonriulation. The project was expected to strengtileni the capacity of the coordinatilng Ullit
- 4 -



for the adjustment program, withi support from the Directorate of Statistics in the Ministry of Planniiing, to
monitor implementationi of the adjustmenit program and supervise the project portfolio through an improved
system of data collection. The project was also designed to improve the capacity of the Ministry of
Planning to disseminate economilc policies to the public and to publishi economic data onl a regular basis.
The coordinatinig unit has continlued to fulfill its leadership role in the implementationi of the adjustmenit
program. It served as secretariat for the high level Steering Committees established in June 1994 to
monitor implementation of the reform program. It maintained the momentum for reforims and ensured that
all agencies concerned were implementing their action plans. The collection of data has improved, but is
still inadequate for monitoring developmental and poverty indicators. The nationial accounts were revised
to eliminate the most serious inconsistenicies, but do not yet provide a coherent framework for economic
policy formulation. The Governmeit has made repeated efforts to (jisseminiate economic informationi to the
public. A number of seminars and workshops were held to sensitize development partners to the main
components of the reforn program.
The performance indicators for this component were timely implemnenltationi of the economic reform
program and improved availability of reliable data. Based on these indicators, the economic policy
fonnulation component is rated satisfactory.
Completion of the Government's divestiture program. This componenit targeted 12 public enterprises, for
restructurinig, privatization or liquidation, including the four largest ones, STEE, the water and electricity
company, ONPT, the post and telecommunications company, COTONTCHAD, the cotton processing and
marketing company and SONASUT, the sugar company.
During the 1996-98 period, the Government implemented its divestiture program with the privatization and
liquidation of 8 small and medium enterprises. The divestiture of the four largest enterprises was much
delayed, however. It started in earnest in 1998 with the recruitment of consultants and merchianit banks
financed by the project. SONASUT was privatized in April 2000, and STEE has been put under private
management since September 2000. ONPT, the post and telecommunications company, was split into
SOTELTCHAD, a telecommunicationis company and STPE, a postal company. Recently, the privatization
of SOTELTCHAD has been jeopardized since it entered into a joint venture with an interniationial company
and thereby effectively awarded its cellular license to a private operator. A far reaching cotton sector
reform strategy was approved by the Government in December 1999. A study on the separation of
COTONTCHAD's oil and soap division (DHS) is about to be completed and a decision on the privatization
of DHS is expected in the first quarter of 2001. A study on the possible scenarios for the privatization of
COTONTCHAD is about to be launched.
Despite the delays in the divestiture program, the divestiture componieit is rated satisfatctory. The project
provided valuable assistance in preparing for the privatization of all but two of the largest enterprises. The
work done by consultants was higihly appreciated by government officials.
Civil service reforn. The project was designed to help the Governmeit (i) redefine the role of the public
sector. reorganize existing entities and design an action plan for training in public administrationi
management; (ii) define the long- and short-term training needs of the refocused civil service; and (iii)
establish an infonnation system for personnel management and revamp the existing filinig system. The
performance indicator was a streamlined civil service, with a clear focus on core public sector functionis
and modernized and criteria-based personnel management.
In April 1997, the Government established a National Committee for civil service reform. Slhortly
- 5 -



afterwards, two committees were created, a steering committee comprised of core rministers and a technilcal
committee. In October 1997, the Head of State launchied a seminar to discuss the Ministerial Committee's
preliminary proposals along four themes: the institutionial and legal framework, the pay system, the
management of humani resources, and the role of women. In July 1998, three seminars were organized to
discuss a draft Public Administration Reforn Program, whicih was reviewed and adopted by the
Governmeit in December 1998. A set of basic principles was approved, sucih as recruitment of personiel
on the basis of competency and remunerationl linked to performance. The process of civil service reforiml is
uliderway, but moving slowly. In December 2000, the Governmenit issued a draft of the revised Civil
Service Statutes, introducilig a competitive recruitmenit procedure for civil servants as well as a merit-based
advancement system. The inforimiationi system, including the payroll and civil service files, has not
improved.
The civil service reforn component is rated ulisatisfactorv. Its objectives have not been achieved despite
good progress made In building up a consenisus on the basic principles of the reform. The civil service has
not been streamlined and personiel managemenit has not ilmproved.

4.5 Instituitional development iinpact:
TFhe project has improved the capacity to implement action plans for the major governmenit institutiolis
responsible for the economic reforn program. Before approval of the project, the capacity of governmeit
agencies was extremely limited. It was uLiderinilied by the inability of the Governmeit to pay its civil
servants on time. Arrears accumulated, with a highily negative impact on the morale of the staff. The
wage bill is nlow paid regularly, but tile purchasling power of wages has decliled in real terms. Despite
some improvements, most miniistries and public agencies are unable to fuLictioni smoothly because
allocations for noni-wage expenditures are negligible. The Govermiienlt's ability to make effective use of its
finanicial resources has considerably improved, but muchi remaiiis to be done to improve the delivery of
basic services to the population.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5. I Factors ouitside the contr ol of govc rnnient or implementinig agency:
A major factor for the successful inplemenltationl of the reforn program has been the smooth transitioni to
democratic rule. In March 1996 a new constitutionl was adopted by referendum. A Presidential election,
won by the incumbenit, took place in June 1996. Legislative elections were held in early 1996. The new
Cabinet appointed shortly thiereafter included members from opposition parties and had a broad manidate to
implemenit the reforn program. The fragility of Chad's political situationl was considered a major risk, in
view of the turbulent past of the coulitry. Recurrent armied rebellions remainied a source of major concer-ni,
and slowed down the reforn program at times, but this did not prevent the Goverinenit from moving ahead
with its economic and political agenda.
5.2 Faclors generalv .sub/ecl to government control:
The Government gave strong support to the coordinating unit for the adjustment program. The Steering
Committee for the adjustment program, chaired by the Head of State, met regularly to make decisions and
ensure a follow up. The Governmenit has been concerned all along with the need to build a consenisus for
reforms. This slowed down the reforimi process at times, but helped broaden support for chaniges that wer-e
-6 -



difficult to implement.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The coordinating unit was strongly committed to the project and was effective in the recruitment of
consultants and the managemenit of project resources. It monitored closely project activities and produced
progress reports on time.
5.4 C'osts and financing:
The table below provides a summary of credit allocations and actual disbursements, all expressed in
millions of US$. The third column indicates the percentage of actual to initial allocations. Expenses for
training were much less thani initially envisaged. On the other hanid, operating expenses were muchI higher.
A substantial part of the credit (18 percent) was used to help Chad establish new institutions withill the
broad framework of the project objective and to make up for the consistenit lack of appropriate operating

The project under review was to a great extent a continuationi of activities supported by the GEF project.
In spite of that, project implementation started slowly and little disbursemlienits took place durinig the first
year. Eventually, disbursements picked up and were in In1e with the original schedule with about one-year
delay.
6. Sustainability
6. 1 Rationale for sustainabilit raling:.
The sustainability of reforms imiplemented with support from the project is likely. The civil society at large
acknowledges that the reforn program had positive results, rnostly because it enabled the public sector to
operate after years of decay. The privatization of public enterprises is now broadly accepted as a means to
improve efficiency and service delivery. It is unlikely that a new governmenit would backtrack on reformis
implemented. Much remains to be done, however, to improve the effectiveness of government
administration. Operating expenditures are still far below basic requirements, and the morale of staff is
low for lack of appropriate incenltives. The reforn of the civil service along the basic principles defined
-7 -



during project implementation would help improve the efficiency of governmeit administration. Its rapid
implementation would make a contributionl towards the sustainiability of resLults achieved ulider the project.
The reform process is fragile, however. The credit provided a critical support to the agencies involved in
reforn formulation and implementation. By financing the largest part of their operating expenses, it
ensured that the reforn process would not fizzle for lack of teams committed to its success. Operation of
these teams is highlly dependent on the continuationi of external SUpport, wIhich is not sustainable in the
long-term.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
A new operation was approved in early 2000 to help Chad prepare for the advent of oil revenues. It builds
upoin achiievements uLider the project under review, includinig in the areas of finanicial maniagemenit
strengthieniiig, civil service reforiml, and economic reforml monitorinig. It supports a comprehenisive package
aimed at ensurinlg that future oil revenues be used to reduce pervasive poverty throughi the desigii of a
poverty reductioni strategy, overhaul of the public expenditure system, the consolidationi of currenlt and
capital budgets, the strengtheninig of control and audit of public expenditures, and the association of civil
society to the control and oversight of public expenditures. It puts emplhasis on capacity building in key
institutiols. The successful implemilenitationi of the new operation should consolidate results achieved ulider
the project ulider review.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7 1 Lendinig:
Tlle project was identified and prepared with the objective of providing critical support to the teams
involved in the economic reform process. With assistance from the restructured GEF project, Chad was
able to bring its reforn program back on track after a weak performance during the first half of 1994.
Performance improved markedly and Chad was able to reach agreemenit with the IMF on a new programll in
mid-1995. The project under review was prepared with active participation of the Chadiain team
responsible for the turn around and in close collaboration with the IMF. The project was fully consistenit
withi govemrment priorities, and was focused on key activities required for a successful implemenitationi of
the refonn program. Most project institutions were involved in implementing the GEF project and had
demonstrated their capacity to take the steps needed for carrying out tile work program formIulated for the
new project.
The project was appraised in October 1995, after Chad hiad reached agreement withi the IMF and the Bank
on a Policy Framework Paper (PFP) and with the IMF on an ESAF program in August 1995. The
Government was fully committed to the new program and had made good progress in the initial phase of its
implementationi. During appraisal, the design of the project was simplified to facilitate implementatioll.
Performance indicators were defined for each component. The risk analysis was appropriate. Project
appraisal took into account the capacity of executing agencies, wlhiclh had been put to test durinig
implementationi of the restructur-ed GEF project. A project implemiienitationi plan was agreed dul-ing
negotiationis in January 1 996.
The performance of the Bank in project identificationi, preparation and appraisal is rated highly
satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
Project implementationi was closely sLpervised. Bank Imlissionls visited Chad regularly to monitor progress
-8 -



ulider the reform program and provide assistance whenl needed. Th-iere was a remarkable continuity in
staffing the supervisioni missions. The country economist for Chad supervised the project durinig the entire
period of project implementation. A comprehenisive medium-tenr review took place in June 1998. The
review was carefully prepared and was helpful in focusing the attentioni of governmenit officials on all
aspects of implementation and on the development objectives of the project. Supervision missions repolts
were informative and issue-oriented. The country director and the resident representative took an active
interest in project monitoring and follow-up. Three Country Portfolio Performianice Reviews (CPPRs) took
place during implementation of the project. They gave the Governmeit and the Bank an opportunity to
review progress under the portfolio and to address crosscutting issues.
The performance of the Bank in supervisioni is rated satisfactory.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall performance of the Bank is rated satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Government was fully committed to its reforn program. It gave full support to the economic Llnit in
charge of implementing the project and monitorinig the reform programii. The Steering Committee for the
adjustment program chaired by the Head of State met regularly to follow up on proposals made by the
technical committee chaired by the director of the economic unit. During project implementation, the two
directors who were in charge of the economic unit enjoyed strong support from senior aoverrnenit officials.
The borrower's performance in preparation is rated satisfactory.
7.5 Government implementation performnance:
The Governmenlt relied heavily on the credit, rather thani its own budget, to fund the operating expenses of
the institutions set up for project implementation. While this option is clearly not desirable for the
sustainability of the institutional framework supporting the reform effort, it enabled the project to operate
without the usual disruptions due to lack of adequate funding on the part of the Government. The
Governmenit's implementation performance is rated satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The economic unit, in charge of coordinating project implementation, provided strong leadership, as well as
technilcal assistance, to the agencies involved in the project. The unit is well managed and most of its staff
is competent. The unit is large however, and should be streamlined with a view to mainitaininig staff whici
is essential to the functioninig of the unit. Accounting and auditing met appropriate standards and were
compliant with Bank procedures. Recommendations made by auditors were taken into account by the unit,
as confirmed by the last audit report. The implementing agency's performance is rated satisfactory.
7. 7 Overall Borrower peijbrmance:
The perfonnance of the Borrower is rated satisfactory. Despite initial delays in project implementationi, the
Government and the economic unit were strongly committed to the project, and provided key support to thle
successful implementation of the reform program initiated in mid-1994.
8. Lessons Learned
Capacity building and techniical assistance are essential to the implementationi of a reform program in a
country such as Chad, whichi has beeii devastated by years of civil strife. In turn, the reform program., by
putting emphasis on revenue mobilization and improved budgetary procedures, was essential to the
rebuildling of public administration.

The project was specifically designed to help Chad implement its reform program, supported by three
Adjustment Credits. The reform program was implemented successfully, and Chad has been able to make
critical progress in the managemlienit of its public resources. Tlis would not have been possible without
assistance provided under the project.
Capacity building is a long-tern endeavor, whicih requires sustainied govermilenit commitment. The project
developed local capacity, but much remains to be done, particularly as Chad is gearing up to vastly
increased resources from petroleum exploitation in coining years.
Durinig the review process, Bank managemenit insisted that operating expenditures to be finanlced under the
credit be kept at a minimum, so as to ensure sustainability. The allocation in the credit agreemenit was
small and experience has showed that it was far from adequate in view of Cliad's constrained fiscal
situation. During project implementation, the allocation was increased, whichi was critical for movinig the
reforn program alhead.
There was continiuity in project supervision and synergy with Bank economic and sector work. This was a
factor in making the project a sLiccess.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrowver/inp/einenting agency:
The completion report reflects accurately the achievements under the project. The Bank has demonstrated
flexibility during project implemenitatioin, whichi has helped Chad establish four Units critical for the success
of the adjustment process. These UllitS include the oil management Ullit, the cotton reform  unit, the
committee for civil service reforml and the capacity building Ullit. Establishemiienit of these Ulnits has
conltributed to increasiig the operating cost financed under the project, but proved a good investimenit. The
first one has provided leadership to the fonnulation of the Govermilenit strategy in the area of oil
management in anticipation of the development of the Doba oil fields. The second has helped the
Government define its strategy for cotton reform. The third one hias been instrumiienital in developing a set
of principles for civil service reforn and building up a consenisus on these principles. Fiially, the last one
has helped the Governmenit prepare a program for the development of local capacity, a crucial issue for
sustaining economic and social growth.
The project implementatioll unit was also in chiarge of monitorinig progress ulider the adjustimienit program.
This combination was extremely helpful. The unit hielped steer project implementationl for the benefit of the
reform program. Considerable progress has been achieved in economic reform in the past four years.

Projet intervenait a un moment ofi le manque d'infrastructure et les insuffisances dans
la capacite de gestion de l'Administration etaient criants.
Les objectifs de ce Projet ont e  centres sur le Renforcement des Capacites
nationales en matiere de gestion economique A travers le renforcement des institutions
de l'Etat et l'achevement du programme de desengagement de l'Etat des entreprises
publiques (la liquidation ou la privatisation).
Ces activites etaient centr6es autour de cinq grands objectifs ci-apres
a- Augmentation des recettes de l'Etat;
b- Rationalisation des depenses, y compris dette et investissement;
c- Amelioration de la formulation de la politique economique;
d- Achevement du programme de desengagement de l'Etat des entreprises publiques;
e- Reforme de la fonction publique.

(Direction de la Dette et Investissement)
* 13 Entreprises liquidees. II s'agit de:
SOTERA, SHT, CSPC, CRPS, OMVSD, OFNAR, OPIT, OFCA, SONACOT, FIPP,
BATAL, AIR TCHAD et BICIT.
Soit au total 39 Entreprises traitees grace au Credit IDA 2818-CD
d)   Formation
L'execution du volet formation a connu un depart lent du fait que les Services
beneficiaires ne disposaient pas d'un plan de formation precis. En effet, un Consultant
Independant avait ete recrute pour recenser tous les besoins en formationi des Services
b6neficiaires en vue de pr6parer un plan global de formation, ce qui fuit fait et
approuve par la Banque Mondiale. Ce Plan de formation a servi de rattraper ce retard
par 1'envoi des agents du Ministere des Finances dans les grandes Ecoles, telles que
l'ENAREF de Ouagadougou, I'ENAM de Yaounde et bien d'autres, et par
l'intensification de la formation locale en masse.
e) Fonctionnement
Ce volet correspondant a la categorie n5 de 1'accord de Credit. a connu des
d6passements importants dus essentiellement a deux raisons:
Les depenses de fonctionnement retenues lors de l'evaluation du Projet
concemaient uniquement la Cellule d'Appui A la Gestion des Projets et A l'Ajustement
7



(CAGPA), le Secretariat Permanent Charge du Desengagement de l'Etat des
Entreprises (SPCDEE) et la Direction de la Statistique (DSEED), et les
depenses de fonctionnement engagees concernant les nouveaux services beneficiaires
expliquent le depassement constate au titre de la categorie 5 du Credit.
2 - EXECUTION FINANCIERE.
A la date du 30 juin 2000, 5.451.422.176 F CFA ont ete dcaiss6s, soit 100% du
montant du Credit. Les details figurent dans les tableaux en annexe.
IV - RESULTATS DU PROJET
* La Construction
Les resultants de ce volet correspondant A la categorie 1 de l'accord de Credit
par leur caractere mesurable ont permis de renforcer les capacites des differents
services ( voire details au point III execution du Projet).
* L'Equipement
L'achat des vehicules, des materiels informatiques, des radios emetteurs
r6cepteurs avec panneaux solaires et des mobiliers de bureau destines aux differents
services beneficiaires a reellement contribue au renforcement des capacites.
* Credit a I'Assistance Technique
A l'achevement du Projet, le credit alloue a l'assistance technique a et
entierement utilise voir tableau en annexe .
* Formation
L'execution de ce volet a et tres lente du fait que les services beneficiaires ne
disposaient pas d'un plan de formation precis. A l'heure actuelle le credit alloue A la
formation est engage A hauteur de 70%.
* Financement des activites non prevues dans I'accord de credits.
Le projet de renforcement des Capacites de Gestion Economique avait finance
les activites de certains organes non prevus dans l'accord de credit. C'est le cas de
l'Unite d'Appui Permnanent a la Gestion Economique A l'Ere Petroliere et du Secretariat
de Renforcement des Capacites Nationales, la Filiere Coton, L'ONPTet le Ministere
du Commerce et de l'Industrie. Cet etat de choses avait complique la mission de
l'equipe de gestion du Projet. A la date du 30 juin 2000 leurs depenses representent
14,48% du Credit.
V - DURABILITE DES ACQUIS DU PROJET
8



A la date du 30 juin 2000, le Credit est entierement consomme. Quant A la
perennite des acquis, il est claire que les realisations du Projet en maticre de savoir (
formation et assistance technique) et r6alisations physique (construction et equipement
ont considerablement renforce  les capacites de gestion  de  l'Administration
Tchadienne.
VI. PERFORMANCE DE LA BANQUE
Au vu des documents disponibles, la Banque a apporte une contribution
importante lors des preparations du Projet et elle a entretenu des rapports constants
avec la Cellule Economique sur le Projet. Elle a egalement suivi de pres les passations
de marches, les contrats et 1'execution des depenses.
VII. PERFORMANCE DE L'EMPRUNTEUR
Le Gouvemement du Tchad A travers la Cellule Economique a entretenu des
rapports permanents avec la Banque Mondiale. Elle a suivi de tres pres l'execution du
projet conformement aux procedures de la Banque surtout en matiere d'execution des
depenses de passation des marches, de d6caissement, de la tenue de la comptabilite. II
est important de souligner que malgre les difficultes rencontrees au cours de
1'execution de ce projet, sa gestion a e  exemplaire et les acquis sont incontestables.
Compte tenu des difficultes rencontrees dans 1'ex6cution du Projet, a savoir
l'utilisation partielle des credits alloues A la formation et le financement des activites
non prevues dans l'accord de credit, un depassement dont les details ci-dessous est
cre&
Activites non Prevues dans I'Accord de Credit.
Ces activites non prevues ont perturbe enormement le fonctionnernent du projet
dans la mesure ou aucun credit n't&ait prevu a cet effet. Or ces activites Dnt diminue le
volume des credits destines a d'autres services beneficiaires qui etaient prevues lors de
l'evaluation du Projet. Les consequences de la creation de ces unites paralleles sont
nombreuses. Parmi ces consequences, le depassement sur le Credit cree par le
fonctionnement de ces unites paralleles retient particulierement notre attention et pour
lequel il faut imperativement trouver un financement. Ce depassement se compose
comme suit:
1- Tchaby (stabilisation d'Aire de Stationnement de Ngueli) = 31.968.49S9 Fcfa;
2- Price WaterHouse ( etude sur la DHS de la Coton Tchad) = 42.600.000 Fcfa;
3- HSBC EQUATOR BANK (etude sur la SONASUT)    = 60.003.251 Fcfa;
4- Cotisations aux organismes sociaux               = 34.722.493 I;cfa;
Soit un depassement de                          =169.294.243 Fcfa.
NB: L'explication au non paiement de ces engagements est que premierement les
factures des entreprises Tchaby, PriceWaterHouse et BSBC Equator Bank n'etaient
disponibles qu'apres la cl6ture du Credit. Et A la date du 30 juin 2000, le Credit etait
entierement decaisse et a ce jour aucune disposition n'a et prise.
9



Nous pensons qu'il faudra envisager le transfert de ces creances sur le Credit 3316-
CD qui a notre avis poursuit aussi des objectifs de renforcement des capacites de l'Etat
par I'augmentation des recettes et l'achevement du programme de desengagement de
I'Etat des entreprises publiques conformement au Programme de la Reduction de la
Pauvrete et de Croissance. A ce titre:
* Afin d'eviter des blocages dans la poursuite des etudes sur le processus de
privatisation de la CotonTchad, conditionnee par le paiement du reliquat de
PriceWaterHOUSE&COOPERS A qui le Gouvernement a confie les etudes, il faudra
envisager le paiement du reliquat sur le Credit 3316-CD;
* Le paiement'du reliquat des entreprises Tchaby (Aire de Stationnement de Ngueli) et
HSBC Equator Bank (SONASUT), devra etre aussi pris en compte par le Credit
3316-CD, car nous estimons que, comme nous I'avons mentionne ci-dessus, le
nouveau Credit poursuit aussi des objectifs de renforcement des capacites;
* Quant aux charges sociales du personnel, leur prise en charge n'a pas ete effective
pour la simple raison que le jer janvier 2000 date prevue pour l'entree en vigueur du
Credit 3316-CD a connu des reports. Ce decalage dans la mise en vigueur du Credit
a cree une periode de flottement de six mois ayant pour consequence la prise en
charge par le Credit 2818-CD du couit de fonctionnement de la Cellule Economique
qui avoisine les 160.000.000 Fcfa. Voila une explication breve du depassement sur le
Credit 2818-CD.
Et enfin nous souhaiterions avoir I'avis de la Banque au mime titre que les autres
engagements en cours d'execution a l'exemple de la prise en charge du reste de la
scolarite des etudiants qui etaient pris en charge par le Credit 2818-CD et bascules
sur le Credit 3316-CD.
VIII. CONCLUSION
le projet de renforcement de capacite de Gestion Economique, credit IDA 2818-
CD, en depit des difficultes rencontrees dans l'execution de ses activites, a permis:
* Par un elargissement de l'assiette fiscale;
. Par une restructuration des services de Douanes en les dotant du materiel
informatique et des vehicules pour lutter contre la fraude et la contrebande et la
formation des agents;
. la privatisation, la liquidation ou la restructuration de certaines entreprises
publiques;
* l'informatisation d'un grand nombre des services publics et la formation des agents;
* l'6laboration et l'adoption des comptes nationaux;
. la mise sur pied d'une Cellule de Suivi de la mise en (Euvre de la reforme de la
fonction publique;
* la creation d'une structure de suivi du programme d'Ajustement Structurel, un cadre
adequat de concertation avec les partenaires. Cette structure qui est la Cellule
Economique est une reference en matiere de creation des capacites de gestion.
