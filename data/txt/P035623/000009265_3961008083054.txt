MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT FOR ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Chad for the equivalent of SDR 6.4 million
(US$9.5 million equivalent), on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance
a Capacity Building Project for Economic Management.
2.    Country and Sector Background. Chad is one of the least developed countries in the
world. With a population of 6.5 million, per capita GNP is estimated at US$190 for 1994, below
the level at independence. Social indicators of primary health and education are well below
those in most other sub-Saharan African countries. Chad ranks 168th out of 173 countries on
UNDP's Human Development Index. Extended periods of political instability and civil strife
have been major contributing factors to this low level of development.
3.    Over the past five years the government has been able to bring about political stability. A
democratization process has been initiated and elections are now expected to take place by mid-
1996. Following the devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994, a reform program was put in
place to restore order to public finances and lay the groundwork for growth and poverty
alleviation. This program was supported by an IMF Stand-by arrangement and an IDA
Economic Recovery Credit (ERC), both approved in March 1994. The ongoing Technical
Assistance Project for Economic and Financial Management (GEF) was significantly
restructured to support the work of high level committees, which were established in June 1994
to monitor program implementation. The result was a dramatic improvement in the country's
economic performance, particularly as concerns government revenues. A PFP was recently
negotiated and an ESAF program was approved by the IMF on September 1, 1995.
4.    The prolonged instability has taken a massive toll on the economy, from which it has yet
to recover. Years of turbulence have left the physical infrastructure, human resource base, and
institutional and administrative capacities at levels well below those in most countries in the
region. With revenues equivalent to 7.4 percent of GDP in 1994, the Government is barely able
to meet basic requirements. The low level of institutional capacity in Chad represents both a
threat and constraint to the sustainable development of its resources. Revenue collection and
expenditure control are especially weak in the Ministry of Finance. Poor operating procedures
and control systems are compounded by lax management and lack of accountability and
transparency. Similarly, insufficient human resources reduce the ability of the Ministry of Plan
and Cooperation to forrmulate economic policy, to prepare and monitor public investment
planning, and, more generally, to provide leadership in economic management.
5.    Project Objectives and Description. The project's objective is to help Chad increase
its capacity for economic management. In the short term, the project will assist the government
to prepare and implement a reform program to be supported by a series of single tranche



2
Structural Adjustment Credits (SACs). It would support objectives that form part of Chad's
medium-term  and long-term  economic management strategy including: (i) rebuilding the
administration around a civil service of modest size with a clear focus on core public sector
functions and in which transparent and criteria-based recruitment, career planning, training and
career management would be targeted; (ii) restoring the Government's capacity to provide
essential public goods and services, improve its public finance management; (iii) improving the
quality and efficiency of public expenditures; and (iv) implementing the Government's
divestiture program.
6.    In particular, the project would support the Government's ongoing efforts to:
(i) enhance revenue mobilization, by providing consulting services, training, equipment
and office facilities to the Directorates responsible for revenue collection, namely the
Directorate of Customs, the Directorate of Income tax and the Directorate of property tax
(US$2.17 million).
(ii) improve the quality of public expenditures (current and capital) by providing short-
term technical assistance, training and equipment to the Directorates of Budget and Debt
in the Ministry of Finance and to the Directorate of Programming and External Aid in the
Ministry of Plan (US$1.82 million);
(iii) strengthen capacities in economic policy formulation and monitoring, and
dissemination, through provision of consulting services, training, and equipment for the
Coordinating Unit, the Directorate of Economic Planning and the Directorate of Statistics
in the Ministry of Plan (US$2.65 million).
(iv) implement its divestiture program by: (i) financing consulting services to the
Secretariat overseeing the divestiture process (US$0.4 million); (ii) financing revision of
the legislation, consultants and audits of public enterprises (PEs) to be restructured,
privatized or liquidated (US$1.6 million).
(v) design and implement a program of civil service reform (US$0.86 million) by
providing consulting services for (i) the redefinition of the functions of the central
administration, reorganization of the existing economic entities and preparation of a new
organizational chart for the economic ministries; (ii) the definition of long-term and
short-term training needs of the refocussed civil service; and (iii) the establishment of an
information system for personnel management and the improvement of the filing system
of the Ministry of Civil Service. The recently completed civil service census will provide
the data necessary for planning the staffing component of the reform.
7.    Overall, during the three-year period (1996-98), the project will finance about 120 m/ni
of consulting services for institutional capacity building; a training program of 700 trainees; and
logistical support.
8.    The project will promote greater coordination between the central and line ministries,
particularly with regard to budget preparation, execution and monitoring. In parallel, the
European Union intends to support the strengthening of the financial management of the line



3
ministries, and the French Cooperation is expected to continue to provide assistance for internal
audit and inspection services within the Ministry of Finance. This assistance will complement
the actions to be financed under the proposed project.
9.    Project Cost and Financing. Total project cost is estimated at US$10 million, to be
financed by the Government (US$0.5 million), and the proposed IDA Credit (US$9.5 million).
The Government would finance part of the local costs and other facilities and services to the unit
responsible for overall implementation of the project. IDA would finance all other costs.
10.   Project Implementation and Performance Indicators.  To correct performance
slippage in program implementation in the first half of 1994, the Government put in place an
Interministerial Committee supported by a Technical Committee and a Coordinating Unit for the
adjustment program, within the Ministry of Plan. This structure has worked well, as evidenced
by the greatly improved coordination and monitoring of the reform program since June 1994. In
particular, the Coordinating Unit, which was established during the restructuring of the GEF
project and largely resr -)nsible for the turn-around in project performance, demonstrated its
capacity to successfully implement well-focused programs. This Coordinating Unit will be the
implementing agency responsible for the overall coordination of the project and directly
responsible for the implementation of the sub-components related to the Ministry of Finance and
Ministry of Plan. The Secretariat for the Divestiture Program, which has established a good
track record, will be responsible for the privatization/liquidation component of the project. The
civil service reform subcomponent will be implemented by the Directorate of Civil Service in the
Ministry of Civil Service.  The project will be implemented over a three-year period.
Performance indicators are detailed in Schedule B3.
11.   Project Sustainability.  A basic objective of the project is to contribute to the
institutional capacity of governmental agencies targeted for assistance. Chad's development
prospects will be enhanced through increasing capacity in the public sector, by ensuring that the
administration has the structures, staff skills and resources it needs to lead the economic reform
process. Improved revenue collection is key to financial sustainability. The project's consulting
services for advisory assistance and training elements have been carefully designed to limit long
term expatriate assistance and to enhance local capacity. By the end of the proposed project, it is
expected that the divestiture program and the civil service reform would be completed and the
Chadian authorities, would be able to collect at least 11.5 percent of GDP in revenues without
outside assistance.
12.   Lessons from Previous Bank Group Involvement. The proposed project was designed
taking into account the lessons learned from implementation of the GEF project. That project
was meant to increase capacity, yet failed to adequately recognize the extremely low
implementation capacity. The project was restructured in April 1994 around tightly focused
activities aimed at achieving concrete results within specific time limits. Implementation has
since improved dramatically. Actual disbursements since April 1994 have been greater than for
the previous five years combined. Considering these factors, activities under the proposed
project have been deliberately restricted to key priority areas where performance indicators are
clearly identifiable. In addition, 20 staff weeks of supervision per year on average have been
allocated to reflect the need for close staff supervision.

13.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is fully consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to be presented at the same time than the proposed project,
and is a key for its successful implementation. The CAS objectives are to (i) restore critical
public sector capacity; (ii) focus public expenditures on poverty reduction; (iii) create an
environment favorable to private sector development; (iv) promote sustainable use of natural
resources. The program of assistance under the proposed project will help Chad re-establish the
core functions of government and thus provide an appropriate framework for private sector
development and poverty alleviation. It will help Chad build up critical capacity in economic
management, and improve the quality and efficiency of its public expenditure.
14.   Agreed Actions. At negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it would: (i)
make provisions for its contribution to the project and prepare procurement documents critical
for project start-up by April 1996; (ii) restructure the Ministry of Plan and the Ministry of
Finance before end-1996 to improve coherence and coordination of public economic and
financial institutions; (iii) confirm the Coordinator for the Adjustment Program as coordinator of
the Project; (iv) mainta n and strengthen the interministerial High Committee, the Technical
Committee for adjustment and the Secretariat for State Divestiture as the key bodies to develop
and monitor the implementation of the economic reform program; (v) follow the project
implementation plan agreed upon with IDA; (vi) conduct a joint annual review of project
implementation not later than March 31, after the end of the year under review, in coordination
with the other donors involved and (vii) implement the training program agreed upon with IDA,
beginning with the design of a detailed program for the first year of the project before March 31,
1996. Condition of effectiveness is the employment of an independent auditor acceptable to
IDA.
15.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed project would have no direct impact on the
environment and is classified "C". Recommendations of the Country Environmental Strategy
Paper, published in June 1994, are being translated into specific operations with the support of
donors, including IDA.
16.   Project Objective Categories. Project activities would be executed as part of Chad's
structural adjustment efforts. Specific objectives of the project are institution- and capacity-
building, improved management of public finances and private sector development.
17.   Participatory Approach. The project's design has resulted from extensive consultations
with prospective beneficiaries. During project preparation, the Government established working
groups, comprised of relevant representatives from the various ministries and, where appropriate,
the private sector, to address reform issues. These groups were responsible for identifying
priorities and elaborating detailed action plans. The plans were subsequently presented and
discussed at a plenary session attended by a broad spectrum of concerned parties from the private
and public sectors.
18.   Project Benefits. *The proposed operation is designed to provide the financial and
technical support needed for Chad to implement its adjustment program and establish the
framework for sustained economic growth and poverty alleviation. It will help improve the
management of public finances, strengthen fiscal performance and make the civil service more
efficient. In particular, the proposed project will increase the capacity of the customs to collect



5
revenues. A comprehensive expenditure control system is expected to be in place by the end of
1996, and will include the reinforcement of the capacity of the Budget Directorate to prepare and
monitor the budget and of the Directorate of Treasury to control expenditures. The proposed
project will also significantly improve the debt management system and Chad's public
investment planning capabilities. Under the recently negotiated PFP, the Chadian authorities are
committed to privatizing and/or liquidating most public enterprises.
19.   Risks.  The major risks associated with the strategy for change in public sector
management arise from the fragility of Chad's political situation. In the process, political
resistance may be encountered from vested interests. To help reduce these risks, extensive
consultations were held with parliamentarians, representatives of the private sector and NGOs,
and union leaders during the preparation of the project. The Government subsequently organized
seminars and workshops with a wide array of stakeholders on its economic reform program.
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.

Risks:
In itself this project has relatively small risks stemming essentially from political factors. The realization of its full
benefits is also contingent upon how effectively the adjustment program is implemented.

CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT FOR ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
Portfolio Implementation
1.    The major constraints for project implementation in Chad are: (a) the low level of internal
revenues, resulting in Government's inability to provide counterpart funds and pay civil servant
salaries and (b) weak institutional capacity and the insufficient skills of some project directors,
particularly regarding procurement procedures, accounting systems and auditing.
2.    Procurement processes and capacity improved in FY94. The Country Procurement
Assessment Review carried out in December 1992 led to concrete actions to develop local
procurement capacity. It also helped to identify the need for the following capacity-building
actions which are now on-going: (a) the contracting out of petroleum import tax collection to a
private firm; (b) the establishment of a two-year in-service training program in procurement,
financed by IDA which is offered to local staff; and (c) the establishment of an implementation
unit in the Ministry of Planning to assist Bank-financed operations in the areas of procurement,
accounting and auditing and to monitor carefully the availability of counterpart funds. IDA
played an important role in helping the Government to design the needed corrective measures to
improve implementation capacity.
3.    Overall performance of the Chad portfolio improved from FY93 to FY95. During the
FY93 review, Chad was singled out for having three problem projects out of a total of eight
operations. During FY94, corrective actions were taken and in FY95 Chad's project portfolio is
problem free. Disbursement performance continued to improve, reaching an estimated US$47
million (disbursement ratio of 28.1 percent) in FY95 compared to US$28 million (ratio of 18.4
percent) in FY94. A disbursement mission is scheduled in January 1996 to provide assistance in
special account documentation.
