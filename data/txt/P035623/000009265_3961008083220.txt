REPUBLIC OF CHAD
CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
TECHNICAL ANNEX
Country Background
1.    Chad presents a major development challenge. At independence in 1960, the new nation
started inauspiciously on the development path, finding itself poorly prepared in terms of
infrastructure, education and health services, particularly in the northern part of the country. Yet,
Chad's most intractable development constraint has been non-economic: since independence,
Chadian political history is characterized by a one-party state, dominated in turn by regional
groups and recurring armed rebellions. In 1979, the central government and political institutions
collapsed, and regions of the country were ruled by competing groups. War conditions prevailed
throughout 1979-83 and again in late 1980s. As a result of this turbulent period, GDP per capita
is barely above what it was at independence in 1960.
2.    Chad is now emerging from this long series of political crisis and armed conflicts that
have severely damaged its infrastructure, shaken its institutions and disrupted economic life.
Both the government and the population appear determined to take up the challenge of restoring
political stability and reactivating economic growth. While the risk of resurgence of political
turmoil cannot altogether be discounted, the most likely outcome for the second half of the 1990s
is the successful implementation of comprehensive political and economic reforms, leading to
the establishment of democratic institutions, improved public sector management and sustained
growth.
3.    With a population of about 6.5 million, Chad is among the poorest countries in the world
(1994 per capita income of US$190). Chad ranks 168th out of 173 countries on the UNDP's
Human Development Index. This is borne out by its poor social indicators: life expectancy is 47
years (52 years sub-Saharan Africa --SSA--average); the infant mortality rate is 122 per thousand
(99 per thousand average for SSA); the primary school enrollment rate is 46 percent (SSA
average of 66 percent); and less than 30 percent of children have been immunized against the
deadly childhood diseases (55 percent average for SSA). The economy is predominantly rural.
Agriculture provides 42 percent of the 1995 GDP; industry 18 percent; and services 40 percent.
The export base is narrow, and consists of essentially three items: cotton (50-60 percent of total),
livestock (20 percent) and arabic gum (9 percent).
4.    Recent Developments. During the period 1990-94, real GDP grew at an average rate of
0.9 percent, albeit with great year-to-year fluctuations. The low growth was due essentially to a
decline in cotton production, triggered by falling world market prices and a loss of
competitiveness, due to the appreciation of the real exchange rate. Between 1990 and 1993, the
world market price for cotton (Liverpool Index) fell by 30 percent. As a member of the CFA
zone, Chad had to wait till January 1994 to devalue the CFA franc in concert with other members



2
of the zone. Compounded by management and liquidity problems in the cotton processing and
marketing parastatal, COTONTCHAD, falling world market prices led the authorities to cut
producer prices. This, in turn, led to reduced production and further financial losses for
COTONTCHAD. The loss of competitiveness resulting from the appreciation of the exchange
rate also weakened the performance of the livestock sub-sector, other agricultural exports and
local manufactures.
5.    Chad's overall financial situation deteriorated during 1990-93. Government revenues
remained at almost 10 percent of GDP during the period, while current expenditures rose from 15
percent of GDP in 1990 to 18 percent in 1993. Private (including parastatal) savings averaged
0.4 percent, making domestic savings average negative II percent over the period. Aid flows
were substantially reduced and external arrears accumulated to US$49 million at end-1993;
international reserves fell from the equivalent of 2.9 months of imports in 1990 to 1.2 months in
1993, and Chad exceeded its credit position at the common Central Bank of Central African
States, BEAC. Nevertheless, a significant share of investment financing continued to be
available on a grant basis. Chad is not heavily indebted. While external debt stands at 93
percent of GDP in 1995, the debt service-exports ratio is modest, amounting to 14 percent in
1995. However, owing to low revenue mobilization, the debt service burden is much heavier in
relation to government revenues (66 percent in 1995).
6.    The devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 presented the Chadian authorities an
opportunity to reinvigorate the economy and lay the basis for accelerating growth and tackling
poverty reduction. The authorities prepared a reform program aimed at securing a lasting
improvement in the economy's competitiveness; improving producer incentives; and attenuating
the negative effects of the parity change on the vulnerable groups. The program was supported
by a Stand-by arrangement with the IMF and an Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) from IDA.
This program was implemented with mixed results and was essentially off-track by end-June
1994. The Chadian authorities canceled the Stand-by arrangement and replaced it with a staff-
monitored program covering the period October 1994-June 1995. IDA provided support to the
implementation of both the Staff-monitored program and the ERC through the restructuring of
the Economic and Financial Management Project (GEF, CR 1872 for US$12 million approved in
1988) in April 1994. The project helped improve revenue performance when it financed the
institutional strengthening of the Customs Department and the privatization of the collection of
petroleum import taxes. With a rapidly improved revenue performance, the government was able
to resume critical expenditures, including the settlement of arrears to suppliers and civil servants.
Building on this foundation, the government outlined a reinforced reform program for the 1995-
98 period. A PFP was negotiated in August 1995 and the IMF Board approved a three-year
ESAF arrangement in September 1995.
7.    Following the devaluation of the CFA franc, Chad, in concert with the other members of
the Economic Union of Central African States (CAEMC) implemented a far reaching tax and
customs reform. The tax and tariff structure was simplified and effective protection lowered.
The Government objective as set out in the PFP is to raise the revenue to GDP ratio from 7.4 in
1994 to 11.5 percent in 1998. The authorities intend to rigorously implement the extensive and
ambitious action plan that has been developed for the customs office with the assistance of the
GEF. Principal actions which will be supported under the proposed Capacity Building Project



3
will consist of a further strengthening of customs monitoring and control, a widening of the
assessment of customs duties on the basis of updated c.i.f. value and the expansion of training
program and use of computerized information.
Public Sector Institutions
8.    Institutional capacity in Chad's public sector is low.  The central administration
completely ceased to function during the civil war and a large number of the most skilled
professionals left the country. In the 1980s, the effects of the war were seen in the almost total
lack of systems/procedures, basic coordination mechanisms and skilled personnel. The lack of
funding further frustrated efforts to reestablish an effective administration. Salary arrears have
been a recurrent phenomenon. In 1993 they accumulated to eleven months. Accordingly, public
servants lacked motivation and were often absent from work. In many cases they also lacked the
basic materials and supplies required to perform their work. The combined effect of these factors
was that most of the core functions of the government administration needed to be redeveloped
almost from scratch.
9.    The GEF was the first comprehensive attempt to rebuild government's capacity in
economic and financial management. Project activities were however, insufficiently defined, too
dispersed, and poorly coordinated by the government. In early 1994, only 38 percent of the
credit had been disbursed. The project was restructured in April 1994 and focused on increasing
government capacity in the three crucial areas of revenue collection, expenditure control, and
economic policy design and implementation. The restructured project was instrumental in
helping the Government make remarkable progress in the implementation of its post-devaluation
reform program. Table 1 provides a summary of project activities.
10.   There is a considerable weakness in the fiscal services of the Ministry of Finance.
Achievement of the objectives in fiscal policy as well as the advancement of fiscal reform and
the restructuring of government spending require a significant improvement in budget
preparation, execution and monitoring. There are, however, limits to the speed with which
revenue collection can be improved and reforms can become effective, due to weak operating
procedures and control systems which are compounded by lax management, and a lack of
accountability and transparency. The introduction of clear procedures and operating systems
needs to be accompanied by extensive staff training and skill development. Under the GEF,
progress was made in key areas, including (i) computerization of the fiscal services, (ii)
relocation of customs facilities and (iii) sub-contracting of petroleum import tax collection to a
private, foreign operator. The proposed project will increase the customs in-house capacity to
collect revenues, so that in 1996 the Chadians can resume this collection role and conduct
internal audits efficiently, and increase their level of collection by 50 percent in 1996 and at least
25 percent in 1997 and 1998.
11.   Weaknesses in the Ministry of Plan, especially in the areas of economic policy
formulation, public investment planning, and donors activities coordination undermine this
Ministry's ability to perform its leadership role in economic management and investment
portfolio management. Project supervision was an area of weakness until a Project Supervision
Unit in the Ministry of Plan was created in late 1994 (under the GEF) to improve project



4
management, auditing and evaluation. The GEF also provided initial financing for macro-
economic policy formulation. This will be continued under the proposed project.
12.   The Ministry of Civil Service is perhaps one of the most disorganized of all the
ministries. It is unable to provide information on numbers of personnel, let-alone a breakdown
of staff according to qualifications, skill categories, areas of responsibilities or even geographical
location. The recently completed civil service census will help establish a solid basis for the
management of human resources. Priorities for reform in this Ministry include: replacing
current ad hoc management with a systematic career development program and transferring some
routine functions from the Ministry of Civil Service to the appropriate line ministries.
13.   Civil Service Reform  Program.   The government intends to rehabilitate its
administration around a civil service of modest size with a clear focus on core public sector
functions and in which recruitment, career progress, training and management and incentives
elicit dedication and efficiency from its staff. The results of a civil service census completed in
late November 1995 are currently under review. Preliminary indications show that the size of
civil service is around 27,000 persons and about 10 percent of the civil servants are fictitious or
in unregular situation. The proposed project will help implement the action plan drawn from the
census and will establish a new information base for managing and controlling the size of the
new civil service which will be adjusted in accordance with government's economic objectives.
An improved and modernized management of the Civil Service (recruitment and career planning,
training and supervision, salary increase and promotions) will be established under the proposed
project. The long-term objective is to develop a well-trained and highly motivated professional
civil service and to focus the attention of central departments on key policy design, project
planning, programming and monitoring functions since many operational tasks are expected to
be delegated or sub-contracted to private enterprises, decentralized agencies and community-
based organizations.
14.   Public Enterprises. The Chadian authorities believe that the private sector should be the
driving force in the economy, generating growing incomes and providing employment. They see
the public sector's role as creating the conditions permitting the emergence of new formal small
and medium-scale enterprises while those in existence expand and diversify their activities. The
government realizes this will require public sector withdrawal from activities that can be handled
by the private sector; the provision of supportive infrastructure; and the removal of obstacles to
the creation of an open and competitive business environment. To this end, the authorities
propose to : (i) create a business-friendly judicial and regulatory environment; (ii) restructure the
financial system to make it more supportive of private sector investment and trade; (iii)
accelerate the divestiture process. In 1990, Chad's state enterprises (including mixed public-
private entities and autonomous, commercially-oriented agencies) numbered about forty. The
twenty-eight largest together had assets totaling CFAF180 billion (equivalent to 56 percent of
GDP) and employed some 8,000 people (about 25 percent of modern sector employment).
During 1992-94, the financial losses of the five most important enterprises (CFAF7 billion, or
about 2 percent of GDP) accounted for the bulk of the losses of the public enterprises sector. In
1992, the decision was taken to divest the state of most of these enterprises in order to reduce the
scope of public sector activity and create room for private sector growth. In that year, a
Presidential Ordinance established a list of enterprises to be liquidated or privatized, and spelled



'5
out the procedure for doing so. The Bank provided financial support through the GEF for the
implementation of this program. Considerable progress has been achieved since. In 1994, seven
enterprises were liquidated and five were privatized. In 1995 the liquidation of 4 enterprises and
the privatization of 4 additional enterprises were completed.
Section A: Project Objectives and Description
15.   The proposed project is designed to address basic weaknesses in the Chadian public
administration. It would reinforce progress made under GEF and would help to (i) rebuild the
administration around a civil service of modest size with a clear focus on core public sector
functions and in which transparent and criteria-based recruitment, career planning, training and
career management would be targeted; (ii) restore the Government's capacity to provide essential
public goods and services, improve its public finance management; (iii) improve the quality and
efficiency of public expenditures; and (iv) implement the Government's divestiture program.
16.   The project will support the continuation of activities initiated in 1994 under the GEF in
the following areas:
a)    revenue collection: consulting services, training, equipment, materiel and office
facilities for the directorates responsible for revenue collection (customs, income tax, and
property tax), to reach the revenue to GDP ratio of 11.5 percent in 1998 as agreed in PFP
(US$2.17 million);
b)    rationalization of expenditures. consulting services, training and equipment for
the Directorate of Budget to improve budgetary procedures and increase allocation to
priority sectors; technical advisory assistance and equipment to the Directorate of Debt to
improve debt reporting, to the Directorate of External Assistance (DPAE) and to the
Ministry of Plan to improve the preparation and implementation of the public investment
program and the coordination of donors. The PIP process will be rationalized by
reducing the number of projects, identifying and moving current expenditures into the
current budget, making the PIP less donor driven, and improving the realism of the PIP
and the efficiency of its implementation to support the development impact and poverty
reduction objectives of the program and its consistency with sector strategies (US$1.82
million).
c)    economic policy formulation: consulting services for technical advisory assistance
and equipment (US$2.65 million) to support the Coordinating Unit for the adjustment
program, and the Directorate of Statistics in the Ministry of Plan to generate the data,
monitor the overall adjustment program and supervise the project portfolio. The project
would also contribute to improve the Ministry of Plan's ability to disseminate economic
policies to the public, particularly the journalists, the parliamentarians, the unions and the
private sector, through training and seminars in economic matters and the publication of
economic data and establishment of an economic information system (US$0.5 million).
d)    During the period 1996-98, the proposed project will support the completion of
Government's divestiture program (as detailed in Annex 1, Table 6), targetting 12 public



6
enterprises, including the five largest ones--STEE (water and electricity), ONPT (posts),
TIT (telecommunications), COTONTCHAD (cotton processing and marketing), and
SONASUT (sugar). This component will assist the government implement its divestiture
program by financing technical advisory assistance for the Secretariat overseeing the
disengagement process (US$0.4 million), and audits and diagnostic studies (US$1.6
million);
e)    The project will finance short-term consultants, training, material and equipment
(US$0.86 million) to (i) redefine the role of the public sector, reorganize the existing
entities and design an action plan for training in public administration management; (ii)
define the long-term and short-term training needs of the refocused civil service; and (iii)
establish an information system for personnel management and revamp the existing filing
system of the Ministry of Civil Service. This subcomponent consists of studies to
evaluate personnel skills and skill gaps and to review the current incentive system,
placing greater emphasis on merit in the salary adjustment guidelines and on the
formulation of principal career streams.
Section B: Project Costs, Implementation and Monitoring
I. Project Costs
17.   Total project costs including price contingencies net of taxes and duties are estimated at
US$10 million. The Government would provide staff and facilities and cover part of the local
costs at an estimated US$0.5 million equivalent. Detailed project costs are provided in the
Annex 1, Table 2. A summary breakdown of the project costs net of taxes is given below:
Table 1: Estimated Total Project Costs

Total                                                     10.0
II. Organization and Management
18.   The Coordinating Unit, which was established during the restructuring of the GEF project
to help implement the economic reform program, will be the implementing agency responsible
for the overall coordination of the project and directly responsible for the implementation of the
sub-components related to the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Plan. The Secretariat for the



7
Divestiture program will be responsible for the privatization/liquidation component of the
project. The civil service reform subcomponent will be implemented by the Directorate of the
Civil Service in the Ministry of Civil Service.
19.   An outline of a Project Implementation Plan has been prepared to help the Project
Coordinator implement and monitor the project. The plan will include all project procedures
agreed with IDA, standard bidding documents for consultants, the list of consulting services to
be procured and the type of procurement, detailed project costs, terms of reference for the studies
and support services to be carried out and standard forms for progress reports. The plan has been
agreed during negotiations. Most terms of reference for critical project activities have already
been agreed with the Government.
III. Implementation Schedule
20.   The implementation schedule for the project has been agreed upon during negotiations.
The proposed schedule i" provided in Annex 2. It is prepared on the assumption that the credit
would become effective in March 1996. The project would be executed over a three-year period,
and the credit would be closed by June 30, 2000.
IV. Reporting and Monitoring
21.   The content and timing of progress reports were agreed during negotiations. A standard
progress report form will be developed during appraisal and included in the Project
Implementation Plan. They would be prepared quarterly and in advance of each Bank
supervision mission and will review progress on financial execution and studies. The Borrower
will submit an Implementation Completion Report to IDA no later than six months after the
closing date of the credit.
V. Supervision Plan
22.   Bank Staff input into the Supervision of the project would take the following form:
a) Portfolio Management: Review of procurement documents, terms of reference and
reports (progress, financial studies, financial statements); and
b) Field Supervision: Missions to review the progress of technical assistance studies and
divestiture programs. Missions would monitor the impact of project activities and
discuss action plans for implementing recommendations based on study results. A
supervision plan is proposed in Annex 1, Table 7.
VI. Annual Review
23.   During negotiations, the Borrower agreed to an annual review, and on its objectives. No
later than 31 March 1997, the Project Coordinator should prepare and hold the first annual
review of the project execution. The review would be organized with the ministries concerned,
IDA's supervision team and representatives of donor agencies involved in the Capacity Building



8
program. The review process would include progress in meeting project objectives, project
performance against agreed upon indicators, execution of the studies and divestiture program and
performance of project consultants.
VII. Performance Indicators
24.   Performance Indicators are summarized below, details are given in Annex 1, Table 3.
a) Revenue collection         Increase in domestic revenues from 7.4
percent of GDP in 1994 to 11.5 percent of
GDP in 1998.
b) Rationalization of expenditures  Streamlined procedures; better allocation
of resources to priority sectors (increase
from 48 percent in 1994 to 62 percent of
total expenditures in 1998). Fully
satisfactory PIP process in 1996 leading to
enhanced donor coordination; and a
roundtable meeting in 1996.
c) Economic Policy Formulation   Timely implementation of the economic
reform program supported by the SAC.
Improved availability of reliable
macroeconomic data.
d) Divestiture                Restructuring, privatization or liquidation
of about twelve PEs.
e) Civil Service Reform       Streamlined civil service with a clear
focus on core public sector functions and
modernized and criteria based personnel
management.
Section C: Procurement Disbursements, Accounting and Auditing
I. Procurement
25.   Table 2 below summarizes the project elements by category, estimated costs and
proposed procurement methods. Chad's procurement practices allow IDA procedures to take
precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations. A note on procurement, discussed
during negotiations, will draw the attention of the executing agencies to the following measures
required for ICB such as: (a) refraining from using restricted lists of suppliers and contractors;
(b) leaving the choice of insurance company to the suppliers or contractors; (c) ensuring
sufficient advertising; and (d) discontinuing the use of the double-envelope system for
submission of bids.
26.   Civil Works. The only civil works financed by the project would be office renovation
for units in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Plan. These civil works contracts, each
estimated to cost less than US$500,000 and aggregated to US$0.65 million, would be procured



9
through national competitive bidding (NCB), in accordance with Bank Guidelines for
procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits (January 1995). The following procedures
would be applied for NCB: (i) tenders would be advertised locally; (ii) bidders would be given a
minimum of 30 days for submitting bids; (iii) evaluation criteria would be specified in precise
quantitative/monetary terms; (iv) all bids would be opened in public, with bidders representatives
permitted to attend; (v) eligible foreign contractors would be allowed to participate in the
bidding; and (vi) the contract would be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.

27.   Goods. Goods financed by IDA (totaling US$1.84 Million), including office equipment,
supplies and vehicles, would be grouped into packages of at least US$150,000 each and procured
through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD loans and
IDA credits (January 1995). Standard bidding documents developed by the Bank would be used.
A preferential margin of 15 percent, or the applicable customs duty, whichever is less, over the
c.i.f. prices of competing goods for all ICB procurement would be given to domestic firms, if
any. Office equipment that cannot be grouped into packages of at least US$150,000 would be
procured through NCB under procedures acceptable to IDA, provided that the aggregate amount
of such procurement does not exceed US$0.40 million. Procurement of small items for office
supplies which are available off-the-shelf and cannot be grouped into bid packages of at least
US$30,000, will be done on the basis of international and national shopping, based upon price
quotations obtained from at least three eligible suppliers, provided that the aggregate amount of
such procurement does not exceed US$0.31 million (0.21 international, 0.1 national shopping).
28.   Consultant Services and Training.  International and local consultants' services
financed by IDA (US$4.24 million equivalent) and training (US$2.57 million) as described in
Annex 1, Table 2, 4 and 5, would be contracted in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for



10
the Use of Consultants (August 1981). The standard Letter of Invitation (LOI) and forms of
contract for appointment of consultants as developed by the Bank would be used. Studies are
primarily related to the civil service component and, the divestiture program. Consulting
services for ad-hoc technical advisory would include: (i) 65 man-months for public finance
management, accounting and auditing (ii) 55 man-months for economic management investment
planning and statistics. Training would include external assistance for the organization of local
seminars, in-site training and limited outside training programs for selected staff at managerial
levels and technical workshops including travel allowances and rent related to the preparation
and the holding of donors meetings.
29.   EDI would be involved in the training program as needed. The proposed training plan,
which was agreed with the government during negotiations, is conceived as a program of
activities and as a series of reinforcing actions aimed at long-term development. It is therefore
proposed that it takes place over a two-to-three year period.
A summary of the program's basic principles is as follows:
*  A series of training activities focusing on long-term development.
*  Demand-driven, to respond to the needs and concerns expressed by nationals, and using local
organizers and consultants whenever possible.
*  Aimed at sharing ideas and experiences, disseminating information and best practices and
facilitating dialogue within the country, and with the Bank; at enlarging the group of
stakeholders consulted in the course of project preparation and implementation; and at
enhancing specific capabilities within the government.
*  Focusing on the interlinkages of some key constraints to development: policy environment,
local capacity, infrastructure and institutional support systems.
30.   Procurement status of ongoing projects. A Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR) was completed in August 1993. In general, Chad's current procurement laws and
regulations do not conflict with IDA guidelines. The disbursement lag under certain ongoing
IDA-funded projects in Chad is partly the result of insufficient procurement skills and poor
planning. The capacity of implementing agencies to plan and closely supervise IDA-financed
procurement has been a major constraint on the timely execution of project activities. However,
during the last few years, due to closer supervision, substantial improvements have been
observed.
31.   Procurement arrangements under the proposed project. For the proposed project a
number of activities are planned in order to establish local capacity in the area of project,
coordination and implementation:
a)    A national project coordinator has been recruited under the previous project based
on his experience in project management and procurement. His assignment has been
confirmed during negotiations.
b)    A detailed processing schedule for goods and services to be procured under the
project was discussed at the time of appraisal, and reviewed during negotiations. During



11
implementation, all bid evaluation reports transmitted to IDA for review would contain
an updated copy of the implementation schedule and a Form 384.
c)    During negotiations, standard procurements processing timetable for key
procurement activities have been agreed upon with the borrower.
32.   The project coordinating team would be responsible for procurement. It would have
access to support from independent procurement specialists (consultants), as required (estimated
at two man-months per year during the first two years of the project and one man-month during
the rest of the project). During negotiations bid documents for early project start up were
reviewed and found acceptable.
33.   Recording of Procurement Information. Procurement information would be collected
and recorded as follows:
a)    prompt reporting of contract information by the Borrower;
b)    comprehensive semi-annual reports to IDA by the Borrower, indicating: (i) cost
estimates for individual contracts and semi-annual revisions for the total project; (ii)
revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award,
and completion time for individual contracts; (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on
specified methods of procurement; and (iv) reports to include consultant's performance
evaluations; and
c)    during supervision missions, a detailed statement of all procurement undertaken to
date, together with a forecast of anticipated procurement to be undertaken in the coming
six months, with estimated costs.
34.   Review by IDA. IDA-financed contracts for goods and works above a threshold of
US$100,000 equivalent each would be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. The review
process would cover about 80 percent of the total value of the amount contracted for goods
financed by IDA. Selective post-review of awarded contracts below the threshold levels would
apply to about one in three goods contracts. In the case of consultants, prior review by IDA
would be required for all consultancy contracts for individuals above US$50,000 and for firms
above US$100,000. However, below these thresholds, this exception to prior review would not
apply to the terms of reference for such contracts, single source hiring of firms, assignments of
critical nature as determined by IDA, and to amendments of contracts raising the contract value
to US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000 equivalent for individuals, respectively.
35.   During negotiations, agreement has been reached on procurement monitoring, as well as
the use of Bank standard bidding documents for ICB and standard procurement documents for
NCB. At negotiations, the Government provided IDA: (a) an updated procurement plan; (b) a
draft ICB bidding document for goods based on the Bank's SBD; and (c) draft letter of invitation
for consultant services.



12
36.   Before agreeing to any material modifications or waiver of the terms and conditions of a
contract that would increase its cost by more than 10 percent of the original price (10 percent
would be specified for the purpose of paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to be Bank Group's
Guidelines), the Borrower should specify the reasons thereof and seek IDA's non objection to the
proposed modifications.
II. Disbursements
37.   The amount to be disbursed from the credit per category is detailed in Table 4 below.
The percentage of expenditures to be financed is 100 percent of the cost net of taxes and duties
for consultants' services, training and seminars and goods.

38.   To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account in US dollars will be established and
maintained in US dollars in a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The
Special Account will have an authorized allocation of US$750,000 representing three months
average project expenditure. Upon effectiveness, an authorized allocation of US$500,000 will be
deposited in the Special Account. The remainder will be made available as needed.
Disbursements will be made against standard Bank documentation, except for contracts of less
than US$50,000 for consultants and goods, for which certified SOEs will be used.
Replenishment applications should be submitted monthly and must be fully documented except
for contracts of less than US$50,000 which may be claimed on the basis of Statement of
Expenditures (SOEs). All supporting documents will be retained for review during regular



13
supervision missions and with the external auditors. An advance under the Project Preparation
Facility in the amount of US$1,450,000 will be reimbursed upon Credit Effectiveness.
III. Accounting and Auditing
Accounting
39.   The Coordinating Unit will maintain records and accounts adequate to reflect, in
accordance with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources and expenditures in
respect of the project. Accounting procedures are defined in a manual prepared by the unit to be
part of the Project implementation plan and agreed under GEF. Records and accounts under the
ongoing GEF were proved satisfactory. During negotiations, the borrower agreed to maintain the
existing accounting system.
Auditing
40.   The signature of a three-year contract with the project auditors is a condition of credit
effectiveness. During negotiations, the Borrower agreed to:
a) have the records and accounts referred to in the preceding paragraph for each fiscal
year audited in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA.
b) furnish to IDA as soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the
end of each fiscal year, a certified copy of the report of such audit by said auditors, of
such scope and in such detail as IDA shall reasonably request;
c) furnish to IDA such other information concerning said records and accounts and the
audit thereof as IDA shall from time to time reasonably request; and
d) without any limitation to the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) above, have the
records and accounts of the Special Account audited in accordance with paragraphs (a)
through (c) above: (i) every four months during the first twelve months after the Effective
Date; and (ii) every six months during the second twelve months after the Effective Date;
and furnish such audits to IDA at the latest within two months following the end of the
period audited.
41.   For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Credit Account were
made on the basis of statements of expenditure, the Bc1 rower shall:
a) maintain or cause to be maintained, in accordance with para 39, records and accounts
reflecting such expenditures;
b) retain until at least one year after IDA has received the audit report for the fiscal year
in which the last withdrawal from the Credit Account or payment out of the Special



14
Account was made, all records (contracts, orders, invoices, bills, receipts and other
documents) evidencing such expenditures;
c) enable IDA's representatives to examine such records; and
d) have the records and accounts of the statements of expenditures audited in accordance
with para 40 above and ensure that the report of such audits contains a separate opinion
by said auditors as to whether the statements of expenditures submitted during the period
preceding such audit, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their
preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals.
