INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF MAURITIUS FOR A SECOND
DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) with the guarantee of Mauritius
for the equivalent of US$5.0 million to help finance a second development fi-
nance company project. The loan would bear interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annum, and the repayment schedule would be an aggregate of the amortization
schedules of sub-loans and of the fixed schedules of repayment by DBM of loan
funds used to finance equity investments.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report, "Mauritius - 4-Year Development Plan - an Assessment"
(AE-30a) in three volumes, was circulated on November 2, 1972 (R72-240).
A Memorandum on Recent Economic Developments and Prospects (268a - MAS) was
circulated to the Executive Directors on March 13, 1974. Country data are
provided in Annex I. Annex I also contains a brief description of the economy
as presented in paragraphs 3 through 12 of my Report and Recommendations to
the Executive Directors on a Port Project (P-1374-MAS) dated March 21, 1974.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
3.        The Bank made a loan of US$7 million to Mauritius in 1963 for a
power project, before the island gained independence in 1968. This loan,
guaranteed by the United Kingdom, has been fully disbursed. Since indepen-
dence, four IDA credits totalling US$16.7 million have been made, one in April
1971 for agriculture (US$5.2 million - Tea Development Authority), two for
industrial development in June 1972 (US$3.5 million - Development Bank of
Mauritius) and in June 1973 (US$4.0 million - Industrial Estates), and one for
rural development in July 1973 (US$4.0 million). A Bank loan of $10.0 million
to-help finance the improvement of Port Louis was approved by the Executive
Directors on April 2, 1974. IFC made a loan of US$600,000 in June 1971 for
the construction of two beach hotels. Annex II contains a summary statement
of the first Bank loan, the IDA credits and IFC investments, as of February 28,
1974, as well as notes on the execution of the ongoing projects. Except for
the tea project, which is facing certain problems, described in greater detail
in Annex II, project execution has been excellent.
4.        Given Mauritius' favourable growth potential and balance of payments
prospects, we believe that Mauritius is now creditworthy for a limited amount



- 2 -
of Bank lending and are, therefore, recommending that the proposed project
be financed with Bank funds. In the next few years, we intend to continue
making a moderate amount of Bank funds available, the volume of which would,
of course, be subject to continued review of the economic situation and out-
look. However, Mauritius will continue to require external financing on
concessionary terms and the lending program envisages a blend of Bank and
IDA assistance. By 1985, the Bank Group share in debt and debt service is
expected to increase to about 25 percent as compared to about 20 percent
in 1972.
5.        The program for Bank Group lending reflects the priorities of the
Government in promoting economic diversification and creating employment
outside sugar. The proposed project would be the third Bank Group lending
operation with DBM (including the Coromandel Industrial Estate Project). Its
primary objective would be to promote industrial development and the growth
of exports. Further projects currently under preparation would be designed
to expand infrastructure facilities, such as water supply and sewerage, in
order to alleviate what would otherwise soon become serious constraints to
future industrial growth, and to assist Mauritius in the development of educa-
tion and training. Continuing assistance is also expected to be provided for
agriculture, possibly along the lines of the recent rural development project.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL, TOURISM AND FINANCIAL SECTORS
6.        Mauritian industry is still dominated by sugar processing.    Value
added by non-sugar manufacturing in 1972 amounted to 10 percent of GDP, and
employment in non-sugar manufacturing was an estimated 20,600 or 10 percent
of total employment. Until recently, most of the non-sugar manufacturing
output came from industries catering to the domestic market, primarily food
and beverage, construction materials and printing. Because of the small size
of the domestic market, import substitution has limited potential and such
possibilities have been substantially exhausted. The major scope for indus-
trialization now lies in the transformation of imported raw materials and
intermediate products for export markets. The dexterity and high quality of
the Mauritian labor force and its low cost compared with competing countries
is a considerable asset, particularly for industries where labor cost consti-
tutes a large percentage of value added, such as manufacture of office machin-
ery, transistors, textiles, clothing, footwear and toys, and manufacture or
assembly of components under sub-contracts. Such goods should preferably
have a high value in relation to volume since transport costs will be
significant.
7.        Up to 1970, the Government's main means of stimulating industrial
development consisted of granting Development Certificates which offered
certain advantages to entrepreneurs, for projects in a selected group con-
sisting primarily of import-substitution type industries. The main emphasis
in the current Development Plan (1971-1975), particularly in the strategy



- 3 -
of employment creation, is to encourage export processing industries. A
scheme specifically aimed at stimulating investment in this field was put
into effect in December, 1970 when the Export Processing Act was approved,
Under it, companies producing for export markets were offered incentives
including subsidized power and water rates, tax holidays on dividends and
retained earnings, exemption from import duties on raw materials and capital
goods, and guaranteed foreign exchange for raw material imports and for
repatriating profits and capital. As part of its industrial policy, the
Government reviews companies requesting this special status to ensure that
their labor intensity is appropriate to the country's employment creation
objectives.
8.        In addition, the Government has sought to accelerate the pace of
industrialization through a program to develop industrial estates. The
first major estate, developed and administered by DBM, is nearing completion
and is partly occupied. A second scheme, assisted by an IDA credit in July
1973 is being constructed. Additional areas have been earmarked for this
purpose, including 200 acres near the harbor of Port Louis that are presently
being reclaimed.
9.        Associate membership in the European Economic Community became
effective on June 1, 1973 and Mauritius based industry is looking forward
to easier access to that major market area. Australia has conceded preferen-
tial tariff rates on certain Mauritian products and exports to that country,
as well as to South Africa, are growing. Long-range prospects for export
growth are good.
10.       From 1971 to August 1973, the Government approved a total of 65
Export Processing applications. Since only about a third of the companies
with approved application have begun to operate, increased activity in the
sector has not yet been fully reflected in output and employment. Industrial
investment, however, increased to Rs 36 million in 1972, compared to an
average of Rs 15 million for 1967 to 1970, and by March 1973, 3,300 new jobs
had been created by export processing industries alone and pending projects
were estimated to require over 20,000 additional employees. The Export Pro-
cessing applications approved so far include mostly textile projects, but
also several schemes in food and beverages, jewelry, electrical and elec-
tronic goods, and toys.
11.       Because of the size of Mauritius, there is a danger of misalloca-
tion of scarce land resources. The high population density requires careful
and comprehensive land use planning to ensure that industrial development
takes place in the most suitable areas and that the supporting infrastructure
is provided in a coordinated manner.   The Government, which has already
initiated the preparation of a land use plan, has agreed to complete it by
September 30, 1974 and thereafter to ensure its implementation. (See paragraph
3.03 of Guarantee Agreement).

The Tourism Sector
12.       Mauritius has a distinct attractions for tourism; it has unspoiled
white sand beaches, coral reefs and lagoons and subtropical temperatures with
long daily periods of sunshine on the coast. The target is to raise the
contribution of tourism to GDP from the less than 1 percent in the 1967-69
period to above 3 percent by 1980.
13.       Tourism in Mauritius has increased since 1969 beyond all expec-
tations.  Visitor arrivals have increased by an average of 33 percent a year
since 1969, reaching 49,000 in 1972; 50,000 tourists were expected by 1975,
a figure that was substantially exceeded in 1973. The 900 hotel rooms and
bungalows in Mlauritius were estimated to have a 90 percent occupancy rate in
1972, resulting in an average return on fixed assets for the hotel industry
of about 24 percent. The largest increase in arrivals has been visitors
from South Africa, the Indian Ocean area, Europe and Australia, due in part
to an increase in the number of airlines serving the country, and to the
introduction of special promotional air fares. Nine new hotels are expected
to be built to Mauritius by 1975, which would increase available rooms to
1,700. Future growth may of course be adversely affected by the
impact of the increase in petroleum prices on the cost of air travel.
The Financial Sector
14.       Mauritius has a well developed commercial banking sector.     There
are seven commercial banks in Mauritius; the Mauritius Commercial Bank accounts
for half of all banking business and Barclays for about another quarter. In
June 1973, a new State Commercial Bank was established with Rs 2.5 million
in share capital, of which 80 percent was contributed by the Government and
20 percent by DBM; it is expected to make working capital loans to "neglected"
sectors of the economy, mainly small-scale industry and agriculture. The
Mauritius Commercial Bank is the only other bank incorporated and owned
locally; the other five are branches of overseas banks. All commercial banks
extend term loans to industry, usually up to seven years. However, the amount
of term financing provided by them has been small in comparison to that pro-
vided by DBM.
15.       The Central Bank discount rate is 6 percent while the prime rate
for commercial lending is 7 - 8.5 percent depending on the duration of the
credit. According to current legislation, the maximum interest rate on secured
loans above Rs. 6,000 is 9 percent. On unsecured loans, the interest rate
can be as high as 36 percent. In view of the recent price increases, the
liquidity of the commercial banks has fallen somewhat and there are pressures
for higher interest rates. The Government and DBM have already agreed to
raise DBM's lending rates from 8.5 to 9.5 percent.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
16.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Development Bank of Mauritius"
(No.319a-MAS dated April 4, 197h) is being circulated separately. A Loan and
Project Summary is provided at Annex III. Negotiations for the proposed
loan were held in Washington in February, 1974. The Mauritius delegation
was headed by Mr. R. Pyndiah (Financial Secretary) and included Mr. D. V.
Narasimhan (Managing Director of DBM).
17.       The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange component of
DBM's investments in industrial and tourism projects, during the two-year
period up to mid-1976, except for US$0.6 million which would be used by DBM
for industrial estates, primarily at Plaine Lauzun.
History and Objectives of DBM
18.       DBM was established in 1964 as a statutory body to finance the
development of industry and tourism as well as the diversification of agri-
culture - it is the successor to the Mauritius Agricultural Bank whose
assets and liabilities it took over. DBM was reorganized in 1970 with
assistance from the Bank Group. It was endowed with share capital, the
Board was strengthened, and policies and procedures were improved. DBM
received an IDA credit of US$3.5 million in 1972 and in 1973 a US$4.0 million
IDA credit for development of an industrial estate at Coromandel.
19.       DBM is the only significant institutional source of financing for
industrial and tourism projects requiring terms longer than seven years. As
investment grows and the demand for long-term finance expands, DBM has the
potential of becoming an increasingly important institution in the economy.
Through direct financing and its industrial estates program, DBEM has assisted
75 percent of the companies with Export Processing Zone Certificates, and 55
percent of the companies with Development Certificates. In FY72, DBM's dis-
bursements to industry, services and tourism represented 12 percent of gross
fixed capital formation in industry. Partly because of lending limits on
individual investments, DBM and commercial banks have undertaken joint financ-
ing of projects.
Board of Directors
20.       DBM's board consists of twelve Directors including representatives
of the Ministries of Finance, and Commerce and Industry and the Bank of
Mauritius, seven private businessmen and DBM's General Manager. Board members
are all chosen by Government. The current chairman is Mr. R. Pyndiah, Mauri-
tius' Financial Secretary. The Board, which must approve all investments,
meets twice a month.



-6-
Management and Staff
21.       The present Managing Director, Mr. D. V. Narasimham is a competent
and experienced banker who joined the company in 1971 on the recommendation
of the Bank Group after six years as Chief Executive of the Madras Indust-
rial Investment Corporation in India. His contract expires in May 1974, but
it is expected that he will stay on until a replacement has been found. DBM
is actively searching for a replacement with assistance from the Bank. DBM's
staff consists of 18 professionals and 29 non-professionals, including an
investment officer seconded from the Industrial Credit and Investment Corpora-
tion of India. Five new investment officers were recruited during 1973, who
will be trained in project analysis. There is a need for additional expertise
in accounting and recruitment of qualified staff is expected shortly.
Resources of DBM
22.       The share capital of DBM amounts to Rs 10 million, of which 80
percent is owned by the Government and 20 percent by the Bank of Mauritius.
Retained earnings amounted to Rs 12.5 million as of June 30, 1973, bringing
DBM's total equity to Rs 22.5 million. Investments in local currency for
the Industrial Estates project of Coromandel, amounting to about Rs 21 mil-
lion, will be financed from FY1976 to FY1979 by increases in subscription
of DBM's share capital by the Government. DBM's long-term liabilities as
of June 30, 1973 amounted to Rs 44.6 million, of which Rs 18.0 million were
in the form of bonds issued by the Mauritius Agricultural Bank and assumed
by DBM, and Rs 26.6 million in the form of long-term Government loans. An
IDA credit of US$3.5 million, Credit 313 MAS of June 23, 1972, was, except
for US$0.1 million, relent to DBM and provided US$3.0 million for the foreign
exchange component of loans to and equity investments in industry and tourism;
US$0.4 million for construction of industrial estates and US$0.1 million in
the form of a grant for a feasibility study of future industrial estates. The
balance of this credit is expected to be fully committed by June 30, 1974.
DBM accepts savings deposits from the public, and pays the same interest
rate, between 4 and 6 percent depending on the terms, on deposits as commercial
banks; deposits were Rs 5.8 million at the end of FY1973.
Policies and Operations
23.       DBM's Statement of General Policies includes adequate guidelines
to be followed by DBM in its equity and loan investments, and in its rela-
tions with the enterprises financed.   The quality of DBM's appraisal work
has been generally satisfactory, but steps are being taken to improve economic
analysis and to give greater attention to management and marketing arrange-
ments for projects.
24.       DBM has experienced delays in signing loan contracts, partly as a
result of relatively complex legal procedures customarily applied in Mauri-
tius. DBM has recently taken measures to alleviate this problem and has also,
a few months ago, introduced a commitment fee which comes into effect six
months after approval of the loan by DBM's Board.



25.       Approval of projects in all categories increased significantly
during FY1973. Loan and equity approvals (net of cancellations) increased
by 40 percent to Rs 22 million, compared to Rs 9 million in FY1972.    in
addition, Rs 43 million was approved for the Coromandel Industrial Estate
project. Total commitments (excluding Coromandel) were Rs 11 million compared
to Rs 8 million in FY1972, and disbursements were Rs 14 million in FY1972.
26.       Both the number and average size of loans to industry increased
from FY1972 to FY1973. Hotels and textile projects have been the main sectors
of DBM's activity, representing respectively 56 percent and 31 percent of
FY1973 approvals. In FY1973 DBMl approved Rs 732,000 for 122 small scale
industrial projects, compared to Rs 493,000 for 77 projects in FY1972. DBM
approved 78 agricultural loans for Rs 1.6 million in FY 1973 compared to
Rs 700,000 in FY1972 and about two thirds of FY1972 approvals were loans of
Rs 5,000 or less to owners of ten arpents of land or less. DBM has also
been highly successful in its program of constructing and leasing buildings
suitable for industrial enterprises.
Financial Condition
27.       As of June 30, 1973, about one fifth of DBM's loans, representing
$1.9 million or 8.5 percent of total outstanding loans were more than three
months in arrears. About half of these, however, do not imply serious risks
for DBM and partly reflect a lack of adequate follow-up. Various measures
to bring about improvements are being introduced by DBM. In addition, DBM's
Board has set up a special committee to investigate loans in difficulty.
Despite these arrears, DBM's financial condition is satisfactory. Provisions
at four percent of the total loan and equity portfolio are adequate to cover
probable losses. The term debt/equity ratio is low at 1.8/1.
DBM's Lending Terms
28.       Currently, DBM's interest rate on loans for medium and large scale
industry and tourism is 8.5 percent, at which level it has been maintained
since November 1971 when the rate was raised from 6.5 percent. The Government
and DBM have agreed to increase the rate to 9.5 percent. This is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (Section 8.01 of Loan Agreement).
29.       DBM, under its Statement of General Policy, cannot accept any
exchange risk in respect of borrowing repayable in foreign currencies. Under
IDA credit MAS-313 the Government, as the borrower, assumed the exchange risk
which was not passed on to the sub-borrowers. Under the proposed loan, the
foreign exchange risk will be borne by DBM's sub-borrowers.
Forecast and Resources Requirements
30.       DBM expects to approve about Rs 14 million of industrial loans
during FY1974 and approvals are expected to grow by about Rs 1 million (7 per-
cent) annually thereafter. Annual approvals of equity investments are



- 8 -
expected to be maintained at Rs 1.5 million, about half the abnormally high
level reached in FY1973. Investments in small-scale industry and agriculture
are expected to show moderate increases in the future.
31.       Future foreign exchange requirements for industrial and tourism
development are expected to continue to represent about 70 percent of DBM's
operations. The company's foreign exchange requirements for industrial loans
after commitment of the proceeds of IDA Credit 313 M4AS, expected by June 1974,
are expected to be about US$4.4 million through FY1976 in addition to about
US$600,000 in foreign exchange for industrial estates. A US$5 million Bank
loan would therefore cover DBM's foreign exchange requirements through June
1976.
Terms of Bank Loan
32.       The amortization schedule of the loan would be the aggregate of the
amortization schedules of sub-loans and of the fixed schedules of repayment
by DBM to the Bank for loan funds to finance equity investments (including
industrial estates). Repayment schedules will be limited to a maximum of
twenty years for equity investments (schedules suitable to the individual
investments will be agreed upon with DBM in each case) and for sub-loans
for projects in tourism, and to a maximum of fifteen years for sub-loans for
industrial projects.
33.       Under the previous IDA credit to DBM, projects over US$50,000 up
to an aggregate of US$750,000 were sent to the Bank for approval. Under the
proposed loan the free limit would be increased to US$150,000 and the aggregate
free limit to US$1 million. Taking this limit into account, it is expected
that DBM will have to seek Bank approval for about 80 percent of the financ-
ing to be provided with the assistance of the loan.
Disbursements
34.       The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange component of
DBM's investments in industry and tourism, which would include 100 percent
of the CIF cost of direct imports, 75 percent of the invoiced price of goods
previously imported through normal trade channels, 50 percent of the invoiced
price of goods produced in Mauritius to a substantial extent from imported
inputs, and 45 percent of construction costs of industrial buildings and
hotels. These percentages represent the estimated foreign component of these
categories of investment goods.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
35.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and DBM, the draft Guaran-
tee Agreement between Mauritius and the Bank, the recommendations of the Com-
mittee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Bank and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 9 -
36.       The additional condition of effectiveness    described in paragraph 28
is reflected in Section 8.01 of the Loan Agreement.
37.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
VI. RECOMFIENDATION
38.       In formulating the proposal, it has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However,
available information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully jus-
tified.
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

THE ECONOMY
(Excerpt from Report P-1374-MAS of March 21, 1974)
3.        Mauritius is a small island, densely populated and heavily dependent
on one crop:  sugar.   For decades, it was considered a typical case of the
vicious circle of underdevelopment: population pressure on land was asso-
ciated with a stagnation of investment and output; the very limited size of
the national market seemed to prevent the establishment of domesti.c indus-
tries; the vagaries of weather, and the generally unfavorable outlook for
sugar demand at that time, inhibited attempts at increasing production and
reducing unemployment.
4.        The present outlook is much more encouraging, and Mauritius may
soon be viewed as a case of a rapidly developing country which capitalizes
on the availability of cheap labor. After two decades of stagnation, Mauri-
tius is experiencing rapid economic growth. Family planning programs have
been a major success, and the rate of population growth declined to 1.8 per-
cent in 1972. The Government's effort to create new production and employment
opportunities through the development of export based, labor intensive indus-
tries and tourism has achieved an impressive beginning. Sugar prices have
improved, and prospects for future development are favorable. During 1970-72,
real GDP grew by an annual average of 6 percent, while national income grew by
6.4 percent and 12.5 percent in 1971 and 1972 respectively. Thle number
employed went up about 15,000 in the last three years, mostly in the industry
and tourism, and the rate of investment rose from 16 percent in 1969 to 19
percent in 1972. Though the economy is still heavily dependent on sugar,
manufacturing and services (including tourism) increased output at a rate
of 9 percent per annum, thus contributing close to 30 percent of GDP growth
in this period.
5.        In December 1971, the Government adopted a four-year plan (1971 to
1975) for social and economic development. The principal objectives as stated
in the plan and modified since are: further development of the sugar industry,
diversification of the economy to create substantial employment, particularly
in export oriented, labor intensive industry and tourism, and the improvement
of training and education, and family planning services. The plan aims at a
GDP growth rate of 7 percent per year and an increase in the rate of invest-
ment to 27 percent in 1975. This program is well conceived and addresses
itself to the basic production and employment problems faced by the Mauritian
economy; the Government's performance in pursuing those objectives has been
impressive.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
6.        The diversification of the economy is a primary objective of
Mauritius, both within agriculture and in creation of other industrial
activities. Sugar still accounts for about 30 percent of national income
and over 90 percent of commodity exports. However, though output increased
substantially in 1972 and 1973, and export prices rose by 40 percent, all
activities related to sugar contributed only about 25 percent to the growth
of real GDP in the last three years; the dependence of the economy on sugar
is thus being progressively - though slowly - reduced. Future prospects
for diversification within agriculture include the development of groundnuts,
vegetables and traditional crops like ginger, and a livestock industry based
on sugar cane by-products. Outside agriculture, immediate possibilities for
diversification are in manufacturing and tourism.
7.        Absorptive capacity and availability of financial resources are
both possible constraints to economic development. However, the steps taken
by the Mauritians in establishing new institutions and improving existing
developmental institutions, such as a planning office and a development bank,
in mobilizing external technical assistance and in training Mauritians, would
indicate that absorptive capacity is not likely to be a serious impediment
to growth. Other constraints, particularly financial constraints, might
operate before absorptive capacity comes into play.
8.        Hitherto, development has been financed mostly from domestic
resources and in this regard both domestic policies and the improvement in
the international sugar price have made effective contributions. In 1972,
the domestic savings rate was 22 percent as compared to the investment rate
of 19 percent. This rate of savings was made possible because (a) the salary
structure of civil servants was frozen from 1968 to 1971, thus permitting
some Government savings; (b) wages in the sugar sector did not follow the
improvement in sugar prices; (c) price stability encouraged private saving.
9.        There has in recent months been pressure on the public and private
sectors to distribute the gains of economic improvement more equitably.
Partly as a measure to retain and attract skilled and qualified people to
Government and partly as a redistributive measure, public sector salaries
were increased on the average by 30 percent in 1973. There has been a similar
increase in wages in the private sector. Though some increases in wages were
justified, the magnitude was such that inflationary pressure resulted. Con-
sumer prices rose by 18 percent between October 1972 and October 1973, and
merchandise imports increased by about 30 percent. The current account of the
balance of payments showed no surplus in 1973, as compared to a surplus of
about US$15.0 million in 1972. The Government has taken a number of anti-
inflationary measures to restrict the level of aggregate demand. New taxes
have been introduced, adding about 10 percent to Government current revenues,
and credit restrictions have been imposed.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
10.       The question of income distribution will remain central in the
future. The recent economic expansion has been accompanied by a relativL.
deterioration in the share of wages and salaries in national income. They
accounted for 53 percent of GNP in 1972 as compared to 59 percent in 1968.
It is, however, almost inevitable in the early phases of a sharp upswing in
the price of sugar, in an economy so heavily dependent on this commodity,
that the share of wages and salaries in the national income should experience
a decline. The distribution of investments and the Government's fiscal poli-
cies will play a crucial role. Insofar as future investments emphasize the
creation of new job opportunities, the income distribution situation should
improve. However, Mauritius, along with many other developing countries, has
features in its economic policy which discriminate in favor of capital inten-
sive techniques, including low interest rates, favorable depreciation .;ules
and generous tax exemptions. Future economic policy will need not only to
focus on continued high rates of domestic savings to finance investments to
benefit a large number of people, but also to correct some of the biases
which favor capital intensity.
11.       The contribution of capital inflows in supplementing the domestic
savings effort has been modest. Over the four years since Independence
(1969-72), annual gross public capital inflow averaged US$3.8 million, of
which US$1.7 million was in grant form and US$2.1 million in loans. In
1969-70 and 1970-71, Mauritius also made use of about US$2.7 million of SDRs
each year. The U.K. has provided over 91 percent of grant funds aLnd 84 per-
cent of the loans. The U.S., Australia, the European Economic Co.nmunity
and the World Food Program have been the other contributors of grant aid,
principally in the form of food, while IDA has been the source of the remain-
ing 16 percent of loans. In addition, there has been a recorded annual
private capital inflow averaging US$1.2 million over the same four-year period.
There are indications, however, that until quite recently there was in fact
a net outflow of private capital, not recorded in the balance of payments
figures. In future there will be a substantial need for external assistance
if Mauritius is to ensure long-term social and economic development through
the intended step-up in investment levels.
12.       Official foreign exchange reserves went up from US$13 million to
US$67 million between the end of 1967 and the end of 1973. This is equiva-
lent to about 6 months of imports. Recent petroleum price icnreases are
expected to add about US$9 million per year to the import bill, but with the
expected capital inflow and good prospects for exports in the comingt years,
reserves should still rise despite the expected increase in imports required
for the investment program. At the end of 1972 external public debt was
US$29.7 million, of which the Bank Group share represented about 21.5 percent.
Service payments amounted to US$3.0 million (of which about one fifth was
to the Bank Group), equivalent to 2.1 percent of foreign exchange earninqgs
during the year. Given satisfactory economic performance and not unfavorable
developments in sugar prices, Mauritius should be able to serve a limited
amount of conventional borrowing without the debt burden exceeding manageable
limits.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 239-MAS - Mauritius Tea Development Authority Project: US$5.3 million
Credit of April 9, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977:
This project constitutes the second phase of Mauritius' tea develop-
ment program. Project field development is satisfactory, but the Mauritius
tea industry has experienced a number of problems. These result first from
the deteriorating world market prices which, combined with increases at
appraisal, and secondly from the reluctance of labor to work in the rather
isolated and damp tea growing area. The total area to be developed under
the project has been reduced from 5,000 to 3,000 acres: this in turn has
reduced the factory requirements during the project period. Despite this
reduction, project costs are estimated to be some 25 percent above appraisal
estimates. Although prospects for the next five years are somewhat brighter,
since Mauritius has succeeded in making arrangements to sell most of its tea
production, the Government has decided to undertake shortly a comprehensive
review of the future of the tea industry.
Credit 313-MAS - Development Bank of Mauritius Project; US$3.5 million Credit
of June 23, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1976:
As of February 28, 1974, projects amounting to US$1.9 million had
been approved. The balance is expected to be committed before June 30, 1974.
Credit 411-MAS - Industrial Estate Project; US$4.0 million Credit of June 29,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1980:
This credit became effective on October 1, 1973. Construction
work began in July 1973 and is proceeding ahead of schedule.
Credit 419-MAS - Rural Development Project; US$4.0 million Credit of July 9,
1973; Closing Date: February 29, 1976:
This credit became effective on October 11, 1973. Work began in
July 1973 and is progressing satisfactorily.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.
