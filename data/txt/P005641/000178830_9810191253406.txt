I.  INTRODUCTTON
1.01      The Government of Tunisia (the Government) has requested the Bank
to help finance a project which involves:  (a) rehabilitation and expansion
of the spinning and weaving facilities of Societe Industrielle des Textiles
(SITEX) located at Sousse and Ksar Hellal, 120 and 145 km south-east of
Tunis, the capital city (Map IBRD No. 15613); (b) minor investment in
debottlenecking and essential spares for Societe des Industries Textiles
Reunies (SITER), Societe Monastirienne des Textiles (SOMOTEX) and Societe de
Tissage de Moknine (TISS-MOK); and (c) technical assistance for SITEX,
SITER, SOMOTEX and TISSMOK as well as the holding company. SITEX, SITER,
SOMOTEX, TISSMOK and another operating company, SOPIC, are fully owned by
the holding company, Societe Generale des Industries Textiles (SOGITEX
Holding), and together form the only public sector company in Tunisia
engaged in the manufacturing of textiles.
1.02      The proposed Project includes both physical and Technical Assist-
ance components. In SITEX, it will expand and improve the quality of denim
1/ production for export, by: (a) reconditioning the spinning and winding
equipment and upgrading the service facilities at the spinning plant in
Sousse; (b) expanding and upgrading the existing weaving and denim finishing
facilities at the weaving plant in Ksar Hellal; and (c) upgrading the
company's financial management and accounting systems to meet the require-
ments of modern textile operations. Upon Project completion in 1983, total
annual yarn and finisVed denim production will reach 13,250 tons and 26 mil-
lion square meters (m ), respectively. Compared with 1980 this represents
an increase of about 50%.
1.03      In SITER, SOMOTEX and TISSMOK, the proposed physical investment
will be aimed at balancing the existing production facilities as well as
urgent overhauling of certain equipment to maintain productivity. The
proposed technical assistance program will: (a) upgrade SITER's, SOMOTEX's,
TISSMOK½s and SOGITEX Holding-s management and accounting systems, to meet
the requirements of modern operations; and (b) assess market potential,
strengthen marketing capabilities and prepare future investment plans for
SITER, SOMOTEX, and TISSMOK.
1.04      The total financing required for the proposed Project is estimated
at about TD 13.2 million (US$32.9 million equivalent) including TD 10.9
million (US$27.1 million) in foreign exchange. Besides the proposed Bank Loan
(US$18.6 million) a Swiss credit of US$4.5 million equivalent has been on-lent
to SITEX by the Government. The remainder (US$9.8 million) will be covered
by Government equity.
1.05      A feasibility study for the rehabilitation and modernization of the
SOGITEX Group was prepared by consultants (P-E International Operations Ltd.,
U.K.) with UNDP financing, in 1979/80. A mission to Tunisia in February 1980,
however, found that substantial modifications in the proposed project scope
and financial projections were required. A preappraisal mission, consisting of
Miss V. Bates and Messrs. H. Oteifa and A. Sandig of the Industrial Projects

Department visited Tunisia in May/June 1980 and discussed an alternative scope
with the Government and SOGITEX. Subsequent analysis revealed, however, that
in order not to overtax SOGITEX's implementation capabilities, it was essential
that the plans be carried out in two phases. The proposed Project represents
the first phase which was appraised by Miss Bates and Mr. Oteifa in November
1980.
1.06     The Bank has not so far been directly involved in the Tunisian tex-
tile subsector. Indirectly, several textile subprojects have been financed
by the Bank through the Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET),
which has used the proceeds of the Bank Loan No. 1504-TUN to extend loans to
five private textile companies. With a maximum amount of US$416,000, however,
these subloans shed little light on the subsector.
II. THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR AND THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY
A. Manufacturing Sector
2.01      In view of the country's high unemployment rate (about 13% in 1979)
and its relatively poor resource endowment, the Government chose manufacturing
to be the prime vehicle for economic development and employment creation as
early as 1969. Manufacturing became a leading sector in the Tunisian economy
because of its ability: (a) to generate employment (60,000 new jobs in
1973-76 and 74,000 in 1977-80); (b) to export (TD 370 million, or 40% of
commodity exports in 1980); and (c) to attract foreign investment (some 50
million Dinars during 1972-78, or 18% of manufacturing investment).
2.02      In the 1960s, the public sector played an important role in import
substitution, as the Government invested heavily (80% of total fixed capital
formation) in such capital intensive activities as construction materials,
chemicals and steel. However, because of their poor management and overstaff-
ing (for social reasons), these public enterprises were, and still are,
generally economically and financially inefficient.
2.03      During the 1970s public investments were oriented towards more
labor intensive activities. In addition, industrial development objectives
shifted to focus more on private investment and exports. As a result of
strong Government incentives, supplemented by protection against competition
from imports, growth in manufacturing accelerated from 6.4% p.a. in real terms
during the 1960s, to 11.5% during the 1970s. The economy as a whole grew at
the impressive real annual rate of 8% per capita during the seventies, and
industry-s share of GNP increased still further, from about 10% to roughly
12%, as a result. Private investment, encouraged by the incentives given by
the Government, increased (in the following 3-year periods) from TD 25.8
million during 1969-72, to TD 151.6 million during 1973-1976 and TD 235
million during 1977-80.
2.04      The above achievements are quite impressive in quantitative terms.
Structurally, however, the sector's performance was less satisfactory. First,
the relative growth of manufacturing exports did not take off as expected,



- 3 -
mainly because of faltering demand in the world markets for Tunisia's tradi-
tional exports (olive oil, textiles and chemicals), whilst export diversifica-
tion was constrained by the Government's pricing/protection policies, which
encouraged enterprises to concentrate on the local market. Second and most
importantly, productivity trends in manufacturing deteriorated after 1972.
In effect, value added per worker increased only marginally during 1973-77
(compared to the 12.4% p.a. increase observed between 1970 and 1972), and
the gain was not commensurate with the increase in the capital intensity of
the sector, such that the marginal productivity of capital declined. The
subsectors mainly responsible for the drop in overall industrial productivity
were generally in construction materials, food industries and chemicals,
dominated by Government-owned companies. Overall productivity was, however,
maintained in electromechanical industries, and productivity in private
Tunisian textile enterprises actually increased (during 1973-77) especially
in those with foreign participation. There are indications, however, that
this trend has also been on the decline since 1978, at least in entirely
locally owned textile companies.
2.05      To summarize, since the early seventies, the Tunisian manufacturing
sector, and the public segment in particular, has been characterized by:
(a) increasing capital intensity, weak management capabilities, and employment
creation beyond efficiency levels, resulting in deteriorating productivity;
(b) overinvestment in subsectors serving the domestic market in consumer goods
and intermediate components entering their fabrication; and (c) inadequate
capacity in, and incentives for, subsectors oriented towards exports and
some segments of the domestic capital goods market, where local production
could be efficient.
B. The Textile Industry
2.06      Tunisia first manufactured textiles on an industrial scale in 1961.
By 1979, the country was producing about 52% of its yarn and about 120% of its
domestic fabric consumption (Annex 2). Tunisia does not produce natural or
synthetic fibers, 1/ so almost all raw materials are imported.
2.07      The textile subsector has played an important part in the realiza-
tion of Tunisian development objectives because of its relatively low capital
intensity. During 1973-78, textiles generated about 40% of new jobs in manu-
facturing and accounted for about 30% of manufacturing exports, while absorbing
only 10% of new investment. Until its recent decentralization, there was only
one public sector textile company, SOGITEX, which in 1979 accounted for 47% of
the yarn and about 49% of the fabrics manufactured in Tunisia. However,
because the Company accounted for almost all Tunisian fabric exports, its
share of the domestic market was only 22%. SOGITEX is an integrated textile
operation which includes spinning, weaving, and finishing and, to a minor
extent, garment manufacturing. There are about 60 textile companies in the
private sector. About a dozen of the larger companies account for 20% of the
fabric production, and another 48 small enterprises for the remaining 31%.
Most of the small companies are engaged in the less capital intensive phases
of textile manufacturing--weaving and knitting. They therefore import most of

their yarn requirements, and have their fabrics finished, on a commission
basis, by SITER or one of the larger private companies.
2.08      In addition to the public and private sector companies, there is a
third subsector of so-called export-oriented enterprises (EOEs). These
foreign and locally owned companies have all been established in "Free Zones"
since 1973, under Law 72-38. These EOEs import capital goods, spare parts and
raw materials (yarn for knitwear and fabrics for garments) in bond, for
further processing in Tunisia prior to export. They are exempt from income
taxes for ten years, and subject to a reduced tax rate for a further ten
years.   Between 1973 and 1979, about 130 enterprises were established
under this Law. Most of their work force are females. Labor productivity
is about 70% of European standards, but since Tunisian wages are about 20%
of the average for Western Europe, the manufacture of garments and knitwear
is very labor intensive, and Tunisia is an associate member of the European
Economic Community (EEC), there is a net advantage to European manufacturers
of moving these industries to Tunisia. Until the end of 1977, Tunisian
textile exports to the EEC were both duty-free and without quotas or
ceilings. Since that time, quotas have been imposed as part of the latest
sequence of international Multi-Fiber Agreements. 1/
2.09      In 1979, all in all, there were 450 production units 2/ in Tunisia
owned by about 200 companies involved in manufacturing textiles. 3/ The
industry operated about 100,000 spindles (including 13,000 for wool), about
3,000 looms and 1,600 knitting machines. In addition, there were about 13,000
sewing machines operated by domestic garment manufacturers, and another
10,000 by EOEs.
2.10      In the seventies, textiles were the second largest contributors to
value added in manufacturing (after food processing), and led the sector in
exports and job creation. As shown below, during the five years following the
enactment, in 1973, of Law 72-38 on EOEs, the private sector textile industry
grew rapidly; employment increased by about 40,000, the volume of output
doubled, the value increased from TD 25.7 million to TD 180.4 million
(Annex 2), and exports increased from TD 19.2 million to TD 83.2 million (all
in current terms).

down by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), intended
to regulate Third World textile exports to developed countries.

2.11      As shown above, however, since the growth of the EOES levelled off
in 1976, textiles' share of new investments and hence exports, employment,
and value added, has been on the decline.
III. PROJECT SPONSOR: SOCIETE INDUSTRIELLE DES TEXTILES, SITEX
A. Organization and Management
3.01      Societe Industrielle des Textiles (SITEX), the Project sponsor, is
the largest subsidiary in the SOGITEX Group; SOGITEX is also the largest
textile group in Tunisia and the only one that is publicly owned. SOGITEX
was created in 1967, through the amalgamation of five existing plants, but in
January 1979, was reorganized into five separate entities, including four
operating companies: SITEX, SITER, SOMOTEX, SOPIC and a holding company--
SOGITEX Holding (The Holding). In January 1981, SITER's weaving facilities
were spun-off as a fifth subsidiary-TISSMOK. The Holding also owns a minority
share in each of two garment manufacturing companies: SOTUVES, making sports
outerwear, and SOLIFEM, making lingerie.
3.02      Like all SOGITEX's subsidiaries, SITEX operates as an independent
legal entity under the general supervision of the Holding. The Company's
(i.e., SITEX's) Board of Directors is appointed by the Holding, and consists
of eleven members: the Chairman, who is also the Company's General Director,
two directors of SOGITEX Holding, two representatives each of the Ministry
of Planning and Finance and the Ministry of National Economy, and one repre-
sentative of each of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Social Security
Fund and two banks. In addition to the Board of Directors, SITEX and the



- 6 -
other subsidiaries each have a steering committee responsible for the
implementation of Group policy. This is headed by the Company's Chairman
and includes its functional directors. SITEX's organizational structure is
shown in Annex 3-1:
B. Role of SOGITEX Holding
3.03      Although the restructuring of the SOGITEX Group in 1979 was intended
to give the subsidiaries a large degree of autonomy, in practice they were -
until the end of 1980 - still controlled by the Holding, which approved their
budgets and investments, and was responsible for marketing. Up to that time,
the Holding's main responsibilities were accordingly: (a) to formulate and
implement Group policy on such issues as: the markets to be sought and the
products and prices to be offered, long- and medium-term financing needs and
sources, employment and labor compensation, and technical development; (b) to
market the subsidiaries' products; (c) to scrutinize the subsidiaries' budgets
and to pass these to the Ministry of Industry for approval; and (d) to monitor
progress against budgets.
3.04      The Holding made little effort to explore market opportunities
and possible product development, or to adapt production and marketing methods
to improve volume and profitability. The subidiaries' production plans were
dictated by ad hoc orders received from the Holding, and sales were conducted
with little regard to the production costs of specific products. The Holding
received a flat fee of 5% on local sales and 1% on exports, irrespective of
the profitability to the subsidiaries of the transaction involved. As a
result the Holding's control over marketing and sales was a source of
continuing conflict with its subsidiaries. This was particularly true for
SITER (TISSMOK) and SOMOTEX. SITEX did not face the same problems, as
nearly all of its production is being exported under a long-term agreement
with Swift Textiles, S.A. 1/ (Swift) of Zug, Switzerland (para. 4.13). As
of January 1981, the Government, in an effort to complete the restructuring
of the SOGITEX Group, and to assure a higher degree of autonomy, transferred
all marketing and sales activities to the individual subsidiaries.
3.05      At the time of appraisal, the role of the Holding was being reviewed
by different Government agencies. Two alternatives were under consideration.
The first was to limit the responsibility of the Holding to the Group-s
overall planning, coordination and development. The second was for the
Holding to cease to exist as a holding company, and to become an agency within
the Ministry of Industry in charge of overall textile sector development
instead. The Government has now settled on the first alternative, and a new
chairman was appointed to the Holding in February 1981.
C. Production Facilities
3.06      SITEX is an integrated cotton spinning, weaving and finishing
operation geared to the production of denim and a small amount of pocket-
ing material, mainly for export to the EEC. It operates two plants, one in
1/   A subsidiary of Dominion Textiles Inc. of Canada.  SITEX-s denim sales
are managed by Swift, Paris; another subsidiary of Dominion, at Swift
Zug's request.

Sousse for spinning coarse yarns for denim production, and the other in Ksar
Hellal for weaving and finishing. In 1979, the production facilities included
32,000 ring spindles, 480 single shuttle looms and a complete range for denim
finishing. The Company employs about 870 workers at Sousse and 810 at Ksar
Hellal.
3.07      SITEX's facilities were not originally designed for the production
of denim which requires certain specialized equipment as compared to other
types of fabric. However, since 1973, and through several agreements with
Swift, these facilities have been gradually converted to permit denim produc-
tion as well. Additional equipment, including an indigo dyeing range, warping
and denim finishing machines were installed and, most important, operating
technical assistance was provided by Swift. The change to denim created
certain production imbalances, particularly in spinning. Moreover, the
quality of the weft yarn produced on the existing ring spindles, as well as
that of denim woven on the shuttle looms, was not adequate for export. That
is to say, a relatively high proportion of the denim produced was of the lower
Grades B and C; both of which are severely penalized, price-wise. SITEX's
current modernization program (para. 3.14) is aimed at overcoming some of
these difficulties.
3.08     2During 1980 the Company produced only 7,800 mt of yarn and 16.2
million m of finished fabric. This production was achieved at operating
efficiencies 1/ of about 60% in spinning and 70% in weaving. Unbalanced
production facilities, equipment needing replacement or modernization and
periodic shortages of raw materials, accessories and spare parts were the main
reasons for this low level of output. However, production in 1980 was a con-
siderable improvement (about 20%) over that achieved in 1979. The Company's
yarn and fabric production during recent years is shown below:
SITEX - Recent Production a/

a/   Production figures for preceding years (before 1978) are not shown,
as they would be misleading due to frequent movement of equipment among
SOGITEX's plants and significant changes in product mix.
3.09      There is no reason why further improvement could not be realized
with the current modernization plan and continued technical assistance by
Swift. Both the spinning and the weaving plant have preventive maintenance

programs, that are thoroughly prepared, and apparently satisfactorily imple-
mented by a well-trained staff. Standard production control systems also
appear to be working satisfactorily. Quality control procedures at Sousse and
Ksar Hellal are thorough, and the laboratories are well equipped with testing
instruments.
3.10      Labor productivity is very low compared with Western European
standards (about 25-30%). This is mainly because SITEX, like the rest of
the SOGITEX Group, is overstaffed. As a public company, it has been consis-
tently obliged by the Government to maintain a staff well in excess of its
needs, including a number who are physically disabled. Overstaffing, however,
is concentrated in indirect labor and administrative activities. In fact,
workloads for direct operators, such as spinners and weavers, are comparable
to European averages. The Company is petitioning the Government to either
subsidize the cost of excessive labor, or to allow their early retirement. In
an effort to reduce redundant labor, SITEX wishes to operate the weaving
facilities at Ksar Hellal on four shifts (rather than three), as is already
the case in Sousse. So far, the Company has not been successful due to labor
resistance. However, agreement has been reached with the labor union that any
new equipment will be so operated.
3.11      Tunisia's industrial labor force developed only recently, and its
skill depends largely on the quality and continuity of training provided by
the companies concerned. At SITEX, where a considerable degree of guidance
and assistance has been provided by Swift, training is a continuous activity,
supported by good documentation and comprehensive records. Those operators
who are well-trained and experienced would be capable of matching the produc-
tion performance of operators in Western Europe, when given the benefit of
equal standards of equipment, raw materials and production organization.
3.12      The quality of SITEX's staff is good.  Most of the Company's sen-
ior and middle management are graduates of technical schools in France and
Belgium, and some of them have received advanced training in Europe. Their
knowledge and technical training are appropriate for their present tasks.
However, again due to the short industrial tradition, there is only a limited
background of industrial business management experience within the country, to
provide the necessary guidance for achieving productivity and profitability
targets. For this reason, the continuity of expatriate operating assistance
is vital to SITEX. At the supervisory level there are a number of individuals
who have gained good experience while working in textile mills in Europe. In
general, staff as well as labor are well motivated, with the exception of
those workers whom the Company is seeking to retire prematurely.
3.13      Basic wages/salaries for labor and staff in the public sector are
determined by a civil service-type progression. The current wage/salary
levels include 18 grades from unskilled worker to foreman, and another 18 from
the most Junior staff to the top level of management. Promotion, which occurs
on average at three-year intervals, increases earnings by about 10%. The
Company's employees obtain an automatic annual increase of approximately 5% at
the lowest levels of pay and 3% at the highest. In addition, they receive a
cost-of-living increase which is annually determined by consultation between
the Government, management and the labor unions. In recent years this increase
has been an absolute amount, irrespective of grade. SITEX's incentive system,



- 9 -
which is based on time saved by direct workers, is applied at both the spinning
and weaving plants. Both direct and indirect labor benefit from this system,
and it appears to be working effectively. Operators are allowed to earn
incentive payments up to a ceiling of 40% above the guaranteed minimum earn-
ings. Management also receive incentives based on actual results. Higher
remuneration can be obtained in the private sector, but since Tunisian private
textile companies are mostly small and owner-operated, taking advantage of
such opportunities generally entails adopting a completely different risk/
remuneration package, and further, physical relocation may be required.
Hence, although almost all private sector management originally worked for
SOGITEX, 1/ this attrition has been gradual over the years, and has further
been beneficial to the country as a whole.
D. Current Modernization Program
3.14      In order to overcome some of the difficulties faced by the Company
because of its low denim quality and loss of production due to imbalances,
SITEX, in 1980, carried out a modernization program in its spinning plant.
This program provided for: (a) purchase of 840 open-end (O-E) spinning rotors
to replace 10,800 (34%) of the existing ring spindles; (b) replacement of all
of its 36 drawing frames by 18 new frames; (c) partial replacement of blow-
room equipment by scutchers of larger capacities; and (d) addition of 150
drums for automatic winding. The total cost of the new machinery, including
erection was TD 1.9 million (about US$4.8 million), the major portion of
which (US$3.0 million) was financed through Swift. The new equipment was
erected during the fourth quarter of 1980, and commissioned during the first
quarter of 1981.
3.15      With the completion of this program, SITEX-s yarn production is
expected to increase to 10,000 tpy, or about 22% above the level achieved
in 1980.  Of this amount, 4,600 tons will be O-E spun.   Preliminary tests
indicate that the use of O-E spun yarn in the weft will result in a reduction
in the number of cloth defects 2/ from 28 to about 20 defects per 100 linear
meters.  However, the full benefit of using O-E yarn can only be realized when
using direct weft on large packages (up to 4,000 grams) from O-E machines; a
technique which has proven to be technically and economically attractive to
denim producers elsewhere. This, however, cannot be realized while using
the existing single shuttle looms, which must use weft yarn from an automati-
cally replenished bobbin carrying only 30-35 grams of yarn. Frequent weft
replenishing unavoidably leads to, and in fact is, the major source of fabric
defects.
3.16      Shuttle looms also pose two other serious quality limitations.
The first is that the maximum cloth length that can be wound on the loom's
cloth roll before being doffed is about 80 meters. The small size rolls,
1/   SOGITEX was the first textile company in Tunisia.
2/   O-E yarn is characterized by its superior regularity and coverage,
over ring spun yarn.



- 10 -
must be subjected to an extensive inspection and selection process to form
reasonable lots (600-800 m) of denim of homogeneous shades, a stringent
requirement for the garment industry. This process, which basically depends
upon human judgement, is usually considered the most unreliable link in the
production line, and sometimes causes costly rejection of large lots of
exported denim. Secondly, the existing looms can only weave denim of a
maximum finished width of 108 cm, which is not preferred by garment manufac-
tures 1/ because of its low fabric utilization (higher fabric consumption per
unit piece of garment); for this SITEX's denim export price is being penalized
by 3-4%. The Company had considered the possiblity of widening some of the
existing looms to weave broader denim, but the idea was discarded on technical
and economic grounds because: (a) the looms are already about 20 years old,
and although they are kept in good condition, widening could impose excessive
wear and tear on certain parts, resulting in higher down-time and production
loss; and (b) widening would certainly aggravate the occurrence of weft
defects as a result of even more frequent weft replenishment per meter.
E.   Past Financial Performance, and Anticipated Future Without the Project
3.17      Since each of the proposed loan allocations for the Holding, SITER,
SOMOTEX and TISSMOK is small, and includes a substantial element of technical
assistance, this report is primarily concerned with the past and future
performance of SITEX. No historic analysis or future projections have been
prepared for the other subsidiaries. Moreover, as noted in para. 3.01, SITEX
became a separate legal and financial entity only on January 1, 1979; prior to
that it was simply one operating unit within the SOGITEX Group. All historic
data on financial performance prior to 1979 therefore relate to the Group and
not to SITEX only. Background on the Group's financial performance through
December 1978, as well as a brief history of the Group-s financial restructur-
ing is included in the Project File. Audited accounts for 1976-78 are shown
in Annex 3-2. The financial restructuring was intended to parallel the
Group-s organizational restructuring in January 1979, but was not in fact
completed until April 1981.
3.18      Projections of production, sales, and financial results for SITEX
"without the Project", as well as actual data since it became a separate
entity in 1979, are included in the Project File, and are summarized below:
1/   Particularly in markets with high labor costs and where the demand is
exclusively for wide denim.

3.19      These projections are based on the same assumptions as are used for
the "with Project" projections, and outlined in paras 7.01-7.08 1/. This is
not strictly appropriate. SITEX's problems stem not only from inadequate
production facilities, but also from substandard operations, and in particular
from deficiencies in its financial management and reporting systems where:
(a) there is no realistic and timely system of cost accounting; (b) inventory
planning and control is imprecise and outmoded; (c) budgeting is unrealistic,
subsequent monitoring is limited, and no control mechanisms are built-in; and
(d) what little financial reporting there is functions with such unacceptable
delays, as to be virtually useless. 2/
3.20      A substantial technical assistance component has been included in
the Project, precisely to overcome these difficulties. It is therefore
likely, that other things being equal, losses on accounts receivable, inventory
management, misguided production, and equipment down-time, will be substan-
tially greater without the Project than with it. However, since SITEX has
only been an independent entity since early 1979, and has yet to obtain ade-
quate liquidity, the impact that the aforementioned operational deficiencies
will have and, in fact, are having on its financial situation is difficult to
quantify. It is for this reason that both sets of forecasts are based on
actual results from January 1979 through December 1980. In reality, however,
SITEX's financial situation "without the Project" is liable to be worse than
projected, and "with the Project", better.
3.21    Given the above proviso, yarn and fabric production "without the
Project" have been projected to increase in 1981-82, as the open-end spinning

2/   Note:  This is equally true for the other subsidiaries.

equipment, procured through Swift, is brought into operation, and the Company's
improved financial situation enables it to acquire the raw materials, spare
parts, etc., required for normal operations. Thereafter, without essential
upgrading of spinning equipment, winding machines, air conditioning and
services in the spinning mill, and in the absence of funds required to acquire
essential parts for overhauling the existing looms (about 20 years old) and
for reconditioning the weaving preparatory and finishing equipment in the
weaving plant, the volume and quality of production are expected to decline.
As a result, the Company's financial situation would deteriorate progressively,
until it either went out of business, or as is more probable, would be subject
to a further financial restructuring by the Government.
F. SITER, SOMOTEX and TISSMOK Operations and Financial Results
1.   Operations
3.22       SITER owns and operates a relatively modern processing plant
at Bir Kassaa, some 15 km from Tunis, engaged in the commission bleaching,
dyeing, printing and finishing of woven textiles. In 1979, SITER's own
fabric production (from Moknine - now TISSMOK) represented about 60% of the
plant's throughput. The balance was processed for other companies in the
SOGITEX Group (28%) and the private sector (12%). The plant contains a large
variety of equipment offering versatility of processing for a wide range of
products. As a result, utilization of several items of equipment is very low,
and on average the plant operates at less than 50% of its capacity. In 1980
only 13.6 million lm were processed compared to about 14 million lm in 1979,
20 million lm in 1978, and 27 million lm in 1973. This fall-off was largely
due to declining demand, as some private customers installed their own pro-
cessing facilities, whilst others were obliged to send their fabrics abroad,
as SITER's plant is not capable of processing synthetic or blended fabrics, or
of printing large repeats, which are currently in demand. Due to past neglect
of effective maintenance and shortages of spare parts, some equipment, parti-
cularly in the wet processing sections, has deteriorated to such an extent
that complete overhauling is urgently required. The plant employs about 680
workers. It is grossly overstaffed and accordingly labor productivity is very
low (about 15% of that in comparable European plants). This overstaffing is
due both to the large process and product diversities, and to pressures to
provide employment for new as well as other SOGITEX Group employees, who
prefer to work close to the capital city.
3.23       SOMOTEX concentrates on the production of heavy work cloth, furnish-
ings and suitings for the domestic and export markets. The fabrics for the
domestic market are finished in Bir Kassaa, but most exports are in grey form.
The company is engaged in both spinning and weaving, and all of its production
facilities are in one location, Monastir, which is some 150 km from Tunis.
These facilities include three plants, for waste spinning, cotton spinning,
and weaving. The waste spinning plant is an old-fashioned mill, based on the
condenser system. It operates at a low throughput rate and produces very
coarse yarns in a variety of fibers: cotton, wool, rayon and blends. These
yarns are produced in a wide range of styles: unbleached, stock-dyed,
yarn-dyed and bleached in single, folded or cable form, for the traditional



- 13 -
artisanal carpet industry. Besides the waste spinning and dyeing equipment,
the plant also includes a non-woven production unit for mattress filling. The
plant equipment is only in fair condition, and requires frequent or major
repairs. In 1979, about 900 tons of yarn and 200 tons of non-woven filling
were produced, Due to increased demand, four-shift operation was introduced
in 1980, but only 1,277 tons were produced in total.
3.24      The cotton spinning plant is a relatively new spinning mill of
about 8,600 spindles, which started production late in 1978, and only reached
50% of its full capacity in 1979. 1/ In 1980, SOMOTEX decided to concentrate
on producing the coarse counts required for the weft, and to import the finer
warp yarn. With this objective it replaced some of its spinning frames by
those displaced in SITEX when the new O-E machines were erected. This replace-
ment, besides causing great disruption and sizeable loss of production, created
imbalances, as the existing preparatory equipment was not capable of meeting
the increased spindle capacity. To overcome this difficulty additional
investment will be required in blow room and carding equipment, and this is
included in the proposed Project. This is expected to increase the present
production capacity (1,800 tpy) by 20-25%. As there is no fiber and yarn
testing laboratory, there is virtually no control on yarn quality, which
varies greatly. Testing equipment will, therefore also be included in the
proposed Project. In 1979, only 750 mt of yarn were produced and about 70% of
yarn used in weaving had to be imported; in 1980 production increased to 1,279
tons.
3.25       The weaving plant contains 282 looms, of which 162 are shuttleless.
Equipment is generally in good condition with the exception of 42 looms, which
are over 30 years old, and need to be replaced as their spare parts are no
longer available. Partial replacement of 16-year old driving motors on the
shuttleless looms is also essential. In 1979, as a result of the shortages
in spares, as well as delays in the delivery of imported yarn, only 5.6
million lm of grey fabric were produced, at an operating efficiency of about
60%, and with labor productivity of about 32% of Western European plants. In
1980 output increased to 6.7 million lm.
3.26      TISSMOK owns and operates a weaving plant at Moknine (about 175 km
south of Tunis), primarily for the production of light weight apparel fabrics
for the domestic and, to a lesser extent, export markets. Prior to January
1981, this plant formed part of SITER-s operations. Most of the plant-s yarn
requirements (about 1,200 tpy) are imported. The production facilities
include 464 looms of varied widths (120 to 300 cm) and ages (8 to 30 years
old). Capacity utilization is about 84%, but due to shortages of spare parts
and accessories, and occasional shortages of yarn, only 8.8 million of grey
fabric were produced in 1979, and in 1980, about 8.9 million lm. This produc-
tion was achieved at an operating efficiency of about 64%. With some 550
workers employed, labor productivity is about 24% of the standards prevailing
in Western European plants.
1/   Slow production build-up during 1979 (the plant's first year of operation)
reflects the fact that this was the Company's first experience in this
area.



- 14 -
3.27      SOGITEX also has a fifth operating company, SOPIC, which consti-
tutes a very minor part of the Group. SOPIC is engaged in the production and
marketing of jeans, shirts and sportswear, for both domestic and export
markets. It produced about 0.9 million pieces in total in 1979, and employs
about 454 workers.

long awaited financial restructuring, the impact of which was not shown uni-

was completed on April 13, 1981. As a result, the subsidiaries debt:equity
ratios range from 44:66 (SITER) to 33:67 (TISSMOK) and their current ratios
from 1.3 (SITER and SOMOTEX) to 1.2 (TISSMOK). With the investments and
technical assistance included in the proposed project, these entities are
expected to approach break-even in 1981, and even to generate slight profits
in 1982/83, at which stage a major physical investment and rehabilitation
program for these three remaining subsidiaries is envisaged (second phase- see
paras. 5.00 and 5.02).

IV. THE TEXTILE MARKET AND MARKETING
A.   The Export Market for Tunisian Textiles
4.01      The principal export markets for Tunisian textiles are the countries
of the European Economic Community (EEC). Until 1977, as an Associate Member
of the EEC, Tunisia enjoyed free entry into the community for its goods. With
the establishment of the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA), Tunisia retained duty-
free entry, but several categories of textile articles became subject to
strict annual quotas. Under the present MFA (expiring 12/31/81), the growth
in annual quotas for so-called "sensitive" categories, was about 6% per year.
Sensitive items are defined as those which would generate direct competition
with local (EEC) production. These categories include cotton woven fabrics
and trousers which are the main outputs of the proposed Project. In view of
the recession of the textile industry in the EEC, it is believed that the new
MFA (currently being negotiated) may be more restrictive (para. 4.08).
4.02      The EEC countries provide the world's largest market for imported
textile products (about 50% of world imports) but for the proposed Project,
only the markets for cotton woven fabrics and trousers, specifically denim and
denim jeans, are directly relevant. Denim was originally produced mostly for
farmers in the USA, but became a fashion item in the 1970s. As a result its
popularity and con Iumption increased dramati2ally; in the USA, sales increased
from 236 million m in 1970 to 633 million m in 1980, or about 2.6 m per
capita. The growth in Europe was equally 2xplosive, and sales incr2ased from
almost nil in 1974, to about 220 million m in 1980, or about 0.7 m per
capita.
4.03      While the rate of growth of denim consumption in Europe has slowed
down considerably since 1977, mostly due to the disappearance of non-jeans
end uses, the projections are for about 4% annual increase in denim
consumption from 1980-85, and 3% from 1985-90 1/. The supply of denim
in the European market is provided by: (a) 10 local manufacturers 2/; (b)
imports of denim fabrics (mostly from the USA); and (c) imports of denim
jeans. Imports, exports and apparent consumption of denim jeans in Western
Europe, Tunisia's prime market, are summarized below, and shown in detail in
Annex 4-1.

4.04      Official statistics separating denim fabrics and denim jeans, are
not available and for 1980 the European production data as well as US imports
(which account for 85% of the total denim imports) shown are based on private
but reliable trade statistics. The projections somewhat are tentative, as the
future structure of the market will depend on the outcome of the current MFA
negotiations on import quotas.
B.   Export Marketing of Textiles
4.05      Exports of textile products from Tunisia increased rapidly in the
1970s, and particularly after the passage of Law 72-38 (para 2.08). Textiles,
which in 1973 accounted for only 10.7% of manufactured exports, had by 1978
increased their share to 36% (para. 2.10). According to a study by the
Tunisian Centre National d-Etudes Industrielles (CNEI), out of total exports
valued at TD 72.7 million in 1977, about TD 55.4 million were derived from
garments produced from fabrics imported in bond from, and re-exported, to EEC
countries (para. 4.19) --i.e., the Tunisian content being limited mostly to
cutting and sewing. It appears, however, that due to quota restrictions in
EEC countries and Government reluctance to grant new permits under Law 72-38,
in the coastal zone, the growth of EOEs since 1977 has been limited and,
consequently, that their exports have levelled-off. Exports of textile
articles made from materials other than those imported in bond reached, in
1977, a total of TD 17.3 million. These exports were mostly in the form of
cotton fabrics (TD 7.4 million) followed by garments (TD 5.0 million) and
carpets (TD 3.8 million), and 90% were traded with the EEC countries. Growth
of exports of woven cotton fabrics and garments made from fabrics woven in
Tunisia is closely connected with the concept of the proposed Project, as
SITEX is the only company both large enough and in possession of the technical
know-how and marketing arrangements required to engage in export activities.



- 17 -
Woven cotton fabrics make up almost all of Tunisia-s exports of fabric, with
denim being the most important of these, followed by work cloth. 1/
4.06       Production of denim in Tunisia started in 1976 on the basis of a
1973 agreement with Swift, S.A., of Switzerland, who provided technical assis-
tance and marketing arrangements (para. 4.19) as well as necessary equipment
(an indigo yarn dyeing machine).  By 1978, SITEX was exporting about 8.0 mil-
lion lm per year, and in 1980 exports of denim (including the fabric converted
into jeans in Tunisia) increased to about 14.0 million lm. The proposed
rehabilitation and expansion Project would result in an increasing FITEX's
denim manufacturing capacity to 19.7 million lm (about 24 million m ) of
finished fabric in 1983.
4.07       SITEX's past success in producing denim fabric, acceptable to
the EEC market, was based on:  (i) Tunisia's geographical proximity to Europe,
resulting in low freight costs and fast delivery; (ii) duty free entry within
a relatively large and not fully utilized quota; (iii) a consistently growing
market for denim in EEC countries; and (iv) a sales price that is comparable
to the average ex-factory price of major US producers. However, since 1978
SITEX has realized that this success would become difficult to maintain
because of two limiting factors: the quality, and the width 2/ of its denim.
In 1979 SITEX took the first step to improve its denim quality, and with the
installation of O-E spinning equipment (currently under commissioning), yarn
quality, and consequently denim quality, is expected to be appreciably improved
(para. 3.15). The next step for SITEX, as a narrow denim producer, would be
to complement the current upgrading and expanding of its spinning facilities
with an investment in wide looms. With such investment, included under
the proposed Project, SITEX denim is expected to be within the upper quality
quartile of the EEC denim market.
4.08      Imports of textile products into the EEC are currently governed by
the Second Multi-Fiber Agreement, covering 1978-81 (para. 4.01). In the EEC,
the MFA regulations apply to imports of nearly 130 categories of textile
products from 40 countries. Several types of products (mostly cotton yarn,
fabrics and garments), in the "sensitive" 3/ categories are subject to
strict quotas negotiated with the individual exporting countries. In the case
of Tunisia, the quota agreement, dated March 19, 1979, limits exports in
several categories (cotton woven fabrics, knitted underwear, trousers, shirts
and blouses, etc) as shown below:
1/   Produced by SOMOTEX.
2/   Because of the increasing preference for high quality wide denim,
particularly in markets with high labor costs (para. 3.15) combined with
the rapid increase that is taking place in European wide denim production.

Denim is subject to quota Category 2 (cotton-woven fabrics) and jeans to
quota Category 6 (trousers). Annex 4-2 shows the distribution of these
two quotas among EEC countries. The quotas for the 1982-86 period are
still under negotiation, but it is generally accepted that after 1981 the
annual increases allowed by MFA for Tunisia are unlikely to exceed 3% and 5%
for fabrics and garments, respectively.
4.09      Swift's past sales of SITEX's denim in the EEC are shown below:

Exports to France and the Benelux, where Swift is well established, accounted
in 1980 for about 90% of Swift's sales as shown below. Nevertheless, the
1980 MFA quotas for Tunisia indicate that only 66% of the quota in the
cotton fabric category and 75% of the quota in trousers were utilized. In
France, where Swift maintains a good marketing network, the quota for cotton
fabrics (5,600 mt) was only half full; whilst EEC markets other than France,
the Benelux countries and Italy (traditional Swift markets) have been left
untapped by Swift, as these markets are already accustomed to consuming broad
denim.

4.10      Upon completion of the proposed Project, SITEX's annual yarn and
denim production would reach 13,250 tons and 26 million square meters respec-
tively--an increase of about 65% over the 1980 levels. Increased fabric
production will be in the form of wide denim for export, as fabric, to the
EEC. SITEX's projected sales "with the Project" are tabulated below:

Pocketings and Others    2.0    2.0    2.0    2.0    2.0    2.0
These projections imply an EEC market penetration for SITEX denim, throughout
the rest of the decade, of about 10%, compared with 8.4% in 1980.  This is
both feasible and realistic since, as noted, all new fabric production will
be in the form of wide denim for marketing in the EEC as fabric. This will
be a heavy (14 oz.), high quality product, and of the preferred (150 cm) width.
No difficulties in marketing it, are, therefore foreseen.  Potential difficul-
ties are rather associated with the production of narrow denim. Although as a
result of the Project, as well as recent investments in modern spinning equip-
ment, the quality of SITEX-s narrow denim production will improve signifi-
cantly, higher waste and labor costs are associated with the use of narrow
fabric in garment production. Since this is of only marginal importance in
Tunisia, where low labor costs and SITEX's proximity are compensatory factors,
SITEX/Swift intend to concentrate on the promotion of narrow denim sales to
the EOEs, as soon as wide denim becomes available for the European market.
In 1980, the EOEs shipped 12.9 million pairs of trousers to the EEC, of which
an estimated 5.5 million were denim jeans, and 3.2 million of these were made
from SITEX denim. However, to absorb almost all of SITEX's narrow denim
production by 1983, the share of denim in the EOEs production will have to
increase from 25% in 1980 to 40% (5.5 million pairs of jeans) in 1983. This
implies that the use of denim would increase more rapidly than the rate of
growth projected for EOE trouser production as a whole. If the required
acceleration does not take place, SITEX/Swift could find itself with some
excess narrow denim production potential in 1981-1983. These amounts are
estimated at, at most, 1.2 million lm in 1981, 2.7 million lm in 1982, and 1.1
million lm in 1983.
4.11      To insure against such an eventuality SITEX/Swift are actively
developing a number of alternative market outlets. The first is to cut the
narrow denim into trousers at SITEX; the pieces being converted into trousers
by EOEs with spare capacity, on a commission basis, for marketing by Swift,
to minor European jeans manufacturers, which are too small to either undertake



- 20 -
the investment involved in establishing their own EOE, or even to make secure
contacts for manufacture by existing EOE's with idle plant. Swift, on the
other hand, both has such contacts, and is well known to the European entities
concerned. SITEX/Swift, started to exploit this avenue in earnest at the
beginning of the year, and a cutting room has been established at Ksar Hellal.
At least 1.5 million lm of narrow denim a year could be absorbed in this
manner. Another outlet would be to increase export sales to neighboring
countries where low labor costs also prevail.  It is estimated that at least
2 million lm of narrow denim could be absorbed annually by such markets.
Finally, SITEX/ Swift are actively trying to develop a competitive construc-
tion of lightweight pocketing that could be sold to European jeans manufac-
turers, as well as to EOEs, in a package with SITEX denim.
4.12      The market projections employed in this report as is apparent from
para. 4.10 are based on the assumption that no new diversification from denim
will be necessary. As demonstrated in para. 7.13, even if SITEX is unable to
sell its potential excess narrow denim production and simply cuts back fabric
output to this extent, the project would still yield a reasonable rate of
return. Further, this assumption is conservative in terms of the potential
negative impact of quota restrictions. As the table below indicates, even if
the EEC fabric quotas for Tunisia were frozen at the 1980 level, and if
Swift's sales of denim fabric continue to be limited to France, the Benelux
and Italy, these quotas would be sufficient to absorb all SOGITEX's projected
export output, including SOMOTEX's projected sales of work cloth, provided
that a large proportion of narrow denim is converted into jeans in Tunisia.

4.13      Marketing of SITEX's denim for export is governed by an agreement
dated September 27, 1973, and amended on February 6, 1976, between SITEX and
Swift, under which Swift holds exclusive rights for the marketing of all
narrow and wide indigo denim cloth manufactured by SITEX. The only exception
is that Swift agreed that SITEX can sell in the local market, and for use in
Tunisia, up to 0.5 million lm of denim per annum, either in the form of short
pieces (less than 40 yards) of all qualities, or as cloth classified as Grade



- 22 -
C and below. Otherwise, all production of denim must be sold to Swift, at
prices equivalent to the average USA ex-factory quarterly prices applicable to
"one million yards" contracts, but not below the price of Swift Textiles, Inc.
of Columbus, Georgia for the same quarterly period and adjusted for weight,
width and quality according to an agreed trade formula. This agreement
expires on May 27, 1983. It can be renewed at the option of the parties for
additional periods of three years. Swift's intention to exercise such options
must be communicated to SITEX at least 12 months before the end of each
period, i.e., the first time on September 27, 1982 at the latest. The contract
does not oblige Swift to purchase any minimum amount of SITEX-s denim.
4.14      Swift has a distinct edge over other major importers of denim who
usually channel their goods through wholesalers, thereby adding about 10%
to the cost of distribution. Swift-s warehousing arrangements guarantee 24
hour delivery to garment manufacturers anywhere in Europe, which makes it
fully competitive with the European producers and well ahead of US imports
which are further adversely influenced by the fact that domestic orders in
the USA usually get top priority. Swift distributes denim to some 250
customers in France and the Benelux countries and also to about 16 EOE plants
in Tunisia.
4.15      SITEX-s price to Swift is based on average USA ex-factory prices
(para. 4.13), adjusted pro rata for width. Swift's price to customers in the
EEC is the FOB price plus 5-8% freight, 1/ plus 14% mark-up on CIF cost; the
same mark-up applies to Swift customers in Tunisia but there are no freight
charges. On the basis of quality, Grade B is subject to a 10% discount
and Grade C to 20%. In 1980, the average price for SITEX narrow denim to
Swift was US$2.46 per linear meter CIF South European Port, and their selling
price about US$2.80 which is quite competitive with the US imports, as well as
those of European producers, particularly for the clients manufacturing jeans
in Tunisia, as the costs of conversion of denim into jeans are considerably
lower there, than in Europe.
4.16      The present arrangement has distinct advantages for SITEX.  First
and foremost, through the technical assistance provided under the Agreement
(not to mention the loan of equipment), SITEX has been able to master the
relatively sophisticated technology of denim production at zero cost. Further,
it allows them to dispense with such functions as market research, product and
market development, advertising, merchandising, etc., and also practically
eliminates the cost of sales. For SITEX to set up its own marketing and
distribution system in Europe would certainly cost less than Swift will make
on the anticipated sales, but Swift's experience and close marketing connec-
tions with the major European jeans manufacturers are very valuable, parti-
cularly when additional volumes need to be marketed.
4.17      Swift also derives benefits from the arrangement.  Although it is
responsible for all costs of marketing and distribution, as well as of techni-
cal assistance and depreciation on the dyeing range, it markets the denim in
the EEC. Since Tunisia is an Associated State, all EEC imports of Tunisian
origin (provided they do not exceed quota restrictions) are duty-free. The
1/   Freight to the UK and North European markets is 2-3% higher.

price of denim in the EEC market, on the other hand, is based on the costs of
the main supplier--the U.S. These include both higher freight rates than for
Tunisian denim, and a 14 percent import duty. As a result, the EEC market
price is about 17-20 percent higher than the U.S. ex-factory price, enabling
Swift not only to recoup the afforementioned costs, but also to generate
reasonable profits.
4.18      Apart from SITEX's de2im, Swift handles only a small amount of
polyester cotton (0.3 million m ) imported from the USA, and grey curduroy
purchased in France to be finished in Canada and distributed in EEC. The sale
of SITEX's denim is, therefore, Swift-s main business activity. Both parties
feel that they have established a good relationship, and although the existing
contract expires in 1983 (para. 4.13), both expect to continue their coopera-
tion. Nonetheless, assurances have been obtained that SITEX will consult with
the Bank prior to amending, cancelling or extending the existing contract with
Swift, or entering a new one.
C.   The Domestic Market for Tunisian Textiles
1.   Historical Development
4.19      Imports, exports and apparent consumption of textile products in
Tunisia 1974-78 are tabulated below, and shown in detail in Annex 4-3.
Tunisia - Historical Consumption of Textile Products
(1,000 metric tons)
1974      1975       1976       1977       1978

Source:  Ministry of National Economy
During this period, Tunisian textile consumption grew at an average annual
rate of 4.7%, or 2.7% per capita. Since the above figures include the
operations of EOEs, the apparent consumption in individual years may be
somewhat distorted by swings in inventories. A detailed analysis of goods
imported and exported in bond was carried out by the CNEI, for 1977 and the
results indicate that while 27% of all imports and 66% of all exports were in
this category, the apparent domestic consumption was 6.4 kg/capita, i.e. in
good agreement with the 6.6 kg/capita calculated in the above table, on the



- 24 -
basis of gross trade statistics. Consumption of textile products in Tunisia
in 1977, with a GNP of US$950/capita, was also roughly in line with other
developing countries in the region (Egypt: 5.0 kg and US$400, and Turkey:
7.7 kg and US$1,000).
2.   Forecast Supply and Demand of Textiles in Tunisia
4.20      The projected supply and demand for textiles in Tunisia through 1990,
is shown in Annex 4-4. Production has been forecast on the basis of the
proposed investments by the SOGITEX Group plus an expected increase in capacity
utilization in the private sector, as a result of increasing local demand
(para. 4.21). The proposed Project includes an increase in yarn production
(at SITEX and SONIOTEX) from 9,000 mt in 1980 to 15,400 mt by 1985, through
rehabilitation, balancing of production lines and improvement in the efficiency
and capacity utilization of existing equipment. It is also projected that the
private sector can increase the capacity utilization of its existing spinning
equipment (presently operating at about 58% of rated capacity) by 10% to 7,800
mt in 1985, and an additional 10% to 8,500 mt in 1990. As to weaving, it is
assumed that the proposed Project will increase the fabric production of the
SOGITEX Group from 11,800 mt in 1980 to 15,800 mt in 1985 and 16,500 in 1990,
and that manufacturers in the private sector can increase the capacity
utilization of their existing equipment (presently operating at about 63% of
rated capacity) by 5% by 1985 to 11,000 mt, and by another 5% to 11,500 mt of
fabrics by 1990 1/. The projected increases in capacity utilization are
considered modest and achievable when compared with international standards,
which are usually above 90% of rated capacities.
4.21      The future domestic demand for textile products has been projected
by using the textile demand elasticity of 0.42 actually observed during the
period 1973-78, an estimated growth of GNP per capita in 1978-90 of 4% per
annum, and a population growth rate of 2%, resulting in an annual average
increase in textile demand of 3.7%. On this basis, the demand for textile
products is estimated to reach about 52,000 mt in 1985 and about 63,000 mt in
1990. The projections (Annex 4-4) indicate that by 1985 the demand for tex-
tile yarn and woven fabrics will exceed supply, and consequently the domestic
component of the incremental output of the proposed Project is expected to be
easily absorbed. By 1990, the yarn deficit is forecast to reach about 11,000
mt and the fabric deficit 4,300 mt. While a good part of the demand would be
for synthetic knitted goods, an additional investment in spinning and
weaving facilities will be required.
4.22      Industrial production of garments is not well developed in Tunisia,
and in 1979 about two thirds of the woven fabrics were sold over-the-counter
for home sewing. While domestic production satisfied 98% of the demand for
new garments, it accounted for only about 50% of the total consumption of all
garments; the difference being imported used clothing (frippery). The use
1/   According to official statistics (FENATEX) the capacity for yarn produc-
tion in the private sector in September 1979 was 12,000 mt and the
capacity for woven fabrics about 16,000 mt.



- 25 -
of frippery is wide-spread in Tunisia because it is cheap. In 1977, the
CIF cost of frippery was TD 0.17 (US$0.42) per kg, as compared to TD 2.37
(US$5.93) per kg for new garments. Furthermore, frippery, unlike new garments
(para. 4.23), is not subject to import duties or luxury taxes. At the consumer
level, made-up articles account for about 50% of consumption, and fabrics for
home sewing for another 20%; the balance (30%) are products of cottage indus-
tries, trimmings, carpets, and miscellaneous items. According to the CNEI,
the Tunisian consumer allocates 6% of his clothing budget for frippery, but
because of its low price, it meets about 25% of his total demand for textile
articles. Because of the low cost and the importance of these articles in the
low-income family budget, the amount of imported frippery has been allowed to
increase more rapidly than total textile demand and there is now considerable
pressure from textile manufacturers and trade unions to curb these imports,
which they maintain, constrain the growth of the domestic textile industry.
In this forecast, future frippery imports have, therefore, been projected to
grow only at the same rate as total consumption. Since these projections
indicate a shortage of textile articles for 1985-1990, the Government will
have to decide whether to encourage investment in new production facilities,
or to allow more frippery imports to enter the market, or some combination of
the two. Either way, however, this will have little effect on SITEX in which
the bulk of the proposed project is concentrated, as this entity is primarily
export oriented.
D.   Marketing of Textiles in Tunisia
4.23      Most locally produced fabrics are distributed either directly to
garment manufacturers or to wholesalers, who resell them to retail outlets.
The number of garment and household goods manufacturers 1/ in Tunisia is
estimated at about 150, and in 1979 there were 26 wholesalers. The other
outlets are the tourist industry and Government institutions which buy
directly from the textile manufacturers. The import of fabrics and unused
garments (other than in bond) is not significant because of high import
duties, surcharges and luxury tax which can, together, increase the original
CIF price by over 100%. Consequently, only items requiring special technology
or high fashion items for women are imported, and these amount to only about
5% of domestic textile consumption. Profit margins on distribution are
controlled by law. A 10% profit margin is allowed to textile manufacturers,
and a 30% margin between the manufacturers' price and the retail price.
Although no specific breakdown is prescribed by law, in practice the whole=
salers' margin is between 5 and 7%, allowing 23 to 25% to the retailer.
The garment manufacturers purchase at the same price as the wholesalers,
while retailers buying directly from the manufacturers pay the price which a
wholesaler would charge. The usual terms offered by the textile manufacturers
are either net on cash basis, or 90 days with 3% surcharge. When SOGITEX
Holding was responsible for marketing, the maximum price was rarely applied as
most of the goods were sold at a loss. The private sector textile industry,
however, appears to be profitable, as indicated by its continuous growth in
terms of both investment (Annex 4-5) and sales volume.
1/   Other than EOEs.



- 26 -
4.24      Marketing was always a weak point in the SOGITEX Group.  The Holding
never employed salesmen, and depended on orders placed either by telephone or
personally, by wholesalers visiting the depot and submitting samples of fabrics
brought from Europe. Market research and product development did not exist,
and sales were not analyzed by end-use or channels of distribution. Produc-
tion planning was nonexistent, and to a large extent, the role of marketing
was limited to selling fabrics already produced, offering large discounts if
necessary. This resulted in a gradual decline in SOGITEX's share of the
domestic market (from about 60% in 1973 to about 23% in 1979). As noted
previously (para. 3.04), starting January 1981, responsibility for marketing
has been placed with the individual subsidiaries, but in view of the above
weaknesses, a considerable amount of technical assistance will be required to
train marketing personnel. Such assistance is included in the Project.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Choice of Project
5.01      Although the proposal prepared by the preappraisal mission (para.
1.05) addressed the rehabilitation and modernization requirements for the
entire SOGITEX Group, it had a number of shortcomings:
(a)  subsequent detailed evaluation of data submitted for SITER
and SOMOTEX raised serious questions as to its reliability.
To have postponed appraisal until these issues were resolved
would have delayed Project implementation considerably; 1/
(b)  given the weakness of the Group's management systems,
simultaneous Project implementation in all three mills
could have been overtaxing for both the Holding's Project
implementation staff and for the Group as a whole. Further-
more, if management were simultaneously attempting to con-
centrate on the acquisition, installation and operation of
new equipment, its ability to implement operating changes
recommended by the technical assistance (TA) consultants
might have been impaired. This situation is least likely
to occur in SITEX, where Swift has been providing TA for
several years; and
(c)  SITEX has already invested in spinning equipment to improve
its yarn quality for denim exports. A complementary
investment in weaving (included in the Project) is urgently
needed to obtain the maximum quality potential and broader
fabric widths which are required if SITEX is to improve its
1/   To SITEX's cost, see (c) below.



- 27 -
position in the highly competitive European market. Further-
more, in the case of SITEX, no civil works are required,
reducing the risk of delays in project implementation.
5.02      Therefore, phasing of SOGITEX's rehabilitation and modernization
requirements was considered, and agreed upon with SOGITEX Holding and the
Government. The first phase (the Project) would essentially involve rehabili-
tation and modernization of SITEX alone, as well as TA for the Group as a
whole, and urgent minor investments for the other subsidiaries. The second
phase, to be elaborated under the TA component of the first phase, would
consist of rehabilitation and modernization investments in the three remaining
main subsidiaries--SITER, SOMOTEX, and TISSMOK.
B. Project Scope
5.03      The proposed Project has three components namely: (a) rehabilita-
tion, modernization and expansion of SITEX's production facilities; (b) in-
vestment in debottlenecking and essential spares for SITER SOMOTEX and TISSMOK;
and (c) technical assistance for all four main subsidiaries (SITEX, SITER,
SOMOTEX and TISSMOK) as well as the Holding.
5.04      Investment in SITEX:  the objective is to expand and to improve the
quality of SITEX's denim production for export.  To this end, spinning and
winding equipment at Sousse will be reconditioned and service facilities
upgraded.  This will complement the US$4.8 million investment just completed,
in which yarn preparatory equipment was expanded, drawing machines replaced
and new open-end spinning machines installed (para. 3.14). At the weaving
plant in Ksar Hellal, besides upgrading the existing weaving equipment, some
60 extra-wide shuttleless looms will be installed to produce wide denim. To
meet this supplementary production, weaving preparation, denim finishing and
services will be renovated and expanded. All new equipment will be installed
within the existing production areas, hence no civil works are required.
5.05      Upon completion of the above investment, in 1983, total annual yarn
production would be 13,250 tpy and finished fabric output 26 million m .
These estimates are based on the assumption that the spinning mill and the
new looms will be operated during 8,096 hours per year (hpy) or 4 shifts
and the existing looms during 6,198 hpy or 3 shifts (para. 3.10), at operating
efficiencies of 85 percent for the new equipment and 75-80 percent for the
existing equipment. 1/ The efficiencies are conservative by international
norms, which are usually over 90%. 2/ Furthermore, SITEX will continue to
benefit from the operating assistance given by Swift throughout Project
implementation. Additionally, with proper temperature and humidity control

efficiencies higher than 94%.

spinning and 95% for weaving.



- 28 -
(air conditioning) and the strengthening of plants' services that will be
achieved with the Project, attainment of increased efficiencies will be
facilitated. All yarn produced will be consumed by the mill's weaving depart-
ment.
5.06      Although the mill is specialized in the production of denim and
pocketing material, the new looms will be equipped with additional accessories
required for the production of other types of fabrics such as corduroy 1/,
shirting and sheeting. This flexibility will allow SITEX to effectively
absorb any fluctuations in denim demand, or to meet potentially profitable
market requirements for other fabrics.
5.07      The planned product mix for SITEX, at full capacity, is as follows:
SITEX - Assumed Finished Product Mix
Article           Material           Width       Weight      Production per Year
(cm)      (gram/m )   ('000 m ) ('000 lm)

The underlying production program and efficiencies are shown on the following
page.
5.08      Investment in SITER, SOMOTEX and TISSMOK:  although the rehabilita-
tion and expansion of SITER and SOMOTEX are not envisaged until the second
phase, certain minor investments are required immediately if the technical and
financial situation of these subsidiaries is not to deteriorate. The invest-
ments concerned will include (in addition to the acquisition of essential
spare parts). For SITER: (a) renovation of scouring/bleaching, washing
and dyeing equipment; (b) upgrading in the capacity and quality performance of
mercerizing and stentering machines; and (c) acquisition of a new high expres-
sion mangle and rotary printing machine to save on energy and allow the print-
ing of large repeats (para. 3.22). For SOMOTEX, in the spinning area: (a)
modification of blow room and card feeding equipment and provision of new
cards to balance production lines (para. 3.24); (b) installation of traveller
cleaners on spinning frames for healthier working conditions and improved
yarn quality; and (c) provision of a new fiber and yarn testing laboratory,
including air conditioning, for effective control of product quality.

all three companies), assessment of their impact on the financial and economic
performance of the entities concerned was not carried out (para. 7.21).



- 30 -
5.10      Technical Assistance:  The activities which will be covered by
the technical assistance component are: (a) upgrading the Group's manage-
ment and accounting systems to the requirements of modern mills (para. 3.19);
(b) assisting SITEX in the detailed preparation and implementation of its
rehabilitation and modernization program to be covered under the Project;
(c) assessing potential markets for SITER, SOMOTEX and TISSMOK, as well as
strengthening their marketing capabilities (para. 4.24); and subsequently,
(d) preparing investment proposals for SITER, SOMOTEX and TISSMOK, to be
implemented during the second phase.
C. Project Technology
5.11      The technologies available for a textile mill can be grouped into
three main categories: (a) preconventional technology (PCT), based on narrow
mechanical looms and direct spinning; (b) conventional technology, based on
automatic shuttle looms and ring spindles; and (c) advanced technology (AT),
based on shuttleless looms, automatic opening in blow rooms, chute-fed high
production cards, single process drawing in tandem with carding, and open-end
spinning. The PCT technology, for most applications, has become outdated
because of its low machine productivity and accordingly higher capital and
operating costs per unit of production. Furthermore, PCT technology requires
highly skilled operators. The various technologies available were examined
in detail before selecting that appropriate for Tunisian conditions. For the
proposed Project, proven modern but conventional technology (CT) will be used
with the exception of looms which will be of the proven shuttleless type (AT).
5.12      As mentioned (para. 3.14), SITEX is already investing in spinning
equipment to improve its yarn quality for denim exports. A prime objective
of the proposed Project is to provide the complementary investment in weaving
that is urgently required (to realize maximum quality potential and broader
fabric widths) if SITEX is to improve its position in the highly competitive
European market. In denim weaving, high quality requirements can only be
achieved when using shuttleless weft insertion, which minimizes the occurrence
of jerk-ins, one of the main causes of seconds in shuttle weaving. Moreover,
the absence of frequent weft replenishing and the use of large weft packages
associated with shuttleless weaving, provide an insurance against an array
of weft defects including thin and thick places, tight picks, bars and other
defects caused by variation in weft tension; such variation is a common
phenomenon in shuttle weaving (para. 3.15).
5.13      Presently, SITEX is producing denim on shuttle looms, and in spite
of the extensive operating assistance it receives through Swift, the Company
is finding it difficult and costly to meet quality standards required for
international markets. With the acquisition of the proper type of looms 1/
provided under the Project, and with the use of O-E spun yarn from its recent
modernization program, SITEX will be able to reduce its production of finan-
cially severely penalized seconds, from about 22-25% of total output to about
1/   Looms will also be equipped with a fabric winding attachment to accom-
modate large batches of woven denim. This would eliminate the costly
shading process mentioned in para. 3.16.



- 31 -
6-8%. It will not be difficult for the Company to operate this type of loom.
Only a small number of operators and loom fixers (20 people) will need to be
trained on the new looms, locally and abroad. SITEX has demonstrated its
ability to deal with advanced technology equipment in the past. Chute-fed
high production cards, O-E spinning and automatic winding are successfully in
operation at Sousse. Moreover, shuttleless technology is not new in Tunisia.
In fact, this type of loom has been in use in SOMOTEX for over 15 years, and
the equipment is still in good condition, in spite of the occasional lack of
spares and accessories. Given that on top of all this SITEX is receiving,
and will continue to receive, operating assistance from Swift, until at least
mid-1983, there can be no doubt that it will be able to operate these looms
successfully.
D. Raw Materials and Utilities
5.14      The main raw materials for SITEX are cotton, dyestuffs and chemicals.
At full capacity about 15,000 tons of low grade cotton will be required
annually. As Tunisia does not grow cotton, all requirements will be imported.
Since 1958, there have been a series of attempts to grow cotton in Tunisia.
During 1980, small quantities of cotton of the American Upland variety were
grown on an experimental basis. Preliminary results are encouraging; quality
and yield were both good. The intention is not to grow cotton at the expense
of other crops, but rather to bring barren lands into productive use. A pro-
posal is under consideration to grow cotton on a commercial basis in the
southern region of Tunisia which, if carried through, would require substan-
tial investment in land preparation and underground water pumping equipment.
It is premature at this time to predict how successful these efforts will be.
All dyestuffs and chemicals for indigo dyeing, as well as starch for warp yarn
sizing, will be imported.
5.15      The industrial water requirements for SITEX, at full capacity, are
estimated at about 200 cubic meters per hour. This amount is about 25% greater
than current consumption and will be easily supplied from the city system at
Ksar Hellal. Both sites at Sousse and Ksar Hellal are supplied with power
from the city network, and no supply problems are anticipated. Additional
power requirements are minimal, and only a stand-by transformer of 630 KVA
for Sousse need be provided under the Project. A new three tons per hour
boiler will be installed at Ksar Hellal to meet additional steam requirements
for the finishing section. To this end, the water treatment facility will
also be expanded. A water reservoir of 2,500 cubic meters capacity will be
built at Ksar Hellal to allow the plant a water reserve of about ten hours
consumption.
E.   Ecological Considerations and Occupational Hazards
5.16      The plant sites at Sousse and Ksar Hellal are located in the out-
skirts of the two cities. Few other industrial or residential units exist
near the plants. However, provision will be made under the Project to bring
the discharge or solila, liquid ana gabeous wastes to within internationally
acceptable limits. At present there are no standards for waste control in
Tunisia, but the Government has contracted a Canadian consulting firm to carry
out the necessary studies, and to make appropriate recommendations to provide
the basis for future control over industrial wastes.

5.17      The Project provides for major modifications of the air-conditioning
systems in the spinning and weaving plants. These will both ensure effective
control of emissions of fibers and dust into the atmosphere, and of humidity
and temperature, particularly in spinning, for better operational efficiency
and working environment. Additionally, with the installation of centralized
compressed air stations and traveller cleaners on3selected machines, it will
be possible to keep the dust level below 0.5 mg/m . Although the new looms
emit less noise, the noise level will be measured, and operators will be re-
quired to wear ear plugs in working areas where the level exceeds 90 decibels.
The only liquid discharge is that from the indigo dyeing range, which is dis-
charged into the city network. There have been no problems due to this dis-
charge (which started in 1975). Similar to the existing steam boilers, the
boiler to be imported under the Project, will be equipped with automatic
regulating devices to insure maximum combustion, and thus to restrict the dis-
charge of CO2 in the fuel gases to within acceptable limits. Assurances that
the Company will operate its facilities with due regard to ecological consi-
derations and occupational hazards, have been obtained.
F.   Project Implementation, Staffing and Training
5.18      For SITEX:  a preliminary implementation schedule for the Project
is shown on the following page. Project implementation covers about three
years. Since the Swiss Credit (para. 1.04) became available to SITEX in early
1981, and due to the unusually short delivery period for the Swiss equipment
financed with it (arrivals are scheduled to start in May 1981), erection and
commissioning of this equipment is expected to be completed in early 1982.
Production build-up is also expected to be short because: (a) the 60 new
looms represent a small addition to the existing 480 looms; (b) with the
commissioning of the current spinning rehabilitation and expansion program,
additional quantities of yarn will be available for the new looms; and (c) the
Company is already receiving technical assistance, and training for the
operators and technicians is planned. For SITEX, Project implementation will
be the responsibility of the Company's management, which will deal with all
matters such as finance, cost accounting, transport erection, commissioning
and training. Because of the size of investment, SITEX's management will be
assisted by consultants who will be appointed in consultation with the Bank.
The scope of work for the consultants will include the following functions:
(a) preparation of detailed project design, including machine
specifications;
(b) preparation of tender documents for equipment and evaluation
of bids;
(c) assistance in the inspection of erected equipment, start-up
and initial operation;



33 -
(d)  assistance in the implementation of a training program for
plant operators and technicians, who will be required for
the new equipment, as well as arrangements for foreign training
of production management and supervisory personnel; and
(e) assistance in the development and operation of a project
monitoring and control system, including the preparation of
a project reporting system satisfactory to the Company's man-
agement and to the Bank.
The consultants will also assist SITEX in upgrading its financial and account-
ing systems to the needs of a large and modern textile mill. This will be
achieved through the development and implementation of appropriate systems for
cost accounting, standard financial accounting, financial planning and budget-
ing, internal auditing and management reporting and control. Assurances that
the consultants' recommendations will be submitted to the Bank for discussion
prior to implementation, have been obtained.
5.19      SITEX's technical assistance requirements, which will be provided
under one contract, are estimated to cost about US$0.4 million including travel-
ling and lodging expenses. and to involve about 34 man-months. The terms of
reference for this assistance (Annex 5-1) have been discussed and agreed upon
between SITEX and the Bank. Since operating assistance is currently provided
by Swift, SITEX intends to negotiate with them for its additional TA require-
ments. Agreement on all these services is expected by the end of May 1981.
5.20      The rehabilitation, modernization and expansion of SITEX's pro-
duction facilities will not require the hiring of new staff. The personnel
required (about 75) will be drawn from the existing labor force. Training
of skilled workers (weavers and loom fixers) as well as plant supervisors
will be programmed and monitored by the Project Consultants. Some foreign
training will be required, mostly in the facilities of equipment suppliers
and textile mills abroad. The cost of SITEX's training requirements is
included in the Project cost.
5.21      For SITER, SOMOTEX, TISSMOK and the Holding:  Physical investment in
SITER SOMOTEX and TISSMOK, being mainly in essential spare parts, is expected
to be completed by 1982. implementation will be the responsibility of the
Management of these companies coordinated by the Holding's Technical and
Development Department, which is headed by a qualified and experienced textile
engineer. In view of the Department's experience in managing the Group's
investments, preparation of tender documents and evaluation of bids will not
require expatriate assistance.
5.22      Technical assistance will also be made available to SITER, SOMOTEX,
TISSMOK and the Holding. This will include (a) upgrading their management
systems to the requirements of modern mills (as for SITEX); (b) assessing the
market potential for SITER, SOMOTEX and TISSMOK, as well as strengthening
their marketing capabilities; and subsequently, (c) preparing investment
proposals for SITER SOMOTEX and TISSMOK, to be implemented during the second
phase of the Group's rehabilitation program. For all the above services,
about 86 man-months of technical assistance will be provided. The Consultants'

recommendations, in each area, will be submitted to the Bank prior to imple-
mentation. This program is expected to start by the end sf June 1981.
Separate terms of reference, given in Annex 5-2, and a short list of consult-
ants were agreed upon with the Holding's management, which will be in charge
of the implementation of all aspects of these activities, in collaboration
with the managements of SITER, SOMOTEX and TISSMOK. Offers have been received
from three consulting groups, and conclusion of a satisfactory TA contract will
be a condition of disbursement for funds allocated to these entities.
VI. CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Costs
6.01      Total financing required for the Project is estimated at US$32.9
million equivalent, oj which US$27.3 million apply to SITEX and the remaining
US$5.6 million to SITER, SOMOTEX, TISSMOK and the Holding. Of the total,
US$27.1 million equivalent (82%) is in foreign exchange. Equipment and
Technical Assistance (TA) cost estimates were prepared by the appraisal
mission using experience gained under recent textile projects financed by the
Bank Group. They are based on end-1980 prices. Working capital requirements
were estimated on the basis of SITEX's 1980 consumption ratios, at 1980
prices, and reflect the sum of the annual increases in net working capital
anticipated with the Project, from 1981 to 1983 inclusive (para. 7.01).
Capital cost estimates are shown in the Project File and summarized on the
following page. The summary is broken into two parts for clarity, one for
SITEX and the other for SITER, SOMOTEX, TISSMOK and the Holding.
6.02      All engineering and consulting services are expected to be provided
by foreign companies. The total requirement is estimated at 120 man-months, at
an average cost of US$10,000 per man-month, excluding travel and subsistance.
Including these items, the cost estimate is about US$12,000 equivalent per
month.
6.03      Working capital represents a large 40% of the total financing
required for SITEX. This is because the installed cost per annual incremental
meter anticipated as a result of this Project is only US$1.4 equivalent,
whilst current installed costs for greenfield projects are of the order of
US$4 per annual meter. Working capital costs on the other hand are indepen-
dent of whether the incremental output is derived from a greenfield or a
rehabilitation investment. Interest during construction/implementation,
of US$3.9 million equivalent in total, has been computed assuming a three year
implementation period, and on the basis of the financing plan described in the
following paragraphs.

B. Financing Plan
6.04      The acquisition of some 60 looms for SITEX (excluding the 10%
downpayment) is being financed through a tied Swiss credit. The remaining
foreign exchange requirements for equipment, working capital and consulting
services would be financed through the proposed Bank loan. Local costs, plus
the downpayment on the Swiss credit and all interest during construction,
would be financed with Government equity. On this basis, the following
financing plan has been developed:

6.05      The relatively high proportion of debt financing proposed for SITEX
(70%) is feasible and realistic because of the low gearing ratio employed in
the Group's financial restructuring, such that throughout Project implementa-
tion the Company's debt:equity ratio is not expected to exceed 50:50. Neither
the subsidiaries nor the Holding are expected to contribute to Project financ-
ing from retained earnings. This stems from the Group's current financial
restructuring, and the fact that an about-turn in profitability is only
anticipated as a result of the Project, and not prior to its implementation.
It has however been agreed with the Government that in the event that the
subsidiaries, and SITEX in particular, do generate sufficient cash internally
to finance their own interest during construction, whilst maintaining minimum
acceptable financial ratios (paras. 7.20 and 7.22) they will do so. The
Government's equity contribution would then be reduced accordingly.



- 38 -
6.06       The Swiss credit has been made to the Government, and passed on to
SITEX in two tranches. One third (US$1.5 million equivalent) being interest
free for 15 years including 10 years' grace, and the remaining two thirds
(US$3 million equivalent) bearing interest at 6.25% plus 7.52% tax (6.7% in
total), for 10 years including 3 years' grace. The foreign exchange risk is
borne by the Government, and there is no commitment fee.
6.07       The proposed Bank loan of US$18.6 million would be made to the
Government, who would onlend the proceeds in the proportions US$14.4 million
and US$4.2 million equivalent, to SITEX and the Holding respectively. The
Government would receive these funds at the standard rate for Bank loans
(currently 9.6%) for a period of 15 years including 3 1/2 years' grace. The
proceeds would be passed on to the ultimate beneficiaries on the same repay-
ment terms, but at 1.1 times the Bank interest rate. These beneficiaries
would bear the foreign exchange risk. The financial projections in this
report are based on an interest rate to the Project of 10.6% and a commitment
fee of 0.75%. A 3-1/2 year grace period has been allowed in light of SITEX's
sensitivity to potential delays in project implementation, to any decline in
revenues, or to an increase in operating costs (paras. 7.12 and 7.13).
6.08       Local costs, as well as interest during construction on both the
Swiss credit and the proposed Bank loan, would be financed by Government
equity. With the Project, financial projections indicate (para 7.11) that
SITEX would be able to pay dividends from 1982 onwards, in such amounts as to
generate a high return on new equity invested in the Company to finance the
Project, and a reasonable return on the Government's total shareholdings in
SITEX. Without the Project, projections indicate (paras 3.19-3.22) that
existing equity would earn a negative return. The Government has confirmed
its proposed equity contributions to the Project, and to has given assurances
that it will allocate the requisite amounts 1/ in each annual budget, to be
disbursed as Project payments require. The Government has further committed
itself to guarantee financing of any cost overruns that may be incurred up to
the time of project completion, either with additional equity or with long
term debt, on terms and conditions that, according to projections acceptable
to the Bank, would not result in the Company's debt:equity ratio exceeding
60:40, its current ratio falling below 1.2, or its debt service ratio falling
below 1.3. For this purpose, the Project is considered complete when the new
equipment included therein has been tested and proven satisfactory in accor-
dance with established engineeering procedures, and has operated, on average,
at at least 75% of rated production capacity, for not less than 60 consecutive
days.
I/   These amounts are estimated as follows:
-SITEX    Holding    Total
-------(TD million)-------
1981                 0.75         0.1       0.85

1983                 0.95         0.2       1.15



- 39 -
6.09      The foreign exchange cost of the consultants' services and of
training, estimated to total US$1.5 million, will be financed by the proposed
Bank loan. Since all consultants are expected to be appointed by the end of
June 1981, and since procurement of equipment for SITEX is already well
advanced, retroactive financing up to a total of US$0.5 million, is envisaged.
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
6.10      Since no local companies are manufacturing textile machinery, no
local bids are expected. Other than the looms to be financed through the
Swiss credit (para. 6.04), all machinery, equipment and spares would be
financed by the proposed Bank loan. For purposes of procurement, Bank financed
machinery, equipment and spare parts can be divided into three groups:
(a) Proprietary items, including machine components required
for overhauling, and spare parts that must be procured
from original machine suppliers (about US$5.2 million);
(b) Accessories that can be procured from original machine
suppliers but could also be procured from other sources
and should, therefore, be purchased after international
shopping (about US$0.5 million); and
(c) New machinery and equipment required for expansion or
debottlenecking, and open to international tendering (about
US$4.2 million).
A list of items to be procured under categories (a) and (b) will be agreed to
by the Bank, and their relatively high share reflects the fact that this
is a rehabilitation project. Items under group (c), estimated to cost less
than US$100,000 each, and which cannot be combined with other items, would be
procured by limited international tendering (after having obtained offers
from suppliers in at least three Bank member countries), on the basis of
suitability, availability and price considerations. The total cost of items
to be so procured will not exceed US$0.5 million. The remainder of the
machinery and equipment in group (c) will be procured according to Bank
procedures for International Competitive Bidding.
6.11       The proposed Bank loan would also be used to finance the imported
component of incremental working capital requirements, primarily cotton, dyes
and chemicals, and spare parts for stockpiling, estimated at US$7.3 million
equivalent in total. Some of these items will be proprietary; however, the
bulk will be procured using appropriate international shopping procedures,
(for example, most cotton is cleared through 3 international commodities
markets, and quotations are readily available whilst dyes will be purchased
using limited international tendering from qualified manufacturers.)

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   General
7.01      The assumptions used in the financial analysis of SITEX are detailed
in Annex 7-1. No financial projections have been prepared for the other
companies for reasons explained in para. 3.17. Ten years of full capacity
operation with the Project (1983-1994 inclusive) have been assumed, and suffi-
cient provision for spare parts and other maintenance supplies has been
allowed to ensure full and efficient operations throughout. The financial
projections are in current prices through to the anticipated completion date
of December 1983, and in constant 1983 prices thereafter. Thus, revenues and
costs (with the exception of raw cotton, labor and depreciation (para. 7.07))
are computed on the basis of prices now paid/received by SITEX, escalated from
current (1980) levels to 1983 levels. For imported/exported components, a
projected international rate of inflation of 9% in 1981, 8.5% in 1982 and 7.5%
in 1983, has been used. For items that are locally purchased/sold, a constant
inflation rate of 7% per annum through 1983 has been used. The exchange rate
used was US$1= TD 0.40.
B.   Production
7.02      Commissioning of the new weaving and technical installations at
SITEX is expected to be complete by September 1983, and full annual production
of 13,250 tons of yarn and 25.0 million lm of grey fabric is projected for
1983 and thereafter. Operating efficiency for new equipment has been assumed



- 41 -
to be 85%, and for existing equipment, 75-80%. Projected annual production
"with the Project" is shown in Annex 7-2 and summarized, along with the
"without the Project" projections, below:

Increase             0.0      3.0     7.8    9.0    9.8   10.6   11.1
7.03      This rather rapid build up to full production capacity is believed
possible and realistic since:  (a) SITEX has been engaged in spinning and
weaving for 15 years; (b) a major portion of the weaving equipment, financed
under the Swiss credit, will be delivered in 1981, and hence, operational
early on during Project implementation; (c) the Company will continue to
receive operating assistance from Swift, and will also receive assistance in
financial management etc., from about mid 1981 onwards; and (d) the effi-
ciency assumptions employed are conservative.
C.   Sales Volume and Revenue
7.04      Sales volume, prices and revenues, "with the Project", are also
shown in Annex 7-2 and summarized, along with the "without the Project"
projections, below:

7.05      Sales prices have been computed on the basis of SITEX-s actual
revenues for 1980, escalated by anticipated international inflation rates
through to 1983. A 3% increase for improved quality of exported narrow
denim, as a result of the installation (1980) of 0-E spinning equipment, has
also been allowed. The resultant prices are shown below:

7.06      The average 1980 ex-factory prices for SITEX wide (150 cm) denim 1/
of TD 1.3 per lm (US$3.2) and for narrow (108 cm) denim of TD 0.9 (US$2.3)
are estimated to have resulted in average landed prices Europe, of about
US$3.4 per lm and US$2.5 per lm, respectively. Even after addition of Swift's
costs, this compares favorably with average European sales prices for US
denim.
D.   Production Costs
7.07      Production costs have been estimated on the basis of SITEX's actual
results for 1980; details are provided in Annex 7-1. Exceptions to this rule
are cotton, wages and salaries, utilities, and depreciation. Raw cotton prices
used are those projected by the Bank's Commodity Department 2/ (as detailed in
Annex 7-1), and reflect a real increase over the period of 9%. Wages and
salaries have been forecast by SITEX on the basis of 1980 changes in government
regulations. These resulted in a total labor cost of TD 3.7 million (US$9.3
million equivalent) in 1980, compared with TD 2.8 million (US$7.0 million
equivalent) in 1979; an increase of 32%. 3/ The anticipated impact of the new
regulations on internal promotions, production bonuses, etc., up to 1983 4/
has also been included. Utilities have been projected as per SITEX's actual
1/   All 1980 prices for SITEX wide denim are hypothetical.  SITEX does not
yet produce wide denim; however, based on demerit points for quality
differentials and narrow width, as well as the difference in square
yardages involved, SITEX estimates that the wide denim that they will
produce on the new looms would have been priced at TD 1.275 per lm
(ex-factory) in 1980.
2/   IBRD Report No. 814/80.
3/   TD 0.3 million of 1979 labor costs have been included under "other" in
Annex 7-2.
4/   All projections are in constant terms thereafter.

1980 experience, but with the Project, a further 30% increase in consumption
has been projected for from 1982 onwards, when the new looms and auxiliary
services are expected to be in operation. Depreciation has been calculated
as per SITEX's current practice on the basis of existing book value, with the
exception of new equipment 1/ and preoperating costs, which have been calcu-
lated on a straight-line basis over 15 and 5 years, respectively. A detailed
depreciation schedule is shown in Annex 7-3. A summary of the resultant total
production costs in "with Project" steady-state (1985) operation is shown
below. Production costs "without the Project" for 1986, are also shown for
comparative purposes, although, as noted earlier (para. 3.21), this situation
is, in fact, unlikely to occur.

b/   Includes retained cash surplus.  No dividend payments have been assumed.

7.09      These projections are based on the assumption that the spinning
mill, as well as new weaving equipment, will be operated on four shifts,
while existing weaving equipment will continue to operate on three shifts
(para. 5.05). On this basis, as projected, SITEX's financial situation would
be satisfactory in all years after anticipated Project completion (in fact,
a satisfactory situation prevails from 1982 onward). Debt service coverage
does not fall below 1.5 from 1983 onward, while the debt to equity ratio never
exceeds 48:52, and the current ratio (calculated here on the assumption that
all excess cash generated by the operation will be used to reduce short-term
debt) does not fall below 2.7. The projected profit margin, which ranges from
4.5% in 1984 and 4.9% in 1985 to 14.2% in 1993, is normal for the industry. 1/
Income tax of 4.6% of gross profits has been projected to reflect SITEX's
current legal status (Annex 7-1).
7.10      Based on projected 1985 interest expenses and product mix, the
break-even point on a profit basis is roughly 20.4 million lm of grey fabric,
compared with anticipated production of 25 million lm. On a cash flow basis,
this point obtains at about 20.6 million lm of grey fabric. This reflects
the shorter periods allowed for debt repayment than for amortization of
equipment.
7.11      Dividend payments have not been projected; however, with the Project,
SITEX would be able to pay annual dividends of TD 1.0 million (US$2.5 million
equivalent) or 9% of total share capital (30% of Project equity financing),
even before Project completion (1983), without the current ratio falling below
1.5 or the debt:equity ratio exceeding 45:55. From 1986 onward, annual
dividends could increase to TD 1.5 million (US$3.8 million equivalent) without
the current ratio falling below 1.7 or the debt to equity ratio exceeding
32:68. TD 1.5 million represents 13.5% on total share capital, or 44% on
Project equity financing.
F.   Financial Rate of Return, Sensitivity Analysis and Risks
7.12      The base case financial rate of return for SITEX is 20%.  This has
been calculated under the assumption that without the Project the Company will
be obliged to close down. 2/   Results of the sensitivity analysis are shown
below:
1/   Use of the conventional tax regime would reduce SITEX's profit margin;
also, since by 1993 much of the equipment will be reaching the end of its
useful economic life, additional long-term debt is, in fact, likely to
have been incurred.
2/   This means that the income stream has been calculated from a zero base.
Working capital requirements are the sum of the anticipated annual
increments, 1981-1983 inclusive, and a project cost in the form of the
sale of existing assets foregone (net of outstanding debt) has been
imputed (Annex 7-1).

1. Operating Risks and SITEX Sensitivity Analysis
7.13      Each of the sensitivity tests shown above reflects the impact of an
event which has a sufficiently high possibility of occurring to be of interest
in the decision-making process. Specifically:
(a) Capital cost changes: an increase in capital costs of more
than 10% is unlikely, as about US$5 million of the BCE (or
45%) is in fact derived from a fixed price contract, escalation
and contingency allowances are adequate, and there are no
civil works.
(b) Sales revenue changes: in the past, denim prices have
generally reflected changes in the cost of raw cotton.
Further, SITEX produces heavy (14 oz.) denim for which raw
cotton represents, on average, about 60% of the production
cost. A significant change in the sales price without an
equivalent change in operating costs is not therefore
anticipated. However, as noted in para. 4.10, the projected
Base Case assumes that whilst after 1981 it might be difficult
to sell narrow denim in the European market directly as fabric
(in 1980 such sales equalled 8.5 million lm and in 1982 they
are projected at 1.4 million lm), it will be quite feasible to
sell it to (or process it through) Tunisian EOEs, who would in
turn convert it into blue jeans for European consumption. This
is the case because of the reduced inventory requirements and
transport costs to the EOEs implied by the purchase of Tunisian,
as against imported, fabrics, and the reduction in investment or



- 47 -
contracting risks to small European jeans companies associated
with purchasing the finished product from Swift. However, to
absorb almost all SITEX's narrow denim production by 1983, the
EOEs production of denim, as against other cotton trousers, will
have to increase more rapidly from 1981-1983, than the rate of
growth projected for EOEs trouser production as a whole. This
more rapid growth is expected to be achieved through a diligent
sales drive (para. 4.11). However, should it not occur, and
should EEC production of wide denim increase as rapidly as
projected, so that no SITEX narrow denim can be sold directly
as fabric after 1981, SITEX/Swift would find itself with some
excess production in 1981-83. These amounts are estimated at
(at most) 1.2 million lm of narrow denim in 1981, 2.7 million
lm in 1982, and 1.1 million lm in 1983. In such an event,
SITEX/Swift would have three alternatives: to sell this
excess production at a discount, to reduce narrow denim
production and sell the excess yarn on the local market (to
SOMOTEX, for example) or to produce a new fabric for a new market.
In the sensitivity analysis denim production has been reduced by
the relevant amounts, and the financial rate of return is still
acceptable.
(c)  Operating costs: raw cotton represents 56% of total production
costs (para. 7.07), but as noted above, changes in the price
of cotton are normally reflected in the price of denim.
Further, the projections are based on a real increase in the
price of cotton between 1979 and 1983, of 9%. As evidenced in
1980, the other major (18%) cost component--wages and salaries
--is liable to increase sharply for reasons unrelated to the
textile industry. However, a 54% increase in labor costs is
only equivalent to a 10% increase in total operating costs.
The same applies to an 83% increase in the cost of dyes and
chemicals (12%  of production costs).  Since there is no close
correlation between any two of these other cost variables, a
real increase in total independent 1/ operating costs of even
10%, is unlikely to occur.
(d)  Delay in reaching capacity:  a six month delay in implementa-
tion is considered to complete the picture; however, given
the absence of civil works and the fact that the Swiss looms
will be delivered in 1981, this is unlikely to arise.
7.14      To summarize, the sensitivity analysis indicates that one of the
greatest risks from a production point of view, is that to satisfy various
1/   i.e., costs that do not show a close to unitary correlation coefficient
with the price of denim.

national objectives, SITEX will be obliged to increase wage and salary expen-
ditures considerably. However, assurances have been obtained that SITEX will
prepare, with the assistance of their consultants, a training and staffing
program for submission to the Bank by no later than June 30, 1982.
7.15      There is, however, another significant risk from a production point
of view that is difficult to quantify. Neither SOGITEX nor SITEX has ever
been successful in financial terms. In SITEX's case, in part this reflects
equipment constraints, in part management constraints. The Project attempts
to address this through comprehensive physical investment/TA programs. SITEX
management is fully aware of the shortcomings in its management and information
systems and is keen to commence implementation of the TA program as soon as
possible. However, SITEX is a public company and its management can be
altered or pressured to comply with non-commercial national objectives. There
is, therefore, a risk that, despite the TA program, management performance
will continue to be substandard, and so, that anticipated profits will fail to
be realized.
2. Other Risks for SITEX
7.16      The raison d'etre for the proposed investment in SITEX is based on
two tenets: (i) the first tenet is that a substantial public investment in
technical and human capital has been made, which is currrently 1/ generating
losses. Yet with relatively minor additional investments in both areas, the
quantity and quality of production, and so revenue-earning potential, could be
increased substantially; (ii) the second tenet is that SITEX has secured a
corner of the European heavy denim market, in which substantial potential
still exists. And further, that if SITEX does not improve its denim quality
in terms of both width and faults per meter, not only will it be unable to
expand its sales in the future, but it will also lose its existing market
altogether.
7.17      If either of these tenets is violated, the raison d-etre for the
Project no longer exists.  As noted in para. 6.03, in this Project, the anti-
cipated capital cost per additional meter of high grade production potential
generated, is low compared with the investment that would be required in a
greenfield operation.  Hence, there is little probability that the first tenet
will fail to hold.
7.18      Similarly, the second tenet is based upon an in-depth analysis of
the European denim market. The situation has every probability of evolving
as projected, and if it does so, the benefits to the Company and the country
will be substantial. SITEX has a long-standing agreement with Swift. Swift
has the loyalty and confidence of a number of major European denim consumers.
Hence, provided SITEX-s denim is of the high quality and broad width that is
1/   And virtually always has been.



- 49 -
essential in a buyer's market, 1/ there is a good possibility that the Company
will be amongst the last to be adversely affected by a demand downturn.
7.19      Nonetheless, there is a possibility that the European heavy denim
market will not turn out to be as large and as steady as anticipated, and
that Swift will not purchase denim as projected. 2/ In such an event, SITEX
would be faced with the major task of either identifying alternative markets
for its denim, or of developing a new product for new and profitable markets.
The development of supplementary denim markets as well as of alternative
products (whilst maintaining the primary relationship with Swift) is foreseen.
In addition, the new looms will be equipped with additional accessories to
permit production of a variety of other fabrics.
7.20      Yet another important risk associated with the allocation of US$14.4
million equivalent of the proposed Bank loan to SITEX is not directly Project
related, but stems from SITEX's relationship to the SOGITEX Group. SITER
SOMOTEX and TISSMOK have not been profitable yet, and since SITEX is virtually
owned by the Holding, any profits that it might generate could be withdrawn to
subsidize the other operations. SITEX management maintains that they can, and
would, resist such transfers. Further, assurances have been obtained from the
Holding and SITEX that no dividends will be withdrawn, funds otherwise paid
out, 3/ or any financial commitments entered into, if this would reduce
SITEX-s current ratio to less than 1.5.
3. Other Risks not Related to SITEX
7.21      Some US$3.2 million equivalent of the proposed Bank loan would
be passed on to the Holding, partially for use in SITER, SOMOTEX and TISSMOK.
These operations are making losses. Given the small size of investment
involved, no "with Project" projections have been prepared for these four
entities. It is possible that they will continue to make losses until imple-
mentation of the proposed second phase is completed. However, the proposed
loan would be made to the Government.
G.   Other Financial Covenants
7.22      Besides the covenants noted in para. 7.20, during negotiations,
SITEX and the Holding/SITER/SOMOTEX/TISSMOK gave assurances, that throughout
the life of the proposed Bank loan, each of the respective entities will:
1/   This was not the case in the 1978 downturn, when SITEX suffered heavy order
reductions.
2/   Under the existing contract, Swift has sole right to all of SITEX's denim
production, but is not obliged to purchase any of it.
3/   Including loans to other Group entities.



- 50 -
(a) not borrow additional funds if, as a result according to projections
acceptable to the Bank, their respective debt to equity ratios would exceed
60:40, or debt service coverage fall below 1.3; (b) not enter into any
major new investments prior to Project completion (i.e., in excess of US$2.0
million p.a. for SITEX and US$1.0 million p.a. for the Holding or the other
subsidiaries); and (c) maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2 at all times,
and refrain from taking any action, such as the distribution of dividends or
pre-payment of debt, if such action would, according to projections acceptable
to the Bank, reduce their current ratio to less than 1.5.
H.   Reporting and Auditing Requirements
7.23      The two groups of consultants to be appointed under the Project
will be required to develop and implement improved systems of financial
management and control, as well as management reporting procedures for each
entity. They will prepare monthly reports on their progress, and upon Project
completion, a final report will be compiled detailing overall results achieved
with both the management and the operating assistance. SITEX and the Holding
will use these same reports to submit to the Bank as progress and completion
reports respectively.
7.24      The group has only recently started to audit its accounts (retro-
actively for 1976-78). Audits undertaken on SOGITEX/SITEX's behalf have been
made by a Tunisian company, SOGEX, 1/ with a staff of 15 in total; all prin-
cipal members were trained in France. SOGITEX feels that they have estab-
lished a good professional relationship with this company. Assurances have
been obtained that SITEX and the Holding/SITER/SOMOTEX/TISSMOK will cause to
be prepared, and submit, annual audited financial statements, in a form
satisfactory to the Bank, throughout the life of the proposed loan.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Adjusted Costs and Benefits for Economic Analysis
8.01      As for the financial rate of return calculations (para. 7.12), the
economic evaluation of the Project has been undertaken under the assumption
that were the Project not to be implemented, SITEX would close down and
its existing assets, sold off. In addition, all labor has been shadow priced,
and, the "with Project" financial data has been adjusted by eliminating local
duties and taxes from all cost and benefit streams. The assumptions and
1/   Societe Fiduciare d'Expertise Comptable d'Organisation Generale et
d'Audit.



- 51 -
adjustments made to obtain economic rates of return are detailed in Annex 8-1.
The resultant cost and benefit streams are shown in Annex 8-2.
B. Economic Rate of Return
8.02      The base case economic rate of return on the project is 30%, compared
with the financial rate of return of 20% (para. 7.12). The difference between
the two is due primarily to the reduction in operating costs implied by the
shadow pricing of labor employed with the Project. This is compounded by a
small reduction in project capital costs to reflect local taxes on equipment,
and in operating costs to reflect taxes on services and power. The costs
attributed to non-closure of the plant, however, are higher as no deduction is
made for the repayment of existing long and medium term debt (Annex 7-1).
8.03      The Results of sensitivity tests on the economic rate of return are
shown below. The reasons for employing these particular tests are outlined
in para. 7.13.
SITEX: Sensitivity of Economic Rate of Return
Base Case                                                  29.9
Capital Cost Changes
- up 10%                                                   28.7
Sales Revenue Changes
- Reduced production of narrow denim and increased
sales of yarn                                           28.6
Independent Operating Cost Changes
- up 10%                                                   22.7
Six Month Delay in Project Implementation                  25.1
C. Other Benefits
8.04      Both the financial and economic rate of return are based on an
effective "without the Project" net income of zero or, in other words, on the
premise that since "without the Project" anticipated income flows are negative
(para. 3.18), the plant would be closed down if this investment does not take
place. As SOGITEX's past history demonstrates, however (para. 3.21), a
more realistic assumption would be that the Government will continue to
undertake piecemeal investments and ad hoc restructurings of the Group to the
extent required to maintain employment, and that losses would continue to be
generated in most years for a long time to come. Were the negative streams
projected to be employed in the economic analysis and no sale of existing
assets assumed, the rate of return would be 48.3%.

9.03      Agreement was reached with the Holding/SITER/SOMOTEX and TISSMOK on
the following points:
(a) That they will submit to the Bank for discussions, the con-
sultants' recommendations on upgrading SITER, SOMOTEX,
TISSMOK and the Holding's management and accounting systems

into any major new investments (i.e., exceeding US$1.0 million
equivalent p.a.) without prior approval of the Bank (para. 7.22).
And further that each entity will maintain a current ratio of
at least 1.2 at all times and will refrain from taking any

months after the end of the financial year concerned, through-
out the life of the proposed loan (para. 7.24).
9.05      The sole condition of disbursement applies to SITEX/SOMOTEX/TISSMOK
and the Holding alone, and is that a satisfactory contract for the proposed
TA component of the Project for these entities have been concluded (para.
5.22).

1.        This paper provides the terms of reference (TOR) for consultancy
services required to assist SOGITEX HOLDING and two of its subsidisries --
SOMOTEX and SITER -- to improve their organizational and management systems,
as well as to upgrade the marketing capabilities of the group as a whole.
Depending on the outcome of these activities, the consultants may also be
required to evaluate the viability of new investment.
II. BACKGROUND
2.        SOGITEX is the only public sector textile company in Tunisia.
It is engaged in spinning,weaving,and finishing. In 1979, production was
28,033 million linear meters (mlm), of which 17,211 mlm were exported
(primarily denim, under contract with Swift); local sales of 10,565 mlm are
principally: finished work-cloth, shirtings, suitings, pocketing and
furnishing fabrics. All sales (including exports) were officially handled
by the Holding on a commission basis. From 1981 onwards, however, the
subsidiaries will become responsible for their own sales activities.
3.        SOGITEX is planning to implement a comprehensive rehabilitation
and expansion project, in two phases. These TOR relate to the first phase
during which emphasis will be placed on: upgrading organizational and
financial management systems in SITER, SOMOTEX and the HOLDING; improving
the marketing organization of the group as a whole; developing a detailed
marketing strategy and structure for SITER and SOMOTEX; and preparing an
investment plan for the same two subsidiaries to be implemented during
the second phase of the project.
4.        In undertaking the activities outlined above, SOGITEX intends to
employ the assistance of a professionally qualified textile consulting firm.
The consulting firm sought should have extensive experience in textiles, as
well as in undertaking similar work, preferably in developing countries.
The specific tasks that the consultants would be expected to accomplish are
outlined below. It is intended that the staff of SOGITEX and its subsidiaries
will work together with the consultants on all aspects of these activities.

assigned to each phase, as well as of staff in the home
office who would be responsible for the supervision of
the team;
(v) Estimate of the total time-effort required for the con-
sulting services for each phase, supported by a bar-chart
diagram showing the man-months for each expert. The chart
should clearly indicate which periods pertain to work in
Tunisia, and which to work in the consultants home office;
and,
(vi)  The consultants  comments, if any, on the data, services and
facilities to be provided by SOGITEX. Five copies of the
proposals should be submitted to SOGITEX.
A.   Cost Estimate
9.        The cost estimate for carrying out the consultants- proposals should
cover all foreign and local costs of consulting services for each phase,
including costs of experts in the field and home office. It should also indi-
cate cost of international travel, preparation of final reports, equipment,
insurance, office supplies, subsistence allowances, and local transportation
to be provided by SOGITEX. The cost of preparing a proposal and of negotiating
a contract, including trips to Tunisia, is not reimbursable.

expand by 2,200 tons (28%) during 1981 as a result of investments completed in
1980, increasing working capital requirements (cotton and spares); and (c) the
first shipment of Swiss looms will have arrived (May 1981), generating a
further increase in working capital requirements. Previous experience in Bank
textile projects has, however, been born in mind.

TUNISIA - SOGITEX TEXTILE REHABILITATION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN SITEX FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
General
1.        The financial projections have been made in current terms through
1983, the year of anticipated Project completion, and in constant 1983 terms
thereafter. For this purpose, the following escalation rates have been used:
Period                   Annual Escalation Rate
Local    International
1981                      7%           9.0%
1982                      7%           8.5%
1983                      7%           7.5%
2.        Full capacity annual production, "with the Project", has been esti-
mated at 13,250 tons of yarn, 8.1 million lm of wide grey denim, 14.8 million
lm of narrow grey denim, and 2.1 million lm of pocketing and other fabrics.
This production is expected to build up as follows:

3.        It has been assumed that the Project will sustain full capacity
operations for 10 years, up to and including 1993. Projections "without the
Project" were made for the same period for the rate of return calculations.
Given the continuous losses anticipated, however, and in the light of the
country's need to maintain employment, the "without Project" situation is
unlikely to develop as projected. Rather, it is more probable that the
Government would continue to finance minor investments and preventive main-
tenance on an ad hoc basis, enabling SITEX to continue to limp along, sustain-
ing employment, for many years to come.
4.        Ex-factory sales volumes, prices and revenues are shown in Annex
7-2. The price of narrow denim has been calculated on the basis of actual
average 1980 prices, augmented by a one space 3% quality premium (anticipated
as a result of 1980 investments in open-end yarn spinning capacity), and
escalated by the projected international inflation factor. Wide denim prices
have been computed on the same basis, allowing for increased meterage by a
factor of 58/42.5. The local market will absorb the lower grade denim produc-
tion, hence, the price of this product has been projected by using the actual
average 1980 price, escalated by the international factor. The same method
was used to calculate the price of pocketing, etc. for export (assuming a
constant fabric mix), and the price of exported jeans. "Without the Project",
yarn sales revenues were projected on the basis of the average 1980 price for
the anticipated count mix, escalated by the international inflation factor.
5.        "Other Revenues" reflect sales of waste products; tax reimburse-
ment for professional training programs undertaken; annual rebates on indigo;
sizing materials and other consumables; and the imputed value of internal
works. This has been calculated on the basis of actual 1980 results, escalated
by the anticipated local inflation factor.
6.        Sales tax is payable on local sales alone, at the rate of 16.82%.
It is charged by the seller for payment to the Government, net of purchase
tax, at year end.
7.        The cost of raw cotton "with" and "without" the Project, has been
computed under the assumption that production of one ton of yarn requires 1.11
tons of purchased cotton (which is then supplemented by process waste). This



ANNEX 7-1
Page 3
- 79 -
is the current cotton factor. The price of such cotton assumed is that
forecast in the "Price Prospects for Major Primary Commodities" 1/ (Mexican
SM1-16; current terms, c.i.f. Northern Europe) as follows:
1983 and
1980     1981      1982  thereafter
Price of Cotton
(TD/kg)            0.71     0.81      0.94      1.00
The 1980 price projected closely approximates that actually paid by SITEX,
net of interest on purchase credit 2/ currently extended by the Banque
Islamique.
8.        Dyes and chemicals requirements have been computed on the basis
of estimated actual 1980 costs per meter, which are as follows:
Fabric Type                    1980 Cost per Grey Meter
(TD)
Narrow Denim (108 cm)                      0.0976
Wide Denim (150 cm)                        0.1363
Pocketing, etc.                            0.0037
These have then been escalated by the anticipated international inflation
factor.
9.        The cost of spare parts and consumables has been calculated on
the basis of actual 1980 results, escalated by the international inflation
factor. To this, a further 1% p.a. of cumulative 1980-83 investment has been
added, to reflect the spare parts requirements of new equipment.
10.       Tax on purchases  has been projected to reflect the change in
SITEX-s taxable status which took place in April 1980. Prior to that date,
tax was payable on all purchases at the rate of 16.82%, and refunded, net of
sales tax (para 6 above), at year end. In April 1980, the company came under
the Regime "Admission Temporaire du Materiel Suivi d'une Re-exportation
Obligatoire", and was classified under "L'agrement pour un Entrepot Industriel"
from December 1980. Under these regulations, provided not more than 30% of
the company-s total sales are directed to the local market, SITEX is not
liable to purchase tax on imports, save for spare parts (which are not deemed
to enter sales directly).
11.       Wages and salaries have been projected by SITEX on the basis of
actual costs for 1980 (TD 3.7 million), escalated according to mandatory staff
promotion and anticipated production bonuses through to 1983. Thereafter,
they are maintained constant, in consonance with other cost and revenue
projections.

2/   Recorded as an account payable on the balance sheet.

12.        "Confection commission" reflects the cost to SITEX of the commission
manufacture of jeans by third parties. This has been estimated on the basis
of actual average 1980 cost per pair, excalated by the anticipated local
inflation factor.
13.        "Other" operating costs that will be incurred by the company have
been projected on the basis of actual 1980 expenditures for maintenance and
repairs, and freight and transport. This has been increased for tax, at
7.52%), and escalated by the local inflation factor thereafter.
14.        Overhead costs reflect rent, insurance, honorariums, etc., cal-
culated on the same basis as "other".
15.        The cost of utilities has been based on actual 1980 expenditures
(including 5% tax), escalated by the local inflation factor. In addition,
"with the Project", utilities' consumption has been projected to increase by
30% in 1982 and thereafter, as the new looms, air conditioning, etc., come
into operation.
16.        Depreciation has been projected, on a straightline basis, according
to SITEX's current practice and Tunisian laws, as follows:
Item                               Useful Life (years)
Buildings                                        20
Existing Machinery
and Equipment                                 10
New Machinery and Equipment
(including interest during
construction)                                 15
Transport Equipment                               5
Furniture and Office Equipment                  10
Preoperating Expenses                             5
17.        Interest on existing long- and medium-term debt (local loans) has
been projected on the basis of actual payment and interest schedules.
18.        Interest on Project debt (World Bank and Swiss Credit) has been
calculated as per the terms outlined in paras. 6.06-6.07, and capitalized
during the construction period, 1981 through 1983, inclusive.
19.        Interest on short-term debt has been calculated at 8.3% on the
previous years closing balance. 8.3% is the weighted average 1980 rate
payable on SITEX's short-term debt balances, including 7.52% tax.
20.        "Tax" has been projected on the basis of 1% of gross sales per
annum (droit d'exercice) plus 4.6% of net profits (tax). Income tax is
normally 46%, however, SITEX has an "Agrement categorie E sous la loi 74/74",
of August 3,1974, which allows them a reduction of 90% on this tax rate,



ANNEX 7-1
Page 5
- 81 -
and absolves them of the "droit d'exercice". Droit d'exercice has been
projected, nonetheless, as it is unclear how the Government will react
once SITEX starts to earn significant profits. Losses may be carried
forward for three years for income tax purposes.  This has not been taken
into account for the same reason.
21.       Net working capital requirements have been projected on the
following basis:
Item
Raw Materials                        90 days of annual cotton consumption
Spare Parts                          14 months of annual consumption
Dyes and Chemicals                   90 days of annual consumption
Work in Progress                     15 days of annual operating cost (cost of
goods sold) plus 5 days annual yarn
production
Finished Goods                       25 days of annual sales revenue
Cash                                 5% of annual cash operating costs
Accounts Receivable                  30 days of annual sales revenue
Other Current Assets                 7% of gross operating costs
Accounts Payable a/                  90 days of annual dyes and chemicals
consumption
Other Current Liabilities            7% of total costs
a/   For 1979 throgh 1983, accounts payable includes about 90 days of cotton
consumption financed by the Banque Islamique. This facility is not
expected to be outstanding from 1984 onwards.
22.       In the financial rate of return calculations, the alternative to the
Project has been taken as mill closure (in view of the losses projected for
the "without project" situation). A cost of the foregone benefits of liquida-
tion has, therefore, been imputed to the Project as follows:
(a) TD 2.96 million of net working capital has been assumed to be
realized in 1981;
(b) Land, with a book value of TD 0.9 million; fixed assets of
TD 5.3 million (100% of book value), investments and deposits
of TD 0.2 million (100% of book value), and new equipment of
TD 1.5 million (80% of gross book value)-- or TD 7.9 million
in total -- have been assumed to be liquidated in 1982 and 1983,
in the proportions 70% and 30% respectively. Further, TD 5.3
million of the receipts derived from (a) and (b) above have been
assumed to be used to repay the outstanding long and medium term
debt, as soon as they become available.

TUNISIA - SOGITEX TEXTILE REHABILITATION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS
1.        The economic rate of return calculations for the Project have been
made under the assumption that the alternative to implementing the project is,
in view of anticipated "without Project" losses (para. 3.18), to close the
mill. Were this to be done, we have assumed:
(a) that the net working capital of TD 2.96 million would
be realized, as a cash inflow, in 1981;
(b) that other assets namely: Land, with a book value of
TD 0.9 million; Fixed Assets of TD 5.3 million, or 80%
of their net book value (68% of gross); Investments and
Deposits of TD 0.2 million, or 100% of their book value;
and New Equipment acquired through Swift worth 1.5 million,
or 80% of its gross book value, i.e., about TD 7.9 million
in total would be sold off in 1982 and 1983 in the portions
70% and 30% respectively; and
(c) that because skills are not readily transferred to other
industries (i.e. not without a period of unemployment and/or
retraining), because 60% of Tunisia's spinning capacity is
concentrated in the SOGITEX Group (all of which would
logically have to close down, were SITEX closed), and
because labor is immobile and there are no other large-
scale industrial employment opportunities in the area,
all labor and salary expenses in the "with Project"
situation would have an actual social cost of only 0.66
of the financial outlay. This accounting ratio has been
estimated 1/ as the social price of skilled labor in
Tunisia (that of semi-skilled labor is 0.53 and of
unskilled urban labor, 0.37), and reflects not only
its opportunity cost in alternative employment, but also
the social cost of the additional (consumption) expenditures
associated with allocating income to labor rather than
to profits, and so to investment.
2.        In addition, for the "with Project" situation, economic cost and
benefit streams employed in the financial analysis (Annex 7-1), have been
amended as follows:

ANNEX 8-1
Page 2
(a) Local taxes have been eliminated from the capital cost
estimate, reducing it by 1%;
(b) Service tax of 7.52% has been netted out of "overhead" and
"'confection commission" expenses; 5% power tax has been
netted out from the cost of utilities and "taxes" have
been eliminated. The net impact of "tax on sales",
"tax on purchases" and "net indirect taxes is zero,
hence these have been left unchanged; and
(c) no repayment of existing long and medium term debt, as a
result of plant liquidation, has been imputed.
2.        Since the bulk of SITEX's projected sales are exports, sales prices
are effectively border price equivalents. Similarly, as noted (para. 7.07),
the cotton price used is the Bank's projection of CIF cost. No adjustments
have, therefore, been made in either of these.
