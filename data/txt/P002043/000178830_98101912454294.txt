STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
LAGOS POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
I. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Consumption and Resources
1.01      Nigeria's total energy consumption in 1978 has been estimated at
about 14.7 million T.o.e. 1/ for a population of about 81 million, (0.18 T.o.e.
per capita) of which 8.2 million T.o.e. correspond to commercial sources, i.e.
petroleum products, natural gas, coal and hydro-electricity and about 6.5
million T.o.e. (a very rough estimate) correspond to non-commercial sources, i.e.
wood, charcoal, organic wastes, etc. Annex 1.01 shows an estimate of the
energy consumption of the residential, commercial-industrial, and transport
sectors by energy sources during 1978. The energy consumption in the form of
electricity amounted to 1.80 million T.o.e. or 5,540 GWh representing 12% of
the total energy consumption. The high proportion of total energy consumed
for residential uses and transportation as compared with industrial uses
reflects the present status of Nigeria's economy, which has relatively
little industry outside the enclave oil industry. The major sources supplying
the present consumption are petroleum products and non-commercial fuels
(mainly wood). Development of alternative sources such as natural or LP gas,
to replace wood in home-cooking, would reduce the cost of supply and defore-
station. Nigeria's commercial energy consumption has grown at an average of
20% per year during the last five years.
1.02      As compared with other West African countries, Nigeria is well
endowed with energy resources, oil and natural gas being by far the most
important. In 1978 crude oil reserves, which are located mostly in the area
of the Niger river delta, were estimated at 2,700 million tons. The crude
oil production has bees stabilized at around 100 million tons per year.
About 20,000 million m of natural gas are associated with this production, of
which about only 6% was being utilized, the rest being flared out. Associated
gas therefore constitutes, at present, the most important low cost energy
source in Nigeria. A first step in increasing the present low level utilization
of natural gas is now under consideration with a proposed gas pipeline to
serve the Lagos area.  Free gas3(non-associated) recoverable reserves are
estimated at 1,240 billion 2/ m . The National Nigerian Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC) is the Government institution responsible for the development of the
petroleum industries (production, refinery and distribution). Commercially

exploitable coal reserves are estimated at 340 million tons, of which, at
present, about 0.2 million tons per year are consumed. These reserves are
mainly made up of sub-bituminous coal with an average heat value of 5300
kcal/kg. Lignite reserves are estimated at 140 million tons. Potentially
economic hydro-electric resources are estimated at 11,500 MW 1/ of which
about 3500 MW will be utilized before 1987.
Power Sector Organization
1.03      The public service power supply in Nigeria, except for a small
proportion (less than 5%) which is provided by the States, is the responsibility
of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). Details of NEPA's organization,
management and operations are given in Chapter II. Data on power generated
by self suppliers are scarce but there are indications that such consumption
has increased substantially during the last year due to power shortages.
1.04      NEPA was created in 1972 with the merger of the Electricity Cor-
poration of Nigeria (ECN) and the Niger Dams Authority (NDA). The latter had
been created in 1962 for the multi-purpose development of the Niger river, of
which the Kainji hydro-electric scheme is the first stage. The Bank involve-
ment in the Nigerian power sector contributed to the consolidation of the
sector planning development and operations which culminated in the creation
of NEPA. It might have been difficult to accomplish as much as has been
achieved in the sector, without a centralized approach, incorporating national
objectives and making optimum use of limited Nigerian manpower and other
resources.
1.05      Due to the very high load growth, averaging 20% per year during
the past five years, severe drought conditions affecting hydro-generation
since 1976 and long lead times for the installation of new generating capa-
city, drastic load restrictions have, until recently, been imposed on the
whole power system. These restrictions have adversely affected NEPA's public
image. This deterioration of NEPA's public image and strong regional influences,
have created pressures to decentralize the power sector organization. The
new Nigerian constitution, which came into force on October 1, 1979, gives
to the states concurrent rights with the Federal Government to generate,
transmit and distribute electricity.
1.06      It is premature to foresee the implications of the provisions
of the new constitution. Probably NEPA would at least retain its major role
as centralized producer and high tension (330 and 132 kV) power supplier, but
the states might establish their own organizations for distribution. In any
event, decentralization of the power sector organization would require
careful consideration of several new problems. Among these would be the
financial viability of the state or regional enterprises within the existing
policy of countrywide uniform tariffs, (which will probably be maintained),
the shortage of qualified personnel and salary competition. The effect of
these changes upon the sector and upon NEPA's mode of operation could be
substantial, depending upon the extent and the timing with which they might
1/ Assuming a capacity factor of 0.35.



be implemented. So far as these matters come under the Constitution, there
is little that the Federal Government can do, legally, to influence them.
However, agreement has been reached that the Government shall notify the Bank
of any major changes in NEPA's operational responsibilities and that the
Government would welcome comments which the Bank might wish to offer in this
matter. Agreement also has been reached that the enacting of any law that
adversely affects NEPA's operations wuld be a circumstance where the Bank
might apply its customary remedies.
Past Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.07      The Bank has made four loans for the development of the Nigerian
power sector, as indicated in table below:
Loan No.    Date           Amount        Borrower            Description
(US$ million)
372-UNI  March 12, 1964    42.3            ECN      Transmission system at 330 and
132 kV.  Subtransmission and
distribution for the 3 largest
cities (Lagos, Ibadan and Port
Harcourt).
383-UNI  July 7, 1964        82.0          NDA      Kainji hydro-electric scheme
320 MW and associated trans-
mission system at 330 kV.
572-UNI  Nov. 27, 1968      16.5           NDA      Cost increases of Kainji project,
extensions of the 330 kV system.
847-UNI  June 30, 1972       76.0          NEPA    2 x 100 MW generating units for
Kainji, second 330 kV line to
Lagos and extensions of the 330
kV system.
With the exception of the lines and substations located in the areas affected
by the civil war of 1967-70, the works financed under Loan 372-UNI were
completed in time and within cost estimates. Parallel to Loan 383-UNI,
several other lenders 1/ financed an additional US$45 million of the foreign
cost component of the Kainji project. This project experienced substantial
cost increases due to an increased volume of civil works, higher than
estimated equipment costs and delays caused by the civil war. Loan 572-UNI
provided additional funds to cover Kainji cost increases. The first four
generating units of this station were commissioned in 1970, about one year
later than originally scheduled. Two additional units financed under Loan
847-UNI started operating in 1976. The second Kainji-Lagos line was put into
service in mid-1977, also one year late due mainly to delays caused by the
Lagos port congestion.

1.08      NEPA and the Government have not complied with covenants of Loan
847-UNI regarding the maintenance of electricity tariffs at a level that
would permit NEPA to earn 8% on its revalued net fixed assets in service.
Although a 30% tariff increasewas made in October 1977, this was insufficient
for the above-mentioned purpose. Yet the quality of service had by then so
deteriorated (para. 1.05) that it was not possible to impose further
increases before the service had been normalized. Recently the Government
authorized a 53% tariff increase, effective as of August 1979 (para 7.09).
II. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
2.01      The Borrower and beneficiary of the proposed loan would be NEPA.
The structure and role of NEPA are governed by Federal Decree No. 24 of 1972.
Its mandate is to maintain an efficient, coordinated and economic system of
electricity supply for all parts of the Federation, including generation and
distribution. In 1977/78 NEPA had a staff of about 15,500 employees and
provided service to 700,000 consumers, with a peak demand of 851 MW and sales
of 3627 GWh.
2.02      NEPA has the status of a quasi-independent corporate body.  Its
operations fall under the general surveillance of the Federal Commissioner
of Mines and Power, who is responsible for approving important policies and
decisions. Subject to this, NEPA is controlled by a Board of Directors,
comprising five senior officials of relevant Government Departments and three
additional members appointed by the Commissioner of Mines and Power, together
with NEPA's General Manager. The General Manager is responsible to the
Board for NEPA's day-to-day operations. The Company Secretary heads a small
department responsible for Board meetings and legal matters. There are
six Assistant General Managers, each responsible for a division of NEPA's
activities. These divisions are engineering, operations, distribution,
commercial, finance and administration. The organization chart is shown in
Annex 2.01.
2.03      Top management functions are centralized in NEPA's headquarters
in Lagos. Large work forces exist at the old Ijora power station in Lagos
and at the sites of the new hydro-power and thermal generating stations.
There are training centers at Kainji and Ijora. Within the distribution
division, there are district headquarters, established at various key stations
throughout the country. Each district is in the charge of a district manager,
and has its own staff, including engineers, commercial staff and accountants.
Districts are responsible for planning, design and construction of distri-
bution networks up to 33 kV level, with limited assistance from headquarters.
Each district has its own stores system, operated in conjunction with the main
store in Lagos. Districts are responsible for operation and maintenance of
distribution systems up to 33 kV and for metering, billing and other customer-
related activity. For these purposes, some districts have sub-offices, as
necessary. An organization chart of a typical district is shown in Annex
2.02. As a link between headquarters and districts, there are four district
services headquarters. One serves Lagos and the others are located to serve
the northern, eastern and western regions. Each of these regional headquarters
has a cadre of technical staff not required on a permanent basis by districts
but which are made available as required.



-5--
2.04      NEPA's organizational structure is appropriate to its present
operations. Frequent complaints are heard concerning departmentalization,
poor communications among divisions, lack of delegation and general in-
efficiency, but these problems are caused by a shortage of well-trained and
experienced staff at middle and lower levels, rather than by the organization
as such. Top management is obviously competent, as evidenced by the fact that
it is succeeding in operating and maintaining such a rapidly expanding and
complex utility operation. This is being achieved under adverse conditions
and in contrast to the serious deficiencies of some of the other public
services in Nigeria. Senior management, at the level of department director
and section manager, also contains a large number of competent and experienced
people, but even this level of management is affected by the serious staff
shortages endemic to NEPA. Consequently, directors and managers are fully
occupied in maintaining day-to-day operations, and have little time for
planning and systematic decision-making. On-the-job training of their
subordinates is virtually out of the question.
Operations
2.05      Besides the pre-scheduled power interruptions caused by power supply
shortages mentioned before (para. 1.05), NEPA's power system is subjected to
frequent unscheduled interruptions, caused by a wide variety of incidents,
most of them originating in the transmission and distribution systems.
Although some records exist regarding causes, location and duration of power
failures, they are not a suitable basis from which to carry out a systematic
analysis, which would permit the taking of measures to improve service reli-
ability in a rational manner. Furthermore, the existing record system would
not permit satisfactory evaluation of improvements in system reliability in
the Lagos area, which are likely to result from the proposed Bank project.
To correct this situation, it is necessary to establish (i) a standardized
recording system of power failures and (ii) a permanent unit which would
analyze these records with a view to establishing diagnostics and recom-
mendations. Agreemerits have been reached with NEPA to improve the recording
and analysis of power failures in the manner indicated above.
Staffing
2.06      The following table shows the growth of NEPA's staff over the period
1972/73 to 1977/78, related to the growth in the operations.

2.07      The number of consumers relative to numbers of staff, appear to
have risen by about 40% since operations began, suggesting improved efficiency.
However, the figures must be regarded with caution. Firstly data on numbers
and classification of staff positions in past years have been unreliable,
in itself an indication of personnel planning problems. Secondly, as of
March 31, 1978, there were just over 1,800 reported vacancies, which, if
filled, would add a further 12% to total staff numbers. It is probable that
the vacancies are understated, particularly in engineering, because management
sees little purpose in expanding the number of authorized positions, when
there are more than enough vacant posts to accommodate any foreseeable number
of new recruits. Finally, the overall figures do not emphasize the very
serious shortages of management, technical and professional staff, compared
with fairly obvious cases of overstaffing at lower levels.

17,268   15,454      100    1,814         11
2.09      For the last two categories (Untrained labor and Others), there are
a large number of sub-categories for which numbers of authorized positions
are unreliable. However, some sub-categories of untrained labor can be safely
asserted to be significantly overstaffed, compensated for by vacancies
elsewhere. The staff count for "Others" includes secretarial staff - 823
(5%); clerical staff - 1,946 (13%); and drivers - 1,152 (7%). NEPA's manage-
ment has indicated that freezing the number of positions for non-skilled
staff is not possible due to the continuous power system expansions within
Nigeria and the social problems arising from staff relocation. However,
it has agreed to endeavor to maintain the present trend of improving the
ratio of consumers per employee.
2.10      Since about 1970, Nigeria's educational infrastructure has devel-
oped rapidly and now produces educated and trained manpower of most categories
normally considered necessary for industrial development. This includes
university-educated professionals as well as sub-professional technical and
administrative manpower. However, given the high rate of industrial expansion
in Nigeria, it is improbable that sufficient numbers of adequately qualified
personnel will emerge from the general education system for some time to
come.



2.11      The continued extremely high growth in the scale of NEPA's opera-
tions makes it a potential prime candidate for job opportunities for the
educated and well-trained. Unfortunately, NEPA's competitive edge in the
labor market is severely blunted by the fact that it is required to apply
Federal Government salary scales to its staff. These salary scales are far
too low, in comparison with private industry and commerce, to attract suffi-
cient numbers of well-trained staff. Furthermore, Government salary struc-
tures have traditionally de-emphasized the worth of professionals, especially
accountants and engineers, relative to administrators, thus further 'imiting
NEPA's opportunities to employ the very personnel which it most urgently
needs.
Training Programs
2.12      Like power utilities everywhere, NEPA provides specialized train-
ing appropriate to the industry, for which fully trained manpower cannot
practically or economically be provided by the educational infrastructure.
To be effective, this training must in some cases provide an educational
content, at least to the minimum level normally expected to be provided in
general schools.
2.13      Some of NEPA's training programs, especially on the technical
side will tend to improve skills which are specific to the power industry.
For staff receiving such training NEPA may well offer the best long-term
career prospects. However, much of the training provided by NEPA, especially
to technicians and to accounting and clerical staff, will serve to make
employees more attractive to other sectors of the economy. Without an ade-
quate salary scale, NEPA is unable to retain such staff, and finds itself, in
effect, training staff for other organizations. Indeed, at the lower salary
levels, there appears to be considerable overstaffing with a rapid turnover of
incompetents who stay with NEPA only long enough to gain minimum training and
experience. They then quickly transfer to other authorities or set up as
private contractors.
2.14      With its rapid expansion program, NEPA should be giving priority
attention to manpower planning and to developing training and staff develop-
ment programs. Instead, unable to staff even its present needs, it is forced
to concentrate almost exclusively upon day-to-day operations. Thus, training
programs are orientated towards meeting perceived emergencies and supervisors
neglect their training responsibilities towards subordinates. Long-term
manpower planning is largely absent and where carried out at all, it is based
on largely inaccurate statistics. There is a lack of established policy,
preference standards and assessment procedures, although some basic work has
been done in job evaluation, career paths policy and trade testing.



-8-
2.15      There is a tradition of support for training within NEPA, dating
back to its predecessors, NDA and ECN, both of which had training programs.
To assist in re-organization and staffing after the merger, NEPA appointed in
1974 a 21-man management and training team from Ontario Hydro (OH) of Canada.
Training has been largely confined to technical specialities with very limited
management and supervisory training. After a gradual phasing out of line
positions, 12 OH staff now remain, 10 of whom are working in the training
department (7 instructors and 3 administrators). One of them is acting as
Director of Training, pending the appointment of a Nigerian. With one or two
exceptions, the OH team is expected to be phased out during 1979. A recruit-
ment campaign is now being implemented by NEPA, through national and interna-
tional advertising, seeking to appoint qualified Nigerians to some 35 posts in
the Training Department, including those of the Director of Training and Heads
of Training Centers.
2.16      Buildings and facilities for training exist at Ijora, adjacent to
the old Lagos thermal power station, but space for expansion is very limited.
A new training center has been developed at Kainji, some 500 km north of
Lagos, close to the new hydro power station. Here, facilities are generally
good and sensible use has been made of the houses and other facilities of the
former construction camp. NEPA's capital budget includes provisions for the
development of a new central training facility. Land has been acquired near
Lagos, but no final decision has been taken as to the location or centraliza-
tion of training. For the new Sapele thermal station, substantial on-the-job
training programs are being run by the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland
(ESB) and by British Electricity International (BEI). However, there is no
space for formal training at Sapele.
2.17      The availability of equipment and software for training is variable.
For example, NEPA is reasonably well supplied with heavy equipment for
training in live-line work at high voltages. On the other hand very little
training equipment is available in instrumentation work.
The overall impression of present training facilities is:
(a)  a shortage of space in all sections, even at the present
relatively modest training levels and predominantly
classroom-type instruction;
(b)  an uneven supply of training equipment materials and
documentation;
(c)  sub-optimal use of available buildings, which, in
turn, are not entirely suitable for their purposes;
and
(d) lack of printing facilities.



-9 -
2.18      Although it will not solve all of NEPA's problems, the only realis-
tic way to improve the manpower situation in the foreseeable future is through
training within the authority. Concurrently, the institution of a manpower
development program will provide the potential to move ahead swiftly if
recruitment improves, especially by the removal of restrictions on salaries.
To assist NEPA, the project appraisal mission included a training consultant,
who recommended that for NEPA to carry out consistent manpower development
and effective training, the following additional resources are needed:
(a) a permanent capability (in the personnel department) to
develop manpower statistics and studies, assess the forecast
staffing needs, evaluate the capacity for further training
of existing staff and labor market; and
(b) a permanent training establishment, capable of competent
and in-depth analysis of training needs, formulation of
training policies, objectives and programs, provision
of training documentation and evaluation of on-going
training programs, as wll as the management and execution
of an expanded training program.
2.19      The most serious constraints to developing these capabilities
are:
(a) the serious shortage of qualified Nigerian staff for the
management of manpower training as well as of competent
instructors; and
(b) the lack of essential training equipment and documentation/
instructors adapted to local conditions.
The Project would provide inputs designed to overcome the present constraints.
Estimates of present overall training requirements, including re-training of
existing staff, indicates a need in NEPA for in-house training facilities
accommodating at least 500 trainees. Considering the time frame of the
proposed Bank project, a training component is proposed, limited to the
required high-priority inputs, aimed at assisting NEPA to:
(a) establish a permanent capability to carry out systematic
surveys of manpower requirements, identify training
needs, evaluate training programs and plan training
efforts; and
(b) meet emergency needs in training through the provision of
instructors and high priority equipment which can be
fully utilized within existing training centers.

Accounting and Financial Management
2.20      At top level, NEPA's financial management is in capable hands.
NEPA has a qualified and experienced Assistant General Manager (Finance)
supported by competent and dedicated senior staff. Accounts are kept in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, largely following
United Kingdom practice. Each year, NEPA publishes well-presented accounts
as part of an attractive, colorful and informative annual report. Within
NEPA's headquarters, sound procedures are used for the preparation of annual
recurrent and capital budgets and long-term financial forecasts. Well-
established budgetary controls exist. The financial managers are continuously
seeking improvements in NEPA's systems of financial control. Matching the
financial function is a competent commercial management capability, also
under an experienced Assistant General Manager. Customer statistics are
computerized, data is available in various classifications for forecasting
and sound techniques are used to develop and to test alternative tariff
systems.
2.21      However, the efficient operation of systems depends upon a
reasonable degree of competence among all levels of staff. Unfortunately,
below the level of senior management, the staffing problems affecting NEPA as
a whole seriously undermine the systems of financial control. Senior manage-
ment itself has numerous vacancies for qualified accountants, throwing almost
impossible burdens upon other managers. Thus, lacking adequate supervision,
the less senior financial and commercial staff do not carry out their respons-
ibilities in an efficient and timely manner. This is particularly evident
at district level, where much of the day-to-day commercial and financial
operations are transacted. Meter reading and meter inspection are inefficient,
billing is tardy and cash collection poor.
2.22      Consistent with normal practice among power utilities, commercial
and financial staff at district level work according to regulations prescribed
by their respective headquarters divisional managements, but come under the
disciplinary supervision of the district manager. In normal circumstances
this works well, but the present inefficiencies necessitate increasing
intervention by headquarters financial and commercial staff. However
tactfully this is handled, it has the potential to confuse the otherwise
clear lines of responsibility of the district manager, thus contributing
to an already serious morale problem.
2.23      As an indication of the inefficiencies at district level, NEPA's
outstanding consumer receivables practically doubled from March 1977 to March
1978.  About N 64.0 million (US$100.0 million) is now outstending, representing
about six months' sales. The problem is compounded in many areas, particu-
larly in Lagos and other major cities, because of extremely adverse social,
geographical and climatic conditions not so common in many other countries.
For example, after heavy rains, large areas are inaccessible to collectors
because of floods. Despite strong management pressure, there has been,
so far, little sign of improvement. The problem continues to be a priority
concern of the Finance Division. Cash budgets and collection targets have



- 11 -
been established for each district and district managers are being held
responsible for substantial improvements. N 20.0 million (US$31.0 million)
was due from Government agencies, representing about one-third of all receiv-
ables. Despite numerous reports and requests by NEPA to Government, this
figure has risen dramatically (134%) from March 1977, when it stood at only
about N 8.5 million.
2.24      To solve the problem of arrears of private consumers, effe tive
remedies are hard to suggest other than to establish targets and to work
towards their achievement. NEPA's management itself is already working
hard on speeding up billing and collection, reenforcing its efforts by sus-
pending supply to customers, including government agencies.l/ During negotia-
tions, NEPA has agreed to review with the government and the Bank arrangements
for the prompt recovery of overdue accounts.
2.25      NEPA's accounts are still, by and large kept manually, with consi-
derable assistance, particularly on billing, stores and payroll, from keyboard
accounting machines. A computer is used by the Lagos district, primarily for
billing and other routine work. NEPA's headquarters make use of the computer
for various financial and statistical work. More computerization is planned.
Unfortunately, a new IBM 370 computer was destroyed by fire early in 1978,
shortly after installation. As far as possible, work was transferred back to
an obsolete IBM 360 machine but considerable back-up occurred in billing and
accounting work. A replacement computer has now been installed and work is
in the process of being transferred to it. Meanwhile, NEPA has been renting
time on other computers.
2.26      Facing, as it does, an uncertain future, with a huge investment
program planned and under way, NEPA could benefit considerably from compu-
terization of its financial forecasting system. Already, NEPA produces
annually a very creditable set of financial forecasts, and has recently
prepared alternatives based upon a limited range of future assumptions.
Using manual procedures, however, even this output places considerable
strain upon over-burdened NEPA finance staff. Bank staff is currently
working with NEPA to try to introduce appropriate computer procedures,
whereby NEPA could produce a variety of forecasts, responding to a much
wider choice of future assumptions.
Audit and Insurance
2.27      NEPA's audited annual financial statements for 1977/78 were
completed by early October 1978, about six months after the close of
the fiscal year (March 31, 1978). Whilst not an outstanding performance,
this was nonetheless acceptable in view of the size and complexity of NEPA's
operations and the difficulties experienced by the Finance Division. Audit
is carried out by Balogun, Ayanfalu, Badejo and Company, in association with
Price Waterhouse and Company, both reputable firms of Chartered Accountants.
1/   Essential services, such as hospitals and water supplies are excluded.



- 12 -
The Loan Agreement for Loan No. 847-UNI provides for NEPA to have its accounts
and financial statements audited by acceptable, independent auditors within
four months of the end of each fiscal year. This covenant is still appropriate
and has been retained in the proposed Loan Agreement.
2.28      In addition to external audit arrangements, NEPA operates a system
of internal audit at every level of its operations, throughout the country.
Satisfactory in concept, it suffers from the same staffing difficulties as
the other parts of NEPA's financial management, already discussed.
2.29      NEPA insures against all normal commercial risks, usually with the
National Insurance Corporation. This includes provision against damage
to major structures, machinery and goods in transit as well as appropriate
public utility insurance.
III. POWER DEMAND AND SUPPLY
Power Market - Past and Future
3.01      Table 3.01 shows the actual (1971/72 - 1978/79) and forecast
(1978/80 -1986/87) peak demand and available generating capacity, electricity
consumption and growth rate of NEPA's system. Load forecasts are prepared by
a permanent NEPA committee which works in close contact with the Government
planning agencies and the private sector. Present power consumption forecasts
have been lowered, based on recent revisions of the country's expected eco-
nomic development. Even so, the average annual power consumption growth is
forecast at 19.0% for the next eight years, with a forecast growth rate of 23%
during the next four years. The latter is an extremely high rate, which
reflects not only the very rapid general development (particularly industrial
growth) but also expected increases from the present very low per-capita
consumption.
3.02      The country's total gross electricity consumption for calendar year
1978 is estimated at 5,490 GWh 1/, which represents 68 kWh/capita, an increase
of 75% in the last five years. The annual consumption in public service in
that year was 65 kWh/capita, a very low figure as compared with other West
African countries 2/. The population with access to electricity service is
estimated to be about 20% of total population.  Assuming non-NEPA supply to
remain at around 5% of total consumption, and the population to grow at about
2.2% p.a., gross consumption would reach about 230 kWh/capita in 1985/86.

According to the above table, important changes are expected in the load
pattern for the next ten years, with a substantial acceleration in the growth
of industrial demand against less rapid growth in the residential and commer-
cial demand.
Existing Facilities
3.04      Public electricity service in Nigeria is delivered through alternating
current at 50 Hz 2/, as in all West African countries except Liberia.
Distribution to low tension consumers is at 220-380 volts.
3.05      At the end of 1978 NEPA's generating capacity was as follows:

- 15 -
Compared with the peak demand of 920 MW, the total available capacity of
1,266 MW appears adequate 1/ but, as previously mentioned (para. 1.05)
supply shortages wre due to a deficit of hydro energy (GWh) caused by the
exceptionally adverse hydrological conditions affecting the Niger river flow
into the Kainji reservoir. Generation centers are connected to the main load
centers of Lagos, Benin, Onitsha, Kaduna, Kano, Jos and Birnin-Kebbi (supplying
point of the 132 kV line to Niger) through 1,870 km of transmission lines and
8 main step-down substations at 330/132 kV. 1,700 km of lines and 33
substations at 132 kV feed the sub-transmission and distribution
systems, supplying the individual consumers at 33, 11 and 0.4 kV. The main
generating and load centers and the 330 kV and 132 kV lines committed or in
service in mid-1978 are shown in Map 14102.
Power Expansion Program
3.06      To cope with the high growth in power demand, NEPA with Government
support, has launched an ambitious ten-year development program for the
period 1977-87. This program covers the installation of about 4,300 MW of
additional generating capacity. Annex 3.01 shows the power generation
expansion and retirement plan for the ten-year period providing for a net
incremental generating capacity of 4,190 MW. The generation expansion
included the installation during 1978 of a total of 296 MW of gas turbines at
Ijora (Lagos), Delta and Afam, which formed part of an emergency plan to
alleviate the shortages caused by the drought of the last two years. In
September 1978, the first unit of the Sapele steam (gas-fired) generating
station was commissioned and a second unit early in 1979. Sapele's full
capacity of 700 MW is expected to be in service by 1980. NEPA has initiated
the construction of two hydro stations: Shiroro (600 MW) on the Kaduna river
and Jebba (545 MW) on the Niger river. Also under preliminary study is the
construction of the Lokoja hydro-electric scheme (1800 MW) on the Niger river.
As it can be seen from Table 3.01, even under the current NEPA's generation
expansion program, apparently over-dimensioned in MW capacity, the GWh supply
situation could be tight in some of the coming years.
3.07      To fill the energy (GWh) gap between the completion of Shiroro and
Lokoja hydro schemes, NEPA has under consideration the installation of 300 MW
in gas turbine in Afam and 800 MW in gas-fired steam capacity within the
Lagos area. The location of the plant in Lagos is conditional on the con-
struction of a gas pipeline from the Delta region, with possible Bank partici-
pation. Preliminary studies indicate that the location of this plant in Lagos
would be economically justified if use of the pipeline were to be shared with
some of the existing industrial consumers (cement, textiles, etc.) located in
the Lagos area, who would then use the gas instead of more expensive fuels.
The location of this plant in Lagos also has system operational and reliabil-
ity advantages, as compared with the expansion of the generating capacity in
the Delta area.
3.08      The economics of expanding the hydro-generation capacity by the
construction of the Lokoja scheme or other hydro schemes cannot be clearly
established at this time, as the availability and economic value of natural

gas or coal as energy resources for power generation has not been determined.
A comprehensive study of the available energy resources and their economic
tuses in Nigeria, including possible substitutions, is under consideration by
Lhe Nigerian government. Such a study could establish the basis for a more
rational policy for the future development of the energy sector in general
and power sector in particular. It will be especially valuable in the
planning of future generation facilities. Bank staff is currently discussing
with the Government the scope, timing and possible financing of this proposed
study.
3.09      The expansion of the transmission system is closely related to the
expansion of the generating system. The expansion program contemplates the
installation of 1015 km of single circuit and 1235 km of double circuit
330 kV lines. The 330 kV transmission system will feed the 132 kV system
through a number of substations located at the main load centers. The sub-
transmission system at 33 and 11 kV as well as the distribution system will
also be substantially expanded to deliver to the ultimate consumers the
incremental load of about 2,490 MW expected to develop at distribution level
over the ten-year period.
3.10      The expansion of the distribution system includes the rehabilitation
and expansion of facilities in 18 state capitals and 4 other major cities.
NEPA has engaged consultants, British Electricity International (BEI) to
prepare a feasibility study of this project and the Bank is contemplating
financial assistance.
3.11       According to NEPA's current estimates, the total cost of the
ten-year (1977-87) development program, at 1978 prices, is as follows:
US$ million
Generation                           4,370
Transmission                          1,940
Distribution                         2,010
Other                                   430
8,750
The average total investment cost per additional kW of generating installed
capacity in the ten-year period amounts to about US$2,000. Whilst this may
appear high by developed countries standards, it is not out of line with
costs in other parts of West Africa. The execution of this program and the
increase of the associated operation activities would require substantial
improvement and increase of NEPA's operational capacities. If staff con-
straints are not satisfactorily overcome, NEPA would have to rely upon the
employment of non-Nigerians in most of skilled positions, to an increasing
extent.
Local Manufacture of Electrical Equipment
3.12      The size of the country and the massive power expansion program
now under execution (para. 3.06) would justify important expansions of



- 17 -
Nigeria's manufacturing industry for electrical equipment. This could serve
both the needs of electricity utilization (appliances and building materials)
and of the power supply industry (power lines and substations). The only
significant items produced locally at present are: (i) bare and insulated
electrical conductors, (ii) concrete poles for mediumn and low tension lines,
(iii) some simple appliances and (iv) electrical meters.
3.13      At present there are at least three cable manufacturers in Nigeria,
including Nigerchin and Kabelmetal in Lagos and Niger Wire and Cable in
Ibadan, respectively associated and licensees of Japanese, German and British
manufacturers. Bare wires and cables are made of copper and steel-reinforced
aluminum. At present, copper-insulated cables are made up to 1 kV insulation.
Kabelmetal is installing a new factory at Kaduna which will produce insulated
cables up to 11 kV. Copper and aluminum are imported in the form of wire
bars. Insulation material is also imported.
3.14      There are several manufacturers of concrete poles throughout the
country. In the Lagos area, there are manufacturers of plain I-shaped,
centrifugated and pre-stressed concrete poles up to 12 m length. Quality is
acceptable but improvement in systematic control and testing is required.
Until recently, the lack of adequate supply of poles was one of the main
limitations for wide use of overhead type power distribution lines; such
limitations no longer exist.
3.15      An electric meter factory, with the license of Landis and Gyr of
Switzerland, is now under construction and production is expected to start
in 1980. Recently, Trafo-union of Germany, reached an agreement with the
Government to install a distribution transformer factory in Abeokuta (Ogun
State).
3.16      At present, Nigeria's currency appears to be significantly over-
valued. Thus there seems to be no comparative advantage in the local manu-
facture of items such as electric conductors or other material with high
foreign inputs. However, local manufacture should improve supply reliability
and provide opportunities for developing Nigerian technical skills. The
advantages would further improve when the basic metallurgical and chemical
industries, now under construction, provide some of the necessary inputs
currently being imported.
3.17      Import duties for electrical equipment imported by NEPA are around
10 to 15% of CIF value. Raw materials for local wire and cable industries
attract duties of 5 to 10% of CIF value. In addition, port authorities
charge 5% of CIF value for storage, handling and other port services. In
some recent contracts placed by NEPA for electrical conductors with suppliers
from Eastern Europe, prices were below the cost of raw materials plus import
duties and port services paid by local industries. It is likely that in the
case of local wire and cable manufacture, the imported component (copper,
aluminum and insulation) would exceed 50% of the quoted price (para. 5.16).
3.18      Collaboration between NEPA and existing local manufacturing
industries of electrical equipment (mostly for power distribution), as
experienced in other developing countries, could encourage the industries



- 18 -
to adapt standard foreign designs to local conditions by developing stronger
and simpler equipment. NEPA's specifications could be more readily adapted to
locally manufactured facilities and materials, and there would be increased
opportunities to experiment with new designs in NEPA's networks.   The Bank,
in future operations, could provide for assistance in carrying out a study
on the possibilities of development of the manufacturing industry of electrical
equipment (mainly distribution equipment) in Nigeria, after necessary experience
is obtained from the adaptation of designs mentioned above.
IV. THE LAGOS AREA
4.01  2   In mid-1978 the Lagos metropolitan area covered approximately
500 km , encompassing about four million 1/ people (less than 5% of the
country's total population) and consumed 1571 GWh 2/, 43% of the country's
total electricity consumption. The area was originally served by a local
generation station at Ijora. When the national 330 kV high tension grid
was put into service, Lagos was connected to it through the Akangba 330/132
kV substation. Power is distributed at 132 and 33 kV (the High Tension
system) which feeds the distribution system at 11 kV, 6.6 kV (being replaced
by 11 kV) and 0.4 kV. At present more than 90% of the population living in
Lagos metropolitan area has access to electricity service.
4.02      Late in 1973, NEPA engaged Motor Columbus (MC) of Switzerland as
consultants to carry out a study of the distribution expansion of the Lagos
metropolitan area. This study was completed in 1974. The first phase of the
expansion, consisting of the installation of a new 330/132 kV substation at
Ikeja West and extension of the high tension system, is now nearing completion.
Electricity Consumption - Past and Future
4.03      Motor Columbus has updated the 1974 study, to derive demand
forecasts for the ten-year period 1 977/78-1986/87. These forecasts were
determined for each of 15 zones of the Lagos metropolitan area, in accordance
with the subdivisions adopted by NEPA's commercial department for billing
purposes (map 14102).
4.04      Population, average income levels, volume of sales and number of
consumers according to category, etc., were analyzed for each zone. Based on
this information, projections of future consumption were made, taking into
account the zone development program contemplated in the Master-Plan for
Lagos 3/, as well as the power demand of future large consumers. Annex 4.01
shows GWh sales and MW coincident maximum demands, actual for 1976/77, and
projected for 1979/80, 1978/84 and 1987/88, for the 15 zones of metropolitan
Lagos. As shown in this table, the consumption in the Lagos area is expected

to increase at around 15% per year, which is substantially lower than the
average for the country (approaching 20%, para. 3.01). However, consumption
in some of the zones, such as Bagadry Road, is expected to grow at a much
higher rate, due to the combined effects of increased load density and the
extension of service to new areas within the zone. Table 4.01 shows the
actual and forecast GWh sales and MW maximum demands. Also shown are the
percentages of sales by categories of consumers for selected years. The share
of residential load is expected to decrease from 60% of total consumption in
1977/78 to about 50% in 1987/88. The shares of commercial and industrial
loads, on the other hand, are expected to increase during this period,
reflecting a countrywide tendency (para. 3.03). The expected consumption
per capita would approximately double in the next ten years.
Lagos Distribution System
4.05      The power load of the Lagos area is served at present from the
national high tension grid at Akangba 330/132 kV, 450 MVA substation and
from the local thermal plant of Ijora. Akangba is the terminal point of the
330 kV system of lines which transmit power from the Kainji hydroelectric
station and from the thermal generating plants located at the gas-oil fields
of the Niger river delta. A second 330/132 kV substation located at Ikeja
West, 16 km from Akangba in the 330 kV line, will shortly be put into service.
This substation, with a transformer capacity of 600 MVA, is also the receiving
end of the 330 kV line from the new Sapele thermal plant. These two main
substations will feed the entire distribution system of the Lagos metropolitan
area (paras. 4.01 and 4.02). The main distribution system components of
metropolitan Lagos, are detailed in Table 4.02.

Development Program
4.06      To meet the power load growth of the Lagos area for the period
1977/78-1987/88, NEPA has undertaken the construction of the Ikeja West
substation at 330/132 kV (para. 4.02) with which the feeding transformer
capacity to the Lagos 132 kV will increase from 450 to 1050 MVA. A third
330/132 kV substation should be in operation by 1982/83 and a fourth one by
1985/86. The locations of these substations are at present undecided as they
have to be determined in conjunction with the location of the site for the
proposed new 800 MW thermal plant to be installed in the Lagos area.
4.07      NEPA has contracted for the construction of the double circuit
132 kV line Ikeja West-Oworonsoki-Ijora (Figure 4.01) which will close
the 132 kV ring around Lagos mainland with the existing lines of Ikeja
West-Akangba-Ijora. Also under construction (the Interim Program) are two
132/33 kV, 60 MVA substations at Ejigbo and Alagbon and two 132/33/11 kV,
90 MVA substations at Apapa Road and Oworonsoki, totalling 300 MVA. The
proposed Bank financed project would add a further 1075 MVA to present and
planned 132/133 and 132/11 kV transformer capacity. At the end of the proj-
ected expansion period (1985/86), the 132 kV transformer capacity will be
1795 MVA as shown in Annex 4.02. As a result of the project, distribution
losses (kWh) from the 330 kV feeding substations to the consumer delivery
points are expected to decrease from the present estimated level of 14.5% to
about 13% of sales within the Lagos area.
4.08      Annex 4.02 summarizes the situation of the Lagos distribution
system covered by the 1977/78 - 1985/86 expansion program, by comparing the
estimated demands and installed transformer capacities at different voltage
levels. The table shows the balance of demand and installed capacities for
4 specific years: 1977/78, 1980/81, 1982/83 and 1985/86. The period 1977/78-
1980/81 corresponds to the works under way; the periods 1980/81-1985/86 and
1980/81-1982/83 respectively correspond to the High Tension and the 11 and
0.4 kV distribution expansion programs to be financed under the proposed Bank
loan. Demands at different voltage levels (320, 132 and 33 kV) are estimated
on the basis of the demand at the 11 kV level in the load forecast, adjusted
to take into account power losses and diversity. The resulting capacity-
demand ratio appears adequate. The figure on Annex 4.02 shows the same
results in graphic form, for the years 1977/78, 1980/81 and 1985/86.
4.09      The location and capacity of substations have been determined
from the market study by zone referred to in para. 4.04. Other matters
considered include right-of-way possibilities for the installation of High
Tension structures and the cost considerations mentioned in paras. 5.10 and
6.04. The capacity of the 132 kV supporting network could easily be expanded
beyond 1985/86 in Lagos mainland by connecting additional 132 kV substations
to the existing lines, thus alleviating the load of substations in operation
at that time.

V. THE PROJECT
Proiect Objectives
5.01      Within the context of Nigeria's economic development, electric
power is crucial, placing considerable responsibility upon NEPA. The unpre-
cedented continued growth in demands for electricity can only be met by
maintaining a large capital investment program which, in turn, absorbs
significant financial resources. Since NEPA's inception, this financial
burden has been increasingly borne by Government, whilst NEPA's own financial
potential has been allowed to deteriorate, principally because of inadequate
tariff levels. With the many other demands upon its resources, however,
Government is finding it increasingly difficult to finance what now amounts
to almost all of NEPA's investment program.
5.02      The project creates an important  opportunity for the Bank to
assist NEPA in strengthening its own financial capability. A most significant
aspect of this is to encourage the sale of electricity at prices based on the
principle of full cost-recovery, so as to reduce distortions in demand and to
encourage conservation. Proper tariff levels should also help to create
additional investment funds from NEPA's own resources and to re-establish
NEPA's credibility as an international borrower. The overall outcome should
significantly reduce the burden on Government, as NEPA's major source of
capital finance.
5.03      Strengthening of distribution systems is becoming increasingly
important for the efficient and full utilization of power from recently
completed generation and transmission facilities. The project will therefore
present an important opportunity to strengthen NEPA's planning capability
in the distribution sub-sector (para. 6.03). Concentration upon power
distribution aspects will also direct Bank financing towards facilities less
likely to attract finance from other international institutions, which usually
prefer to finance structures and equipment for power generation.
5.04     -The training component would provide direct assistance towards the
alleviation of one of NEPA's most serious management problems - inability to
fill growing numbers of vacant posts with suitably qualified staff.
Project Description
A. Lagos Distribution System
5.05      The Lagos distribution expansion part of the proposed Bank-financed
project covers (a) the necessary expansions of the High Tension system to
complete the development program up to 1985/86 (see para. 4.07); and (b) the
expansion of the 11 and 0.4 kV distribution system, required to serve the
incremental demand of the areas at these voltage levels, for the period
1980/81-1982/83. The main components of the proposed project are:



- 25 -
(a) The High Tension system
(1) 132 kV facilities (Figure 4.01):
About 10 km of single circuit and 60 km of double circuit
overhead 132 kV lines and 7 new and extensions to 6
existing stations at 132/33, 132/11 and 132/33/11 kV,
with a total additional transformer capacity of about
1075 MVA;
(ii) 33 kV facilities:
About 30 km of double circuit overhead and 60 circuit -
km of underground 33 kV lines and 12 new and extensions
of 13 existing 33/11 kV substations with a total
additional transformer capacity of about 570 MVA.
The location and transformer installed capacity of the high tensions system
is shown in Annex 5.01.
(b)  The 11 and 0.4 kV distribution system
(i) 11 kV facilities:
About 150 km of three phase and 500 km of single phase
underground cables, about 930 distribution transformer
totalling about 300 MVA. Distribution centers, (ring
main units) control and protection equipment and
accessories;
(ii) 0.4 kV facilities:
About 200 km of four conductor underground cable and about
1100 km of four conductor overhead lines.  LT fuse pillars,
meters, and accessories.
B. Training Component
(a) Specialist staff
(i) 6 specialists on human resources development and training,
each for two years, covering: manpower planning, training
policies,needs and programs;
(ii) 6 specialists/instructors each for two years in disciplines
of critical importance; and
(iii) 24 man-months of consultancy services to provide short-term
advisers to meet special needs.
(b)  Training equipment
Urgent and essential training equipment and materials for
the existing training centers.

Project Cost
5.06      The estimated total project cost is US$222.2 million equivalent of
which US$129.0 million corresponds to the foreign exchange component that
would be financed under the proposed Bank and EIB loans (para. 5.09). Table
5.01 shows detailed cost estimates. The base cost of the High Tension system
covered under the proposed Bank project plus other 132 kV facilities required
and already committed, when compared with the projected incremental transformer
capacity at 132 kV, results in a unit investment cost of about 100 US$/kVA.
The unit investment cost for the 11-0.4 kV distribution system, calculated in
a similar way results in about 215 US$/kVA. Thus, the total incremental unit
investment cost for the Lagos distribution expansion project would amount
to about 315 US$/kVA or about 370 US$/kW of installed capacity which is
reasonable, considering that local costs have been computed at the overvalued
exchange rate of 1.54 US$/N (para. 6.06).
5.07      Cost estimates correspond to mid-1979 price levels, on the basis
of procurement methods indicated in para. 5.17. The cost estimates include
7.5% of base cost for physical contingencies, which is considered adequate
because of the modular and standardized nature of the project, 7.5% for 1979
and 6% per year thereafter for foreign price contingencies and 20% per year
for local price contingencies.
5.08      The cost of the specialist assistance of the training component
has been estimated on the basis of salaries and other expenses paid to
similar types of professionals, mainly expatriates, working in Nigeria. The
cost of the training equipment was estimated on the basis of a tentative list
prepared by NEPA and the consultant at mid-1978 prices. It is estimated that
full-time specialists and instructors would be employed for a total of 288
man-months, with an additional 24 man-months of consultancy services.
Foreign costs would average about US$5,000 per man-month, including passages.
Local costs would average a further US$3,000 per man-month, including accom-
modation allowances.

Co-financing Arrangements
5.09      Parallel financing arrangements for the proposed project are being
discussed by NEPA and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The Bank would lend
US$100 million equivalent to cover about 80% of the foreign exchange costs.
The EIB would lend UA 1/ 25 million, converting to approximately a further
US$35 million, to cover the remaining foreign exchange costs and a small
proportion of local costs. The terms and conditions of these loans are
explained in para. 7.28. EIB was represented at the loan negotiations.

Engineering and Project Execution
5.10      Preliminary engineering and project cost estimates for the High
Tension system have been carried out by MC except for the communication
system, which has been done by Merz, McLelland (U.K.). Final design of
transmission lines will be done by the selected contractor (para. 5.17) in
accordance with specifications and routes prepared by NEPA and consultants. In
some sectors of the 132 kV lines, bundle conductors (two per phase) have been
considered, to increase power carrying capacity within the available right-
of-way space. The number of circuits and the cross-section of conductors have
been determined on the basis of power flow studies carried out by the consul-
tants for normal and contingency conditions.
5.11      The 132 and 33 kV substations will work radially (no inter-
connection at the secondary side) but normally open inter-connecting ties will
be provided to enable part of the substation load to be absorbed by a neigh-
boring substation in the case of failures. The size and impedance value of
transformer units and the final MVA capacity per substation have been speci-
fied to meet acceptable short-circuit levels at the secondary side.
5.12      The total capacity of the High Tension component (para. 4.07) is
the result of the analysis of the expected demand growth in different Lagos
areas. Arrangements to ensure acceptable reliability of supply include:
(i) access to required "injection" points to feed the distribution system
through the construction of 132 and 33 kV lines under a single contingency
condition (double circuit lines or two feeding points per substation) and (ii)
at least two transformer units at each substation. The standard sizes of
these units were decided on the basis of economic and impedance considerations
(para. 5.11) and are shown in Annex 5.01.
5.13      Supervision of the construction of the High Tension substations will
be done by consultants. Civil works and erection will be done by contractors.
Engineering of the 11 and 0.4 kV distribution project will be done by NEPA
assisted by consultants using their present standard designs. Construction
will be done by NEPA's own work force and by local contractors. Agreement has
been reached that NEPA, in carrying out the project, will employ consultants
to an extent and upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
5.14      Successful execution of the training component requires that NEPA
engage additional permanent staff to fill posts now vacant, those to be
created or those manned by specialists on temporary contracts. Key posts
requiring to be filled are:
(i) Director of Training
(ii) Professional support staff to the Director of Training
(iii) Managers of two existing Training Centers
(iv) Instructors (immediate need: 30)
(v) Additional qualified staff for the Manpower Control Section,
Personnel Department



- 30 -
During the project period, support staff for the Director of Training and
additional staff for the Manpower Control Section would be counterparts of
the Bank-financed specialists. At negotiations it was agreed that a full-time
Director of Training would be appointed no later than Dec. 31, 1979. Recruitment
of other staff required would be done at a later date.
5.15      The time schedule for the project execution is shown in Annex 5.02.
Procurement and Disbursement
5.16      All Bank-financed goods and services wDuld be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
EIB financed components of the Project would be procured through international
competitive bidding, except for the switchgear, and the control and protection
equipment required for the expansion of the existing 132 and 33 kV sub-
stations, which should match the existing equipment. Locally manufactured
equipment, such as electric conductors, might be eligible for the margin of
preference as stipulated in the Bank guidelines for bid evaluation (para.
3.17).
5.17      For the High Tension lines NEPA would follow the practice adopted
up to now of turn-key type contracts, including detailed engineering (para.
5.10). For the construction of the High Tension substations procurement
would be done in separate contract packages for (i) power transformers,
(ii) supply and erection of structures, switchgear, control and protection
equipment, (iii) supply and erection of telecommunication equipment and
(iv) civil works. For the 11 and 0.4 kV distribution system, procurement
of equipment and material would be done separately for each main group of
items (transformers, poles, conductors, insulators, distribution units and
meters).
5.18      For the training component, specialists and instructors would be
recruited through international advertising by NEPA, indicating terms of
reference, qualifications and experience required and salaries and benefits
offered. Assurances have been obtained that, after interviewing short-listed
candidates, NEPA would submit details of intended appointees to the Bank
for review.
5.19      In accordance with the Federal Government Decree No. 51, 1968,
all companies doing business in Nigeria should be incorporated in the country
as Nigerian companies. This requirement has tended to limit the international
competitive bidding procedures of the Bank. Subsequently, by the Special
Provisions Decree No. 19, 1973, it was made not applicable to non-Nigerian
companies which win contracts for projects assisted by international organiza-
tions. The Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree of 1977 and recent govern-
ment guidelines, limits the exemption referred to in Decree No. 19 and, if
applied in their present form, would again make the procurement process
inconsistent with the Bank's policies. In a memorandum submitted to the Bank



- 31 -
during negotiations, the representatives of the Government explained that the
objectives of the above mentioned regulations were to ensure greater local
control of foreign companies operating in Nigeria, including payment of taxes,
and to establish conditions conducive to the more effective transfer of
technology and know-how to Nigerian nationals. According to the minutes dated
July 2, 1979 (see Annex 5.04), the Government and the Bank agreed, during
negotiations, that foreign companies executing Bank assisted projects would
not be affected by the recent Federal Government guidelines, requiring incor-
poration within a year of their arrival in Nigeria, but that all cc:-s  nies
should be required to employ Nigerian staff to support the expatriate staff,
in order to promote the transfer of technologies. In addition, specific
arrangements to promote the transfer of skills and technology will be agreed
and incorporated in bidding documents to apply equally to all bidders.
5.20      Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made against appropriate
documentation for 100% of the foreign exchange cost of imported goods and
services or 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured goods 1/.
In the case of local consultant services, including training specialists,
disbursements from the Bank loan would be made against 100% of their salaries.
The disbursement schedule relating to the Bank loan is shown in Annex 5.03.
Project Risks and Safeguards
5.21      A major cause of delays in the execution of NEPA's works has been,
in the past, the long time taken by the Federal Government authorities to
approve awards of large contracts. In view of the relatively high number of
contracts whici would be required under the procurement system to be followed
for the High Tension substations, the approval of awards should be substan-
tially speeded up. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the
government will take all necessary measures to expedite approvals of contracts
under the project.
5.22      The success of the training component depends upon the timely
appointment of Nigerian or expatriate staff to the various designated special-
ist posts. It is also essential that NEPA recruit other professional staff
for the training department, some of whom will be counterparts to the project
specialists. Salaries and conditions of service, including the provision of
housing, must be set at a level adequate to attract well-qualified experts.
At the same time, to avoid discrimination, these conditions would have to
apply to Nigerian specialists as well as expatriates. NEPA's permanent staff
are paid on civil service scales (para. 2.11) which are too low to attract and
maintain sufficient numbers of suitably qualified and experienced staff, even
for day-to-day operations. Given the reluctance of Government to modify
NEPA's salary structure, this could create anomalies, to which there is no
obvious simple solution.

bidding is not possible, due to high transport cost.

5.23      The provision of local finance by the Government for the project
itself is not likely to be a problem. Although overall economic and budgetary
constraints may make it more difficult for the Government to support NEPA's
overall investment program in the same manner as hitherto, the recent approval
of a substantial tariff increase (53%), which took effect from August 1979,
(para. 7.11), gives grounds for optimism. Furthermore, the government has
always given high priority to the development of the power sector and there
is no indication that this is likely to change. However, with the coming
into effect of the new constitution, from October 1979, Nigeria may be in for
a period of some uncertainty regarding future tariff policies and levels.
Proposed tariff covenants are reasonable and are in the best interests of
both NEPA and Government.
5.24      As explained in para. 1.05, the new constitution removes from
the federal authorities the exclusive right to generate and distribute elec-
tric power. The likely effect of these proposals on the power sector is, at
present, unknown (para. 1.06).
Environmental Aspects
5.25      The route of the High Tension lines has been selected to minimize
adverse aesthetical effects which maintain safety and service reliability
requirements. No adverse effects on the environment are expected.
Project Monitoring and Reporting
5.26      During negotiations project reporting requirements were discussed
with NEPA and assurances have been obtained that NEPA will submit to the Bank
appropriate quarterly reports. Particular emphasis will be placed upon finan-
cial indicators, including those relating to the collection of receivables.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
General
6.01      The Bank, through four previous loans (para 1.07), has played an
important role in the development of the power sector. The institutional
consolidation, through the creation of NEPA, has been one of the major
contributions. Considering the magnitude and complexity of the task and
the limitation with which NEPA has been faced since its inception, over-
all results justify further Bank support. Distribution expansion has
high priority and requires less extensive and time-consuming studies than
those required for the identification and selection of alternatives for
power generation projects. Furthermore, foreign financing facilities for
generation projects are normally more readily available than for distri-
bution projects, so that Bank involvement will be more appropriately
directed at the most difficult financing gap.
6.02      A potential limitation in NEPA's system development is the capa-
city to distribute power to the ultimate consumers at the required pace.



- 33 -
This problem may become critical in areas of high consumption and population
density for which a high degree of planning and managerial capability is
required. In the case of Lagos, long and medium-term planning of the
distribution system has been particularly difficult due to the uneven
and variable demand growth patterns in different sections of the city. It
has also been hampered by right-of-way restrictions and by the high cost
of installation arising from geographic pecularities such as water-ways
crossings. To this should be added tha lower priority that power util-
ities traditionally give to distribution planning activity, due to press-
ing day-to-day requirements to maintain service. All in all, therefore,
the distribution system appears to be the weakest link in the Nigerian power
sector. Hence the high priority for supporting NEPA's efforts in the expan-
sion of its distribution system.
6.03      Bank participation in the financing of power distribution pro-
jects would provide a good opportunity to analyze the characteristics of
power demand and costs of supply to the ultimate consumers. This would
help to promote the eventual adoption of a tariff system designed to
achieve greater optimality among economic, financial and social objectives.
It would also provide an opportunity to investigate the engineering
designs to reduce power distribution costs and to examine the possibility
of local manufacture of distribution equipment. Tangible results on these
aspects will require a series of Bank operations currently under discussion.
The urgency with which the power distribution system for the Lagos metro-
politan area needs to be expanded and the status of project preparation
makes the proposed distribution project in the Lagos area particularly
appropriate at this juncture.
Least Cost Solution
6.04      Based on the market study (para. 4.03), NEPA and the consultants
analyzed the size, location and the voltage levels of the injection sub-
stations and associated transmission lines to feed the 11 and 0.4 kV distri-
bution system. For this purpose, several alternative 132 and 33 kV schemes
were considered for each of the loading sectors of Lagos metropolitan area,
assuming different proportions of load to be fed directly to the 11 kV
system or through the 33 kV system. Availability of sites for location of
future 132 kV substations is uncertain due to difficulties in assuring
rights-of-way for overhead 132 kV supplying lines. Consequently, the solu-
tions adopted as the most economic (avoiding underground feeding lines)
and flexible in Lagos mainland, contemplate the installation of 132 kV sub-
stations where the construction of 132 kV overhead supplying lines is
already assured. Each substation will be provided with three winding trans-
formers to feed the 33 and 11 kV systems. In Lagos, Ikoyi and Victoria
islands, most of the distribution system would be fed from the 33 kV system
due to the difficulties in installing overhead 132 kV lines in the area.
The adopted schemes constitute the least cost solution under the right of
ways constraints prevailing in the Lagos metropolitan area.
6.05      The Lagos low voltage distribution system follows, in general,
the European concept, using relatively large (300-500 MVA) three-phase
11/0.5 kV distribution transformers, requiring extensive secondary (230-



- 34 -
400V) distribution. Limiting the secondary distribution by installing
smaller and more frequent distribution transformers presents several advan-
tages, such as lower power losses and better voltage regulation. Also, the
effects of transformer breakdowns are minimized. However, NEPA has decided
not to consider these new concepts in the Lagos area at present. According
to NEPA, a modification of the distribution concepts for the Lagos dis-
tribution expansion would create serious problems. These would include
possible delays on project execution and disadvantages inherent to the co-
existence of two systems (personnel, retraining, duplication of operational
instructions and spares). The analysis of distribution concepts is, however,
included in the terms of reference of the feasibility study for the power
distribution extension project for Nigeria's major cities, now under pre-
paration by consultants (para. 310).
Internal Economic Return
6.06      The Internal Economic Return (IER) has been estimated for the
expansion program required to serve the incremental power demand of the Lagos
area for the period 1980/81   1985/86, of which the proposed Bank project
forms a part. The return has been calculated by equating the present value of
the stream of incremental system investment and operating costs associated
with the program, with the present value of minimum benefits, as measured by
forecast revenues from sales of electricity to consumers at current tariff
levels. A shadow exchange rate of 1 N = 1.23 US$ has been adopted for con-
version of foreign cost. Labor cost was evaluated at market prices, as in
Nigeria there is no unemployment of skilled or semi-skilled workers required
for the execution of the project. The assumptions made for the IER calculation
are indicated in Annex 6.01.
6.07      The IER so calculated is 20% (see Annex 6.02).  The main uncertain-
ties which may affect this return are possible investment cost increases of
the proposed Bank project and lower than expected electricity sales. Should
the project cost be 10% higher and sales 10% lower than estimated, the cor-
responding return would be 17%.   If an alternative shadow exchange rate of
1N = 1.00 US$ were adopted, the IER for each of the abovementioned cases would
be 16% and 14% respectively. All these returns are understated as they do not
capture the consumer surplus generated by the project, which by its nature
eludes measurement.
Impact on Urban Poverty
6.08      With more than 90% of the Lagos population having access to
electricity (para. 4.01), a sizable portion of the urban poor already enjoy
at least minimum electricity service, often by up to 40 people sharing one
meter. The fresh demands to be met are concentrated in the currently low
and middle income areas. The present project would further extend power
to the poorer rather than the better-off households, virtually all of which
already benefit from full electric service. "Lifeline" rates for a basic
block of kilowatt-hours, already in use but to be further refined, will
make electricity affordable even to the very poor.

VII. FINANCE
Past and Present Financial Position
7.01      NEPA has had an obligation under Loan 847-UNI to achieve, from its
inception, a rate of return of at least 8% on revalued net fixed assets in
service. Since that date, even on book values, NEPA has never achieved the
required rate of return. NEPA's fixed assets were last professionally re-
valued as of April 1, 1972. If approximate annual revaluations, using appro-
priate price indices, are attributed to the subsequent fixed asset values,
NEPA ceased to make any positive net income after its financial year 1974/75.
Furthermore, since that year, rates of return, on revalued net fixed assets,
have been around zero. Until October 1977, tariffs had not been raised for
over ten years. At that time, a 30% increase in tariffs was implemented, as
a modest step towards compliance with the Bank covenant. The following
table summarizes NEPA's past financial results (cash figures expressed in
millions of Naira):

7.02      Reference to the above table shows that NEPA has been engaged in
a large construction program, financed increasingly by loans.  Because of
increasing administrative problems (paras. 2.23 and 2.24) there has also
been a considerable worsening in the level of receivables. Construction
is expected to be continued and expanded during the next several years,
requiring further large injections of capital finance. Full details of NEPA's
past results are included in Annexes 7.02 and 7.04.
7.03      In recent years, a number of loans have been raised from foreign
sources. However, these loans have provided only a small proportion of
NEPA's capital finance. The majority of NEPA's loans funds have come from



- 37 -
the Federal Government, on very easy terms.  Interest has been at 5%, with
repayment over 25 years, including a 5-year moratorium on interest, and a
5-year grace period on principal repayments. The effective interest rate
on such loans (allowing for the interest moratorium) has not been much more
than about 3%. There are indications that these financing terms may not be
as readily available in the future. As can be seen from the above table,
internal funds have contributed a decreasing proportion of capital invest-
ment requirements, down to about 7% in the year 1977/78.
Electricity Tariffs
7.04      The tariff schedules introduced in October 1977 and revised effec-
tive August 1, 1979 are predicated upon three types of supply:
(a) single-phase 230 volts service, applicable to
residential and small commercial/industrial consumers;
(b) small three-phase 400 volts service for commercial/
industrial consumers not exceeding 75 kVA of connected
capacity; and
(c) large three-phase service supplied at several voltage
levels up to 132 kV, with discounts depending on supply
voltages.
The present service classification seems to be adequate and of easy applica-
tion. The single-phase tariff schedule consists of a fixed monthly kW con-
nected capacity charge and the usual kWh consumption charge. Small circuit-
breakers are currently being installed, at every connection, set at the
connected capacities for which the consumers have paid. As well as limiting
maximum demand, the system permits a more orderly registration of consumer
requirements to facilitate planning by NEPA of its generation and distribution
systems.
7.05      Prior to August 1979, price schedules had all been on the declining
block system, which did not serve to discourage excessive and wasteful 1/
consumption. Furthermore, the application of this system to residential
services did not provide a satisfactory way to achieve social objectives.
The tariff structure introduced in August 1979 has alleviated this tendency,
as shown in the following table which compares average prices per kWh for
six typical cases, based on the old and the new tariff.
1/   A considerable number of residential consumers of the Lagos area have
consumption exceeding 5,000 kWh/month, presumably due to careless use
of air conditioning.

C    Residential              4             -        400      5.8    6.8       17
D    Industrial               -             8      2,000      6.3    7.8       24
E    Industrial               -            45     20,000      5.4    7.7       43

7.06      As can readily be perceived, residential tariffs are still rather
regressive from a social point of view. For low monthly consumption, repre-
senting the basic electricity needs of most of the low-income population,
the average unit price is about twice (previously four times) the average
price for high consumption, with.a wide use of electrical appliances, typical
of high-income consumers. This is contrary to the growing world-wide trend,
whereby low levels of consumption, sufficient to meet basic electricity needs,
are charged for at lower prices than for high-volume consumption.
7.07      The supply of electricity to the larger, densely-populated areas,
especially Lagos, is obviously less costly per unit, than supply to the
smaller cities with lower population densities. However, NEPA's policy
supported by Government, is to maintain uniform tariff levels nationwide.
In present circumstances, this seems a sensible and equitable policy, when
applied to residential consumers and to small or medium commercial and
industrial consumers.
7.08      Further refinement of tariff structures must await the establishment
of economic costs of supply for different classes and levels of consumption,
about which NEPA has little information. NEPA has taken preliminary steps
in this direction by seeking the assistance of consultants, Electricite
de France (EdF), specialists in this field, to carry out a tariff study
following incremental cost principles, financed under Loan 847-UNI (Power IV).
The results will be a further useful step in the rationalizing of NEPA's
rariffs.
7.09      The August 1979 tariff revision raised NEPA's average tariff level
by about 53%. It now equals US,9.1 per kWh (at the official exchange rate).
Although this increase will not immediately enable NEPA to attain the full
8% rate of return on revalued net fixed assets, it will contribute signifi-
cantly towards this objective. Indeed, the timing and extent of the increase
demonstrates a responsible initiative by the Government. Until recently,
1/   11 kV supply.



- 39 -
the possibility of NEPA making any tariff increase was inconceivable because
of the appalling shortage of generating capability and the serious public
discontent which ensued (para. 1.05). There is now every sign that NEPA's
services are improving considerably, with the recent and current additions of
substantial new generating capacities.
7.10      The tariff change is expected to enable NEPA to achieve a net
income of about N42 million in 1980/81 and about N22 million in 1981/82; rates
of return would be about 4% and 3% respectively, all figures taking into
account revaluation of fixed assets in operation. Annexes 7.02 to 7.04
include forecasts of NEPA's finances for the period 1978-1987. Annexes 7.05
and 7.06 include forecasts of possible changes in certain aspects of NEPA's
financial performance which would result from revaluation of its fixed assets.
Future Financial Performance
7.11      The recent tariff increase will not, of itself, solve all of NEPA's
future financial problems. Borrowings to date, large though they may be, are
much smaller than those likely to result from NEPA's projected requirements
for capital funds during the next several years. Large increments of genera-
tion capacity have recently been completed, are nearing completion, or are
committed for the immediate future with very little scope for cut-back.
Expenditure (in constant prices) on related transmission facilities has
reached a peak and is expected to fall substantially during the next few
years. The full benefits of this massive up-stream investment can, there-
fore, only be made fully available to the consumers by the expected increas-
ing development of distribution facilities. Thus, capital expenditures on
these next stages of NEPA's investment program can be curtailed only at the
risk of reducing and delaying the development of potential revenue from
sales and leaving a large share of invested capacity not fully utilized.
7.12      The proposed Bank and EIB loans, together with possible Bank financ-
ing of future projects, are likely to cover only a very small proportion of
NEPA's huge 10-year investment program. Furthermore, NEPA's activities are
in such a vital sector of the economy and its investment requirements are
so enormous, that its problems cannot be reviewed in isolation from those
of the rest of the economy. These, in turn, depend significantly upon
developments within the oil industry.
7.13      Two important matters must, therefore, be continually addressed by
NEPA and the Government, over the next several years:
(a)  sources, timing and terms on which the necessary funds may
be raised to support the investment program; and
(b)  the inter-relationship of investment financing with profit-
ability, funds flow and other aspects of NEPA's overall
financial performance.



- 40 -
7.14      The clear preference of NEPA's management, at present, is for
virtually all capital finance to be provided by the Federal Government.
Indeed, in the short run, there is very little alternative, because NEPA's
unsatisfactory and hitherto deteriorating financial performance could not
have supported the raising of capital finance from local or foreign private
sources. Although this somewhat simplistic approach solves the financing
problems from NEPA's perspective, the burden is merely shifted to the Federal
Government, because the funds still have to be raised, within Nigeria's
economy. In conjunction with the proposed Bank project, agreement has been
reached that the Federal Government will periodically discuss with the Bank
its proposals for the financing of NEPA's investment program and that it will
take all necessary measures to facilitate a further rationalization of NEPA's
tariff levels and structures.
7.15      Whilst there is no alternative to massive Federal Government
financial support in the immediate future, efforts recently initiated must
be sustained and improved upon, so as to achieve the desired gradual improve-
ment of NEPA's overall financial performance. A significant component in
these efforts must be further tariff increases, coupled with tariff re-
structuring. This action would, in time:
(a) provide a significant increase in the proportion of
investment funds generated from internal sources (i.e.
by electricity charges) and correspondingly less by
borrowing through the Government, often from abroad;
(b) improve the overall financial performance of NEPA,
thereby increasing its credibility to potential lenders;
(c) confront consumers with conservation/demand choices at
prices closer to economic costs.
7.16      In addition to the recent tariff increase, explained in para.
7.09 above, agreement has been reached that NEPA will take all necessary
steps to achieve no later than by its fiscal year 1982/83 the full require-
ments of the tariff covenant of Loan 847-UNI, i.e. a rate of return of 8%
on revalued fixed assets in operation. During the period following the
recent changes in government, a degree of uncertainty exists regarding the
extent and timing of further tariff increases, which might not be fully
resolved for about two years. Therefore, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that NEPA would take all necessary steps to obtain a rate of
return of at least 2% in 1979/80, 4% in 1980/81, 3% in 1981/82, and 8% in
1982/83. One practical problem is that NEPA has not adjusted the book value
of its fixed assets to allow for inflation since the last professional revalu-
ation of April 1, 1972. Currently, uncertainties exist internationally
within the accounting profession on the general question of asset revaluation
and inflation accounting. Consequently, NEPA is inhibited from taking a
definitive position of its own on this matter. Assurances were therefore
obtained during negotiations, that acceptable revaluation methods, including
the ones shown in Annex 7.01, would be discussed at appropriate times, and
agreed upon, between NEPA and the Bank.



- 41 -
7.17      The statement of NEPA's funds flow during the project period (para.
7.23) shows that only about 20% of investment requirements will be met from
its internal funds. However, reference to NEPA's projected funds flow state-
ment (Annex 7.03) indicates that, with appropriate future tariff adjustments
NEPA would, by 1982/83, after covering its debt service, be enabled to con-
tribute from internal funds about 34% of its three-year average investment
costs. This percentage could conceivably rise to over 50% by 1986/87.
However, the forecasts for later years must be treated with caution. Firstly,
interest rates might be considerably in excess of the 6% which NEPA now
expects to pay for Federal Government loans. Secondly, a deterioration in the
exchange rate could significantly increase debt service obligations on past
or future foreign loans. Finally, the same possible deterioration in the
exchange rate, coupled with general inflation of foreign and local costs
(in excess of those already allowed for), could bring about a significant
increase in the costs of NEPA's investment program. A 25% increase in in-
terest rates, together with a 20% increase in investment costs could, with the
same tariffs result in contributions from internal funds towards the invest-
ment program of less than 20% in 1982/83, rising to less than 30% by 1986/87,
by no means an outstanding performance in view of NEPA's relatively low
overall cost of capital and the adequate grace periods on its debt service.
This strongly suggests that the 8% rate of return requirement, established
under earlier loan agreements, continues to be a reasonable performance
target.
7.18      Any reduction in revenue from a fall in energy sales is likely to
be compensated by corresponding reduction in fuel costs. In any given year,
hydro-power generation, depending upon hydrological conditions, is unlikely
to be curtailed as much as thermal generation. Other immediate cost-savings
from reduced energy sales are unlikely to materialize unless the sales re-
ductions are part of a long-term trend, perceived far enough in advance to
affect the planning of the capital development program.
7.19      Based on its published financial statements from 1977/78, NEPA's
debt:equity ratio is about 70:30, which would appear to give very little lee-
way for raising additional debt, without increasing equity contributions also.
However, NEPA's past debt obligations have been eroded by inflation. As
indicated by the tables in paragraph 7.01 and Annex 7.06, its March 1978
debt:equity ratio, on the basis of revalued net fixed assets, was only about
45:55, still well within tolerable limits to support additional borrowings.
7.20      The necessity for additional Government equity contributions and
the possible extent and timing thereof are difficult to predict. So long
as present inflationary trends continue to be reflected in the revaluation
of NEPA's fixed assets, the ratio of equity to debt will increase automati-
cally. This could, of course, be offset by the effect of a currency devalua-
tion upon foreign debt directly held by NEPA. However, since it is assumed
that the bulk of NEPA's borrowing in the immediate future will be in local
currency from the Federal Government, the net effect will almost certainly be
net improvement in the debt equity position. Using the methods of fixed asset
revaluation based on indices (Annex 7.01), NEPA's debt:equity ratio would



- 42 -
rise to about 64:36 in 1979/80, falling thereafter to below 50:50 by 1986/87.
Thus it may be that NEPA's overall debt levels would be kept within reasonable
bounds, without any contributions of actual cash by the Government. In addi-
tion, the Government, as NEPA's only shareholder, has the option of converting
any of its debt to equity at relatively short notice should the need arise.
7.21      Under the proposed tariff arrangements referred to in paras 7.09
and 7.16 NEPA will achieve debt service coverage (including capitalized
interest) of between about 1.4 and 2 times for the period 1979/80 to 1981/82,
between about 2 and 2.5 times in later years, subject to the reservations
expressed in para 7.17. In this connection, Loan 847-UNI contains an agree-
ment that NEPA will raise loans only with the consent of the Bank, unless its
net cash earnings, before depreciation and interest exceed 1.5 times its
expected debt service in any future year, including debt service on the amount
to be borrowed. This agreement would be continued.
Financing Plan
7.22      As discussed in paras 7.12 to 7.14, the financing plan for the
proposed project is of relatively minor importance compared with that for
the overall investment program of NEPA during the project period. Table 7.03
gives details of NEPA's future funds flows, summarized below (in current
prices) for the project period, 1979/80 to 1983/84;

7.23      NEPA's estimated funds requirements for the period total about
N 4,200 million (US$6,500 million). Of this sum, about N 3,600 million
(US$5,600 million) or about 86%, would be for investment in fixed assets,
including N 144 million (US$222 million) identified as the Bank project,
amounting to just over 3% of funds requirements. The remaining 14% of re-
quirements, totalling about N 600 million (US$900 million) would be for the
increases in working capital, necessary to support the substantial expansion
of NEPA's operations, including trends necessary to cover the expected contin-
uation of a high level of receivables.
7.24      For the same period, internal funds are expected to generate about
N 1,750 million (US$2,700 million) towards NEPA's funds requirements, but
almost half of this sum would be absorbed by debt service, leaving about
N 840 million (US$1,300 million) to finance about 20% of NEPA's capital
expenditure and working capital requirements. Almost all of the remainder,
apart from very minor consumer contributions, would come from loans.
7.25      The Bank loan would be US$100 million, converting to N 64.9 mil-
lion. Interest would be at the standard rate (currently 7.95% per annum) with
repayment over 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The loan from the
European Investment Bank would be UA 25.0 million 1/, converting to approxi-
mately US$35.0 million or N 22.7 million. Interest is expected to be at about
7% per annum and repayment is expected to be over about 16 years, including 4
years of grace.
7.26      By far the largest loans, covering almost 78% of total funds re-
quirements, are assumed to come from the Federal Government in accordance
with current practice. During the project period, such loans are expected
to total about N 3,300 million (US$5,000 million). Latest indications to
NEPA have been that these loans would carry a 6% per annum interest rate
with repayment over 25 years, including 5 years of grace. In due course,
other foreign loans, on different terms, might well be substituted for a
proportion of the Government loans. These other loans could conceivably in-
clude further loans from the Bank, together with additional co-financing or
independent commercial lending, depending upon NEPA's growing financial
stature in international markets.

VIII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED
Assurances and Covenants
8.01      Agreements have been reached with the Government and with NEPA,
as appropriate, upon the following matters:
(a) promptly notify the Bank of any changes in NEPA's operational
responsibilities (para. 1.06);
(b)  reference in loan documents to legislation adversely affecting
NEPA's operations as specific circumstances where the Bank might
apply its customary remedies (para. 1.06);
(c) improvement in the recording and analysis of power failures (para.
2.05);
(d) NEPA would endeavor to improve the number of consumer per employee
ratio (para. 2.09);
(e) review with the government and the Bank of arrangements to recover
overdue accounts (para. 2.24);
(f) satisfactory employment of consultants (para. 5.13);
(g) submission to the Bank, for review, of details of intended appoin-
tees to the posts covered by the project training component and
appointment of the Director of Training not later than Dec. 31, 1979
(para 5.18).
(h) granting by Government of permits, licenses and exceptions for
the project execution (para. 5.19);
(i) expedient government approval of contract awards (para. 5.21);
(j) submission to the Bank of appropriate quarterly reports (para.
5.26);
(k) periodic discussions with the Bank of Government's proposals for
the financing of NEPA's investment program and further rationaliza-
tion of NEPA's tariff levels and structures (para. 7.14);
(1) achievement of interim targets of financial performance (para.
7.16); and
(m) discussions at appropriate time to agree on methodology for the
valuation of net fixed assets, to be used as the basis for the
calculation of rates of return (para. 7.16).
8.02      The following provisions of Loan 847-UNI should be repeated under
the proposed loan:



- 45 -
(a)  the annual audit of NEPA's financial statements within four months
of the end of each fiscal year (para. 2.27);
(b)  from NEPA's fiscal year 1982/83, achievement of an 8% rate of return
on the average value of net fixed assets in operation (para. 7.16);
and
(c)  no incurrence of long-term debt by NEPA, without Bank concurrence,
unless net revenues are at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service
requirement for any succeeding fiscal year (para. 7.21).
Recommendation
8.03      With the agreements described in the above paragraphs, the project
constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$100 million equivalent.
The loan would be repaid over a period of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace.

AGREED MINUTES
concerning
Procurement for Bank-assisted Projects in Nigeria
During negotiations of the Lagos Power Distribution and the Bauchi
Urban Development Projects, representatives of the Federal Republic of Nigeria
(the Government) and the Bank discussed the likely effects on projects
assisted by the Bank in Nigeria of the Companies Decree, 1968 (No. 51), the
Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree, 1977, and the new guidelines embodied
in a recent Federal Government Circular.
In a memorandum submitted to representatives of the Bank, the
representatives of the Government explained that the objective of these
decrees was to ensure greater local control of companies operating in Nigeria
and to establish a context conducive to the more effective transfer of tech-
nology and know-how to Nigerian nationals.
Bank representatives assured the Nigerian delegation that the
Bank fully supported the Government's objectives. However, the new guide-
lines of the Government appear to limit the exemptions which were available or
could be granted to Bank-assisted projects under the provisions of the Compa-
nies (Special Provisions) Decree, 1973 (No. 19), and if applied in their
present form would thus be inconsistert with the Bank's policies on Interna-
tional Competitive Bidding. Accordingly it was agreed that the Bank and the
Government should endeavor to reach an understanding that would accomodate the
Government's development objectives with respect to the transfer of technology
and at the same time be consistent with the Bank's requirements concerning
International Competitive Bidding.
As a result of the discussions the following understandings were
reached by the two sides:
(1) Companies wishing to participate in International Competitive
Bidding under Bank-assisted projects in Nigeria, will be exempted
from the new guidelines. These guidelines, among other things,
require such companies to be incorporated within a year of their
arrival in Nigeria. The Government would require such companies to
employ Nigerian staff to understudy the companies' expatriate staff.
Specific arrangements to promote the transfer of skills and technol-
ogy will be discussed between the Bank and the executing agency for
each project and agreed arrangements will be specified in the
bidding documents to apply equally to all bidders.
(2) The understanding stated in (1) above will apply to the Lagos Power
Distribution and Bauchi Urban Development Projects and all other
projects to be negotiated.

Assumptions Adopted in the IERR Calculation
1.         The equalizing discount rate of economic cost and benefits has
been calculated for the expansion of the Lagos distribution system required
to serve the incremental demand for the period 1980/81 -1985/86 (para. 4.06).
The local cost and the benefits of the Bank project have been valued in US$ at
a shadow exchange rate of -N 1 = US$1.23. Under these assumptions the project
cost is estimated at US$142.73 million.
2.        The incremental demand for the period, measured at 11 kV level, is
estimated at 620 MW (see Table 4.02). It has been considered that the optimal
solutions for the required incremental generation would be the installation
of 2 gas turbine stations of 330 MW each, to be commissioned in 1980/81 and
1983/84, using natural gas at the Niger delta gas-oil fields and two trans-
mission line circuits to Lagos at 330 kV. The life of the required facilities
has been assumed at 20 years for generation and 35 years for transmission and
distribution.
3.        The investment cost of generation, including a step-up substation,
has been estimated at US$350/kW and 330 kV transmission at US$150,000/km per
circuit. The foreign cost component of generation and transmission facilities
has been assumed at 70% and 60% of the total cost respectively. Fixed annual
operating and maintenance cost of generation and transmission has been
estimated at 5%, 4% and 6% of investment cost in generation, transmission and
distribution respectively. The variable cost (fuel) of generation has been
calculated on the basis of (i) the gas price evaluated at its opportunity
cost (exporting as LNG) which approximatel! coincides with the price paid by3
NEPA to NNPC, estimated at US$15.0/1,000 m and (ii) a consumption of 0.41 m
/kWh of net generation.
4.        The distribution requirements not included in the proposed Bank
project were estimated as follows: the 330 kV receiving and substation and
the 132 kV lines and substations, on the basis of actual contracts adjusted
to 1979/80 prices and the 11 and 0.4 kV system at the same average cost per
kW of incremental demand of the distribution part of the proposed Bank
project. The annual incremental operation and maintenance cost of the 11 and
0.4 kV distribution has been estimated at 6% of the investment cost. Benefits
were calculated on the basis of the average revenue per kWh sold in the Lagos
area at present tariffs (0.050 N/kWh).

CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL RATIOS
FOR
PURPOSES OF LOAN AGREEMENT
A. Valuation of Fixed Assets and Accumulated Depreciation
1.        Establishment of gross value of fixed assets in operation, as at any
date required for the purposes of the loan agreement, should be by one of the
following methods:
(a) professional valuation, acceptable to the Bank, as shown in
the books of NEPA;
(b) valuation established by the application of appropriate
accounting principles, incorporating procedures for current
cost, as shown in the books of NEPA; or
(c) valuation established by the application of agreed indices,
to update valuations last established by methods (a) or (b)
above, such updated valuations to be acceptable to the Bank
but not necessarily appearing in the books of NEPA.
2.       W4here method (b) is used, a permanent memorandum record would be kept
of the valuations and the related calculations.
3.        Where method (c) is used, the indices would be weighted (e.g. 35%
for local cost inputs and 65% for foreign cost inputs). In the absence of
well-established indices precisely relevant to construction costs in the
electricity industry, and for the purpose of simplification, local costs might
be deemed to be changed in accordance with the official Consumer Price Index
for Nigeria. Foreign costs might be deemed to be changed in accordance with
the IBRD Index of International Inflation, and converted at the ruling rate
of exchange. By agreement between NEPA and the Bank, other weightings and
indices could be substituted. The established indices would be used to
annually update the following values, in a logical and consistent manner:
(a) gross value of fixed assets in operation;
(b) gross value of fixed assets under construction; and
(c) accumulated depreciation.

Page 2
B. Adlustment of Annual Depreciation Charge
4.        In any case where valuations of fixed assets, established for the
purposes of the loan agreement, were inconsistent with the valuations of such
assets as shown in the books of NEPA, there would be an adjustment to the
depreciation charged used in the calculation of "net income before interest"
(and any other needed figure derived from this) established for the purposes
required by the loan agreement. The book depreciation charge would first be
expressed as a percentage of the gross book values of fixed assets in operation,
averaging as appropriate. This percentage would be applied to the gross
revalued fixed assets in operation, in the same manner as to the book values.
The resulting number would then be substituted for the book depreciation
charge. It would also be incorporated into the value for "accumulated
depreciation."
C. Indices
5.        The following indices have been used as the basis for calculations
made for revaluations under the method shown in para. l(c), for the purposes
of the financial tables shown in Annexes 7.05 and 7.06.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL FORECASTS
General
1.        The financial forecasts shown in Annexes 7.02 to 7.04 are based on
a ten-year financial forecast originally prepared by NEPA in April 1978, but
subsequently updated, in discussions with Bank staff, to allow for various
changes, in particular:
(a) estimated commissioning of several generation facilities;
(b) load and capacity forecasts;
(c) electricity sales forecasts;
(d) operating costs, especially as relating to fuel costs
and administrative expenses;
(e) foreign exchange costs for the service of outstanding
foreign loans; and
(f) expected electricity tariffs.
2.        Costs are estimated in current prices, using various combinations
of price indices for different types of expenditures.
3.        Unless and until appropriate accounting procedures for current cost
accounting are established with greater clarity and certainty, NEPA will
continue to keep its accounts on the basis of historical costs. The financial
statements in Annexes 7.02 to 7.04 reflect this reality. However, the
statements in Annex 7.05 show the effects upon NEPA's financial statements of
assumed revaluation of fixed assets from April 1972, the date of its last
formal revaluation. Annex 7.06 shows the effect of such revaluations upon
NEPA's debt:equity ratios.
Income Statements
4.        Sales of electricity are based on latest available forecasts from
NEPA of sales to various categories of consumers. Based on recent notifications,
a general tariff increase of about 70% has been assumed to take effect from
July 1, 1979, with further increases as necessary to maintain an 8% rate of
return on revalued net fixed assets, from NEPA's fiscal year 1982/83.
5.        Operating costs reflect growing sales volume.  Fuel costs allow for
recently implemented substantial price increases, based on the assumption
that available hydro-electric capacity would operate according to load
factors within the range of 35%-40%.

Annex 7.07

6.        Depreciation charges are based on the following assumptions:
Thermal Generating Plant                 4.705%
Hydro Generating Plant                   2.173%
Transmission & Transformation Plant    2.473%
Distribution Plant                        3.494%
General Plant                             7.793%
Non-power Plant & Structures             3.333%
7.        Interest costs have been based upon the known terms of loan already
contracted and upon the loan terms referred to in paragraphs 7.28 and 7.29 of
the main report. Appropriate interest costs have been allocated to the
costs of fixed assets under construction.
Funds Flow Statements
8.        After allowing for appropriate internal funds generation, based on
tariff levels referred to in paragraph 4 (above), the remainder of NEPA's
capital financing, with very minor exceptions, is assumed to come from loans.
Specific provision is made for the terms and conditions of the Bank and EIB
loans, as explained in paragraph 7.28 of the main report. The balance of
financing is assumed to come from Federal Government loans, on terms and
conditions explained in paragraph 7.29 of the main report. It is understood
that other loans (particularly foreign loans) might be substituted, in due
course, for some of the Federal Government financing.
9.        Estimated capital expenditure is based upon NEPA's investment
program, adjusted as explained in paragraph 1.
10.       Debt charges are based upon known or expected terms and conditions
of currently contracted and expected identifiable future loans and upon the
assumptions relating to Federal Government loans already referred to.
Balance Sheets
11.       As explained in paragraph 3, fixed assets are shown in Annex 7.04
at historical costs, with adjustments, based upon revaluations, being given
in Annex 7.05.
12.       Annual increases in inventories reflect the growth of NEPA's
operations and price escalation. Consumer receivables, expressed as a
percentage of sales revenue, is estimated to gradually fall from about 50%
in 1978/79 to about 30% by about 1986/87. Included in other receivables are
advance payments for contracts and supplies. Increases in estimated cash and
bank balances reflect the growth of NEPA's operations.
13.       No changes are assumed in Government equity contributions, as
discussed in the text of the report.
14.       Balances of existing foreign loans have been converted to Naira
at the exchange rates ruling on March 31, 1978. No assumptions have been
made alhout subsequent exchange rate changes.

15.       Accounts payable represent 2.5 months cash operating expenses
(excluding salaries and wages). Contract retentions represent about 10%
of costs fixed assets under construction and payments to contractors are
assumed to be made within one month of the issue of certificates.
Ratios
16.       The financial ratios in Annexes 7.02 to 7.04 are based on the
figures in those tables. As such, they reflect the fact that fixed assets
appear therein at historical costs. Revised ratios reflecting fixed asset
revaluation, are shown in Annexes 7.05 and 7.06.
17.       In addition to the ratios more commonly used, two additional
ratios, considered relevant, have been introduced:
(a) minimum financial cost of capital (calculated as the average
interest rate multiplied by the percentage of debt in the debt:
equity ratio) reflects a minimum payout rate on debt and equity
combined, for comparison with the rate of return, on the assumption
of no payment of dividends on equity; and
(b) capital expenditure intensity ratio (calculated as the capital
investment costs divided by cash operating costs) reflects
year-by-year fluctuations in capital investment, relative to
the general size of the authority's operations, giving some
indications of the potential strain on staffing and other
resources. This ratio also helps to make more meaningful
year-to-year comparisons of ratios of internal funds as
contributions towards capital expenditures, especially where
there are significant annual fluctuations.
