MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Program Completion Report on Democratic and Popular Republic
of Algeria - Economic Reform Suooort Loan (ERSL) (Loan 311 7-ALI
Attached is the Program Completion Report on Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria -
Economic Reform Support Loan (ERSL) (Loan 311 7-AL). Parts I and IlIl were prepared by the Middle
East and North Africa Regional Office. Part II has not been received from the Borrower.
The main objective of the program was to restore sustainable economic growth, with
stability, while creating job opportunities and protecting the most vulnerable groups in society. The
primary focus of the proposed action plan was a gradual transformation of the centrally planned
economy into a more decentralized, market-oriented system. By the time of Board approval of the
ERSL, in August 1 989, Algeria had already initiated reform measures in the agricultural sector, with
the transformation of state farms into medium- and small-size private farms. With the ERSL, the
scope of the reform efforts was widened to cover a broad range of issues across the economy.
The policy measures stipulated in the ERSL were implemented as agreed, except for the
transformation of public enterprises into autonomous Economic Public Enterprises: this condition was
waived for second tranche release, because the process was ongoing, though with some delay. The
economic reform program, however, did not achieve its main objectives. While the Bank had
reviewed the sensitivity of projected outcomes to external shocks, especially to a decline in oil prices
(as it turned out, oil prices exceeded base case projections), the existing stock of external debt had
been under-reported by a large margin. The higher than expected debt service squeezed imports and
thereby constrained GDP growth. In addition, the action program in the public enterprise sector did
not immediately address some of the key issues, i.e. redundant labor and unviable firms. The net
result was a major shortfall in achieving the fundamental objectives of the program. GDP grew little
and unemployment rose sharply.  Value added declined in all sectors, except for agriculture,
hydrocarbons and public administration. The outcome was unsatisfactory. The program also proved
to be unsustainable: trade restrictions were again intensified in 1 992 and rationing of domestic credit
and of foreign exchange increased.  On the other hand, the program  did make a substantial
contribution to institutional development in several areas, including the restoration of the banking
system to a more traditional role, price liberalization and the abolishment of import monopolies.
The PCR provides a very good assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the operation.
The continuing severe economic crisis and associated political instability interrupted the execution
of Algeria's reform program during most of 1993. However, by early 1994 efforts were resumed
to restore the momentum of the reform program in cooperation with both the IMF and the Bank.
A follow-up operation, the Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL), was
approved by the Board on June 21, 1991. OED will audit the ERSL and EFSAL jointly.

PROGRAM COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC & POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
ECONOMIC REFORM SUPPORT LOAN (ERSL)
(LOAN 3117-AL)
PREFACE
The Economic Reform Support Loan (ERSL) to Algeria was approved by the Board
on August 31, 1989, for an amount of US$300 million. The loan was closed nine months
behind schedule on September 30, 1992. On that date an amount of US$1.55 million
remained to be disbursed.  A further amount of US$0.3 million was disbursed on
December 31, 1992, for goods shipped prior to the closing date.
This Program Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Country Operations
Division of the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (MN1CO). On December 8,
1 992, the Bank sent a letter to the Borrower with a formal request to submit Part II. As yet,
Part 11 has not been received.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's supervision mission of the
ERSL in October 1992. The basic information is drawn from the President's Report
(P-5114-AL), the loan agreement, supervision reports, internal Bank papers and documents
provided by the Algerian authorities. The PCR has also benefitted from numerous discussions
with Algerian officials and industrialists, as well as with Bank and IMF staff members who had
been involved with the implementation of the Algerian adjustment program.

PROGRAM COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC & POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
ECONOMIC REFORM SUPPORT LOAN (ERSL)
(LOAN 3117-AL)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
In the two decades following independence, Algeria followed a policy of heavy
industrialization based on central planning. The Government took advantage of the increase
in oil prices in the late seventies to raise investments from one third to nearly one half of GDP.
But, in spite of a booming hydrocarbon sector and huge investments, real GDP increased by
only 6% a year in the seventies and 5% in the first part of the eighties. The economy became
increasingly dependent on the hydrocarbon sector which accounted for 97% of export
earnings and 44% of government revenues in 1984-1985. As long as oil prices remained
high, the inefficiencies of the system could be covered up, but the situation changed
dramatically with the collapse of oil prices in 1986.
The drawbacks of central planning appeared most clearly in the case of agriculture,
which helps explain why the first liberalization measures were taken in this sector. The
transformation of state-farms into medium- and small-size private farms in 1 988 was the first
major change. The reformers, who came to power in that year, understood that the entire
Algerian economy had to be liberalized in order to restore growth and serious negotiations
were initiated with the Fund and the Bank. The IMF stand-by approved by the Board on
May 31, 1989, was, however, limited to the first credit tranche, which implies limited
conditionality. The Economic Reform Support Loan (ERSL) approved by the Bank Board three
months later supported a progressive liberalization of the economy and covered a wide range
of reform measures.
The program supported by the ERSL aimed at progressively eliminating the main
sources of price distortions and creating an institutional environment hospitable to private
enterprises. It was regarded by the authorities and Bank staff concerned as the first in a
series of adjustment operations which would support the transition of the economy to a
market basis. Most national public enterprises were transformed into autonomous Economic
Public Enterprises (EPE) which had to operate on the basis of commercial laws. Import
monopolies were, in principle, abolished and prices, which had been administratively
determined, were liberalized for items accounting for about half of the weight of goods
covered in the consumer price index (CPI). The banking system, which had largely been used
as an accounting office for the Government, was set on a path toward its normal function of
financial intermediation and the Central Bank became responsible for the formulation and
monitoring of monetary policies. The expansion of the supply of money and credit and the
increase in the CPI remained within the limits established in the 1989 and 1990 monetary
programs. Labor contracts, which were previously determined centrally, became negotiable
at the enterprise level.
In brief, the measures stipulated in the ERSL were generally implemented to the
satisfaction of the Bank and the second tranche was released approximately one year after
the loan became effective. On this basis, it could be said that the program was implemented



- iv -
in a satisfactory manner. However, the more fundamental objectives of the program were not
fully achieved. Real GDP was projected to increase by 5% on average from 1989 to 1995;
instead, growth averaged only about 1.6% per annum between 1989 and 1992. The debt-
service ratio was projected to fall from 67% in 1988 to 50% in 1990, and to remain at about
this level in the two following years; instead, it rose to 74% in 1991 and is estimated to have
reached 79% in 1992. Unemployment rose sharply, particularly among the population below
30 years of age. The high expectations built up in the seventies and the early eighties
remained unfulfilled, resulting in a widespread dissatisfaction that has been exploited by the
political opponents of the regime. In conclusion, despite the important progress achieved in
implementing reform, the economic crisis remains severe.
To a significant extent, the failure to restore growth is a result of the fact that the
debt problem turned out to be more serious than foreseen on the basis of data available at the
time. The authorities were not aware of about US$5 billion of external debt, much of it of
short maturity. This underestimation of the debt stock was, in a sense, a negative external
shock, offsetting other positive shocks. When the sensitivity of the projections to external
shocks was assessed in documents submitted to the Boards of the Bank and the Fund in
1 989, the staff of each institution indicated that the major external risk was a sharp decline
in oil prices from levels assumed in the base projections. World oil prices, in fact exceeded
projected levels, in particular in 1 990 as a result of the Gulf crisis, and actual export earnings
exceeded the base projections by US$6 billion in nominal terms over the 1988-91 period.
However, the debt service burden was much higher than expected, which also affected
Algeria's ability to attract new external financing. At the same time, the country was hit by
another adverse external shock -- the fall in the value of the dollar which increased the dollar
value of the debt and reduced the purchasing power of hydrocarbon exports. As a result, the
volume of imports declined sharply after 1989. By 1 991, imports, in both value and volume
terms, were well below the levels projected in 1 989. This compression of imports hindered
the ability of the economy to respond to economic reforms.
Another important factor was the apparent underestimation by policymakers of the
internal adjustment difficulties likely to be encountered in shifting from central planning to a
reliance on market forces, and for building up a diversified economy from one financed almost
exclusively from oil and gas. It is also relevant that the ERSL was negotiated before the fall
of the Berlin wall, when the Bank had only limited experience in addressing the problems
encountered in liberalizing centrally planned economies.
A major lesson learned from the experience of the ERSL is the importance of quality
external debt data. It is doubtful that the program would have met the test of financial
viability, had staff known the true magnitude of the external debt stock. Another lesson is
the importance of assessing terms of trade risks associated with large movements in major
currencies, especially for primary commodity exporting countries. A third lesson, of course,
is that social and political factors are an important consideration, and an important risk, in
economic adjustment.



PROGRAM COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC & POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
ECONOMIC REFORM SUPPORT LOAN (ERSL)
(LOAN 3117-AL)
PART l: THE BANK'S ASSESSMENT OF THE ERSL
A. BACKGROUND
1.      Shortly after gaining independence, Algeria adopted a socialist growth model
emphasizing heavy industrialization. On the one hand, substantial resources were devoted to
education and basic health care; on the other, the labor force thus upgraded was provided
with modern, publicly owned factories and the infrastructure was improved. This model was
applied with great enthusiasm under President Boumedienne (1965-1978); it was seen as the
fast track for developing the economy.
2.      The 1974 oil price boom was perceived as an opportunity for accelerating the
industrialization process. The ratio of investment to GDP was raised from one-third in
1970-1973 to almost one half in 1976-1979. With such a high ratio and an incremental
capital-output ratio averaging 4, real per capita GDP should have quadrupled from 1976 to
1992. However, in actuality, the annual growth rate of per capita GDP declined from about
3% during the seventies to 2% during the first half of the eighties, and it fell to about minus
2.2% over the period of 1 986 through 1 992.
3.      Before the end of the seventies, it became clear that the high expectations built up
earlier could not be fulfilled. The drawbacks of central planning appeared most clearly in the
case of state-farms which accounted for the major part of Algeria's agricultural potential. In
spite of large government investments in the state-farm sector, production and yields were
not improving and Algeria's dependence on food imports was rapidly increasing. The time-
lags required for completing large public investment projects also became unduly long, notably
regarding housing, which meant that capital was immobilized for long periods without
generating any return. Moreover, most of the new industrial plants were running substantially
below capacity. For all these reasons, the incremental capital-output ratio became abnormally
high.'
4.      As occurred in most oil exporting countries after the tripling of oil prices, a number
of individuals accumulated wealth rapidly, which was resented by the population. The initial
enthusiasm for building up a modern socialist state faded progressively and the manner in
which the oil bonanza was redistributed became the object of more frequent recriminations.
5.      In an attempt to satisfy the most pressing demands, a complex system of taxes and
subsidies was progressively established. This created various sources of price distortions
which were exploited by operators on the black market, known as "trabendo". On the one
' The ICOR calculated as the average of the current and four preceding years increased from 7 In 1983-8e to 19 In 1988 and reached
194 In 1990 in view of the stagnation in real GDP after 1986 (Statistical Annex, Table 3).

hand, a number of items were unavailable on the official market despite the large inflow of
petro-dollars going into the Central Bank. On the other hand, real interest rates were negative
and the money supply was abundant. The combination of a money overhang with commodity
shortages helps explain why the discrepancy between the parallel and the official market
exchange rates increased steadily until 1985, when the price of the dollar was five times
higher on the parallel market than on the official one (see Figure 1). Such a divergence was
enormous for a country earning up to one-third of its GDP (equivalent to about US$600 per
capita) from exports of oil and gas.
6.      As long as oil prices remained high, the inefficiencies of the system could be covered
up. After the collapse of oil prices in 1 986, these inefficiencies became obvious. From 1 985
to 1987, imports had to be cut by one quarter in current dollars and by almost one-third in
volume terms. This reduction not only adversely affected investments and the consumption
of imported consumer goods; it also reduced the level of activity of domestic industries which
became starved of imported inputs and spare parts. As a result, unemployment increased and
per capita consumption declined; this generated widespread dissatisfaction which was
politically exploited.
7.       In order to find a viable equilibrium, two options were to be considered: - one was
to tighten controls; the other was to eliminate the sources of price distortions by liberalizing
the economy. A group of reformers favoring the second option came to power in June 1 988;
they worked out a program which was supported by the IMF and the World Bank in 1989
(Table 1). The Economic Reform Support Loan (ERSL, Loan 3117-AL), which is the object of
the present completion report, was approved by the Bank Board in August 1989.2

8.      Although the first liberalization measures were taken in agriculture (see para. 11),
the Bank decided to support the program with a structural adjustment operation rather than
sector adjustment loan. This decision was based on an agreement with the authorities that
the economy was in need of broad-based reform. In order to support the emergence of a
strong supply response to the adjustment and reform program, the Bank's strategy
encompassed a substantial investment lending component for projects in agriculture (including
large-scale irrigation and agricultural credit), infrastructure (notably transportation and water
supply), and the social sectors (particularly vocational training and higher education). The
strategy also included a Technical Assistance Project (Loan No. 31 76-AL) to strengthen the
key institutions administrating the economic reform program, notably the Ministry of the
Economy and the Central Bank.
9.      Significant progress was achieved under the ERSL, but the political situation became
increasingly difficult and the reformers believed that the only way to liberalize the economy
was to act rapidly. Accordingly, in the early part of 1991, they worked out a program of
accelerated reforms aimed at restructuring the public enterprise and banking sectors,
liberalizing external trade, unifying the official and parallel foreign exchange markets, and
establishing convertibility for most current account transactions. This program was supported
by a second IMF standby and a second World Bank adjustment loan, the Enterprise and
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL, Loan 3352-AL). The decision to proceed with the
EFSAL despite the turbulent political situation was justified by the urgent need to accelerate
economic reform and restore growth. However, by the time the EFSAL became effective in
July 1991, the original group of reformers had already lost power. In the work program
approved by the new Government in September 1992, currency convertibility remained the
ultimate objective, but an objective to be achieved only after 1995 and, in the meantime,
trade and exchange controls were to be strengthened. Preservation of social peace and
security had become the immediate concerns.
B. THE PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY THE ERSL
10.     The first IMF program, approved by the Board on May 31, 1989, provided Algeria
with cash disbursements equivalent to US$586 million, of which two-thirds under the
Compensatory Financing Facility and one-third under a first credit tranche stand-by. Since the
entire amount was disbursed at once following Board approval, the IMF program did not
include any binding performance criteria; it only provided macroeconomic targets for the year
1989. These targets were retained in the letter of Development Policy supporting the ERSL
request. That letter specified the measures which had to be implemented before each of the
two ERSL loan tranches could be released. In addition, yearly projections covering the period
1990 through 1995 were given in Annex I of the President's Report.
11.     The approval of the ERSL by the Bank Board on August 21, 1989, followed a long
dialogue between the Bank and a group of advisers to President Chadli. The first liberalization
measures occurred in agriculture during the early eighties when it became clear that
centralized decision making was not appropriate for farming. Liberalization of price and
marketing arrangements for fruits and vegetables began in 1982. However, the key reform
occurred in 1988 with the dissolution of some 3,400 state-farms averaging about 700 ha
each and their break-up into 80 ha farms (and, in some cases, 6 ha farms) with permanent
usufruct rights on the land. The newly-formed units operated like private farms and were
entitled to retain all profits. The change from state to private farms was particularly
significant, since it occurred before the fall of the Berlin Wall.



1 2.    The support given by the IMF and the World Bank to the 1989 program was an
acknowledgement of the liberalization measures already taken and, at the same time, an
incentive for pursuing the reforms. It was believed that economic growth could be promptly
restored without having to resort to a shock therapy treatment. The program did not contain
any dramatic measures; it merely aimed at progressively eliminating the main sources of price
distortions and creating an institutional environment hospitable to private enterprises. The
ERSL covered a wide range of issues which are reviewed below with reference to agriculture,
public enterprises, money and banking, foreign exchange, fiscal policies, market structure,
labor and the social safety net.
(i) Agriculture: As previously mentioned, the shift toward a market economy started earlier
in agriculture than in the other sectors. Following the break up of some 3,400 state-farms
into 21,000 private farms in 1988, various problems remained to be addressed; notably,
those relating to the demarcation of land parcels and the establishment of usufruct rights.
Marketing of agricultural inputs and outputs had to be decentralized and, for this purpose,
government-sponsored cooperatives were transformed into farmer-owned cooperatives.
However, some basic issues regarding the pricing of agricultural inputs (notably water)
must still be addressed.
(ii) Public Entervrises: The most difficult task was to improve the efficiency of public
enterprises. Decentralization and restructuring were seen to be the first steps, with
privatization to be considered at a later stage. The ERSL-supported program provided an
institutional framework for decentralization, but it did not immediately address certain key
restructuring issues, such as the reduction of redundant labor or the closing of unviable
enterprises. Most national public enterprises were to be transformed into autonomous
Economic Public Enterprises (EPE) which had to be profit oriented and to operate on the
basis of commercial laws. Operational decisions were decentralized from the Ministry of
Planning and the line ministries to the EPE level. Each enterprise was to receive a foreign
exchange allocation covering a period of several years and to use it over this period as
deemed appropriate. The management of the EPEs was to be overseen by eight holding
companies which were to manage the shares of the new EPEs for the State which retained
ownership. However, in order to promote competition, no holding company was allowed
to hold more than 40% of the shares of any single EPE. The loan agreement specified that
the second tranche of the ERSL could not be disbursed unless, at least, 300 national public
enterprises had been transformed into EPEs. By June 1990, the Government had
mandated the transformation of 303 public enterprises into EPEs. Of these, 153 had
completed the transformation process by October 1990 and the remaining 150 were
expected to complete the process shortly. For this reason, the staff recommended a
waiver which was granted by the Board.
In the context of the EFSAL which followed the ERSL, it was decided to accelerate public
enterprise restructuring and to apply special measures to 22 of the largest loss-making
public enterprises which were employing some 133 thousand workers. The objective was
to restructure these enterprises on the basis of appropriate diagnostic and restructuring
studies and, in the meantime, to contain losses. As of April 1993, the first round of
diagnostic studies had been completed and the Treasury had assumed a substantial amount
of non-performing public enterprise debt. However, physical restructuring was just getting
underway and bankruptcy procedures for public enterprises had not yet become
operational.



- 6 -
(iii) Money and Banking : Until the mid-eighties, the banking system had been essentially
used as an instrument for transferring part of the government oil rent to public enterprises
which, in turn, redistributed it in the form of wages and other benefits. The objective of
the 1990 law on money and credit was to restore the traditional role of the banking
system. The banks were expected to lend in accordance with commercial criteria under
the supervision of the Central Bank. The latter was given the responsibility of defining
prudential ratios, of verifying their observance by commercial banks and of monitoring the
restructuring of bank portfolios whenever required.3 The Central Bank also became
responsible for the formulation of monetary policies; in particular, for setting targets for the
money supply and monitoring the expansion of credit. Some progress was made in
rationalizing lending practices, notably by restricting lending at preferential rates. In order
to provide the Central Bank with sufficient autonomy from the Government, the Bank's
governor was appointed for a six-year term; however, the governor appointed in 1 990
resigned before completing his third year.
(iv) Foreign Exchanae Reaime: Although Algeria followed an import substitution strategy
for many years, it became highly dependent on imports, notably as regards inputs needed
for its domestic industry. When annual export earnings fell in 1 986-1 989 by one third from
their 1985 level, Algeria became unable to cover its current import needs on a cash basis.
For this reason, would-be importers were forced to obtain export credits. As a result, the
stock of outstanding export credits more than tripled from 1 983-84 to 1 989; at the end
of that year, it accounted for 40% of the total debt. The medium and long term external
debt was equivalent to only 2.5 years of export earnings; but the bunching of repayments
was such that the debt service ratio reached 71 % in 1989. The bulk of Algeria's export
earnings was used to service the debt, but the level of the outstanding debt was still rising
because: (i) amortization payments remained slightly lower than new borrowings which
consisted mainly of export credits with very short maturities, and (ii) the depreciation of
the dollar versus other major currencies generated losses (para. 1 8). Exporters from a
given country knew that Algerian importers would make full use of the export credits to
Algeria guaranteed by the official credit agency of that country. For this reason, Algerian
importers were in a poor bargaining position and they had to pay prices substantially higher
than those they could have obtained by looking for the best deal on the world market if
they had been able to pay cash or use normal 60- or 90-day trade credits.
In an attempt to lengthen maturities, new regulations in 1991 established minimum
maturity criteria of 18 months for external credit used to import consumer goods and
24 months for capital goods. However, this initiative had limited impact. Algeria had
entered into a debt trap, but did not want to get out of it by rescheduling. Two other
approaches were therefore explored. The first was to "reprofile" the debt, mainly through
a series of voluntary bilateral refinancing agreements. After initial agreements with the
Italian Government and a Credit Lyonnais-led syndicate, however, this approach proved
difficult to sustain because Algeria's image in international financial markets did not
improve. The second was to depreciate the dinar with a view to reaching equilibrium
between the demand for foreign exchange and its supply. Progress was made in this
respect in 1989-91; but, devaluation ceased in 1992, and the ratio between the official and
parallel market exchange rates stabilized at 1:2.
B' By April 1993, combined financial and institutional audits of the five commercial banks had been completed and the final consultant
reports were being prepared.

(v) Fiscal Policies: With the oil price collapse, government revenue from hydrocarbons fell
from some 44%  of total government revenue in 1984-1985 to only 22% in 1986-1988.
In spite of a substantial reduction in investment expenditures, the overall Treasury deficit
reached 13%  of GDP in 1988. The ERSL-supported program aimed at converting the
Treasury deficit into a surplus in order to reduce the money overhang and contain
inflationary pressures. As a condition of second tranche release, a public investment
review was carried out. Treasury surpluses were achieved in 1990-1991; in those two
years, government revenue from hydrocarbons exceeded half of total revenue, partly on
account of higher oil prices, but mainly because the Algerian dinar depreciated substantially
in real terms.4 The program also aimed at rationalizing and simplifying the tax system and
at raising government revenues from sources other than oil. In this connection, a Value
Added Tax (VAT) was introduced in 1992.
(vi) Market Structure: Until the late eighties, most prices and retail margins were controlled
by the Government through a complex system of regulations. The objective of the program
was to move progressively from administratively determined prices to prices responding to
market forces in a competitive environment. For this reason, the loan agreement specified
that the second tranche of the ERSL would not be released before the goods and services
with prices freely determined accounted for at least 40%  of the weight of the items
covered in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This target was exceeded at the time of
tranche release, since the level of 47% was reached by July 1990.
Prices had to be liberalized in a competitive environment.  For this purpose, import
monopolies were formally abolished. As another condition of second tranche release,
goods imported for resale by a sole designated importer were to be reduced, so as not to
exceed 45% of the total imports of those goods. This condition was also satisfied.
Most restrictions on private investment -either domestic or foreign- were removed, and joint
ventures between foreign and domestic private firms were allowed. Enterprises were
allowed to hold foreign exchange accounts with domestic banks. Crowding out of the
private sector had to be avoided, and the program specified that a greater share of
domestic credit and foreign exchange had to go to that sector.
(vii) Labor: The legal framework for the labor market was substantially modified in 1990.
Before that date, a standard labor contract was applicable to all public enterprises. After
1 990, contracts could be negotiated freely between the trade unions and the management
of the enterprise concerned.  Plurality of trade unions and right to strike were also
recognized for public enterprise employees. Before 1 990, it had been almost impossible
for management to dismiss employees; under the new law, workers could be laid off for
economic reasons, provided they received compensation equivalent to one month of salary
per year of employment, up to a maximum of 1 5 months.
(viii) Social Safety Net: The public sector and the enterprises of the formal private sector
had been providing a safety net to their employees and their families for many years; by
1989, almost half of the total population may have been protected in this manner. The rest
of the population was protected by the generalized system of consumer price subsidies.
4/ Government revenues from hydrocarbons increase proportionally to the nominal depreclation expressed in terms of domestic
currency, while tax proceeds based on domestic activities increase proportionally to the rate of domestic inflation. When the former
exceeds the latter, the currency depreciates in real terms and the share of government revenues originating from hydrocarbons rises.



- 8 -
In order for enterprise restructuring and price liberalization to proceed, the safety net had
to be reformed. To this end, and in accordance with another second tranche release
condition, a plan for protecting vulnerable groups was developed. It was necessary to
identify these groups, determine their consumption patterns and assess the impact of
structural adjustment on their purchasing power. A number of studies had to be conducted
for this purpose. A study of the incidence of price subsidies was completed in January
1991. However, implementation of the planned Living Standards Measurement Survey has
been delayed.
C. THE EVALUATION
13.    As appears from the above review, the measures stipulated in the ERSL were
generally implemented to the satisfaction of the World Bank and, in some cases, the
authorities went further than was required in accordance with the letter of Development
Policy. The second tranche was released approximately one year after the loan had become
effective and the waiver relating to the number of public enterprises transformed into EPEs
was granted without particular difficulties. On this basis, it could be said that the program
was implemented in a satisfactory manner. However, the more fundamental objectives of the
program were not fully achieved and the economic crisis remains severe. Real GDP was only
about 3% higher in 1992 than it was in 1985, while the population increased by about 20%.
The value added by sectors other than public administration, hydrocarbons and agriculture has
been steadily declining since 1 987 and unemployment has been increasing. This rather bleak
picture will be illustrated by reviewing, successively, developments in the macroeconomic
framework, sectoral growth and employment.  An assessment of the strengths and
weaknesses of the program concludes this section. Details of progress realized under the
program through the end of 1992 are included in the updated ERSL policy matrix in section
E.
Macroeconomic Framework
14.    The monetary programs set for the years 1 989 and 1 990 were broadly adhered to.
Domestic credit, money supply and inflation (as measured by the CPI) remained within the
limits established. Prudent monetary policy, combined with a progressive liberalization of the
economy, permitted a substantial reduction in the discrepancy between the parallel and the
official rates. From January 1990 to June 1991, the cost of the US dollar in terms of dinars
more than doubled on the official market but the cost on the parallel market slightly declined
and the ratio between the two rates fell to 1.6 in June 1991, which was the lowest ratio
recorded in more than a decade (Figure 1). At that time, the objective was to reach currency
convertibility for most current transactions by early 1992,5 and this objective appeared
attainable. However, the Government which negotiated the 1991 stand-by and the EFSAL
lost power in June 1 991. The target date for currency convertibility has now been postponed
by several years, and fiscal and monetary discipline have been loosened. The overall Treasury
deficit exceeded 7% of GDP in 1992 and the money supply expanded by 26%. Consumer
price inflation increased to 32%, compared with 23% in 1991, due in part to a mid-year
reduction in consumer price subsidies.
5' This was a key element of the program supported by the second stand-by which was approved by the IMF Board on 6/3/91.



- 9 -
ji 5.    The ultimate objective of the program was to restore economic growth and, in the
reports presented to the Boards of the IMF and the World Bank in mid-1989, the yearly
growth in real GDP was projected to average 5% through 1 995. A somewhat more cautious
view was taken two years latter in the EFSAL report; the growth rate was then projected to
increase progressively from 3% in 1991 to 4.4% in 1995. As it turned out, GDP growth has
averaged only about 1.6% per annum since 1 989 (Figure 2). A preliminary estimate of 2.9%
growth in 1 992 is largely attributable to favorable climatic conditions and the temporary
respite offered by the debt refinancing agreements.
1 6.    The optimistic projections made in 1989 were justified by the favorable export
prospects for hydrocarbons, gas exports in particular. After assessing sensitivity to external
shocks, the staff concluded that the most important risk was a large decline in oil prices from
the values assumed in the base case.6 But such a decline did not occur; on the contrary,
prices exceeded those assumed in the base projection; the major difference occurred in 1 990
as a result of the Gulf crisis (lower part of Figure 2). In nominal terms, actual export earnings
exceeded projected earnings over the three-year period ending in 1991 by a cumulative
amount of US$6 billion (Figure 3).
1 7.    Although actual imports in nominal terms also exceeded the levels projected under
the ERSL during 1989-90, the volume of imports declined sharply after 1989. By 1991,
imports, in both value and volume terms, were well below the projected levels (lower part of
Figure 3). This decline was principally due to: (i) higher-than-expected external debt service,
which also affected Algeria's ability to attract new external financing; and (ii) the external
shock caused by the fall in the value of the dollar, which increased the dollar value of the debt
and reduced the purchasing power of hydrocarbon exports (see para. 1 8). The import
shortfall has hindered the economy's ability to respond to economic reforms and has been a
major contributing factor to slower-than-expected growth.
18.     The debt-service ratio was projected to fall to 50% by 1 990 and to remain at about
this level in the two following years; instead, it rose to 74% in 1991 (71% if refinanced
principal payments are excluded) and an estimated 79% in 1992 (66% excluding refinancing,
see Figure 4). This large discrepancy in the projections occurred because the stock of debt
had been grossly under-reported in 1989, reprofiling efforts proved more difficult than
expected--in part because the higher debt reduced Algeria's creditworthiness, and unforeseen
currency fluctuations resulted in large foreign exchange losses. The projections had been
based on the assumption that the parity between the dollar and the other major currencies
would remain unchanged, which was not the case. In 1988, only 37% of the Algerian debt
was repayable in US dollars while 97% of the export earnings going through the Central Bank
were denominated in US dollars. To a first approximation, it could be assumed that
expenditures were denominated in SDRs and receipts in dollars. Consequently, the Central
Bank suffered a foreign exchange loss when the dollar fell in relation to the SDR and a gain
in the opposite case (Figure 5). The use of currency swaps and commodity-linked financial
instruments had been considered as a possible hedge against currency fluctuations. World
6' President's Report, paras. 140 and 148. The same conclusion was reached In the IMF report.

Bank technical assistance was envisaged for this purpose and some training was financed
under the Technical Assistance Project. However, no substantive action to implement
hedging has yet been taken.
19.     During the negotiation of the ERSL, it was believed that the debt raised "a short-
term liquidity problem and not one of solvency"7 and that Algeria could get over its debt
problem within a couple of years. This has not been the case.
Sectoral Growth
20.     According to the national accounts, real GDP has remained nearly stagnant since
1985 (Table 2), despite significant increases in the values added by agriculture, the public
administration8 and the hydrocarbon sector. In contrast, the value added by the other sectors
has declined by 2.3% per year on average, while indirect taxes fell by some 6.2% per year.
Figure 6 illustrates the evolution of the composition of GDP by sector over the 1 980-92
period.
21.     The growth in the value added by agriculture since 1985 is quite remarkable (5.5%
per year on average), even if fluctuations from year to year, caused mainly by climatic
variation, remain very large. This increase resulted, at least in part, from a basic change in
management: namely, the replacement of state-farms by private farms. The apparent
efficiency gain resulting from the shift to private farming is not surprising, since it has been
observed in most countries making such a shift.
22.     By contrast, the value added by the industrial sector has been slowly, but steadily,
declining since 1 987. New laws have been passed and the institutional status of most public
enterprises has been modified according them greater autonomy; but, the basic ownership
structure and management style appear to have been little affected. Another key factor has
been the persistent foreign exchange shortage which has resulted in lower capacity utilization
and lower output, but not in a sizable reduction of labor employment.
23.     The value added by the construction sector has been declining by 2.5% per year on
average and the time required by public enterprises to complete construction projects has
been increasing, exceeding ten years in some cases. Shortages of imported raw materials and
spare parts are frequently quoted as the main constraint, but the problem appears to be more
deeply rooted. In particular, the role which the State should play in satisfying housing demand
must be reformulated in the context of an overall review of housing policies. This exercise
is being carried out as part of the implementation of a sectoral reform program supported by
a World Bank housing loan.

24.       On the basis of the data available, the value added by the service sector also
appears to have been declining and exports of products other than hydrocarbons have
remained stagnant. In the case of neighboring Tunisia, the real depreciation of the currency
in 1 986 was followed within two years by a sharp increase in exports of goods and services
other than the two traditional exports (oil and phosphates), but this did not occur in Algeria.
25.       It was expected that the share of the private sector would increase in relation to that
of the public sector. This has occurred in several areas, but the statistical evidence is mixed.
Since the beginning of the ERSL program in 1989, real interest rates have remained largely
negative and the cost of foreign exchange on the parallel market has been a multiple of its
cost on the official market. Consequently, domestic credit and allocations of foreign exchange
at the official rate have been rationed in one way or the other. Rationing has been particularly
severe for private enterprises, which are often constrained to purchase their foreign exchange
at the parallel rate. In spite of this additional cost, private enterprises have generally been
able to compete successfully with public enterprises once they were allowed to do so.

26.       When Algeria was investing massively, the public sector was able to absorb virtually
all job seekers. This was the case in the late seventies when investment accounted for almost
half of GDP. Although the situation started to change in the early eighties, the number of
urban jobs was still increasing by over 6% a year during the period 1977 through 1 985 (Table
3). The major change occurred with the collapse of oil prices in 1 986: investments were
severely curtailed and the rate of utilization of existing capacities declined due to the shortage
of imported inputs. The growth rate of urban employment was reduced from 6% a year to
3%, while the urban labor force was still increasing by 5.4%  a year. As a result, the number
of workers unemployed tripled from  1985 to 1990 and two-thirds of them were less than 25
years old in 1990.

27.       Among males in the 1 6 through 19 year age group, 63%  were unemployed in 1 990,
while only 7% were illiterate. By contrast, among males in the 45 to 59 years age group,
only 3% were unemployed while two-thirds were illiterate (Figure 7). This paradoxical
situation was due to historical factors. From independence until about 1980, the obtention
of an urban job was treated as a right, and the right to keep this job until retirement has not
yet been seriously challenged. However, the situation has changed in the eighties. Since
1 985, employment in public enterprises has remained stagnant and the creation of new jobs
has been limited to the public administration and the private sector.



- 18 -
28.     Whatever is the history behind it, the Government is presently faced with the
existence of a group of young people who are literate and who have built high expectations
which remain largely unfulfilled.  This is a major source of political instability.  The
Government has reacted by expanding the size of the public administration and creating
special employment programs for the young. The scope for further expanding the public
administration is limited. The administration already accounts for nearly one quarter of total
employment (national service excluded), which is large by international standards. Moreover,
the shift from a centrally planned to a market economy should contribute to reducing rather
than increasing the size of the civil service. The special employment program for the young
is relatively new. Its net impact needs to be carefully analyzed in terms of costs and creation
of additional permanent jobs, since the cost/benefit ratio of similar programs conducted in
other countries has generally been disappointing.
29.     The employment situation is presently worsening.  According to the National
Statistical Office, the number of new jobs created represents less than one third of the net
increase in the size of the labor force. In 1 990, the labor force (unemployed included)
accounted for only 23% of the total population. This low percentage is due to the fact that
the rate of participation was only 8% for females. If more females were to become job
seekers, the growth rate of the active labor force would increase, which would result in more
unemployment.
30.     Assuming that Algeria continues to move toward a market economy, private farming
and food marketing are likely to be the most important sources of employment in rural areas,
while small- and medium-scale private enterprises will probably offer the greatest employment
opportunities in urban areas. After having been repressed in the seventies, private farming
is now being encouraged by the authorities. However, small- and medium-scale enterprises
in the service sector, in particular those in the informal sector, are still looked upon
unfavorably by part of the public administration. Such enterprises are sometimes regarded
as performing activities which are not truly productive. They may also be considered as a
source of menial jobs which do not fit with what the aspirations of developing country are
seen to be. Finally, some of these enterprises appear to be seen as a refuge for unscrupulous
individuals attempting to defraud the State and avoid paying taxes. A more supportive stance
by the administration is needed if full advantage is to be taken of the service sectors.
Lessons Learned from the ERSL
31.     The ERSL supported a program aimed at moving Algeria progressively from a
centrally planned to a market economy. Such a move was clearly a political decision, as was
the choice between gradualism and shock therapy treatment. The role of the World Bank was
not to push the authorities in any particular direction; it was to help them identify the
problems likely to arise if a given road was followed and to present possible solutions to
specific problems. The Bank was justified in supporting a program aiming at liberalizing the
Algerian economy; such an objective did not appear out of reach and substantial progress has
actually been achieved in many areas. However, the fundamental objectives of the program
have not been fully achieved, and the economic crisis remains severe.
32.     There are significant lessons to be learned from the experience of the ERSL. The
first is the importance of quality external debt data. It is doubtful that the program would
have met the test of financial viability, had staff known the true magnitude of the debt.
Another lesson is the importance of assessing terms of trade risks associated with large
movements in major currencies, especially for primary commodity exporting countries. A third



- 19 -
lesson, of course, is that social and political factors are an important consideration, and an
important risk, in economic adjustment.
33.    In many respects, the reformers appear to have overestimated the capacity of the
country to absorb rapid change when the 1 989 and the 1991 adjustment programs were
drawn up, both in terms of the administration's ability to implement complex economic
reforms, and the economy's ability to adjust. While the Government was committed to
moving Algeria to a market economy, insufficient attention was paid to the mechanics of
implementing specific reform measures.  This was underscored by the long delays in
implementing the Technical Assistance Project. With respect to the adjustment of the
economy, the difficulties of liberalizing foreign exchange transactions and improving the
performance of public enterprises appear to have been particularly underestimated. Moreover,
there was a lack of attention to unemployment and its social impact; the issue was hardly
mentioned in the 1989 Development Policy letter.
34.     The reform also had unforeseen consequences for the implementation of Bank-
financed investment projects. Devaluation and fiscal adjustment resulted in a shortage of
counterpart funds, and difficulties with revising contracts to incorporate price increases
caused substantial delays. While the Public Investment Review carried out under the ERSL
helped the authorities identify several major bottlenecks, overall project performance has
remained below par. This is now being addressed in the context of the country portfolio
performance review process.
35.     Since the success of the program was highly dependent on the implementation of
political decisions, the Bank was right in keeping a relatively low profile. In such cases, the
Bank may wish to assist the borrower with its technical expertise by illustrating from past
experience which are the solutions most likely to work in dealing with specific problems.
When the ERSL was negotiated, the Berlin Wall was still up and the Bank had limited
experience with the difficulties encountered in moving from a centrally planned to a market
economy. However, much experience has been gained since then.
D. PROCUREMENT AND MONITORING
36.     The conditions for withdrawing  the  proceeds of the ERSL  were fairly
straightforward. The borrower had to provide evidence of imports of goods which did not
appear on a negative list for a value equivalent to the amount withdrawn. Ineligible items
were those financed from other bilateral or multilateral sources, goods intended for military
or paramilitary use, and luxury items. Procurement of commodities such as petroleum
products and foodstuffs were limited to an aggregate amount of US$60 million. Contracts
over US$5 million were to be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB);
contracts over US$2 million and below US$5 million were to be forwarded to the Bank with
supporting documentation; disbursements under contracts below US$2 million and above
US$60,000 were to be made under Statements of Expenditures (SOE) with supporting
documentation to be provided by for review by the Algerian Development Bank (BAD) which
managed loan disbursements.
37.     A total amount of US$299 million was withdrawn over a three-year period, which
represents about 1 % of total Algerian imports over that time. Although this percentage was
small, the timely collection of eligible contracts and supporting documents in accordance with
procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank raised major difficulties. The main source of
the problem was apparently the complexity of the BAD's internal procedures, together with



- 20 -
a lack of familiarity among Algerian operators of the Bank's own procedures. This is an
example of the widespread institutional weaknesses which hampered implementation of the
project. Because of these difficulties, most disbursements were made on the basis of letters
of credit guaranteed directly by the World Bank. Two years after the release of the second
US$150 million tranche, US$1.2 million remained undisbursed and was cancelled. The
experience of the ERSL underlines the importance of making a concerted effort to identify, and
correct, potential procurement and disbursement difficulties before project effectiveness.
38.    An initial audit report for the project was carried out by the Inspection Gen6rale des
Finances (IGF) of the Ministry of the Economy and received by the Bank in December 1991.
A final audit report, also prepared by IGF, was received in January 1993.
39.    Implementation of the program supported by the ERSL was monitored by the
Country Operations Division of the Maghreb Department of the EMENA Region (EM2CO).
