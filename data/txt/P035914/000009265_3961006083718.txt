MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENATION OF TE PESIDENT
OF THE INTERIONAL-DEVELOPMENT ASSOCATION
TO
TEE EXECUllV  DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 93 MILI^ON
TO THE REPBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR A CYCLONE EAMERGEANCY REABILTATION PROIECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following meraorandum and ronon a proposed credt ir
an amoun  equivalent to SDR 9.3 million to the Republic of Madasar to help finance a cyclone emergency
rehabilitation project. The credt would be on sandard IDA tem, with 40 years maty.
2.    Backgrond. Madagascar succsly completed a two-year polical transition to democradc rle in
1993. A new president was elected in February 1993, parliametary elections were held in June, and a ne
government was formed in August. The political environment in Mdagascar is complex, however, and the
country is going twough a period of political apprenticeshi.
3.    On January 13-17 and February 2-4, 1994, Madagar was stuck by two cyclones (Daisy and
Geralda). Exceptional ranfall (2.5 dmes the average for the heavy rainfall month of Janary) and winds (up
to 250 km/h) caused extensive damage w the eastern province of Toamasina and the central highlands area
aound Antananarivo, the capital. About 60 people were reported killed and more than 60,000 left homeless
in the capital alone. The donor communty provided immediate relief and helped the govemment restore
basic services. A Bank mission arrived in Madagscar on Febnuy 13, 1994, and prepared, in cooperation
with the G(vemment, a rebabilitation program to be financed by funds reallocated from ongoing credi and
the emergency credit r   ed  in this report. The proposed emergency credit is needed to finance
reconstuction of critical assets not covered by other donors or by funds from ongoing credits.
4.    Madagsa is hit by cyclones of varying intensity every year. In 1984 and 1986, two cyclones
(Kamisy and Honorine) inflicted major damage on the country. The Bank extended an emergency credit and
a spplemenal credit (respectively approved in October 1984 and August 1986) to help rebuild major
infrastructure, including the port of Toamasina, which handles about 90% of the country's external trade.
the advance warning system whose development was assisted by the first  s on  project functioned
well and helped limit casualties in the 1994 cyclones. The constuction standards now applied for public
buildings also proved adequate to limit losses. The port withsood the recent cyclones without structur
damage, and only needs minor repairs to warehouse. However, the coastine outside the port was heavily
eroded, destroying sections of access roads to the port and threati  the hib school of Toamasin. More
importantly, the Toamasina-Anumnanivo coridor, the critical link bclween the port and the capital city,
including a road and a railway, has been badly damaged. The degradation of watrsheds in the corridor area
has considerably increased water nmoff and, comined with a  gged topography, file soi stuture, and
oultdated rail and drahage work designs, has conrbut  to heavy damage. Traffic has been temporily re-
established on the road, but the railway is out of commission for an extended period of tine. The cyclones
also klocked out power generation and distrniuon facilities in Toamasina, and only mmum_   semvce has
been restored. Major irriged areas in the Lake Alaotra region, and the Annaivo plain, which are
among the largest producers of rice, Madagascar's main staple, have been flooded. In the coastal Brickaville
area, south of Toamasina, farmers suffred major damage to their tree crop plantations. Schools, health
centers and other public buildings also need urgent rehabiLitation in several areas. Overall, total damge to
public assets amounts to about US$45 million, witout countg  _subal indect costs resulting from the
cownmic disruption.
5.    Project Objecives.  Complemnted by reallocated fimds from ongoing credits, the proposed
rhlition credt would help rebuild faculties damaged by the 1994 cyclones and srengthen mees to



-2 -
m_imize poteial damage from future cyclones. The overall rblitaton progrm of which this project is
a part, was designed in close coordination with the donor community. The IDA financed components wer
selected on the basis of: (a) their economic and social priority as assessed by the Government and the Bank;
(b) the necessity to ensure rapid restoration and operation of sets; (c) the absence of other financing; and
(d) the feasibility of prmpt rontuction.
6.    Program and Project Descipton and  nandg. Tne preliminary estima  of the total IDA
finnced program cost is US$28.8 million (see schedule A). Fancial sources include funds under eight
ongoing crdis, amoundng to US$9.7 million, that would be applied towards urgent rehabiifton in
accordance with the resr--tive project objectives, as follows: (a) the Ports Project (Cr. 1752-MAG, FY1987)
would finnce a study for the coastal defense of 1 iinasina (US$75,000) and the rehabilition of port
superstructure (US$08 million); (b) the Seventh Highway Project (Cr. 1905-MAG, FY1988) would
contribte US$0.3 million to finae the final design study of the rehabilitation of throe major roads; (c) the
Economic Management and Social Action Project (Cr. 1967-MAG, FY1989) would finalce the sudies for
rehabilitation of public buidings (US$30,000), labor-intensive works on the road network (US$0.34 million),
and rebabilition of agricultural producton in the Brickaville area (US$0.3 million); (d) the Education Sector
Reinforcement Project (Cr. 2094-MAG, FY1990) would finance a study and works for rebabilitation of
sdcools (US$3.0 million); (e) the Antananaivo Plain Development Project (Cr. 2117-MAG, FY1990) would
finan  reconstuction of damaged dikes in the Antananivo plain area (US$0.3 million); (f) the Health
Sector Improvement Project (Cr. 2251-MAG, FY1991) would finance sufdies, works and supervision of
works for rehabilitation of health centers (US$2.0 million); (g) a supplementl PPF advance (PPF 800-1) of
US$0.4 million under the recently approved Annarivo Urban Works Project (Cr. 2591-MAG, FY1994)
would finance urgent street rehabilitation in the capital; and finally (h) the Second Irgation Rehabilitation
Project negoated on April 15, 1994 would include rehabilitation of irrigation schme in the area affected by
the cyclones (US$2.0 million). No major amendments are needed to the respective Credit Agrements, and
the reallocation of fimds is under way.
I                                                             -
7.    An IMA Emergency Recovery Credit of SDR 9.3 million (US$13.1 million equivalent) is proposed to
fnance reconstrution of critical assets which lack alterative funding. The project would cover: (i)
rehabilitation of critical roads affected by the cyclones, including the eastern section of the corridor (RN2)
between the major port and the capital city, the chromite transport road (RN33), and the major road of the
cenal highland area (RN7); (ii) repairs to public buildings and administratve offices; (iii) consuction of a
coastl defense in Toamasina; (iv) strengthening of the National Coordination Comnmittee (CNC), established
in 1984 on a permanent basis to coordinate emergency recovery assistance, and chaired by the Ministry of
Finance and Budget (MFB); and (v) a watershed protection and risk management study for -e Toanasina-
Antananarivo corridor to help the Government address soil erosion issues in transport infructur design
and mateance. Executng agencies have already initiated final design stAdies.
8.    Oher Donors' Cotbutions. Many donors including bilaterals, UNDP, WEP and UNICEF, have
provided timely emergency relief aid. Donors are making important contnbutions to the recovery program
which do not overlap with the proposed rebabilitation project. The European Development Fund (EDF) has
indicated interest in financing urgently needed road works under the 1994 National Road Manenance
Program, for an amount of about US$ 0.8 million, and in increasing its current contribution by about US$8.9
million to rhabilitate other roads not included in the proposed program. The Swiss Cooperation Agency is
committed to finance part of the rehabilitation of the western section of the Anonanarivo-Toamasina road
(US$1.5 million). The Caisse Fnnie de D6veloppement (CFD) would finance the repair of power lines
and power plants in Toamasina (about US$0.5 million) as well as an economic study on modal transport
options in the Toamasina-An vo coridor. The result of this study will be used to define medium term
investment needs, according to viabili.y, including possibly railway rehabilitation. A rehabilitation program
of the agriculual sector has been prepared by a Food and Agriculture Orgaization mission (PAO) to be
subItted to the donor community.



-3-
9.     !roject  lm       n. I nionarrangements for the proposed project would be similar to
those under the first Cyclone Rehabilitation Project (CRP) which was successfu1ly completed with fnamcing
from the Credit 1526-0-MAG-(FY1985) and supplemental Credit 1526-1-MAG (FY1987). The proposed
inpIemeentation schedule, too, replicates the calendar for execution of the first CRP. The CNC, created in
the MFB as a condition of Credit 1526-0-MAG, would supervise implementation of the emergency project.
Rehabilitation of facilities under ongoig projects has already been initiated by the relevant executing
agencies. An emergency unit has bee established under the direct responsibility of the Ministry of Public
Works (MTP) to implement road rehabilitation and coast defense works. The unit has the capacity to carry
out its tasks with the support of a French-fianced technical assistant already in place. Another emergency
unit has been created under the responsibility of the Miistry of National and Regional Development (MAT)
to supervise the reconstruction of public buildings other than schools and health centers. MAT has
demonstrated its ability to carry out urgent works during the start-up of the IDA-financed Antananarivo
Urban Works Project (approved in March 1994). A senior implementation specialist, to be assigned to the
Bank Resident Mission in Antananarivo as of July 1, 1994, would be responsible for on-going Bank
supervision of the proposed rehabilitation project to be unplemented over 2.5 years. Specific monitoring
indicators were agreed upon during negotiations.
10.   Project   tab .  The proposed project would reinforce the use of technical specifications
cntly adopted in Madagascar for low-ost cyclone-resistant constuction, as defined under the first CRP
(OED Report SecM92-763 of June 8, 1992). A flood warning system, to complement the advance cyclone
warning system, is being implemented under the Antananrivo Plain Development Project with CFD
inancing. The project would further help the counuty by supporting the development of enviromental risk
management to improve the formulation of investment projects and to introduce a preventive posure in the
maintnance of infiasucture according to the immnence and gravity of potential erosion damage.
11.   Lessons learned from Previous IDA Involvement. The first CR? demonsaed that the main
ingredients for success were: (a) surong political support from the government, manifested by the strong
coordinating unit placed direcdy under the responsibility of the Minister of Finance and Budget; (b)
agreement, between the Governmn  and the financiers, or the reconstrction strategy; and (c) a
simplification of cmbersm  procurement pocedures in Madagascar, with a specific timetable for
strea8ining the necessary steps, permitting efficiency, tnsarency and accountability. The Government's
swift and efficient response to the recent disaster already demonstrates its political support for the recovery
effort. The proposed project incorporates the lessons learned, especially those concerning implenon.
12.   Rationae for IDA Imvolvement.  The proposed project is fully consistent with the Country
Assistance Suategy (CAS) which was discussed by the Board on May 18, 1992. The Bank's over-arching
objectives in Madagascar are to help promote sustained export-led growth with equity, reduce poverty and
protect the environment. The proposed project fits well with the cuntry strategy, and is in line with IDA's
mission in emergency recovery assistance, of restoring producivity and promoting disaster prevention and
mitigation. Thus the prposed project would: (a) restore to normal levels the supply of primary necessities in
the capital dy and highlands, by urgeny rehabilitating major roads (prices of food and fuel skyrocketed in
the aftermath of the cyclones, creating economic disorder and hardship especially among the poor population,
and although basic supplies soon resumed to the capital, the situation has not reurned to normal). Besides,
the disruption of traffic flows requires correction of long term damage to transport corridor as well as
of pavement; (b) allow resumption of social services before the disruption affects their quality
and cost, thus protecting the welfare of the population and contributing to poverty alleviation, by undertakng
prompt repairs to schools and health centers; and (c) have a positive impact on the enironment by managig
watersheds to reduce erosion and vulneability of transport infrastructure.



-4 -
13.   Issues and Acdons.  The project would include measures to ensure that appropriate building
standards are applied in accordance with those established under the first CRP. The Government would
adjust the existng public investment program (PIP) to accommodate the reconstruction project and avoid
overburdening execution and financing capacity. The Government and IDA would agree on eligibility
criteria to be applied for the selecon of administrative buildings to be rehabilitated, as a condition of
disburment for these buildings. Agreement on the use of streamlined procurement procedures, established
for the first CRP on the government side, has been confirmed during negotiations.
14.   Euvhr=nent Aspects. Because this emergency recovery project needs to be processed rapidly and
seeks to restore existing facilities, it would not require an Enviromental Assessment (EA). However, the
project will seek to detennine and correct inappropriate enviromnental practices which contributed to
exacerbate the emergency. The project's impact on the environment is expected to be positive, in terms of
erosion control, coastal defense and slope stabilization. Further, the project is expected to develop
appropriate methods to protect the urmediaze environment of transport infrastructure and make adequate
provision for the inclusion of envitonmentally-safe procedures in all relevant civil works contract.
15.   Project Benefts. The reconstruction of infrstructure which has been destroyed or damaged by the
cyclones is urgently needed to restore economic activity and reduce hardship to the population. The
rebabilitation works financed under this project would be designed to reduce the vulnerability of
ifrsuue  and buildings, and mirimize damage in future cyclones. The studies financed will contnbute to
the development of policies for systematically reducing risks in the design, construction and maintenance of
major public infrastructnre, especially roads.
16.   Project Risk. The main risk is delay in the procurement process. This iisk is being mitigated by
attention to project size and scope, the use of experienced institutions and streamlined procurement
procedures, and close monitoring and supervision through the Bank's decentralized supervision
arrngements.
17.   R     n    on.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

CYCLONE EMERGENCY REHABILITATION PROGRAM
Note on projects with signiflcant disbsement lag
1.     Mo.t projects with IDA financing in Madagascar have suffered from slow disbursements due
partly to geneic problems, including: (a) lack of counterpart finds; (b) difficulties for project manaers
to access IDA funds deposited in special accounts opened by the Central Bank and operated by
signatories in the Treasury; and (c) cumbersome public procurement procedures due to repeated reviews
by central agencies. The situation worsened in July 1991 with the onset of political turmoil. Large scale
demonstrations and strikes parlyzed public adminisraon and severely disrupted econonic activity.
The country has now completed a process of political transition (new govermment in place since late
August 1993). Project implementation has continued to be slow during the two-year transition. The
generic problems noted above have affected all projects, in addition to other project-specific '..tors
causing delays. The following projects have the most significant disbursement lags:
Accountin  and Management Traiing Project (Cr. 1661-MAG).  Even theugh the project has
attained most of its goals, disbursements are low, with larger than anticipated co-financing through grants
fiom Canada and France. Agreement has been reached on possible uses for some of the remaining funds,
and a litde more than US$1 million has been cancelled.
Forest Management (Cr. 1878-MAG). Implementation of this project has been delayed by a wide
variety of problems (organizational, permnel, counterpart fimds, and marketing). A mid-term review in
March 1992 made recommendations to redirect and streamline the projea and agreed on an action plan,
which the Forestry Department (DEF) has so far implemented with minor delays. The FanamaltF pine
forest. plantation has almost completed reorganizing and equipping itself to meet its tasks, and is
continuiLg its efforts to find foreign operators who are interested in its products and by-products.
Seventh Hihway Project (Cr. 1905-MAG). This project was mosdy affected by the generic problems
of cumbersome procurement procedures and lack of counterpart funds. Many con s have now been
signed and disbursents have incased significntly (US$8 million in FY93 and US$13.8 million
aready in FY94 by the end of April 1994).
Economic Management and Socal Action Project (Cr. 196"-MAG). Implementat  of IDA-financed
components was slow, partly due to complexity of project design. Component financed by grants from
Switzerland and UNDP were disbursing more rapidly. Followir- the establishment of a new coordinaton
unit (private sector), the disburseent rate picked up and the project was re-designed in October 1992 to
streamline its activities,
Nadond Agricutural Resarc  Project (Cr. 2042-MAG). The roject experienced an eight-month
start-p delay in meeting credit effectiveness conditions. Project execution was disrpted in 1991 due to
the political turmoil in the country and continued to be affected by institutional disputes. Several
missions in 1993 and 1994 have fowssed on restuctring the project, and a proposa to downsize the
project and cancel part of the credit has been implemented.
Education Sector Reinforement Project (Cr. 294-MAG).  Only 20% of this credit has been
disbursed, even though the project has been effective for three yea-s. Project objectives and design are
being simplified in order to speed up project implementation.

F_indal Sector and Private Enterprise Development (APEX) Project (Cr. 2104-MAG). The APEX
credit, despite a good commitment record, is not disbursing rapidly. A mid-tem review in October 1993
gave partcua attention to identifying and addressing the problems which have being holding up
disbursements. Actions to remedy to a number of problems (e.g. authorization for Cent  Bank to
rquest disbursement directly, simplified methodology for ERR calculation, clarification of eligibility
criteria, pmcurement guidelines, more regular monitoring) were agreed upon with the Borrower and for
the most p;'- have been implemented.
Antnanarivo PWn Development Project (Cr. 2117-MAG). This project experienced start-up delays,
due both to cumbersome procurement procedures as we.l as complicated resettlemen issues, but most of
these problems have been resolved and disbursements are expected to pick up considerably.
Envrnment Project (Cr. 2125-MAG).  Madagascar's period of political dnd socia instability
coincided with, and affected, the start-up of this project. The institutional set-up of the project h&s,
however, been put in place and has helped develop a satisfactory implementation capacity. The project
now needs to concentate on priority areas and establish realistic obiectives and performance criteria. A
mid-term review mission and meetig with the cofinanciers in Deember 1993 addressed these issues.
National Helth Project (Cr. 2251-MAG). Start-up of this project was delayed duie to slow
establishment of a project management structure. Competent project staff have now been recruited and
disuursements are expected to incrase significanty.
2.     Some recent breakhmug  have been made which should go some way towards addressing th
geneic problems of the portfolio. A CPPR was carried out in April 1994 during which a calendar was
agreed upon to complete the resruc g of the portfolio, particularly in the case where projects are
inompatible with execution or finaca capacity, or do not respond any longer to todays' developmen
priorities; clearer responsibilities will be given to project managers; innovatve mean of project
implementtion and management will be introduced following the posidve expenence of the
Antmannarivo Urban Works Project; systematic monitoring of performance, both of the Bank portfolio
and the entire PIP will be implemented. These breakhoughs followed the Country Implementatio
Review (CIR) in Antananaivo in December 1990 and a follow-up CIR in March 1992, which resulted
in: (a) new regulations for prcement and use standard bidding docments  hich comply with Bank
guidelines; and (b) a decree allowing project managers to have direct access to special accounts to be
opened in commercial bans. In FY93, disbusmets for investment operations reahed US$41 million,
i.e. almost 80% more than the total amount disbrsed in FY92. In FY94, US$40 million had been
disbursed as of April 1994.
