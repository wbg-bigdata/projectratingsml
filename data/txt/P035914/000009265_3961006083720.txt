Projet de Tenmes de REfence
Etude pour lam6nagement des bassins versants et la gestion des risques de degradation des
infrastructures routitres (couloir Antnnrv
A. Contexte
1.    Les derniers cyclones survenus A Madagascar en dEbut 1994 et les prEcipitations abondantos
qui les ont accompagn6 ont gravement endomnagE les infastructures, et tout particuieremnt, le
rEseau routier. Le Gouvernement, avec I'aide de la Banque mondiale a entrepris rapidement la mise
en oeuvre d'un programme de rehabilitation des ouvrages, et notanment de la RN2, qui constitue
l'axe principal d'approvisionnement de la capitale, Antananarivo, et de la region centrale du pays.
Les tavaux de remise en etat devraient debuter des le mois de juillet 94. Au delk de ces travaux
d'urgence, il apparat opportun de considerer la gestion de l'enviromnment aux abords de la route
et sur les bassins versants envionnants comme un fiaceur de pErennisation des travaux de
rEhabilitation. En effet, en cortins points de rupture I'absence de vEgEtation et le deboisement ont
fortement accentue les dfgSts causes par les eaux. Ces differents elements seronts examines dans le
cadre de l'etude faisant l'objet des prsents termes de rffrnce.
B. Organion de lEtude
2.    L'6tude comportera 3 phases distinctes et devra permettre:
* Phase 1: d'tablir uine inventaire exhaustif des informations disponibles et des ph6nombnes
constates;
* Phase 2: de proposer un plan d'action visant i r6duire, i tenme, Il'ampleur des dommages et
limiter les risques encourus,
*  Phase 3: de mettre en oeuvre les ommaations du plan d'action au travers d'un projet pilote
sur une zone test. II est prEcisE que la phase 3 est optionnelle.
3.    L'etude aura egalement pour objectif l'Etablissemeat d' une collaboration entre le Ministere
des Travaux Publics (ITP) et les agences envronnementales coordonnEes par l'Office National de
l'Environnemet (ONE) pour la Wmis  en oeuvre d'une politique de protection durable des
infastrucmes routieres (en particulier le trongon Antannarivo-Toamiasna), en mettant en evidence
les interrelations enwre la construction et la maineance de ces dernieres et la gestion de
1 'environnement.
4.    Le delai total de l'etude, hors phase 3, est de 12 mois, y compris une periode de I mois A
