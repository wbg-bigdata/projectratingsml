Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Third Economic management and Governance Reform Grant (EMGRGIII) was designed to provide
fiscal space to the CAR to protect priority sector spending and mitigate the effects of the global economic
slowdown. The objectives of the EMGRGIII were to improve transparency and efficiency in the
management of public resources and promote private sector development through reforms aimed at: (i)
strengthening budget execution and reporting as well as public procurement, and improving revenue
administration to increase domestic revenue; (ii) strengthening the regulatory framework in the forestry,
mining and petroleum sectors so that they can continue to be a source of sustainable growth, employment
and incomes; and (iii) improving the business environment by reducing the cost of doing business.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At appraisal, the Central African Republic (CAR) was striving to build on progress it had made since
conflict ended in 2003 but had suffered a severe exogenous shock in 2009. Despite its progress, the CAR
remained a fragile, post conflict country. The CAR had successfully re-engaged with the international
community; embarked on a program to restore security that begun to absorb rebel groups; and undertaken
reforms in budget procedures and governance in order to create the conditions for growth and
development. Politically, dialogue had led to a consensus government in January 2009, the beginnings of
a Disarmament, Demobilization and Rehabilitation (DDR) program, and the establishment of an electoral
commission to organize the presidential and parliamentary elections. Nevertheless, security remained
tenuous due to continuing attacks from splinter rebel groups in the north and frequent intrusions in the
east by the rebels of the Lord Resistance Army (LRA).

Poverty affected about two-thirds of the population, nearly as many as at the end of the conflict. A
Poverty Participatory Analysis carried out in 2007 attributed the main causes of poverty to poor
governance and insecurity. The 2009 UNDP Human Development Report ranked the CAR near the
bottom of its Human Development Index (179th out of 182 countries). Social indicators were extremely
poor with life expectancy about 39 years and one child in four who had never attended school. Progress
toward the 2015 MDGs was limited. In 2007 the government prepared its first Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper. Covering the period 2008-2010, the PRSP had four pillars: (i) restore security, consolidate
peace, and prevent conflict; (ii) promote good governance and the rule of law; (iii) rebuild and diversify
the economy; and (iv) develop human capital.

Economic performance improved somewhat after 2004, but real GDP growth remained below 4 percent
annually; in 2008, as a result of domestic and external shocks, growth dropped to 2 percent. In 2009,
owing to the global economic slowdown CAR’s main exports, timber and diamond, contracted sharply.
The forestry sector was particularly hard hit; timber production fell by 37 percent, exports declined by 29
percent in volume terms, revenues decreased by more than 37 percent and employment contracted.
Diamond production and exports fell by 18 percent. As a result, real GDP growth weakened further to 1.7
percent in 2009; the modest gains made in real per capita incomes in 2006-2008 were erased.

Despite these problems, the CAR had made significant progress in re-establishing macroeconomic
stability. The Bank and the IMF provided support to this process beginning in December 2006. Prior to
EMGRGIII, the CAR had established a commitment to reforms in budgetary processes and governance
that were supported by the World Bank’s Reengagement and Institution Building Support Program
(RIBSUP), first and second Economic Management and Governance Reform Grant (EMGRGI&II),
various Low Income Countries Under Stress (LICUS) grants, and an Institutional Development Fund
(IDF) grant. The CAR reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative in June 2009.

The low tax revenue-GDP ratio remained a major problem. At 8.7 percent in 2009, this ratio was among
the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa. The low tax revenue constrained the government’s ability to address the
basic needs and security of the population and left spending highly dependent on the declining grant
disbursements of the donors. Some progress had been made in the timely payments of public sector
salaries; but substantial arrears to domestic suppliers had accumulated. To address the liquidity shortage a
Liquidity Committee, chaired by the President, was formed for short-term cash management.
1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Third Economic Management and Governance Reform Grant (EMGRGIII) was designed to provide
fiscal space to the CAR to protect priority sector spending and mitigate the effects of the global economic
slowdown. The objectives of the EMGRGIII were to improve transparency and efficiency in the
management of public resources and promote private sector development through reforms aimed at: (i)
strengthening budget execution and reporting as well as public procurement, and improving revenue
administration to increase domestic revenue; (ii) strengthening the regulatory framework in the forestry,
mining and petroleum sectors so that they can continue to be a source of sustainable growth, employment
and incomes; and (iii) improving the business environment by reducing the cost of doing business.

The operational policy matrix of tranche release conditions included 8 outcome indicators that were
expected to improve fiscal management and contribute to strengthening governance and transparency in
natural resource management and the business environment: (a) better execution of the capital budget
through timely validation of procurement plans and clearance of domestic arrears to encourage suppliers
to bid on government contracts; (b) increased compliance to the procurement code; (c) improved
government accounting system and control of funds through timely submission of the budget review law
to Parliament; (d) improved domestic revenue mobilization by reducing tax and customs exemptions; (e)
strengthening governance in the forestry sector by establishing a mechanism for tracking and controlling
timber production; (f) continued adherence to the EITI principles, applying them to all mineral receipts;
(g) enhancing competition and transparency in the petroleum sector by introducing a downstream
legislation and carrying out the audit of the use of petroleum sector revenues; and (h) improving the
business environment by reducing the cost of starting a business and the transfer of property.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

The objectives of the operation were not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

Public Financial Management

The new government in 2003 faced complete disarray in public financial management after years of
political instability, conflict, and mismanagement. Between 2004 and 2010, the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment identified serious shortcomings in Public Financial Management (PFM) and laid out reform
priorities; three IDA DPO (RIBSUP, EMGRGI and EMGRGII) and LICUS grants provided support for
implementing reforms as well as much-needed fiscal resources. These reforms addressed the (i) lack of a
modern legal framework for public financial management; (ii) weak control of the Treasury over
government resources; (iii) lack of transparent and comprehensive reporting of government operations;
(v) inefficient public procurement and institutions; and (vi) weak domestic revenue mobilization.

The EMGRGIII sought to improve further budget processes and their transparency as well as domestic
revenue mobilization and was based on these prior assessments and grants, as well as on the 2009 joint
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Specifically, the EMGRGIII supported measures to enhance the
efficiency of budget execution and strengthen public procurement. To improve transparency and
accountability, it supported the harmonization of budget classifications with the accounting
nomenclatures, based on OHADA norms; the publication by the Court of Account of the audit report,
including the declaration of conformity, on the 2008 budget; and the submission of the 2008 budget
review law to Parliament. To improve fiscal revenues the EMGRGIII supported measures to strengthen
the control of tax and customs duty exemptions.

                                                    2
Strengthening Public Sector and Economic Governance

The CFAA and PEFA reports, as well as a 2006 Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP) identified
numerous ways in which the government could improve governance in the public sector and in the
economy generally. The LICUS grants, RIBSUP, EMGRGI, and EMGRGII supported the Government’s
efforts in these areas, particularly in the areas of mineral revenues and forestry and petroleum sector
policy. The improvements included (i) making government anti-corruption efforts more effective by
linking them to international standards and measurements; (ii) enhancing the management of natural
resources; and (iii) strengthening the regulatory framework in the downstream petroleum sector.

The EMGRGIII built upon these assessments and the previous grants. It supported the adoption of a new
legislation for the downstream petroleum sector to provide a clear separation of the roles and
responsibilities of the regulatory authority (ASRP), the state-owned storage company of petroleum
products (SOCASP), and the Ministry of Mines; and to introduce a new methodology for the
determination of the price of petroleum products. To promote transparency the EMGRG III supported the
audit of the use of funds by ASRP.

With regard to the critical issues of improving governance in the management of natural resources, the
EMGRGIII supported the continued implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI) principles; in particular, applying them to all mineral receipts, carrying out the preparation of the
second EITI report, ensuring its adoption by a multi-stakeholder committee, and undertaking a broad
dissemination of the report. In the forestry sector, EMGRGIII supported the establishment of a framework
to improve the tracking and verification of the legality of timber production in the context of the Forestry
Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative. EMGRGI had supported a new forestry law
that was in compliance with the FLEGT. EMGRGII supported the strong implementation of the revenue
sharing mechanisms in the new law and improvements in transparency through the disclosure of the
forestry revenue sharing between the government and the logging communities and of the amount of local
taxes paid by logging operators to logging communities.

Promoting Private Sector Development

The World Bank Doing Business 2010 ranked the CAR 183rd out of 183 countries on the ease of doing
business. On some of the indicators CAR ranked in the bottom ten. IFC geared its technical assistance
program toward (i) strengthening the partnership framework between the State and private sector to
promote a productive dialogue around the issues affecting private sector development in the CAR, (ii) the
restructuration of the Chamber of Commerce to enable it to carry out its functions effectively; (iii)
strengthening the one-stop window for business registration; and (iv) reducing regulatory constraints.

EMGRGI and EMGRGII had not directly supported the development of the private sector. The
EMGRGIII sought to support reforms that could be implemented swiftly and help reduce the cost of
doing business. It built on the assessment of the Doing Business and IFC TA, and supported reforms to
reduce the registration fees for starting a business and for the transfer of urban commercial real property.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance

The EMGRGIII was a two-tranche operation of SDR 5.8 million. It was approved on September 17,
2010; became effective on November 23, 2010; and was closed on March 30, 2012. All first tranche
release conditions, listed below in Table 1, were met by the time of Board approval; and the grant was
fully disbursed following implementation of the second tranche conditions. As discussed below in detail,
despite a long-drawn-out electoral process, the EMGRG III was effective in supporting the continuation
of economic and governance reforms in the CAR.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Improvements in the CAR’s terms of trade, the reversal of food and fuel prices from their surge in 2007-
08, and a pick-up in world demand for diamonds and timber helped set the CAR economy on a path to
recovery by the end of 2009. Real GDP growth rebounded to 3.0 percent in 2010 from 1.7 percent in 2009.

                                                        5
A rebound in food and cash crops production, and a robust growth in services led by transport and
telecommunication and commerce contributed also to the recovery. The rebound in economic growth
helped boost government revenues, and the decline in consumer price inflation from 9.3 percent in 2008
to 1.5 percent in 2010 helped boost household consumption. Strong agricultural production and mining
activity helped push real GDP growth further to 3.3 percent in 2011.

The protracted electoral process in 2010 created uncertainty and tensions between political parties,
delaying the formation of the new government and weakening fiscal discipline. In particular, budget
execution during 2010 and 2011 was marked by a sharp increase in off-budget expenditures. A growing
increase in the recourse to exceptional procedures for the payment of government expenditures led to a
large volume of spending outside the normal budget process executed through the computerized system
gesco. New arrears on domestic and foreign debt accumulated; and public investment spending in priority
sectors, notably health and education, was crowded out. The lack of capacity was a major constraint to
reforms. In particular, improving public procurement was hindered by lack of capacity in line ministries.
Another problem was the low number of firms that would bid for government contracts. In response, the
Government has taken corrective measures to restore fiscal discipline. As regards procurement, the
government has ensured all the line ministries have the legal documentation for the new code,
implemented a training program for them, and assisted them in preparing procurement plans. The Bank
supported this effort by accelerating implementation of the IDF grant approved in the second half of 2009
to strengthen procurement capacity in the line ministries and procurement units.

On the security front, the withdrawal of UN peace keepers at the end of 2010 weakened security in the
south-east region of the country, where several rebel groups including the LRA remained active. The
Government continued lack of military control over the entire country hindered formal business activity.

Factors under Government Control

The government made security sector reform a medium-term priority, and formulated a strategy focused
on modernizing the army and building a proper police force and functioning legal system. Following the
lengthy and difficult electoral process the government took steps to open up the political process. The
opposition had rejected the results of the presidential election and boycotted the second round of the
legislative elections. In April 2012 the leader of one of the largest political parties, arrested on the
suspicion of plotting a military coup, was freed from prison, which permitted the DDR process to resume,
raising hopes for improved security and further progress toward peace. However, the government’s
perceived lack of inclusiveness has continued to persist; and the dismissal of the finance and justice
ministers reinforced the perception that the president intends to increase its control over the government.

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment

The Government’s strong commitment to the reform program during EMGRGI and EMGRGII was not
sustained in the early years of the EMGRGIII. Fiscal discipline weakened considerably during the
electoral period leading to slippages that undermined macroeconomic stability; and earlier gains in public
finance management to support transparency and accountability were reversed. Toward the end of 2011
the government re-affirmed its commitment to the reform program, took corrective measures to enhance
confidence in budget execution, and completed the implementation of the tranche release conditions of
the EMGRGIII.

Soundness of Background Analysis

The background analysis for the EMGRGIII was adequate, based on a broad range of analytical work
covering most aspects of the operation and the success of and lessons learned in EMGRGI and EMGRGII.

                                                    6
Key analytical work included the CFAA of FY08, the PEFA assessment in 2010, and the earlier Country
Procurement Issues Paper of FY06 in the area of public financial management. These studies, carried out
in close cooperation with other donors, identified critical steps in the short and medium-terms for budget
and procurement reforms. The 2007 update of the forestry sector assessment provided the underpinnings
for reforms in the sector. In particular, the update highlighted the need for further improvements in
increasing transparency and competition in timber harvesting rights and enhancing tax collection and
management systems. The 2009 diamond sector review assessed the extent of fraud and suggested
avenues for improving transparency in the sector; and the doing business report provided policy-relevant
evidence on the impact of regulation on businesses throughout their life cycle.

The social and environmental aspects of EMGRGIII were adequately analyzed. Corruption and poor
governance were identified as a major cause of poverty in the participatory poverty analysis of 2007. The
poverty assessment based on the 2008 household survey provided an update of the poverty profile that
highlighted the need to increase access of the poor to public services. EMGRGIII supported the use of
increased revenues in programs aimed at improving CAR’s low social indicators by emphasizing
improved transparency, accountability, and strengthened budget execution as well as the links between
public spending and the priorities of the Government’s poverty reduction strategy. The reforms in the
forestry and petroleum sectors were expected to have favorable environmental impacts as well as increase
revenues. In the forestry sector, the reforms would contribute to a better monitoring of forestry
management, increased legality of timber production and discourage unlicensed logging. In the petroleum
sector, the reforms would ensure compliance with quality and security standards and higher revenues.

Assessment of the Operation’s Design

Building upon the satisfactory implementation of EMGRGI and EMGRGII and the prior grants and
assessments, EMGRGIII’s reform agenda aimed at further improving public financial management and
public sector governance. In addition, it began the process of expanding the program to cover private
sector development, focusing on improving the business environment through targeted measures. The
tranche release conditions directly followed the “key next steps? in EMGRGII and strengthened the
policy areas where progress had been slow and limited. The EMGRGIII’s tranche release conditions were
in many cases related to the further implementation of the Government’s earlier actions, for instance, in
the areas of prompt budget execution, auditing of the budget, procurement, reducing exemptions in
customs and taxes, better management of mining and forestry resources, and improved petroleum policy.

Relevance of Risk Analysis

The EMGRGIII outlined adequately the substantial security, political, macroeconomic, and sustainability
risks, as well as the issues of institutional capacity and fiduciary risk facing the CAR, and ways to
mitigate them. The security situation was described as fragile despite the peace agreement with the main
rebel groups. Security issues remained because the government still lacked control over large parts of the
country; clashes between the national armed forces and a splinter rebel group were ongoing in the north;
and security was threatened in the east where the LRA rebels continued to carry out fresh attacks on the
population. Political instability is always an issue in post-conflict countries. Despite the political gains in
the CAR, the EMGRGIII appropriately expressed concern if popular frustration were to follow the
presidential and legislative elections which had been postponed twice. Macroeconomic risks from a
deterioration of the political situation were recognized. The EMGRGIII pointed out the possibility of
these problems affecting revenues, budget support operations, foreign investments, and the risk of fiscal
slippage. Weak institutional capacity was a major constraint, as well as a risk to implementation of the
reform program, despite the support for improved capacity. Finally, fiduciary risks were recognized as
high, due to weak financial controls indicated by the CPIP, the CFAA and the PEFA reports. Problems in
the Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) that had been identified by the IMF were also recognized.


                                                      7
Mitigation of the security risks fell outside the scope of the operation. Mitigation of political risks was
tied to continuation of the inclusive political dialogue and the reforms in public financial management and
public sector and economic governance supported by EMGRGIII, as well as larger, more budget-
harmonized donor inflows. In addition, enhancing budget execution in priority sectors, as supported by
the EMGRGIII, was expected to lead to greater accountability of and public confidence in the
Government. Mitigation of macroeconomic risks was expected to come from a combination of policy
adjustments and greater donor inflows. The risks from weak institutional capacity were expected to be
mitigated by the focus of the EMGRGIII on areas where capacity has improved and continued TA.
Finally, fiduciary risks were expected to be mitigated by improvements in budget execution and reporting
and through enhanced compliance to procurement procedures, which was a tranche release condition in
the grant. The concerns about the BEAC were expected to be mitigated through the opening of a
dedicated local currency account in a commercial bank and a mandatory audit of the flow of funds.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. Prior to EMGRG III, the Government had designed an M&E framework to monitor and
evaluate the implementation of its PRSP. Since August 2009, all sectoral committees have used a
standard format to report their poverty activities, which facilitates evaluation of progress and problems.
Since October 2009, budget support from IDA, African Development Bank, European Union, and France
uses a common harmonized framework to improve the predictability of aid, facilitate administration of
donor support, and improve its focus. The M&E arrangement for EMGRG III built on this overall M&E
framework; it reflected the need for quality and timely information and easy to monitor indicators.

M&E implementation and utilization: The Ministry of Finance and Budget was responsible for the
overall coordination of program implementation and for overseeing progress in achieving program
objectives. A program oversight committee was established to monitor implementation of the EMGRGI
and EMGRGII and was continued for the EMGRGIII. It included representatives of the line ministries,
directorates and agencies concerned. EMGRGIII followed the procedures of EMGRGII in reaching up-
front agreement on reform activities with the government, including key indicators to assess progress and
which could be incorporated in subsequent EMGRGs. The supervision missions assessed performance on
these indicators and completed two implementation status reports (ISRs).

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

To continue support for the CAR’s reforms and given the country’s still-low resources, the Bank is
considering launching a new programmatic series of development policy operations. The focus of this
new series of DPOs is expected to remain on economic management and governance. It will build on
EMGRGIII and focus on further improvements in: (i) budget execution and procurement; (ii) natural
resource management and petroleum sector regulatory reforms; and (iv) the business environment.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of EMGRGIII were important in supporting the CAR’s continuation on the path of
economic rehabilitation and reform. Building on progress already supported by EMGRGI and EMGRGII,
EMGRGIII’s objectives were intended to further strengthen public financial management practices,
improve domestic revenue, and address key public sector and governance issues. The objectives of
EMGRGIII were fully aligned with the PRSP and the CPS, and followed up EMGRGII’s key actions.
They attempted to strike a balance between ensuring that the grant resources were provided rapidly to

                                                    8
help mitigate the effects of the global economic slowdown on the CAR economy and spreading them over
different time periods because of the general elections whose outcome was difficult to predict and
represented a risk. The EMGRGIII objectives also included supporting further efforts in the management
of national resources and the environment — mining and forestry—; strengthening petroleum sector
policy; and expanding the reforms to support improvements in the business environment

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The EMGRGIII moderately achieved its development objectives through the tranche release conditions
and government achievements in relation to key outcome indicators. CAR experienced a protracted
electoral period and the government reform program went off track, delaying the start of the new
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). Normal budget procedures were circumvented in
financing government expenditures. Since November 2011, the government has taken appropriate
remedial actions to restore macroeconomic stability and re-focus structural reforms. (Table 2 provides
selected economic indicators for 2009-2012). On June 25, 2012 the IMF Board approved a new three-year
arrangement under the ECF. Outcomes under the program supported by the EMGRGIII are discussed
next and detailed in Annex 2.

Objective 1: Improve the efficiency of Public Finance Management

The government has taken steps to improve budget execution in priority sector ministries. The
EMGRGIII supported the early preparation of procurement plans and the clearance of domestic arrears in
accordance with well-specified criteria in order to accelerate budget execution in priority sectors. In 2010,
all the seven priority sector ministries targeted by the grant 1 adopted their procurement plans six months
following the approval of the Finance Law by Parliament, much earlier than before, ensuring adequate
time for the execution of contracts. The creation of new ministries and changes of cabinet ministers
following the elections delayed the adoption of procurement plans in five of the priority sector ministries

 The targeted priority sector ministries were: Agriculture and Rural Development, Education, Equipment and
Public Works, Health, Mining, Energy and Hydraulics, Social Affairs, and Transport.


                                                     9
in 2011. During this period the government did not adhere to the normal budget execution procedures,
frequently circumventing them through the use of exceptional procedures to finance public spending.

In 2010 the government adopted an Arrears Order setting out the criteria for clearing arrears to domestic
suppliers. Domestic arrears payments totaling CFAF 849 million were made in 2010, followed by
payments of CFAF 903 million in 2011 and CFAF 657 million for the period up to September 2012,
largely exceeding the targets. Twelve suppliers (10 in 2010 and 2 in 2011) had their arrears fully cleared,
which reduced the number of small enterprises with un-cleared arrears to 240, in line with the targets.
However, the arrears Order was not consistently adhered to and no significant progress was made in
encouraging suppliers to bid for government contracts. New arrears to suppliers amounting to CFAF 3.0
billion in 2010 and CFAF 3.2 billion in 2012 were also accumulated. As a result, the budget execution
rates on the domestic capital budget have remained low. For example, the budget execution rate on
domestically-financed capital expenditures was 4.6 percent for education and 2.8 percent for health on a
commitment basis in 2011. For the priority sectors as a whole (excluding the Ministries of Mining and
Transport), the budget execution rate on the domestic investment budget was just 9 percent. Since then,
some improvements have been achieved. At the end of 2011, cash payments orders fell sharply to 7
percent of current expenditure (excluding wages and finance charges) from 80 percent in 2010. By end-
May/June 2012 five of the priority sector ministries already had their procurement plans approved by the
Public Procurement General Directorate (DGMP). The government revitalized the existing liquidity
monitoring units and created a budget management monitoring committee to track spending. Despite
these improvements, spending without prior commitment persists and priority sector spending remains
low, with a budget execution rate of just 6.5 percent in the third quarter of 2012.

The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) has undertaken a review of compliance to the
procurement code. The review covered the period June 2009-May 2010 and found that, over this period,
about 57 percent of contracts awarded complied with the procurement code. The conduct of the
compliance review reflects the increased operational capacity of the PPAR and the level of compliance
indicates that the government is obtaining quality goods and services at a competitive price. The PPRA
and DGMP have organized training workshops to familiarize line ministries with the new procurement
procedures and strengthen their capacity to implement them. As a result, compliance has been improving
although capacity needs further strengthening. This level of compliance reflected also a number of
violations of the procurement procedures. The review made a number of recommendations to enhance
compliance further but an action plan to tackle the identified problems has not yet been formulated. A
persisting problem is the extensive use by line ministries of the simplified procedure for the acquisition of
goods and services; though this procedure is legitimate, it tends to lead to serious violations of the
procurement code. Going forward, the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority will conduct an audit of
contracts awarded under the simplified procedure and devise a plan to reduce the risk of collusion and
promote adherence to open competition.

The Court of Account has carried out the audit of government accounts for 2008, and Parliament has
adopted the draft 2008 budget review law. The Court of Accounts undertook a verification of the 2008
government accounts and issued an audit report, including a statement of conformity. The audit report
was submitted to the Minister of Finance in September 2011 and was published on the government
website; this was later than planned due to the long delays in compiling the government accounts. The
Ministry of Finance submitted the 2008 budget review law to Parliament in December 2011. The Finance
Committee of Parliament discussed the issues raised in the Court of Accounts’ report with the Ministry of
Finance during the review of the 2012 draft budget law. The Court of Account’s statement of conformity
provided the basis upon which Parliament voted to adopt the 2008 budget review law. For the first time,
the external control of the Court of Accounts and Parliament over budget execution was applied. More
important, this control led to the establishment of the budget management committee at the Ministry of
Finance to monitor budget execution and enhance budget programming.


                                                     10
Customs duty exemptions have been significantly reduced. Since the creation of the inter-ministerial
Committee in charge of fiscal and customs exemptions (CICEFD) in 2007 tax expenditures relating to
customs duties and VAT on imports have declined steadily, falling from CFAF 16.6 billion in 2007 to
CFAF 8.9 billion in 2009. In 2011, they fell further to CFAF 5.1 billion, a 42 percent decline from their
2009 level; and are on track to remain below CFAF 5.0 billion in 2012. Over this period, revenues from
international trade taxes rose from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2009 to 2.7 percent in 2010 and 3.1 percent of
GDP in 2011. Exemptions relating to domestic VAT fell from CFAF 660 million in 2008 to CFAF 258
million in 2009 but have since increased, rising to CFAF 535 million in 2010 and to CFAF 1.3 billion in
2011. This increase reflected exemptions granted to a number of development projects on the purchase of
local materials for construction works. Nevertheless, the total value of tax and customs duty exemptions
granted in 2011 fell by more than 30 percent, largely in excess of the EMGRGIII target.

Objective 2: Strengthen Public Sector and Economic Governance

The Government made substantial progress in adhering to the EITI principles. The Government has
prepared the EITI report covering the years 2007, 2008, and 2009. This second EITI report was based on
extensive consultations with stakeholders including the public sector, mining operators, and
representatives of civil society; and it covered all mineral revenues, not just revenues from diamonds as in
the 2006 report. The report was published in December 2010 and has been widely disseminated. CAR
became a candidate country in November 2008 and in the following two years it has implemented a range
of actions outlined in the work plan that the National Steering Committee had adopted. The second EITI
report received a satisfactory assessment from the EITI International Secretariat; and, in March 2011, the
EITI Board designated the CAR EITI compliant, indicating that it meets all the requirements in the EITI
standard. Preparation of the third EITI report covering the year 2010 is currently underway.

The Government has established a national tracking system and a system of verification of the legality of
timber production. Tests are currently underway to detect potential bottlenecks. The tests applied to the
national traceability system are to ensure that it permits the tracking of timber as it moves through the
supply chain from the forest and processing plants to the port in Cameroon from where the timber is
exported. The implementation of this system, for which the CAR is seeking donor support, together with
a certification scheme to establish the legality of timber production will help stamp out the unlicensed
logging that has decimated large areas of CAR forest in the recent past and boost exports.

The Government has also made significant progress in strengthening the regulatory framework of the
downstream petroleum sector. The new legislation has eliminated the overlap in the functions of ASRP,
SOCASP and the Ministry of Mines. It has also modified the methodology for calculating the price of
petroleum products, basing it on actual transaction costs. The new price structure permits a transparent
implementation of the price adjustment mechanism, which is expected to generate revenues for the
government budget. The audit of the use of funds by the regulatory authority over the years 2008, 2009
and 2010 revealed serious governance issues, which are being addressed. As regards the overall sector
performance, the sources of petroleum supply to the CAR have been diversified with a sales agreement
concluded with Chad’s national oil company; and the control of petroleum products entering the CAR
territory has been strengthened although fraud remains significant. Prior to the EMGRGIII, there were
two licensed private operators purchasing and distributing petroleum products in the country; since then,
two other private operators have entered the market and two more are expected to begin operation by end-
2012, which would help expand the distribution of petroleum products across the country.

Objective 3: Promote Private Sector Development

The government has reduced the cost of doing business in relation to two doing business indicators. With
the support of EMGRGIII the government has reduced the registration fees for the creation of a business


                                                    11
and for the transfer of property, each by 50 percent. This measure was carried out through the
modification of the applicable legislation, in respect of the OHADA Uniform Law, and announced in the
2011 Finance Law with immediate effect. Reflecting political uncertainty the number of newly created
enterprises, as recorded by the Ministry for the Promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises, declined in
2011; and data up to September suggests that the creation of new firms is likely to remain depressed in
2012. The cost of construction permits also increased in 2012, reversing earlier progress in this area.
Reflecting this development, the 2013 Doing Business Report has ranked the CAR 185 out of 185.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Following the election-related fiscal slippages the government re-asserted its commitment to reforms; it
has implemented remedial measures, and a new arrangement under the ECF was agreed with the IMF.
The control over customs duty exemptions was strengthened and a new legislation for the downstream
petroleum sector was adopted, which will contribute to efforts to raise revenues in the future.

Regarding public finance management, the finance laws approved by Parliament reflected the harmonized
budget and accounting nomenclatures. A growing number of line ministries are preparing procurement
plans in six months and less following adoption of the finance law by Parliament, which should permit a
more adequate implementation of the domestic investment budget. Compliance with the new procurement
code is improving; and the external oversight of budget execution has been strengthened.

Regarding public sector and economic governance, action continued on forestry management. Formal
negotiations with the EU on a voluntary partnership arrangement in forestry were successfully completed,
leading to the establishment of a traceability system and a system of verification of the legality of timber
products. The second EITI report covering revenues from the production of diamonds and other minerals
over the last three years has been prepared and disseminated, and the CAR was declared EITI compliant
by the EITI Board. The decrees setting out a new methodology for the determination of the price of
petroleum products and re-organizing the sector with clearer lines of responsibility for the regulatory
authority, the storage company and the Ministry of Mines have been promulgated; the audit of the
utilization of funds by the regulatory authority has been carried out and corrective measures are being
implemented.

Regarding private sector development, the Registration Code was amended and the registration fees for
the creation of a business and the transfer of urban commercial real property were reduced significantly.

Progress was less in improving budget execution processes and priority sector spending. The frequent use
of exceptional procedures in paying for government expenditure in 2010 and 2011 did not permit the
efficient allocation of budgetary resources. Priority spending for which budget allocations had been set
aside suffered the most from these practices. New expenditure arrears were accumulated, offsetting
progress made earlier in this area and contributing to weaken confidence in the government’s signature.
The delay in the formation of the new government, the creation of new ministries and changes of
ministers delayed the preparation of procurement plans in 2011, which also affected budget execution.
Regarding the business environment, the registration fees relating to the creation of a business were
reduced as planned; but the number of registered new firms fell significantly in 2011, partly due to
political uncertainty in the wake of the elections. In response, the recourse to exceptional procedures has
been reduced significantly though this practice continues; the regularization of off-budget expenditures is
made daily thanks to a more effective use of Gesco; and the government has undertaken to conduct an
audit of accumulated arrears and devise a plan for clearing these arrears. To improve the business
environment the government intends to strengthen the judicial system and the legal framework as well as
simplifying the land tenure system and boosting access to finance.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The EMGRGIII’s contribution to efforts to mitigate the poverty impacts of the global economic
slowdown in CAR was less than satisfactory. The EMGRGIII provided additional grant resources to the
government but was less effective in supporting public investment in priority sectors, which has been
crowded out. The budget execution rate on the domestically-financed capital budget remained weak for
most priority sector ministries, averaging just 4.6 percent for Education, 2.8 percent for Health, 4.5
percent for rural development, and 9 percent for the Ministry of Social Affairs on a commitment basis in
2011. During the protracted electoral period gains in PFM were reversed, weakening the prospects of
achieving key economic and social priorities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional development impact of the reforms implemented under the EMGRGIII was generally
significant. The EMGRGIII supported the harmonization of the budget nomenclature with the accounting
nomenclature based on OHADA norms, which should facilitate the tracking of poverty-reducing
expenditures and help enforce accountability. The Court of Account’s report on the 2008 government
accounts and the submission to Parliament of the 2008 budget review law are contributing to
strengthening the institutional framework for the external oversight of budget execution. The EMGRGIII
also helped reduce customs duty exemptions and improve compliance to the procurement code. Lack of
institutional capacity in line ministries is being addressed through TA and support by the DGMP to
procurement units in the line ministries. In the forestry sector, the establishment of a national tracking and
verification framework should promote a more sustainable development of the forestry sector. In the
mining sector, reporting on mineral revenues has continued and now covers receipts from minerals other
than diamonds; and in the petroleum sector, adoption of the new downstream legislation should
strengthen the sector’s legal and regulatory framework.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Significant

The EMGRGIII’s assessment of risks in the CAR and ways of mitigating them was moderately
satisfactory. Currently, security risks remain significant, given the continued activities of dissident armed
groups in the north and the destabilizing influence of the LRA in the south-east. Political risks also
remain significant. The EMGRGIII was appraised in the hopeful context that the general elections will
lead to the formation of broad coalitions for peace and development, and thereby prevent political
paralysis and renewed violence. However, since then, political uncertainty and the population’s
frustrations over the government’s perceived lack of inclusiveness and ineffectiveness have persisted.

The macroeconomic risks from a protracted electoral process were recognized, but underestimated. The
elections led to a considerable easing of the reforms and affected the commitment needed to strengthen
budget processes. Since then the government has re-affirmed its commitment to the reform program and
implemented remedial measures. Nonetheless, macroeconomic risks remain. First, a weakening of the
external environment, particularly in the euro area, CAR’s main export market, will keep CAR’s growth
low. Low growth of industrial countries may also limit donor funds. This scenario will test the
government’s commitment to reforms. Regarding PFM, since many of the reforms were done by decrees,

                                                     13
changing them will be easy. Furthermore, the capacity to enforce existing regulations, particularly in the
area of natural resource management and petroleum policy, remains weak despite recent progress and TA.
Various interest groups may take advantage of those weaknesses. Moving beyond improvements in PFM
to delivery of needed services will be difficult because of the weak institutional and delivery capacity.

Several considerations provide hope that the renewed government commitment to reforms may mitigate
these downside risks. First, following the fiscal slippages in 2010-11 the government has taken important
steps to improve confidence in the budget process. It has revitalized existing liquidity monitoring units
and created a budget management monitoring committee to control spending. Next, the institutional
strengthening and capacity building in public procurement realized under the EMGRGIII will help
improve the efficiency of public finances. Similarly, the submission of the 2008 budget review law
represents an important milestone on which to build future efforts to improve transparency and
accountability in the use of public resources. Third, the government is coordinating with donors operating
in CAR to harmonize the structural reform program and ensure its continuity. However, more donor
funding and higher GDP growth will be needed to improve the low social indicators and high poverty rate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

At entry, the EMGRGIII focused on key issues for further improving public finance management and
strengthening governance in the public sector and the management of mining and forestry resources. It
built upon the achievements of the LICUS and IDF grants, EMGRGI and EMGRGII and expanded them
to include reforms to promote private sector development. The design of EMGRGIII was realistic. A two-
tranche grant disbursing on agreed conditions, it helped maintain the focus on critical reforms and ensured
that the Bank remain engaged in policy dialogue with the authorities before and after the elections. The
tranche release conditions were extensively discussed with the authorities, well focused, underpinned by
good analytical work, and took into account the government’s limited capacity. The risk analysis was
satisfactory, pointing out the substantial risks that the CAR faced. Lessons learned from previous
operations were taken into account. These included the need in post-conflict situations to focus on
reforms that are feasible in the context of limited capacity and could set the stage for better budget
execution, better resource mobilization, and better governance in natural resource management. The
EMGRGIII, a Crisis Response Window grant, provided needed resources to a fragile, post conflict
country that was making progress but facing a major external shock that could reverse this progress.
However, the EMGRGIII was less clear in its design about how priority sector spending would be
protected.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Satisfactory

Supervisions were undertaken of EMGRGIII and two ISRs were prepared, both during 2011. During the
implementation phase of the EMGRGIII the TTL was based in the country office. The presence of the
TTL on the ground made possible a sustained supervision of the operation and the release of the second
tranche during the post electoral period. Aide-memoires on performance were prepared in close
consultation with the authorities and the potential impact of fiscal slippages on the overall performance of
the grant was raised. The policy matrix was updated each time. Additional resources were provided

                                                    14
through the LICUS III and IDF grants to strengthen implementation capacity. A wide array of sector
specialists and consultants participated in the supervision missions, contributing valuable expertise and
TA in each of the operation’s policy areas. Bank management was highly supportive of the team.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Moderately Satisfactory

The government commitment to the reforms of EMGRGIII weakened considerably during the protracted
electoral period. The grant’s closing date had to be extended twice. The government’s implementation of
the program has since improved. Progress toward the objectives of strengthening public sector and
economic governance has been satisfactory and the government has renewed its efforts to strengthen
budget execution and public finance management; in this context, the recourse to exceptional procedures
to finance government expenditures has been curtailed sharply. Similarly, steps are being taken to
improve the business environment. The government participated in the EMGRGIII supervision missions
and the dialogue was productive. The Government’s evaluation of the operation is presented in Annex 3.

6. Lessons Learned
A development policy operation can be an effective instrument for addressing key issues in restoring a
functional government and contribute to setting the stage for deeper reforms. A programmatic series of
DPOs may be better than stand-alone DPOs, which may provide a timely response to exogenous shocks
but could lead to inappropriate sequencing of the reforms over the medium term. Going forward the new
DPO series should seek to link more strongly the public sector and economic governance reforms with
measures to promote private sector development.

A two-tranche budget support operation can be effective in supporting the continuation of reforms,
especially in fragile countries. The EMGRGIII, a two-tranche grant disbursing on agreed conditions,
helped maintain the focus on critical reforms and ensured that the Bank remain engaged in policy
dialogue with the authorities before and after the elections. The second tranche helped support the
government’s efforts to restore fiscal discipline following election-related slippages. Its disbursement
helped clear arrears which, in turn, permitted other donors including the IMF and the African
Development Bank to move forward with their support program.

In a fragile post-conflict country such as the CAR, TA should be available to help implement the reform
program supported by the DPO and build up capacity in key areas. TA should promote synergies and
built on them. The policy measures under the EMGRGIII that were most successfully implemented were
those that benefited from greater cooperation among the departments and units concerned. To help build
robust budget processes, reforms should be closely monitored and a close dialogue with the government
should be maintained through frequent supervision missions and a strong field presence.

Introduction

La Banque mondiale a approuvé le Don IDA de 5,8 millions de Droits de tirages Spéciaux (DTS) à la
RCA au titre de l’année 2010 en appui au programme de réformes visant à améliorer la gestion des
finances publiques, à renforcer la gouvernance économique dans le secteur minier, pétrolier et de la foret,
et à améliorer l’environnement des affaires. Suite à l’accord de don H6120-CA y afférant, le
Gouvernement a désigné le CTP/PAS comme l’unité de mise en œuvre. Ce projet a permis de renforcer
la gestion des finances publiques et de promouvoir la bonne gouvernance financière.

Contexte

La mise en œuvre s’est déroulée dans un contexte international difficile, les chocs de 2008 et 2009 ont
fragilisée l’activité économique du pays. La faible demande extérieure, et la chute des prix des matières
premières entrainent un repli important des exportations en volume, -18% en 2008 et -31% en 2009.
Le taux de croissance du PIB réel s’est redressé en 2010 pour s’établir à 3% (contre 1,7 % en 2009). Ce
rebond est en grande partie lié à la hausse de la consommation, dont la contribution à la croissance est
passée de 0,5 point en 2009 à 2,9 points en 2010. L'activité est aussi soutenue dans le secteur primaire,
l'agriculture vivrière et de rente est très dynamique notamment dans les secteurs café et coton, poussée par
des conditions climatiques plus favorables et par une plus grande sécurité dans les zones de production.
L’inflation retombe à un taux moyen de 1% en 2010, contre 3,5% un an plus tôt, reflétant essentiellement
une détente des prix des produits alimentaires et énergétiques. Les crédits au secteur privé se sont accrus
de 32% en 2010 reflétant un rebond de la croissance économique et de la consommation.


Malgré la crise économique mondiale, le ratio de recettes fiscales s’est amélioré en se situant à 9,3 % du
PIB en 2010 contre 8,7% en 2009. Du côté des dépenses et en réponse à la récession économique
mondiale, la politique fiscale vise à soutenir la demande globale tout en maintenant la prudence et en
restant conforme aux engagements pris dans les différents programmes de stabilisation macroéconomique.
Le gouvernement continue de payer régulièrement les salaires et un montant substantiel des arriérés de
salaire accumulés ont été apurés.


Mise en œuvre des composantes du Don IDA H6120-CA

Le projet a été préparé avec beaucoup de réalisme. Les services internes concernés par la mise en œuvre
ont été bien impliqués dès le départ et les déclencheurs tout comme les mesures clés pour les prochaines
étapes étaient bien définis en accord avec tous les responsables. Les objectifs du projet ont des
implications directes sur la gestion des finances publiques et sur le renforcement de la gouvernance
économique dans les secteurs productifs.

Résultats et déclencheurs du don IDA H6120-CA

Les mesures concourant au renforcement et à l’amélioration de la gestion des finances publiques au cours
de l’année 2010 sont:

                                                    23
    •   L’harmonisation des nouvelles nomenclatures comptables et budgétaires conformément aux
        normes de l’OHADA
    •   Un système informatique de gestion intégré des dépenses de l’engagement au paiement a été mis
        en place en Janvier 2010 ;
    •   Le document de stratégie globale des Finances Publiques a été élaboré et validé en juin 2010 ;
    •   Le compte de gestion 2008 a été finalisé et soumis à la Cour des Comptes. La loi de règlement y
        afférant a été adoptée par le Parlement en 2012.
    •   La gestion rationnelle de trésorerie de l’Etat se traduit au niveau du Trésor par le maintient d’un
        compte courant dans chacune des banques commerciales. A cela s’ajoute trois comptes
        transitoires dans trois banques commerciales.
    •   La mobilisation additionnelle des ressources est le fait du suivi et du contrôle des exonérations
        fiscales et douanières. Le CICFED émet des avis sur chaque demande d’exonération accordée
        ou rejetée. Tous les dossiers de demande d’exonération revus par CICFED sont accessibles au
        grand public.
    •   L’alignement de la Charte nationale d’investissement est fait sur la Charte régionale dans le Code
        général des impôts.

S’agissant de la Gouvernance économique dans le secteur public, les autorités n’ont ménagé aucun effort
pour mettre en œuvre les mesures suivantes :
    • Le renforcement du cadre légal de lutte contre la corruption en cohérence avec la convention
        des nations Unies par la mise en conformité des textes.
    • La mise place du cadre réglementaire de passation des marchés publics incite les fournisseurs à
        postuler pour la commande publique. L’opérationnalisation de l’Autorité de Régulation des
        Marchés Publics (ARMP) qui se traduit par l’élaboration régulière des rapports de conformités
        permet d’identifier des mesures correctives à toute irrégularité qui survient dans le processus de
        passation de marchés
    • Les nouveaux permis octroyés dans le domaine minier sont en conformité avec la convention type
        prescrite par le nouveau code
    • La Mise en œuvre des principes d’ITIE traduit l’adhésion volontaire de la République
        Centrafricaine à l’Initiative pour la Transparence des Industries Extractives (ITIE). Ainsi le
        deuxième rapport amélioré d’ITIE qui couvre les exercices 2007, 2008 et 2009 est publié sur les
        sites WEB officiels du Gouvernement et la dissémination du rapport sur le territoire national.
        Le plan d’action de la phase II ITIE (2011-2013) est adopté par le Conseil National ITIE.

    Le renforcement de la gouvernance dans le secteur forestier se traduit par la publication systématique
    dans les communes forestières du mécanisme de partage des revenus forestiers entre le Trésor, la
    caisse d’affectation spéciale du Ministère en charge de la forêt et les communautés. En outre, le
    Gouvernement a mis en chantier un programme national de traçabilité et de vérification dont
    l’adoption sera effective dans le but de mettre en place un système de vérification de la légalité des
    productions de bois d’œuvre, dans le contexte du processus d’« Application des réglementations
    forestières, gouvernance et échanges commerciaux (FLEGT).

Réformes d’approfondissement :

Concernant les mesures entreprises dans les domaines de la gestion des finances publiques et du secteur
public depuis 2010, on peut citer l’amélioration de la qualité de la préparation et de l’exécution du
budget avec :
   • L’adoption d’une circulaire présidentielle fixant le cadre de préparation du projet de Loi de
        Finances 2011, après adoption par le Conseil des ministres. Cette circulaire comporte également
        le calendrier budgétaire.

                                                   24
    •   Le renforcement du processus participatif dans le cadre de la préparation (PLF 2013) avec la
        prise en compte de quatre nouveaux départements sectoriels, ce qui portera le nombre des
        départements visités dans le cadre des prés conférences budgétaires à 18. De plus un projet de
        guide méthodologique de préparation du budget est en cours d’élaboration.
    •    La poursuite de la publication trimestrielle des rapports d'exécution budgétaire.
    •   L’amélioration de l'applicatif GESCO, en y intégrant les ministères qui dépensent leurs propres
        ressources et les régies de recettes et limiter rigoureusement le recours aux procédures de
        dépenses exceptionnelles.

    •   L’audit des arriérés intérieurs de 2008 ,2009 et 2010 a été effectué. Un plan d’apurement de ces
        arriérés assorti de critères de sélection transparents sera adopté prochainement. Le nouvel audit
        des arriérés intérieurs accumulés en 2011 est en préparation.

L’amélioration du contrôle et de la gestion des sociétés de service public, avec :

    •   La création par décret du Conseil Spécial de Surveillance et de Redressement des Entreprises et
        Offices Publics (CSSR-EOP), a permis au Gouvernement d’examiner la situation comptable,
        financière et organisationnelle des entreprises et offices publics.
Le gouvernement tient à l'amélioration des résultats financiers des sociétés de service public, par le
règlement intégral des consommations publiques, la mise en place des plans d'action détaillés devant
conduire à leur viabilité financière à moyen terme qui se traduit par la signature des contrats de
performance avec la direction de ces sociétés ceci permettra de suivre l’exécution des plans d'action afin
de veiller à l'utilisation judicieuse des ressources additionnelles. Ces mesures transitoires ont permis de
révéler des dérapages dans la gestion financière de ces entités et de prendre des mesures correctives. Le
retour au fonctionnement normal des organes des entreprises et offices publics se fera rapidement.
L’amélioration de la gouvernance dans le secteur forestier, un projet de loi portant création de l’Agence
autonome de gestion des ressources forestières a été adopté par le Conseil des ministres et acheminé à
l’Assemblée Nationale en Mars 2012.
Sur le volet du climat des affaires :
    • L’adoption en Conseil des Ministres de la Charte Nationale de l’Investissement.

Le Gouvernement s’engage à améliorer l’environnement des affaires et des investissements afin d'attirer
de nouveaux grands projets d’investissement et de favoriser la création d'emplois, et compte poursuivre
ses efforts dans le sens d' une meilleure communication et d’une meilleure transparence avec le secteur
privé et à veiller à l'application judicieuse de la législation en matière d'imposition et d'investissement
ainsi que des dispositions régissant l’activité économique

Supervision de la mise en œuvre du don IDA-H474-CF

L’ unité de supervision du Don en l’occurrence le CTP/PAS, actuelle CS-REF était chargé de superviser
les appuis budgétaires des autres bailleurs y compris le programme de réforme soutenu par l’FEC du FMI.
L’appui budgétaire qui a suivi le présent don a été supervisé de la même manière avec des résultats
satisfaisants.

 Assessment of the Implementation of the Third Economic Management and Governance
           Reform Grant (DPO IV) and Comments on the draft ICR Report

Introduction

The World Bank approved the IDA grant in the amount of DTS 5.8 million in 2010 to support the
government reform program aimed at improving public finance management, strengthening economic
governance in the mining, petroleum and forestry sectors, and improving the business environment.
Following the grant agreement the government designated the Committee for the monitoring of economic
and financial reforms (CS/REF) as the implementing agency. The grant helped strengthen public finance
management and promote good financial governance.

Context

The grant was implemented in a difficult international context; exogenous shocks in 2008 and 2009
weakened economic activity. Low external demand and a fall in commodity prices had led to a sharp
decline in export, by 18 percent in 2008 and 31 percent in 2009 in volume terms. Real GDP growth
rebounded to 3.0 percent in 2010 from 1.7 percent in 2009. This rebound was due in large part to an
increase in consumption whose contribution to GDP growth rose from 0.5 percentage points in 2009 to
2.9 percentage points in 2010; but also to stronger activity in the primary sector, with significant growth
in production of food and cash crops, including coffee and cotton, owing to improved weather and
security conditions in producing areas. Average inflation declined to 1 percent in 2010 from 3.5 percent
in 2009, reflecting a decline in the prices of food and fuel. Reflecting the rebound in real GDP growth and
consumption, credit to the private sector rose by 32 percent in 2010.

Despite the economic crisis tax revenues improved, rising to 9.3 percent of GDP in 2010 from 8.7 percent
of GDP in 2009. On the expenditure side, in response to the world economic slowdown, fiscal policy
aimed to sustain aggregate demand while remaining prudent in accordance with the macroeconomic
stabilization program. The government continues to ensure the regular payment of salaries and has
cleared substantial salary arrears.

Implementation of the EMGRGIII

The grant was prepared with a lot of realism. All the departments concerned were consulted at the
preparation stage of the grant and the tranche release conditions were well defined, in consultation with
the authorities. The grant objectives have direct implications for public finance management and for
strengthening economic governance in the productive sectors.

Results and tranche release conditions

The measures contributing to strengthening and improving public finance management during 2010
include:

    •   The harmonization of accounting and budget nomenclatures in accordance with OHADA norms;
    •   The establishment of a computerized expenditure management system from commitment to the
        payment phase in January 2010;
    •   The elaboration of the global strategy for public finance management and its validation in June
        2010;
    •   Submission of the government accounts for the year 2008 to the Court of Account; and adoption
        of the budget review law by Parliament in 2012;

    •   The rationalization of cash management through the maintenance of a treasury account in each of
        the commercial banks and three transitory accounts in three commercial banks;
    •   Reinforcement of domestic revenue mobilization through the monitoring and control of tax and
        customs duty exemptions. The Inter-ministerial Committee in Charge of tax and customs
        Exemptions (CICEFD) makes a recommendation on every tax and customs duty exemption that
        is approved or rejected. All the exemption requests reviewed by the CICEFD are available to the
        public;
    •   The national investment chart is aligned on the regional chart in the general tax code.

Regarding economic governance in the public sector, the authorities have endeavored to implement the
following measures:

    •   The reinforcement of the legal framework for the fight against corruption in line with the United
        Nations convention by aligning CAR’s laws and legislations;
    •   The establishment of the legal framework for public procurement, which is encouraging suppliers
        to bid for government contracts. The operationalization of the Public Procurement Regulatory
        Authority is reflected in the preparation of a review of conformity to the procurement code,
        including recommendations of corrective measures to impediments to the execution of contracts;
    •   The new permits awarded in the mining sector are in line with the standard convention in the new
        mining code;
    •   The implementation of EITI principles demonstrates the government voluntary adherence to the
        Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The second EITI report covering the years
        2007, 2008 and 2009 has been published in the official government websites and disseminated
        across the national territory. The national EITI council has adopted the action plan for the second
        EITI phase (2011-2013).

The reinforcement of governance in the forestry sector is reflected in the systematic publication in the
forestry communes of the mechanism for sharing forestry revenues between the treasury, the special
development fund and forestry communities. In addition the government is implementing a national
program for the traceability and verification of timber production in the context of the Forestry Law
Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative.

Deepening of reforms

With regard to the measures undertaken in the areas of public finance management and public sector
governance since 2010, one can cite:

The amelioration of the quality of budget preparation and execution, with:
   • The adoption of a presidential circular, setting out the framework for the preparation of the 2011
       budget, following its adoption by the council of ministers. This circular also includes the budget
       calendar.
   • The reinforcement of the participatory process in the context of the preparation of the 2013
       budget law, with the inclusion of four new departments in the budget consultations bringing the
       number of government departments participating in the budget consultations to 18. Moreover a
       methodological guide for the preparation of the budget is under preparation.
   • The continuation of the quarterly publication of budget execution reports;
   • Improvement of the electronic system Gesco through the integration of ministries that spend own-
       generated revenues as well as revenue collecting agencies and a strong limit placed on
       exceptional procedures to finance government expenditures;


                                                   27
   •   The audit of domestic arrears for 2008, 2009 and 2010 has been carried out. A plan to clear these
       arrears based on transparent selection criteria would be adopted soon. The audit of arrears
       accumulated in 2011 is under preparation.

The amelioration of the control and management of public service companies, with:

   •   The creation by decree of the special council for the monitoring and rehabilitation of public
       enterprises and offices (CSSR-EOP), which has enabled the government to examine the
       accounting, financial and organizational capacity of public enterprises and offices.

   The government is striving to improve the financial results of public service enterprises through the
   full payment of public consumption, the formulation of action plans to achieve financial viability over
   the medium term, and performance contracts signed with the companies’ management which will
   help monitor the implementation of these action plans and the efficient utilization of additional
   resources. These measures have helped bring out slippages in the financial management of these
   companies and to take corrective actions. The return to normal operation in the public companies and
   offices is expected to occur rapidly.

The improvement of governance in the forestry sector, with:

   •   The adoption by the Council of Ministers of a draft law to create an autonomous agency for the
       management of forestry resources; and submission of the draft law to Parliament in March 2012.

Regarding the business environment,

   •   The adoption by the Council of Ministers of the National Chart of Investment.

 The government is committed to improving the business environment in order to attract large new
investment projects and to encourage job creation. The government intends to continue improving
communication and transparency with the private sector and to ensure an adequate implementation of the
legislation governing taxation of the sector as well as investment and measures to stimulate economic
activity.

Supervision

The Committee for the monitoring of economic and financial reforms (CS/REF) supervised the
EMGRGIII. The CS/REF was also responsible for the supervision of budget support operations of the
other partners, including the reform program supported by the IMF’s extended credit facility (ECF). The
EMGRGIII was supervised in the same manner as the previous grant (EMGRGII) with satisfactory results.
