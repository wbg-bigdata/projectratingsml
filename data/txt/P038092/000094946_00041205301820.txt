3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The success of the Former Yugoslav Republic of (FYR) Macedonia's economic reform program will
depend upon whether the Borrower can deal effectively with the social dimensions of reform. The objective
of the Project is to support the Borrower's reform program by:
(a) Facilitating the restructuring of socially owned enterprises through actions to reduce the individual and
community impacts of worker dislocation;



(b) Improving the delivery of social benefits and the collection of payroll contributions for social benefits;
(c) Improving public awareness of the rationale for reform policies; and
(d) Supporting the continuing implementation of the enterprise restructuring program

3.5 Quality at Entiy:
HS - The Govemment's objective was to provide support to the stabilization and structural reform program
it had embarked upon since 1994, by providing effective solutions to the social impact of the economic
reform. With the trade, legal and regulatory framework for private sector development in a capitalist
market economy already partially in place, the objectives of the SRTAP were highly relevant to the
countrys current needs and well aligned with its development strategy. The SRTAP was a particularly
relevant complement to the Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (FESAC), by providing
support, reinforcement and longer-term attention to the social aspects of the transition, critical to the
success of the structural reform program.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been pursuing an aggressive enterprise restructuring
program for several years. The first phase of this program commenced in 1994 with the restructuring of
the 24 largest loss making enterprises through bankruptcy, sale, closure and liquidation of state firms. The
SRTAP financed the development and refinement of programs to provide social support to workers. The
basic fabric of Macedonian society would have had difficulty in dealing with major structural changes in
the economy without the SRTAP project. The inevitable increase in poverty during the transition has been
kept in check by an adequate and well targeted social safety net supported by the SRTAP; and social peace
and support for the reform program have been maintained. Outcomes have been mostly as expected at
appraisal, except for the impact of the Kosovo conflict, which could not have been anticipated at the time
of project design.
SRTAP programs were designed to support the restructuring and privatization process of the 24 largest
loss-making enterprises as well as to contribute to overall policy and institutional development in income
support. The programs were to also support development of labor institutions and policies attuned to the
needs of an emerging market economy. Positive results were achieved: 23 of the large loss-makers were
restructured in to 160 separate enterprises. From these 160, 130 were privatized, 10 were liquidated, and
20 are State-owned. The objectives of the Project at appraisal were geared towards assisting employees of
these 24 enterprises, and easing the dismissal of redundant employees and developing measures to generate
-2-



employment for those employees once laid off. During the second year of implementation, given the
political realities of the country, the Bank agreed to broaden the scope of the Project in order to encompass
all registered unemployed people. Thus, for the remainder of the Project, the unemployed were grouped
and ranked in terms of their redundancy or unemployment: (1 st priority) large loss-making enterprises;
(2nd priority) bankrupt enterprises; (3rd priority) any other enterprises; and (4th priority) first time job
seekers. This decision, to widen the target group, led to the reduction of political and social pressures from
the economic program, and contributed substantially to the acceptance and overall success of the
Government's restructuring program and project.
The SRTAP has gone even further than originally planned, and supports the latest CAS objectives by
providing resources to build the institutional capacity necessary to implement several new or revised pieces
of legislation, including in particular the new Bankruptcy Law which was adopted in November 1997 and
became effective in April 1998. At the time the restructuring program was initiated, formal bankruptcy
through the court system was not considered to be an option. Under the then existing law, opening of a
bankruptcy procedure triggered the automatic termination of all employment contracts and freed the
bankrupt enterprise from the statutory obligation to make severance payments to its workers. These
features guaranteed that no judge would ever declare a large enterprise bankrupt. Therefore, as all of the
enterprises and most of their creditors were either State or socially owned, an out of court process,
incorporating the main features of bankruptcy, was deemed to be the appropriate way of restructuring and
privatizing the large loss-makers. The SRTAP, among other donors, has funded the provision of extensive
training for judges and bankruptcy trustees who will implement this new law. Two follow-up, Bank
financed operations, will strengthen the still weak financial discipline of the enterprise sector, FESAL II
and its complement the Social Support Project (SSP), to ameliorate the social impact of adjustment. The
SSP builds directly on the activities and institutions supported by the SRTAP.
In view of the depth of the reforms, and the strong institutional achievements within a hostile external
environment, the outcome of the SRTAP is assessed as satisfactory
4.2 Outputs by components:
Labor Redeployment Component. This component facilitated the restructuring of State-owned
enterprises (SOEs) by providing a variety of active labor programs which reduced the negative social
impact on individual workers' and communities. The component has provided post-lay off services to
19,531 displaced workers, at an average unit cost of US$248. The delivery of this kind of services will
continue to be financed under the Social Support Project (SSP). The component has also provided funding
to develop a model local employment bureau services in Skopje, and the National Employment Bureau is in
the process of completing the automation of all local employment bureau services which should improve
service delivery and cost-effectiveness within the next few months. Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The component was comprised of five sub-components: (a) Enterprise Analysis; (b) Pre-Layoff
Assistance; (c) Post-Layoff Services; (d) Employment Bureau; and (e) Project Coordination Unit. Four of
the sub-components were implemented by the Privatization Agency (AP). Sub-component (d) was
implemented by the National Employment Bureau.
The enterprise analysis sub-component was successful in developing capacity within the Employment
Assistance Group (EAG) to fulfil its responsibilities as outlined at appraisal. A small and efficient EAG,
with only four staff, was responsible for: (i) the management of the Labor Redeployment Fund (LRF) and
all technical decision-making from preparation to implementation of subprojects; (ii) analysis of evolving
labour legislation and providing feedback to Government on necessary amendments to legislation, based on
concrete experiences observed during the implementation of the various types of sub-projects, i.e. job



counselling, public works, and training and retraining projects; (iii) designing methods to adjust the labor
force according to the needs for divestiture during privatization, and applying findings to the 24 large
loss-makers; and (iv) designing evaluation methodologies for analysis of the social infrastructure of these
enterprises and the need for divestiture during privatization. Some major results of the statistical analysis
performed by EAG included the following: - after the first wave of dismissals, 78% of the remaining
employees are younger than 45 years of age; - further layoffs without investment into productivity
enhancements might have a negative impact on productivity; - unskilled or semi-qualified employees are
affected first by dismissals; - typically high rates of employees in the administrative departments require
adjustments; - more personnel than requested by the respective restructuring programs had been dismissed;
and - the average turnover per employee indicated a need for further personnel adjustments and/or
investment in production extension in order to improve productivity. The approaches developed by the
EAG are presently available, for use in further restructuring programs.
When implementation commenced, the large loss-making enterprises had already dismissed the majority of
redundant employees, therefore demand for sub-component (b) pre-lay off assistance was marginal, and
only one enterprise agreement was signed to support its internal follow-up of the adjustment process. It
must be noted though, that the communities where the large-loss making enterprises were located, were
informed about this potential support in case of new major layoffs being planned. As social tensions were
observed during the first layoff wave, the communities welcomed this kind of possible support. Another
observation of the Employment Assistance Group (EAG) was that although the personnel analysis in most
enterprises indicated, that in many cases additional dismissals would have to occur to secure their
development, but economic circumstances had not deteriorated sufficiently to force most enterprises to take
severe staffing decisions. Furthermore, additional factors concerning unpaid wages and severance payment
regulations, under certain circumstances made it relatively more attractive to retain redundant workers on
payroll, rather than dismiss them. These issues are being tackled under the SSP project, given the changed
environment provided by the approval of the new Bankruptcy Law.
(c) This sub-component effectively designed the procedures for the planning, implementation and
monitoring of the post-layoff services projects financed by the Labor Redeployment Fund (LRF). LRF
funds were made available for the implementation of the following specific programs: - job counselling and
relocation services; - retraining services; - temporary community employment; - small business assistance
programs; - small business incubator programs; and - regional economic development planning. In order
to ensure the success of the post-layoff services sub-component, brochures were developed for the different
target audiences, and publicized through-out the country, explaining the different programs, their
conditionality and potential opportunities for displaced workers. Post-layoff services had a very high
demand, and were extended to all unemployed workers within the second year of implementation. Although
originally envisaged as being contracted between enterprises and services providers, due to the lack of
interest of SOEs in fulfilling this role, the program eventually evolved to satisfactory contracting
arrangements between services providers and the Privatization Agency. A total of 264 sub-projects were
implemented, providing services to 19,531 displaced workers, generating formal permanent employment for
7,800 persons, at an average unit cost of US$248. The average cost per formal sector, permanent
employment following program completion was US$363. Relocation and job counselling ser-vices were
provided mainly through the National and Regional Employment Bureaus, helping to establish their
capacity in the delivery of these services in ten regions. Private sector participation was limited to only two
projects due to the difficulties in obtaining licenses for private operators, despite the amendments to
relevant legislation. Four different types of retraining services were developed: - requalification of
employees with a high risk of dismissal; - training of registered unemployed persons in enterprise; - training
of registered unemployed persons in training institutions; and - management training. Highest demand was
expressed for enterprise retraining with the signature of 186 contracts, benefiting approximately 10,150
- 4 -



unemployed workers, and average job placement rates of about 93%. Temporary Community Employment
(public works) sub-projects were financed on the basis of their adding lasting public value to the
community. A total of 27 communities participated in this program. The Labor Redeployment Fund
(LRF) also played a major role in the creation of new employment opportunities by facilitating the
establishment of new enterprises. This sub-component targeted the most active and courageous workers,
and assisted them in becoming entrepreneurs. The LRF provided a well defined program of support for the
establishment of small scale business, based on the incubators and the small business assistance component
of the program. The regional economic development planning program supported initiatives from the
communities, to indicate and develop their local job creation programs. These studies were the basis for
further development activities and projects. The delivery of these kind of LRF services has been highly
successful and well received by the Macedonian population at large, and is supported with Bank financing
under the SSP. The AP monitored projects during implementation, and evaluated them after termination.
A net impact study will also be carried out with SSP financing to further understand the successes and
shortcomings of this sub-component.
(d) The Employment Bureau has successfully piloted the delivery of more cost effective services for job
seekers at the Skopje Model Local Employment office. It plans to expand these updated services to other
Local Employment Offices in the near future. The automation of Local Employment Bureaux is expected
to be completed by the end of calendar year 1999. Automation is envisaged to improve the efficiency of
the National and Local Employment Offices in the processing of pertinent data, as well as preparing
reports for relevant ministries and employers.
(e) The Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) played a crucial role in coordinating all activities under the
Project. It successfully procured all goods and services purchased with Bank financing, and also
monitoring the provision of counterpart funds. It has developed the capacity to manage project with high
performance standards. The new SSP project is also being implemented by this PCU.
NOTE: The Borrower's ICR (Annex 8) includes a matrix summarizing the achievements by component
and sub-component. It is in accordance with the performance indicators agreed upon at appraisal. These
indicators were included in the original Project Operational Manual (POM) for the systematic monitoring
and evaluation of progress in Project implementation.
Public Information Campaign Component. This component, which aimed at building public support for
the Govemment's reform program, has been the weakest link in an otherwise extremely successful Project.
The Media Coordination Unit originally established within the AP was transferred to the Prime Minister's
office until the end of 1997, where he had a strong spokesperson who could provide adequate leadership to
the unit. Six public opinion surveys were conducted by the Institute for Sociological, Political and
Juridical Research team, as anticipated at appraisal. Thorough data processing and analysis were
completed at regular intervals, before and after the public information campaign. The results of these
surveys were not widely disseminated initially, nor were they incorporated into the media campaign.
Project savings allowed for the equipping of a Macedonia Information Agency (MIA), as requested by the
Government and approved by the Bank. Presently MIA does not provide any services related to this
Project, since it operates as independent media.
Rating: Marginally Satisfactory, while the six surveys were completed and the Macedonia Information
Agency (MIA) was established, the new govemment has not shown an interest in sustaining the PIC at the
Prime Minister's level. It must be noted that relevant and successful publicity efforts were also undertaken
by the LRF under the Labor Redeployment Component.
Social Benefit Programs Component. Efficiency improvements in the delivery and administration of
-5-



social services have been initiated with the implementation of these three subcomponents: (i) social
assistance; (ii) actuarial analysis of pensions; and (iii) payroll tax compliance.
Rating: Satisfactory
Data and programs for the construction of a poverty line were completed within the social assistance
sub-component. The staff of the Statistics Office and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection
(MOLSP) were trained in poverty line methodology and computing of poverty lines. Methodological
changes have been introduced in the system, on the basis of the 1998 report which identified measures to
improve efficiency and equity in the delivery of social assistance program. However, local offices have yet
to utilize the national level reporting system. One model Social Assistance office was established in
Skopje, and further efficiency improvements are yet to be achieved due to poor communications among the
local Social Assistance offices, the MOLSP's Automation Unit and the Social Assistance Department.
MOLSP's Automation Unit has been instrumental in the planning and implementation of the automation of
local Social Assistance offices has been completed, staff have been trained and are producing reports for
the MOLSP. The Automation Unit is managing a multitude of projects for the Ministry, and has been able
to deliver aggregated data via computerized tables on demand. A more regular reporting system is
presently being established for period distribution of relevant information to all interested ministries.
An actuarial model of the pension system was developed within the actuarial analysis of pensions
subcomponent. Staff at MOLSP were trained in its use. Based on the analyses performed, the MOLSP
was able to prepare for a major pension reform and to undertake necessary reforms of the Social Assistance
Decree for 1999-2001.
Additional support to the pension reform was provided by the activities undertaken within the payroll tax
compliance sub-component. Major changes were recommended and enacted in the procedures for
registration, collection, and audit of payroll taxes.
Special Restructuring Program (SRP) Technical Assistance. This program supported the establishment
of the Trustee Unit (TU) in the Ministry of Economy, to represent the interests of creditors and the MOF
during the implementation of the SRP. The TU designed measures to cut losses and reduce costs. It
encountered two types of implementation difficulties: (a) enterprise trustees could not replace well
connected enterprise managers; and (b) powerful enterprise trustees made inappropriate applications for
financing. Major objectives were met since the 23 major loss-makers were separated into 160 enterprises,
of which the majority were privatized (130), 10 were liquidated and 20 still remain under State ownership.
Although the TU was closed in 1996, the SRTAP Project continued to provide technical assistance for
major policy issues, as they appeared. In particular, it provided assistance with: (i) the diagnosis of the
status of enterprises; (ii) the preparation and implementation of restructuring and privatization plans; (iii)
review of these plans by the AP; (iv) post-privatization including management training for SRP enterprises;
(v) capacity building of the main bankruptcy actors in order to initiate and lead sound bankruptcy
procedures; and (vi) the pre-privatization restructuring of the biggest agricultural companies. The
subcomponent did not provide stringent financial controls or any approvals for bank credits or support
payments from the fiscal budget, because there were no applications. Basically none of the enterprises, or
their sub-units went into liquidation. On the basis of this experience, bankruptcy judges were trained on
the application of the new Bankruptcy law which became effective in 1998. The implementation of this
law is being supported by a second FESAL and the SSP.

4.5 Instituitional development impact:
The SRTAP has built institutional capacity within the AP, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy and
Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, to support the privatization effort in order to reverse the perverse
incentives inherent in the previously socially owned enterprises. These institutions are presently in a much
better position to provide an enabling environment for private sector growth, by continuing to support
bankruptcy and labor restructuring of state-owned enterprises identified for support under the proposed
FESAL II Project. The National Employment Bureau and MOLSP (both national and local offices) are
better staffed, trained, and experienced, as a result of SRTAP, to continue to improve the targeting of the
benefits of social assistance programs, upgrade front-line social services (social assistance and labor
services), and use non-governmental partnerships for the social and economic integration of marginalized
groups. The institutional development impact of the programs carried out under SRTAP is assessed as
high.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
During the last year of project implementation the Kosovo crisis had a hampering effect on the real positive
impact of the project, particularly in terms of job creation. As explicitly anticipated in the 1998 CAS, there
was a substantial escalation in violence in Kosovo and massive refugee outflows into Macedonia among
other neighboring countries. The number of displaced workers increased substantially during 1999, and the
general socio-political and economic environment was unfavorable to the overall restructuring effort. The
Bank has responded with a large scale effort to assist the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to
mitigate the social costs arising from the conflict and to help with the costs associated with the structural
reform program. The Bank is financing FESAL II and the SSP to this effect.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Selecting the AP for the establishment of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) proved to be a very wise
decision, which contributed greatly to the successful implementation of the Project. The institutional
capacity of the Employment Bureau and MOLSP have been strengthened in the process of implementing
their own components and subcomponents of the Project. Some of the weaknesses of the current economic
and social situation did impinge upon the implementation of activities within the special restructuring
program (SRP). In particular, the poor management of the enterprise sector has yet to improve, mainly due
to inside ownership and management. The Government's willingness to approve the Bankruptcy Law in
1998 bodes well for the implementation of further privatization and labor restructuring needs of the
country.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Since the AP is directly accountable to the Government, its ability to conduct the technical and
administrative procedures of the Project was sometimes affected by national politics. However, this upset
was minimal, and the PCU was instrumental in assuring a successful coordination of Project activities,
adequately monitoring fulfillment of objectives and outcomes, within the agreed financing envelope.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Due to a substantial depreciation of the SDR, actual total project costs were US$15.2 million, versus an
estimate of US$17.1 million at appraisal. Bank financing remained unchanged, at 9.0 Million SDRs, yet
this represents a substantial shortfall in US Dollar terms, from US$14.0 million estimated at appraisal, to
US$12.5 million at the time of closing. This substantial shortfall in US Dollar terms necessitated very
skillful financial management by the PCU, including the deferral of the net impact evaluation study of the
LRF which will be financed by the follow-up SSP Project.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Given the continued emphasis on labor restructuring, sustainability of the social reforms is highly likely.
Many of the shortcomings listed above are being addressed. Further Bank financial support has been
assured with the SSP project which will be implemented during 1999-2002. It is important to note that
throughout the transition, the Government has remained the owner of the reforms. The current challenge
for the Government is to maintain the consensus of the electorate around the remaining reform agenda,
while deepening its implementation, and in parallel, to encourage the private sector to invest heavily in the
restructuring, modernization and expansion of established and emerging enterprises.
However, the sustainability of the reforms can be undermined by underfinancing of social benefits, in
particular, unemployment and pension benefits, within a medium-term scenario of still rising
unemployment. Social tensions have been high during 1999, and exacerbated by the Kosovo crisis.
Efficiency improvements in the delivery and administration of social services are necessary, but it is
important to maintain existing benefits for the next two to three years of still painful reforms, even if this
should require additional budgetary transfers.
6.2 Transition arrangement to reguzlar operations:
The Social Support Project will provide transitional financing to help mitigate the negative social and
economic impact of bankruptcy and labor restructuring of large state owned enterprises, and the emergency
economic disruption caused by the conflict in Kosovo.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
The Bank's performance in the preparation, appraisal and negotiations of the Project was satisfactory.
During the pre-appraisal of the FESAC Project, it became apparent to the Social Sectors Team that the
success of the Government's economic reform program would depend upon its capacity to deal effectively
with the human dimensions of reform. The Minister of Finance, who was in charge of privatization at the
time (July 1994) stated that "At last, one of our major aid partners understands what is needed in order for
real macroeconomic reform to happen! ". The SRTAP was successfully processed as the necessary
companion to the FESAC Project. The design of the implementation plan and performance indicators in
close collaboration with counterpart staff has proved an invaluable tool for continued monitoring and
updating of project activities.
7.2 Sutpervision:
The Bank's performance during supervision of the SRTAP was also satisfactory. The Bank team, the
Borrower and the implementing agencies worked collegialy at all times. Skill mix and continuity of staff
were adequate. Missions were extremely sensitive to the progress of the overall reform program under
extremely difficult conditions, and appropriately weighed the needs for adjustments in the scope of
activities, keeping the focus on the overall development impact of the Project.
The development of the Project Operational Manual was essential for providing guidance to all
participants, and it was maintained as a live document, which was updated, and changed with the
experience gained by the Borrower during implementation. Throughout the processing and implementation
of the SRTAP, the Government had much praise for the quality, expertise, openness and responsiveness of
Bank staff and for the overall assistance and flexibility it provided.
-8 -



The Bank could have provided more consistent support in the implementation of the Public Information
Campaign Component, which was the weakest link and could have benefited from consistent guidance in an
area which was quite unfamiliar to the Borrower, and Government authorities in general.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
The Bank was responsive and sensitive to the national development priorities in the design of the project
objectives, and the project fitted well with FYR of Macedonia's structural reform agenda. The Project is
recognized to having contributed to achieving the goals of social stability by Government personnel and
stakeholders alike. The Bank's overall performance is rated as satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Government was committed to the need for a successful implementation of the structural reform
agenda, and the need for doing it with a human face. Therefore, the collegiality and positive attitude of all
agenci.es concerned was a particularly uplifting experience for the Bank's preparation team.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's performance during implementation has been satisfactory. For the most part, the
Borrower faithfully pursued the vision and the commitments made during preparation. Where it has lagged
(e.g. lack of utilization of information provided in the public information surveys) it has mainly been due to
the lack of understanding of the impact that could have been achieved, and partly, due to the political
priorities and allegiances of the governing coalition
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The AP fulfilled its obligations in an exemplary manner. The PCU established within the AP was staffed
with fully committed and dedicated staff, capable of identifying their shortcomings and effectively
improving their qualifications both with on the job training and learning-by-doing. Staff in the
Employment Bureau have also learned about the benefits of the Project, during its implementation, and are
now committed to sustaining and improving on their performance. Staff in the Staff at the MOLSP have
had a more difficult time learning to work as a team among the various departments and local Social
Assistance offices. They are finally reaping the benefits of this collaboration, which will assure its
continuity. The Media Coordination Unit at the Prime Minister's office no longer exists, despite the fact
that the Government would benefit from appropriately targeted interventions of a spokesperson who could
periodically address the public at large and explain the Government's overall reform agenda, as well as
individual actions being undertaken at the time.
7.7 Overall Borrowver perfbrmance:
The Government maintained commitment to the reform agenda throughout project implementation and
remains committed to achieve sustainability in the medium term. The Borrower's performance is rated as
highly satisfactory based on its successful completion of the project, and readiness to implement the
follow-up SSP Project. This rating also takes into consideration the fact that the AP, the AP's PCU, the
Employment Bureau, the Statistical Office, and MOLSP did an excellent job during implementation.
8. Lessons Learned
I .    Borrower's commitment and ownership are critical elements for the success of the reform program.
The SRTAP was a complex and sensitive project in terms of the socio-political environment of the country.
The Project benefited from the close coordination, and working partnership between the Borrower and the
Bank. The Government appreciated the flexible adjustments allowed by the Bank during project
-9-



implementation, providing changes which were in line with the main project objectives.
2.    The Government would have benefited from explaining early on the hardships and benefits to be
derived from privatization, and the mechanisms it was setting in place to ameliorate the worst aspects that
could be expected from privatization. The Government would have also benefited from being more open,
and publicizing at a level comprehensible to the general population, the agreements it had reached with the
Bank and the International Monetary Fund who were to financially support the micro-and macro
implications of the privatization effort. This would have helped the affected interest groups, the intellectual
elite and the public better understand the overall vision and goals of the reform program. By reducing the
uncertainty about what was planned for implementation, and when, it would have improved the efficiency
of private economic agents' decisions.
3.    An adequate social safety net was a critical element for limiting a transitional rise in poverty and
for successful implementation of the adjustment programs. In this case, the adequacy of the social safety
net for a population accustomed to high levels of social services has been critical in limiting the pressure of
special interest groups on policy makers to manageable levels.
4.    Where institutions are weak, all types of operations have to be accompanied by technical assistance
to ensure the required expertise for implementation. The PCU engaged early on a project
management/procurement advisor which enabled it to establish sound management and financing practices
for the life of the Project. Stakeholders in the various implementing agencies were provided with rigorous
technical assistance which was key to the achievement of reforms, and new methodologies for dealing with
social safety net issues.
5.    When purchasing information technology equipment and software, their maintenance should be
automatically insured. The Project provided computer equipment to all implementing agencies. The
various institutions were to submit maintenance plans when they submitted their purchasing proposals, as
well as plans for their continued maintenance after the Project closed. These institutions are now facing up
to the fact that they will have difficulty maintaining and servicing the new information technology systems
because of the lack of financial resources. In the short term, SSP will be able to remedy the situation.

BORROWER'S IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
November, 1999
Prepared by the Project Coordination Unit
Of the Privatization Agency of the Republic of Macedonia
in collaboration with
Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, Employment Bureau and concerned Stakeholders
A. ASSESSMENT OF DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
1. Original Obiective: The objective of the SRTAP is to support the Government's reform program, by
(a) Facilitating the restructuring of socially owned enterprises through actions to reduce the individual and
community impacts of worker dislocation, (b) improving the delivery of social benefits and the collection of
payroll contributions for social benefits, (c) improving public awareness of the rationale for reform
policies, and (d) supporting the continuing implementation of the enterprise restructuring program.
2. Revised Obiective None.
3. Original Components SRTAP comprises four components Capital Roman numerals indicate the
Component nomenclature, whereas Capital Latin letter numerals indicate Sub-Component nomenclature -
utilized throughout project implementation.:
() Labor Redeployment To facilitate the redeployment of labor in communities affected by large scale
restructuring in support of privatization through: (A) Enterprise Analysis of state-owned enterprises
(SOE) labor requirements; (B) Pre-Layoff Services to SOE workers to ease social tensions; (C) provision
of post-layoff services to displaced workers; (D) strengthening Employment Bureau services for job
seekers; and (E) establishment of a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) to support overall Project operation.
(II) Public Information Campaien To obtain public support for the Economic and Social Reforms
Program (ESRP) by: (A) (i) creating a Media Coordinating Unit in the AP to facilitate execution of the
Public Information Campaign (PIC); (ii) conducting surveys to obtain information on public opinion to
serve as the basis for formulating a responsive PIC; and (iii) creating and executing a media campaign.
(III) Social Benefit Programs To support preparatory activities to strengthen the Government's ability to
make these programs more equitable, efficient, and financially sustainable by: (A) Social Assistance to
develop objective criteria to evaluate poverty in the economy, as well as a revised model for delivery of
social assistance services; (B) Actuarial Analysis of Pensions to assess the impact of alternative policy
changes on the financial status of the social insurance fund over a long term horizon; and (C) Payroll Tax
Compliance to improve the collection of payroll taxes through more effective business registration
procedures and strengthened audit and enforcement controls.
(1T Special Restructuring Program  (A) (i) develop a Trustee's Unit (TU), assist participating socially

owned enterprises (SOEs) identify loss reduction measures, including the closure of loss-making units, and
implement them; (b) provide the SOEs with strong governance; (c) accelerate the privatization of the SOEs,
including, if necessary privatization through liquidation' (iv) impose stringent financial control on any
external resources provided to the SOEs from the fiscal budget or the banking system; and (v) identify the
post-privatization technical assistance needs of the SOEs.

B. ACHEIVEMENT OF OBJECTIVE AND OUTPUTS
1.    Outcome/Achievement of Obiective
SRTAP implementation was highly relevant to the efforts of the Macedonia in its economic reform
program to deal effectively with the social dimensions of reform. SRTAP, the tangible
outcomes/achievements could be summarized as follows:
a.    Legislation : subsequent to pertinent analysis, several legislation were introduced and enforced in
the social sectors influencing labor issues: (1) Law on Labor Relations September 1997, (2) Social
Assistance Decree changed existing the Social Assistance Law 1997 and 1998, (3) Bankruptcy Law April
1998, (4) made changes in the Privatization Law April 1999.
b.     Capacity Building : Institutions dealing with labor sector were supported, staffed, trained and
presently functioning in their fields of activity, such as establishing job clubs in 9 local Employment
Bureaus, automation of National and Local Employment Offices and Local Social Welfare Centers.
c.    Outcomes: All SRTAP objectives were met, i.e. (a) facilitated the restructuring of SOEs through
actions to reduce individual and community impacts of worker dislocation while providing active labor
programs for about 20.000 unemployed workers in 37 communities, (b) improved the delivery of social
benefits and collection of payroll contributions for social benefits by strengthening the local Social Welfare
Centers with equipment and training of the staff, (c) improved public awareness and rationale for reform
policies through organizing numerous presentations, panel discussions, interviews and media campaign
through TV, newspapers and bulletins, and (d) supported the continuing implementation of enterprise
restructuring program by providing the training for judges for implementing the new Bankruptcy Law,
pre-privatization plans for agriculture combinats, and increasing awareness of the WB and Govemment to
provide new funds (SSP) for continuation of restructuring the remaining non-privatized SOEs.
d.     Specific Achievements: (1) 23 SOEs (large loss makers) were restructured into 160 separate
enterprises, (2) 130 of these were privatized, (3) 10 were liquidated and the balance are still State owned,
(4) Labor reduction targets were met using the recommendations from prepared analysis and reports
financed by the project, thus decreasing leakage of public funds, (5) 264 post-layoff projects were
implemented providing jobs to 19,574 unemployed persons, with permanent jobs of 7,800, (6) 10 job
counseling projects were implemented to 7,400 unemployed persons, (7) 186 training projects implemented
involving 10,191 unemployed persons, (8) 37 public work projects executed, with community participation
involving 1,200 laid-off workers, (9) 5 incubators were established and presently operating on their own
hosting 36 enterprises with 358 new employees, (10) 21 small business assistance projects involving 315
participants were carried out, (11) Automation Unit established at the MOLSP, presently operating and
generating required input to the Ministry, (12) Actuarial Unit of Pensions established and presently
operating with the Ministry, (13) Employment Bureaus were fully supported and automated allowing them
to process pertinent data and prepare relevant reports for ministries and employers, since July 1999 these
operations were improved and operating more efficiently, (14) Several pertinent Legislation enacted.
Assessment: Highly Satisfactory

C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOME
1.    Factors outside of Government or Implementinm Agency: In the last year of project
implementation, the Kosovo Crisis impacted Macedonia's economy, resulting in temporary reduction of
the real positive impact of the Project in terms ofjob creation. The number of displaced workers
increased and the general socio-political and economical environment was unfavorable for such kind of
restructuring projects.
2.    Factors subiect to Government control: (1) The choice of the Privatization Agency (AP)
where the Project Coordination Unit was established, contributed greatly for the successful execution of
the project, although it was very hard to coordinate all other implementing units (i.e. Employment
Bureau, Ministry of Labor and Social Policy with few separately sub-implementing units) dueto the
fact that PCU was not been authorized to implement the overall project, but only to coordinate it.
3.    Factors subiect to Coordinating Aiencv control: AP being accountable directly to the
Government, in many cases was not able to conduct the technical and administrative procedures of the
project outside of the influence of the inter-Ministerial politics. PCU played a key role in the
conducting a successful coordination of the project and keep it within the basic objectives.
D. SUSTAINABILITY
1.    Rationale for Rating: SRTAP is assessed as highly sustainable as per the specific
achievements above. Newly approved Social Support Project, to be implemented over 1999 - 2002,
shall complement the assessed shortfalls of SRTAP occurred due to negative differences in exchange
rate between Special Draw Request and US$. Newly approved Social Support Project will be again
coordinated by AP as a result of continuation with similar SRTAP arrangements, the favorable
assessment of WB for efficient implementation of all PCU activities, and as a result of an agreement
between WB and Government that for such a complex and sensitive project AP is better prepared to
carry out the Project for the present time.

E. LESSONS LEARNED
1.    Continuous coordination meetings by the PCU of AP with all stakeholders, contributed greatly
to the success of the project. These meetings served to iron out and clarify (a) the project objectives,
(b) the interdependence of all components and sub-components towards achieving the project goals, (c)
explaining the Bank procedures to all stakeholders, (d) evaluating progress and redressing situations
when needed;
2.    Bank support was highly appreciated by the AP/PCU. Numerous supervision missions made
the AP/PCU staff possible to execute the project as per the Loan covenants;
3.    The early engagement by PCU a project management/procurement advisor enabled to establish
sound management and financial techniques on the project;
4.    The AP/PCU maintained a close link to the Government authorities, thus, forecasting problem
areas and arriving with solutions prior to deadlocks.
5.    Rigorous technical assistance was key to the success with stakeholders.
6.    Right choice of locally hired staff by AP/PCU. Fully committed and dedicated staff to the
project PCU and their readiness for on-the-job training and learning-by-doing was key for
improvement the qualifications of the locally hired staff to operate the project properly.
7.    Bank support was highly appreciated by the Government for the flexible adjustments brought
about in the project implementation, providing changes which were in line with the main project
objectives.
8.    The project was very complex and sensitive to socio-political environment of the country. The
WB and the Borrower worked closely to improve coordination between technical coordinators and their
high commitment to project implementation achieved better results.
9.    The right choice of using cost savings from different components to support the real needs of
the Government and Ministries within the main objectives of the project were included in the project
implementation. These included mainly: establishing the first National Information Agency,
establishing the National network in Ministry of Finance, upgrading and purchasing computers
equipment in Governmental Institutions which were part of project implementation.
10.   The project provided computers equipment to the MOLSP, NEB, MF, MIA and AP. The
period of maintenance services and up-grading should be included as a part of new project design.

labor issues has been summarized and continuously updated which
was a major factor in the design and implementation of post-layoff
projects. Techniques have been designed and described in a
handbook( "Post LayoffAssistance" - September 1996) . Methods
to retrieve relevant information for the adjustment of the labor force
were described and tested in the 24 loss-making SOEs to prove the
adequacy in receiving and analyzing the relevant information and
data. Methods and Techniques have been defined to evaluate the
social infrastructure of enterprises( Social Structure of Personnel
and April 96). Now the approach is available for further

with representatives of employment bureaus and from enterprises.
Materials for Pre-Layoff were not utilized because of very fast

private sector and three from the Regionial Employment Bureaus
were selected and trained in theoretical and practical application
(role plays) of the materials. Materials for the promotion and

was disseminated. Sample agreements were introduced and
discussed individually with SOEs management. Due to these
reasons only one contract was signed to provide pre-layoff services
to one restructuring enterprise in Strumica. The specific law to
layoff surplus employees expired in December 1995. Most of the
layoffs occurred during the first six months in 1995. After 1995 the
restrictive labor legislation created it very difficult to dismiss
employees. No major layoffs occurred, therefore, these services
were not in direct demand. The enterprises requested for support for
restructuring and to re-allocate the personnel within their structures.
Post-layoff service programs have been incorporated. In one project
the enterprise and the workforce was analyzed in detail, proposals
for adjustment, restructuring and redeployment of personnel were
developed and discussed with the representatives. In 6 projects 834
employees were retained before dismissal, after recommendation
and counseling by local Employment Bureaus, for another
qualification within the enterprises to avoid dismissal. The
employees were qualified for the new job assignments only in the
restructured enterprises.

disputes and transfer of effective control to former creditors were
monitored. Subsequently, most SRP enterprises were broken down
to smaller units. Out of 23 SRP there became more than 160
separate enterprises. The majority ofthem (130) were privatized, 10
were liquidated and the remaining are still dominantly owned by the
State.
As SRP was developing, new policy issues were arising in order to
further support the restructuring process and further decrease as
much as possible the leakage of public funds into unprofitable
enterprises.  That is how  SRTAP backed up with technical
assistance the policy issues as they appeared: (1) diagnose the status
of the enterprises, (2) help prepare and implement the restructuring
and privatization plans, (3) help the AP review plans, (4) provide
post-privatization assistance to SRP enterprises, including
management training, (5) strengthen the ability of the main
bankruptcy actors to initiate and lead sound bankruptcy procedures,
(6) assist in the pre-privatization restructuring of the biggest
agricultural companies in order to avoid the phasing of the
restructuring process and to make it quicker.
