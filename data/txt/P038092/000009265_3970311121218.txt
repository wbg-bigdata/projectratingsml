MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
FOR A SOCIAL REFORM AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following mrremorandum and recommendation on
a proposed Credit to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for SDR 9.0 million (the
equivalent of US$ 14.0 million) on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years to support
the economic reform program and, in particular, to address the social dimnensions of reform.
2.           Country/Sector Background. In this fourth year of political independence, the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces a particularly difficult challenge: the
transformation to a market economy in a situation of extraordinary economic isolation. In
parallel with the loss of markets in the former Soviet bloc after 1989, the disintegration of
Yugoslavia profoundly changed the environment in which the enterprise sector operated. United
Nations sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro brought about a loss of the country's largest
export market. In addition, the closure of the border with Greece, its main trade route to the
sea, limited access to alternative markets and increased the cost of imported goods. As a result
of these external events, gross social product (GSP)' has declined to less than half its 1989
level, and unemployment has risen to approximately 30 percent of the labor force.2
3.           In 1992, the Borrower embarked on a stabilization and economic reform program,
which includes privatization of socially-owned enterprises (SOEs). In spite of the difficulties
associated with the collapse of external markets and imposed economic isolation, the Borrower
remains committed to this program. Under the first Economic Recovery Loan (ERL I),3 the
Borrower adopted a new privatization law, and established the Agency for Transformation of
Enterprises with Social Capital (Privatization Agency) to assist enterprises in preparing
restructuring plans and to oversee the privatization of SOEs. As part of its Special Restructuring
Program, the Privatization Agency has identified 25 enterprises to be restructured or privatized
on a priority basis. These 25 enterprises, which include 20 industrial and 3 agro-enterprises,
plus two utilities, account for about four-fifths of losses in the enterprise sector in 1993 and
currently employ 56,700 workers -- about 13 percent of formal employment in the country. A
1/    Gross Social Product is defined as the sum of national income and depreciation of the capital stock,
where national income is the value added of goods produced in the 'productive sector' (e.g. agriculture,
manufacturing, etc). GSP, unlikle GDP, (i) does not include value added from services, and (ii) does not deduct
the costs of services in calculating the value added of goods produced in the economy.
2/    In July 1994, 195,000 individuals out of an active labor force of about 640,000 were registered as
unemployed at the National Employment Bureau.
3/    Loan 3703-MK and Credit 2564-MK, both approved on February 8, 1994.

parallel Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (FESAC) will support policy reform
in the enterprise, banking and social sectors. Policy goals to be supported in the social sectors
include: (a) facilitating the transfer of labor from SOEs to new employment opportunities, (b)
reforming the social assistance system in an effort to make it sustainable and to improve
employment incentives, and (c) assisting the Pension Fund to be financially self sufficient.
4.           While the FESAC establishes an appropriate policy setting for the enterprise
restructuring program, specific investments will be needed in several areas to implement the
program. First, the Borrower recognizes that labor redundancy is pervasive,4 but managers of
the largest enterprises and key Government officials are unwilling to proceed with large-scale
labor shedding unless targeted labor redeployment programs are established to assist the workers
and communities where labor shedding occurs. Second, public support for the transition is
threatened by rising unemployment, deteriorating living conditions, uncertainty about the
political and economic future, and public confusion about the rationale for specific reform
policies. Public support for reform will require better public awareness of the reasons why the
Borrower is pursuing specific reform policies. Third, because of high unemployment and
sharply declining real wages, many families face the prospect of poverty unless income support
programs are maintained, yet the Borrower is finding it increasingly difficult to maintain these
programs in the face of a shrinking tax base and increasing demand for benefits.5 Fourth, while
initial cost-cutting plans have been developed for 25 of the largest loss-making SOEs, there is
a need for supplemen ary technical assistance in order to help the SOEs implement these plans.
Completion of the enterprise restructuring program is a second tranche condition of the proposed
FESAC.
5.           Rationale for IDA Involvement. Successful enterprise restructuring in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will require effective programs to ease the social costs of
large-scale layoffs. Public support for this and other aspects of the country's economic reform
program will also require better public understanding of the reasons for specific reform
measures. The project actions to mitigate thze social impacts of reform are a part of building
support for the country's economic reform program. The Bank Group is well suited to assist
in developing these actions because of its experience with similar programs in other countries
in the region, and because of its involvemrent in other aspects of the country's economic reform
progamm. The current retention of surplus labor lowers labor productivity, increases enterprise
losses, impedes enterprise restructuring, delays the potential reallocation of labor to productive
alternative employment, and consumes state budget resources in the form of direct or indirect
4/    An August, 1994 survey of 25 large SOEs indicates that managers expect that a minimum of one-third
of staff will be displaced during restructuring.
if    Expenditures for social transfers and services, including unemployment benefits, social assistance,
social nsurance, and child allowanes - but not including educauion and health expenditures -- now consume
one fourth of GSP.

subsidies.6 The basic rationale is that moving workers from jobs where they are not Froductive
and receive public subsidies to jobs where they are productive and do not receive public
subsidies reduces public budget outlays and increases national output. Public budget outlays will
decline to the extent that redundant workers who are to be redeployed to new jobs now receive
direct or indirect government subsidies, as many do. Even if displaced workers are not
successful in finding productive jobs, public budget outlays will decline if, as is expected, the
costs of labor redeployment measures, including income support, are less than the cost of long-
term subsidies to keep workers in unproductive jobs. At the same time, national output will
increase to the extent that the jobs filled by redeployed workers are new jobs or higher
productivity jobs than they would otherwise have been.'
6.            The proposed project directly supports the FESAC and is consistent with the draft
Cointry Assistance Strategy (CAS) -- both of which are being presented to the Executive
Directors simultaneously with the project. The proposed project supports social reforms defined
in the CAS, including establishing new poverty lines and poverty monitoring systems and
facilitating labor redeployment. The project has been prepared in coordination with bilateral and
multilateral donors (Sweden, USAID, and the EU). Project design reflects the recommendation
of the June g994 Consultative Group Meeting.
7.            Project Objectives. The success of Macedonia's economic reform program will
depend upon whether the Borrower can deal effectively with the social dimensions of reform.
The objective of the proposed Social Reform and Technical Assistance Project is to support the
Borrower's reform program by: (a) facilitating the restructuring of socially owned enterprises
through actions to reduce the individual and community impacts of worker dislocation, (b)
improving the delivery of social benefits and the collection of payroll contributions for social
benefits, (c) improving public awareness of the rationale for reform policies, and (d) supporting
the continuing implementation of the enterprise restructuring program.
8.            Project Description. The proposed project, to be implemented over four years,
comprises four components:
a. Labor Redeployment (US$ 10.9 million). This component will support the
redeployment of labor in communities affected by large-scale enterprise
restructuring by: (i) analyzing the labor requirements of socially-owned
enterprises (SOEs) which are undergoing restructuring or privatization,
6/     Workers in loss-making socially-owned enterprises receive direct and indirect public subsidies in the
form of subsidized wages, other subsidized inputs. subsidies to the banking system, and inter-enterprise arrears.
The total cost of these subsidies typically exceeds by a significant margin the combined cost of unemployment
benefits, social assistance, and targeted labor redeployment measures.
7/     Specialized counseling, requalification training, and improved job placement services have been found
to raise productivity by bringing about more efficient matching of job seekers and the skill requirements of
existing jobs (OECD Employment Outlook, 1993, page ix).



4
(ii) providing pre-layoff adjustment services to workers in SOEs scheduled for
downsizing or liquidation, (iii) providing post-layoff services' to the displaced
workers, through a Labor Redeployment Fund, to accelerate their return to
productive employment, (iv) strengthening Employment Bureau services for job
seekers, and (v) establishing a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to support overall
project implementation.
b. Public Information Prop-ram (US$ 1.4 million). This component will support
the development of public media information programs to build support for the
country's economic reform program. It will do this by: (i) creating a Media
Coordinating Unit in the Privatization Agency to oversee the public information
program, (ii) conducting surveys to assess public knowledge and opinion on
economic reform issues to guide the development of an effective public
information program, and (iii) developing and carrying out a public media
program to inform the public of the rationale for specific reform measures.
c. Social Benefit Programs (US$ 2.4 million). This component will help develop
more equitable, efficient, and financially sustainable social benefit programs by:
(i) developing objective poverty criteria as a basis for targeting social assistance,
(ii) developing actuarially-based pension planning, and (iii) improving payroll tax
collection by improving business registration procedures and strengthening audit
and enforcement controls.
d. Enterprise Restructuring Technical Assistance (US$ 2.4 million). This
component would provide technical assistance to: (i) establish a Trustee Unit at
the Privatization Agency to manage enterprise restructuring, (ii) accelerate
privatization of viable SOEs and liquidation of non-viable SOEs, (iii) impose
stringent financial controls on external resources provided to enterprises from the
state budget or the banking system, and (iv) identify the post-privatization
technical assistance needs of SOEs.
9.           Project Implementation. The proposed project would be carried out over four
years by the Privatization Agency. The project cost is estimated at US$ 17.1 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$ 7.6 million equivalent (44 %), excluding taxes and duties
estimated at about US$ 0.1 million equivalent. The total financing required is US$ 17.1 million
equivalent, of which the Bank would finance US$ 14.0 million equivalent (100 % of the foreign
8/    These include programs for employment counseling and job placement, relocation, retraining, public
works, small business assistance, and local economic development planning, but exclude severance payments
which are fmanced separately through the Special Restructuring Program supported by the FESAC.

exchange and 82 % of the total9). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of ten percent (10%) of the Credit, amounting to one
million four hundred thousand USD equivalent (US$1,400,000), would be made available
effective January 1, 1995. Retroactive financing would be used exclusively to support provision
of post-layoff services to displaced workers through the Labor Redeployment Fund (LRF). A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13983-MK dated April 5, 1995 is being
distributed separately, and a Project Operational Manual is available in the project files.
10.         To help ensure that project objectives, performance targets and schedules are met
successfully, a PCU has been established in the Privatization Agency under the Director of the
Transformation and Restructuring Department. The PCU will be responsible for coordinating
all project-related tasks. A Technical Coordination Committee, consisting of the technical
directors of each of the project components, will meet on a regular basis to discuss and resolve
project execution issues. The Privatization Agency, under the general guidance of a Special
Inter-Ministerial Committee, will be responsible for most project components, including the
national Labor Redeployment Pund (LRF). The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, in
cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, will be responsible for implementing the Social
Benefits component; and the National Employment Bureau will be responsible for implementing
the Employment Bureau subcomponent of the Labor Redeployment component. A Project
Preparation Facility of US$ 1.0 million has been provided and the funds are being used to
provide technical assistance to initiate work on the three largest project components (labor
redeployment, social benefits, enterprise restructuring).
11.         Project Sustainability. The principal objective of the project is sustainabiity of
the Borrower's economic reform program -- in particular, the restructuring of large, loss-maling
enterprises. The project-supported instruments for achieving that objective are, by nature,
temporary activities, and will be phased out when the restructuring of the largest SOEs is
substantially completed. The project actions to improve the design of social benefit programs
will end when those developmental actions are completed. They will then be succeeded by
implementation of the improved social benefit programs, which may require additional
investments.
12.         Agreed Actions. During Negotiations, the Borrower provided assurances that the
Labor Redeployment Fund would be used only to finance post-layoff labor redeployment services
as follows: (a) the supply of services would be demand-driven in response to requests from
displaced workers and advisory input from the social partners; (b) communities would be eligible
for LRF support only if they contain an SOE which is undergoing a privatization/restructuring
91    This high percentage of IDA financing results from the fact that technical assistance, which is financed
at 100 percent, comprises over half of the proposed project, and that the prject finances 75 percent of the labor
redeployment services which comrpnse about one third of the proposed project.

program approved by the Privatization Agency; (c) individuals would be eligible for LRF
financed services if they have bcen given notice of dismissal, or have been dismissed from SOEs
undergoing a privatization/restructuring program approved by the Privatization Agency; (d) the
costs of services reimbursed from the LRF tc service providers would be based on the average
cost per disinissed worker times the number of workers receiving services; (e) the impact of
services for displaced workers would be evaluated on the basis of job placement information
which must be provided by the service provider; and (f) labor mobility among displaced workers
would be facilitated by allowing workers in communities qualifying for assistance under the LRF
to be eligible for services in their communities or in other communities receiving assistance
under the Fund. In addition, agencies responsible for implementing project components,
including the Privatization Agency, the National Employment Bureau and the Ministry of Labor
and Social Policy would be provided with adequate staffing resources to ensure timely execution
of their tasks.
13.         Environmental Impacts.   The proposed project has been placed in an
environmental screening category "C", consistent with the provisions of Operational Directive
4.00, Annex A. It is not anticipated that the project will result in negative enviromnental
impacts.
14.         Program Objective Categories. The project supports the Borrower's policy of
mitigating the social impact of economic adjustment. It will contribute directly to poverty
alleviation by accelerating the redeployment of labor displaced in the process of enterprise
restructuring and by developing improved social benefit policies -- including better targeting of
social assistance to the poor. The project falls entirely within the Poverty Reduction and Human
Resource Development category.
15.         Participatory Approach.  The proposed project was prepared. largely by
Government agencies -- the Privatization Agency, MOF, and MOLSP. During preparation,
these agencies developed individual components through dialogue with project beneficiaries and
stakeholders, including representatives from labor and employers. The Special Restructuring
Program will be implemented under the general guidance of a special inter-ministerial committee
chaired by the Ministry of Economy, and will be administered by a Trustee Unit for
restructuring enterprises located at the Ministry of the Economy. Working groups are being
established to provide guidance for implementation of each component of the project, including
an enterprise assistance group for the labor redeployment component, a public information
program advisory committee, multi-agency coordinating committees for the social benefit
component, and a project technical coordination committee. Procedures have been established
to obtain ongoing input from citizens during implementation including identifying the demand
for labor redeployment services through discussions with workers at SOEs prior to layoff, and
public concerns about the social impact of economic restructuring through periodic public
opinion surveys which will be used to shape the public information campaign. In addition, there
was close collaboration during project preparation with USAID, which is providing additional
technical assistance for the Special Restructuring Program.

16.         Project Benefits. The major benefit expected from the proposed project would
be to foster public acceptance of the country's economic reform program, thus helping ensure
the sustainability of the reform program. In addition, labor redeployment activities supported
by the project would help reduce public budgetary outlays and increase national output by
moving workers from jobs where they are not productive, and receive public subsidies, to jobs
where they are more productive. The employment effect of some labor redeployment programs
(e.g., training) may be reduced to some extent if workers who benefit from the programs
displace other workers. However, even in these cases, the programs should contribute to
increased productivity. The project would also help restore long-mn fiscal balance by improving
tax collections and by establishing a more equitable, efficient, and affordable basis for pensions
and social assistance.
17.         Risks. The principal risk associated with the proposed project is that a failure to
impose a hard budget constraint could permit further delays in real restructuring of the largest
loss-making enterprises, including needed labor shedding, thereby undermining the basis for the
project. The proposed FESAC and follow-up policy oversight expected under subsequent
operations would reduce this risk to an acceptable level. Moreover, because the project is
viewed by Goverrnent authorities as a pre-requisite to effective enterprise reform, the project
itself would help to mitigate this risk. However, in the event that there are substantial delays
or changes in the FESAC that affect the special restructuring program, the configuration of the
project may need to be reconsidered. Finally, the implementation capacity of some of the
agencies involved is weak. The project addresses this issue by providing technical assistance
and requiring the agencies to add small numbers of staff to support project implementation.
18.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the International Development Association and reconmmend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
