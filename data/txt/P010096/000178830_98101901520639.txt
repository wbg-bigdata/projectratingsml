APPRAISAL OF THE
LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT - PHASE II
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project that forms a three
year time slice, Phase II, of a long-range program for improving water sup-
ply, sewerage and drainage in Lahore, the administrative and commercial cen-
ter of the Province of the Punjab, Pakistan. A start was made in 1967 on a
Phase I project establishing a utility organization, rehabilitating existing
water supply, sewerage and drainage facilities, developing a master plan,
and executing a small construction component. The cost of studies for the
urban development of Lahore has been added to the present project.
ii.       IDA and the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA)
helped finance the Phase I project with equal amounts, totalling US$3.5
million equivalent. Despite substantial initial difficulties the broad
technical objectives of the project were achieved, and the first credit
(106-PAK) was fully disbursed and closed in July 1972. There was a cost
overrun of 120%, more than half of which resulted from a project revision
and a time overrun of 2-1/2 years mainly because of institutional problems.
An evaluation of the Phase I project made in 1974 has confirmed the need for
the improvements envisaged in the Phase II project. 1/
iii.      The Phase II project is a continuation of the work started in
Phase I, and is based upon studies financed by the United Nations Develop-
ment Program (UNDP), with IBRD as executing agency, and carried out by
Camp Dresser & McKee, Ltd. (CDM), consulting engineers USA, assisted by
Messrs. A.F. Ferguson & Co (Fergusons), a local accounting firm. The con-
sulting engineers revised the master plan developed under the Phase I
project, identified a 10 year investment plan, made hydrological studies,
and assisted the Lahore Improvement Trust Water Wing (LITWW) in making a
tariff study and designing improvements to the accounting and billing and
collection systems.
iv.       The proposed project, to be executed from FY1977 through FY1980 is
an optimal package of works that will strengthen the existing water supply
system which now serves a population of about 1.4 million and expand its
capacity to serve nearly two million people in FY1980. The area served by
the sewerage system will be increased by 20% benefitting an additional popu-
lation of 250,000 and local flooding would be alleviated by the proposed
drainage works. The estimated cost of the project is US$46.3 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$15.6 million. An IDA
credit of US$25.0 million equivalent is proposed to cover about 60% of
the project's costs excluding duties, i.e. the foreign exchange cost (ex-
cluding consulting costs to be financed by UNDP) plus about 38% of the
1/   Performance Audit Report No. 400 dated April 12, 1974.



- ii -
local costs. The remaining US$21.3 million would be financed, US$20.7 mil-
lion by the Provincial Government: and US$0.6 million by UNDP. These project
costs do not include the urban development studies for Lahore for which an
additional sum of US$1.6 million is provided in the proposed credit.
V.         The credit would be made to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
which would on-lend the funds to the Province of the Punjab on the
same terms and conditions. The l'rovince would, in turn, on-lend the
funds to the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) and the Water and Sanitation
Agency (WASA) at 8 3/4% interest for a term of 25 years, with 5 years grace
including a waiver of interest. WASA is a semi-autonomous organization
created by the Province for providing water supply, sewerage and drainage
services in Lahore under the umbrella of LDA - a development oriented organi-
zation created in April 1975. LDA has taken over the functions of the Lahore
Improvement Trust (LIT) with added powers for planning, controlling and coor-
dinating the development of Greater Lahore. WASA has taken over the functions
and staff of LITWW, which satisfactorily implemented the construction compo-
nents of the Phase I project, but did not develop into an effective utility.
WASA will be better organized, having more powers than did LITWW and a greater
opportunity for becoming an efficient organization. WASA will be responsible
for carrying out the water supply, sewerage and drainage project and LDA
will be responsible for carrying out the urban development studies.
vi.       The water supply component of the proposed project includes the
construction of 47 tubewells, 193 miles of transmission and distribution
pipeline extensions and replacements, improvements and repairs to existing
systems, service connections and meters. The sewerage and drainage component
of the proposed project includes about 300 miles of sewers, 21 miles of drain-
age channels, four new sewage pumping stations, extensions to an existing
pumping station, and one 75 acre waste stabilization pond. WASA staff will
be trained in management, finance., engineering operations and maintenance
under technical assistance to be provided by the UK Overseas Development
Ministry (ODM) and UNDP. Adequate facilities and equipment are included in
the project for this purpose. Special equipment for continuing vital ground-
water studies, reducing leakage and for making environmental studies is also
provided.
vii.      As in the Phase I project WASA, with only minimum assistance from
foreign consultants, will be respcnsible for project implementation. Major
contracts will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank Group "Prccurement Guidelines". It is proposed that
a margin of preference is given to domestic manufacturers of 15% or customs
duty, whichever is lower. Assistance will be given to civil works contractors
if needed for the importation of drilling and pipelaying equipment, cement
and steel.
viii.     Of the estimated total project cost of PRs 458 million (US$46.3 mil-
lion equivalent) PRs 227 million (US23.0 million equivalent) is for water
supply, PRs 217 million (US$21.9 million equivalent) is for sewerage, and
PRs 14 million (US$1.4 million equivalent) is for surface drainage.



- iii -
ix.       WASA will implement and maintain rates and charges for water
supply and sewerage services at levels to provide revenues sufficient to
produce an annual rate of return on reasonably valued averaged net fixed
assets in service of 6% from FY1983.
x.        The urban development and traffic study comprises consulting
services to assist LDA in preparing a pilot project in slum upgrading, a
pilot project in sites and services development for low-income groups and
a project for traffic improvements in central Lahore. The study will also
assist LDA in starting a process of urban development planning on a regional
scale and in training of requisite staff.
xi.       The project including the urban studies is suitable for a credit
of US$26.6 million equivalent - US$25.0 million for water supply, sewerage
and drainage and USS1.6 million for urban development studies.

APPRAISAL OF THE
LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT - PHASE II
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Phase II water supply, sewerage and drainage project is part
of a long range program to rehabilitate and expand these facilities in
Lahore, the capital city of the Punjab Province (PP) of Pakistan and second
only to Karachi as the largest city in the country. An IDA Credit of
US$25.0 million is proposed to finance about 54% of the cost of the project
including duties or about 60% excluding duties, the balance being loaned by
PP. An additional sum of US$1.6 million is included for urban studies making
a total IDA credit of US$26.6 million.
1.02      The Phase I project covering the period 1967-72 consisted of estab-
lishing a utility organization, developing a master plan, rehabilitation
works and a small construction component. IDA Credit 106-PAK for US$1.75
million and a Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) credit of
equal amount helped to finance the Phase I project.
1.03      The Government did not agree to the setting up of an autonomous
water utility for the Phase I project, but is now moving closer to this con-
cept with the setting up of a Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) as a semi-
autonomous agency under the Lahore Development Authority (LDA). Continued
financial participation will enable IDA to maintain its role in the long
process of institution building.
1.04      The project is based upon a report prepared by a US firm of con-
sultants Camp Dresser & McKee, Ltd (CDM) assisted by A.F. Ferguson & Co
(Fergusons) of Pakistan. The report included the updating of the 1969
Master Plan and the identification of a ten year investment plan up to 1986,
a hydrological study, a tariff study and the redesign of accounting, billing
and collection systems. The Phase II project covers the first 3 years of
the investment plan. Also during 1974, the need for preinvestment work in
other sectors of the Lahore metropolitan area was identified by urban project
missions and preparatory work on studies was initiated, resulting in agreement
in November 1975 on the scope and budget for an urban development and traffic
study in Lahore.
1.05      This report is based upon the consultants' report and on informa-
tion obtained by supervision missions to review progress on the first proj-
ect and by the April and September 1975 appraisal missions composed of
Messrs. A. Saravanapavan, sanitary engineer and L.V. Smith, financial analyst.

II. THE SECTOR
A.   General Situation
2.01      Being a semi-arid country with a low average annual rainfall of
less than ten inches in most of the country, Pakistan is fortunate in having
the rich Indus River Valley to sustain it. Only about one-quarter of the
country's total land area of 310,000 square miles is arable and most of this
is in this valley. The valley supports the populations of the Punjab and
Sind, the two largest of the four provinces of Pakistan. The Indus River
and the extensive natural underground reservoirs of good quality water in
the valley are being developed for irrigation, hydropower and domestic use.
2.02      Over the past 12 years, Pakistan has had one of the highest rates
of population growth in the world, 3.1% per annum, and in 1972 had a popula-
tion of 65 million people. 1/ Ihe war in 1971, and severe floods and droughts
in recent years have badly affected the economy. The Government of Pakistan
(GOP) has estimated that GDP growth in FY1975 will be limited to 3.5% or
lower; GDP has grown at only a 3.3% annual rate between FY1970 and FY1975,
or by very little more than the estimated population growth of 3.1% annually.
Per capita GDP in Pakistan in 1974 was low at US$112, but higher than that
of most of her neighbors.
2.03      The problems of the rapid population growth and the consequent
strain on public services are very evident. Of the estimated 17 million
Pakistanis living in urban areas in 1972, about 50% had access to piped
water supply. This was often of poor quality or the supply was inter-
mittent. The rest used untreated river or canal water. About 5% of the
48 million people living in rural areas had piped water supplies and the
rest used untreated water from ponds, rivers and canals. Water-borne
sewerage systems exist only in some parts of the larger cities and serve
about 15% of the urban population. In most other urban areas human and
solid wastes are collected by sweepers. Sanitation in the rural areas is
rudimentary. Only parts of some cities have surface drainage systems and
during the monsoon, floods are commonplace. The level of public services in
most cities is very low. For example, in Karachi, water is supplied for only
a maximum period of six hours daily. The three major reasons for this un-
satisfactory position in the sector are (1) the ineffectiveness of institu-
tions responsible for operations and maintenance and revenue collection, (2)
the improper pricing of the services and (3) the shortage of trained manpower
for the institutions.
B.   Sector Development in Pakisitan
2.04      Development of water supply, sewerage and drainage is a provin-
cial responsibility. In the bigger provinces - Punjab and Sind - there are
separate Public Health Engineering Departments (PHED), under the Department
of Local Government, largely responsible for these functions. But in the
1/   1972 Census



-3-
smaller provinces - North West Frontier and Baluchistan - the Public Works
and Irrigation Departments respectively have this responsibility. Important
exceptions are the cities of Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad which have special
development authorities responsible, inter alia, for water supply, sewerage
and drainage. GOP, through the Physical Planning and Housing Unit (PPHU)
within the Planning Division carries out a limited coordination of provincial
activity in the sector, mainly through the five year National Development
Plans (NDP).
2.05      GOP's program for water supply, sewerage and drainage is designed
to reduce the gap between population growth and population served as rapidly
as possible. The needs of the rural population have been recognized and the
specific targets for increases in population served set for the 1976-81 NDP
include urban water 4.6 million, rural water 8.1 million, urban sewerage
10.9 million and rural sewerage 5.7 million.
2.06      The proposed GOP allocation of funds for water supply and sewerage
in the 1976-81 NDP is PRs 1,989 million made up of urban PRs 1,412 million
and rural PRs 577 million.
2.07      GOP has also laid down certain guidelines for sector development
during the next NDP which envisage the creation of separate water and sewerage
authorities in major cities for the construction, operation, maintenance and
management of the systems. GOP also supports the creation of development au-
thorities for planning, acquisition and development of land for all users.
In Lahore, such a development authority, the LDA, was created in April 1975
by PP with wider powers, covering not only urban planning and development
but also the overall control of water supply, sewerage and drainage services
(see para 2.11).
2.08      WHO has recently carried out a sector study in Pakistan under the
WHO/IBRD Cooperative Program and its report is under preparation.
C.   Water Supply and Sewerage in the Punlab Province
2.09      Of Pakistan's total population (1972 census) of 65 million, about
37 million lived in PP. With the exception of Lahore, the provincial capital
with a population of 2.4 million, there are eight cities in the Punjab with
populations ranging from 100,000 in Guirat to 820,000 in Lyallpur with con-
centrations in Rawalpindi (615,000) and Multan (544,0OO).   There are also
some 170 other towns, each with a population above 5,oon, making in all a
total urban population of 11.4 million. Most of these cities have only par-
tial water supplies and little or no sewerage. Standards are low and inter-
ruptions of service are frequent.
2.10      In the 1976-81 NDP the allocation to PP for the sector is about
PRs one billion which includes the Lahore Phase II project and a project
for Lyallpur, the second largest city in PP. The Asian Development Bank



-4-
(ADB) is expected to finance the Lyallpur project. Because of the lack of
local expertise, these two projects have been prepared by consultants. PHED
is also preparing projects for other large cities such as Multan, Sahiwal,
Sargodha and Gujrat. PP does not at this time have prescribed rate policies
or a clear financing policy for the sector.
D.   Water Supply and Sewerage in Lahore
2.11      In 1966 the Lahore Municipal Corporation (LMC) did not agree to
the setting up of an autonomous water supply authority for the Phase I proj-
ect. PP, however, decided in 1973 to create such an authority and a Water
and Sewerage Authority - Lahore (WASAL) was created by statute in April 1975
at the start of the appraisal of the Phase II project. WASAL, however, had
a short existence as it was abolished when PP created the LDA in the same
month, with responsibility for planning and development in the Lahore urban
area including the water supply, sewerage and drainage sector, Discussions
were held with PP in September 1975 with a view to establishing a project
entity acceptable both to PP and IDA and a compromise solution was reached
of creating a semi-autonomous water agency under the LDA with its own managing
director holding a seat on the board of the LDA (see para 5.02).
2.12      The water table in the Lahore area is receding because of in-
creasing pumping for agricultural, public and industrial water supply. This
is leading to the abandonment of mnany tubewells as the receding water leaves
the pump bowls exposed and to increases in pumping heads in the wells still
operating. Most services are unmetered and many householders leave their
taps open or fail to repair brokena taps. Leakage and wastage of water are
so great that along with the low standards of operation and maintenance, it
is not possible to maintain adequate pressure in most of the distribution
system.
2.13      Only about 40% of the c:ity has been sewered.  Older sewers were
designed to carry some storm flows as well as sanitary sewage. Some of the
newer sewers have been designed on1 a separate basis. However, all the sewers
in fact carry stormwater admitted through roof leaders, yard drains and street
inlets. The number of directly connected premises is unknown but is estimated
to be about one-quarter to one-th:Lrd of the total. Premises that are not
connected receive some service from the sewerage system in that it carries
away overland flows of sullage water and ponded rainwater. Collected waste-
water is mostly discharged outside the flood protection bund without treatment.
A part is used for irrigation of crops and the balance finds its way to the
Ravi River.
E.   Drainage
2.14      Except for Lahore, very little is known of drainage in other cities
in PP. In Lahore, there are several low lying areas which become flooded
during the monsoon season with attendant risk to life and property.

III. THE PROJECT
A.   Background and Objectives
3.01      The Phase I project which was appraised in April 1967 and com-
pleted in July 1972 had the three objectives of creating an efficient insti-
tution, developing a master plan for water supply, sewerage and drainage,
and carrying out some rehabilitation and new construction works. Despite
institutional, financial and technical difficulties which required a project
revision and the extension of the original closing date by almost 2-1/2 years,
the project largely attained the objectives of meeting Lahore's urgent
water supply requirements and improving sewer service but with a resulting
cost overrun of 120% more than half of which arose from the project revision.
3.02      With regard to the first objective, there was an inherent insti-
tutional limitation which was recognized by PP and agreed to by IDA at the
time, because LMC was willing to go only as far as creating a project oriented
institution. This caused uncertainty about LITWW's future, affected the at-
titudes of its top management, caused a high turnover of staff, and explains
in part the lack of success by LITWW in implementing administrative and tech-
nical systems developed by management consultants for long-term use. In re-
gard to the other objectives, the project revision became necessary to
accommodate work done by LITWW outside the project. Also the high cost and
poor performance of management and engineering consultants provided little
benefit to project implementation and without the intensive efforts of both
IDA and LITWW staff following the project revision, it would not have been
possible to complete the enlarged project even by the extended closing date.
3.03      The primary objective of the Phase II project will be to continue
and improve upon the work started in the Phase I project, to develop an
efficient public utility organization and implement the three year construc-
tion program summarized in para 3.04. On completion of construction, WASA
should be competent to continue the implementation of the remainder of the
proposed ten year investment plan with the improved management, financial
and technical standards achieved through the training program included in

-8-
3.06      Of the estimated total WASA project cost of PRs 458.2 million,
PRs 227.2 million is for water supply, PRs 217.1 million is for sewerage
and PRs 13.9 million is for drainage. The three components of the project
are 50%, 47% and 3% respectively of the total project costs. Customs duty
and taxes amounting to PRs 45.2 million or 9.9% of the project costs are
included in the above table. The consultants had recommended an investment
program for Phase II of US$54.0 million equivalent but this has been reduced
to about US$46.3 million equivalent because PP wished to proceed cautiously
with the water supply development until more is known about the groundwater
hydrology and to place greater priority on the sewerage service. WASA was
also concerned that the increases in charges needed to support the larger
investment would be unacceptable. Should the pumping tests and other hydro-
logical studies indicate a need for even greater caution in the development
of groundwater, the future work program may have to be revised.
3.07      Unit costs for the water mains and accessories have been prepared
by LITWW staff from prevailing labor costs and manufacturer's prices. For
imported items, estimates were obtained from foreign manufacturers. Similar
unit cost estimates were prepared for the sewerage component of the project.
For the drainage component of the project, prevailing prices, in Lahore, for
land, labor and materials were used. All prices have been adjusted to a
base line of January 1976 and are reasonable.
3.08      Of the total WASA project costs, PRs 304.2 million (US$30.7 million
equivalent) are local costs and PRs 154.0 million (US$15.6 million equiva-
lent) are foreign costs; a ratio of 66:34. The foreign cost component
was estimated on the basis of the expected direct imports and the estimated
import content of locally produced materials.
D.   Contingencies
3.09      As most of the works are below ground and with major components on
which there is little past experience in Lahore, there are a number of un-
certainties which only the construction phase will reveal. For example,
tubewells with greater depths than those drilled in the past are proposed.
Some dry holes or additional wells to provide the required yield are there-
fore anticipated. The sewer outfalls which are mostly in low ground and the
waste stabilization pond which is adjacent to the Ravi River could have sub-
stantially increased construction costs because of flooding from unusual
rains. Also, WASA will be using, for the first time, locally manufactured
prestressed concrete pipes which have been recently introduced in the Pro-
vince. A greater than usual number of rejected pipes are anticipated. To
allow for this combination of uncertainties, the consultants proposal to
provide a physical contingency of 20% on all costs except land is reasonable
and has been accepted.
3.10      In the absence of specific information, price contingencies have
been based upon rates of 10% for equipment and 14% for civil works in 1976
reducing to 8% for equipment and 12% for civil works in 1979 to reflect
declining inflationary tendencies. The total amount is PRs 100.4 million -
PRs 66.3 million on local costs and PRs 34.1 million on foreign costs.

E.   Amount of IDA Credit
3.11      (a) The credit of US$25.0 million for the WASA project would be
about 60Z of the total cost of the project net of duties. US$15.0 million
or 60% of the credit would finance foreign exchange expenditures. The
balance of US$10.0 million or 40% of the credit would finance local currency
expenditures.
(b) The cost of the urban development studies amounting to US$1.6
million to finance foreign exchange expenditures, brings the total credit
to US$26.6 million.
F.   Procurement
3.12      All procurement of equipment and civil works, except for water main
rehabilitation, secondary drainage construction and buildings costing about
US$2.0 million, will be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group "Guidelines" dated August 1975. In
addition, any contract for water supply, sewerage and drainage equipment
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent with an aggregate of such
contracts not exceeding US$500,000 equivalent, shall be awarded in accordance
with local procedures. A margin of preference up to 15% or customs duty,
whichever is lower; would be granted to local manufacturers. No preference
is proposed for civil works contractors as PP did not request any preference
during negotiations. However, there is provision for procuring a drilling
rig, heavy duty tractor, crane, excavating machinery, high tensile wire,
steel plate and some other materials in short supply valued at about US$0.5
million. By this means assistance will be given, if requested, to the civil
works construction industry. Provision will be made in the respective bid
documents for the prepayment of these items and recovery from the bidder.
Consultants for the Lahore urban development and traffic study whose quali-
fications experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be acceptable
to IDA will be retained by LDA.
G.   Disbursement
3.13      The percentages and amounts of expenditures to be financed from
the IDA Credit are given below and a quarterly disbursement forecast is
shown in Annex 4.
(i)  Civil works               50% of local expenditures      US$11.2 million
or 100% of foreign expendi-
tures
(ii)  Equipment & Supplies      100% of foreign expenditures  US$9.2 million
or 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory cost) or 40% of
the cost of imported goods
procured locally (being estimated
foreign exchange component)

H.   Underspending of Funds
3.14      It is proposed that any unspent balance of the credit will be
cancelled.
I.  Design, Construction and Suipervision of Construction
3.15      WASA will be responsible for carrying out the project.  Con-
sultants will assist in the preparation of detailed designs and bid
documents, evaluation of bids and supervision of construction. A sum of
US$893,000 is provided in the project costs for this purpose and for making
preliminary designs for the next phase. UNDP has agreed to finance US$564,000
of this amount as a technical assistance project for which the Bank is the
executing agency. It is proposed to follow the method, which was found
successful in the Phase I project, of having consultants generally advise
WASA engineering staff and take responsibility only for those designs in
which there is little local expertise and for which they will also provide
training (see para 5.11). CDM who prepared the project has been engaged
for this assistance for 52-man-months at an average monthly cost of about
US$8,000 excluding travel and local expenses. Agreement was reached with
PP, LDA and WASA that WASA would employ engineering consultants whose
qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be
satisfactory to IDA.
J.   Construction Schedule
3.16      Project construction is expected to begin about January 1, 1977
with completion scheduled for December 31, 1979 (see Annex 5). The closing
date for the IDA Credit would be December 31, 1980. Land acquisition should
take place before construction starts. Agreement was reached with PP, LDA
and WASA that land acquisition w:Lll be carried out in accordance with a time-
table consistent with the construction program and as shown in the implementa-
tion schedule (see Annex 1, page 28).
K.   Environmental Impact
3.17      The proposed project would directly benefit the environment in
the Lahore area by making it unnecessary to use private shallow tubewells
which are probably contaminated; reducing the number of private waste water,
sewage and night soil collection arrangements; controlling the drainage of
sewage into ditches and reducing minor flooding. About forty ponds totalling
seventy acres scattered throughout the city will be drained, thereby reducing
odors, nuisances, insects and health hazards. Untreated sewage and sullage
water is used extensively for the irrigation of vegetable crop that are eaten



- 11 -
uncooked. The project includes a study to be made by the Lyallpur Agricul-
tural University and the Institute of Public Health Engineering for selecting
crops which may be safely irrigated by raw sewage. Agreement was reached with
PP, LDA and WASA and a covenant included in the draft legal documents that
WASA will carry out and complete by December 31, 1977 a study on the use of
sewage for the irrigation of crops and will exchange views with IDA regarding
the implementation of any recommendations for legislative action arising from
such study (see Annex 7, para 11).
3.18      In order to assist in planning the standard of sewage treatment,
a long term program for monitoring the Ravi River water quality downstream
of Lahore is included in the project. Agreement was reached with PP, LDA
and WASA, that WASA, with the help of consultants will carry out an environ-
mental study of the Ravi River and exchange views with IDA regarding the
implementation of any recommendations for legislative action arising from
such study (see Annex 7 para 10).
IV. JUSTIFICATION
A.   General
4.01      Lahore is the second largest city in Pakistan and is the capital
of PP. The existing water supply, sewerage and drainage facilities are
described in Annexes 6 and 7 and are inadequate in several respects. The
water level in the aquifer is falling, about 75% of WASA's tubewell pumps
are defective and leakage and wastage is high, causing low and sometimes
negative pressures in the pipes. This allows the infiltration of polluted
ground water into the mains with consequent health hazards. Only about
one-quarter to one-third of the population receives direct sewer service.
Most of the remainder are served by a combination of night soil service and
overland flows of sewage or sullage water to sewers or storm drains. Trunk
sewers are undersized and some flooding of streets occurs during peak periods
of flow. Considerable flooding takes place during the monsoon with attendant
risks to life and property. Due to the enlarging of the impervious built-up
areas, flooding is increasing.
4.02      The project will help to alleviate these problems through improving
institutional efficiency, extending water supply, sewerage and drainage
services, reducing water-borne and fecal related diseases and increasing
WASA's competency for continuing the implementation of the investment plan.
B.   Population and Demand Projections
4.03      The population of WASA's water supply service area at the time of
the September 1972 census is estimated by CDM to have been 2.1 million. The
annual growth rate of 4.35% is expected to continue, increasing the service
area population to 2.4 million in 1975 and 3.0 million in 1980. In this
period the number of water service connections is expected to increase by
about 60X from 120,000 to 195,000 and population served by 43% from 1.4 million



- 12 -
to 2.0 million. This excludes the additional 40,000 connections to be taken
over from PHED and LDA (see para 6.07). This increase will be mostly in the
poorer areas and it is therefore :Lntended at this time to keep the number of
standposts at the present total of 1,160. Steps will however be taken for
improving this service by controlLing vandalism and wastage. Water consump-
tion estimates made on the basis of sample surveys by the consultants are only
indicative as only 10% of water service connections are metered (see Annex 8).
As none of the wells are metered and because of frequent mechanical and elec-
trical failures, water production estimates are unreliable. In 1975 aver-
age water production was about 66 IMgd giving a daily per capita use of
27.5 gallons. This low water use will be increased during the project
period by the new works and reduction of leakage from the currently esti-
mated 30% of production. Long term targets for the reduction of leakage will
be set following the start of a leakage survey to be initiated under the pro-
ject. A public education program will be introduced by WASA to reduce wastage.
The used water will be discharged into existing and proposed sewers either
indirectly or through house sewer connections. About 20,000 premises will
benefit indirectly from the proposed 20% increase in the sewered area and
another 5,000 premises will benefit from house sewer connections, increasing
the total number of persons benefitting from the sewerage service by about
250,000.
C.   Least Cost Solution
4.04      The major project elements represent the least cost solution for
meeting the project objectives (see para. 3.03). Wherever applicable,
alternatives have been costed and the selected components had the lowest
present cost at discount rates of 8%, 10% and 15%.
D.   Economic Evaluation
4.05      (a)  Water Supply - At the present time 92% of all connections
are charged on a flat rate based on pipe size or a percentage of an Annual
Rental Value (ARV) assessed by the Provincial Excise and Taxation Depart-
ment (PETD). Effective January 1C977 all unmetered connections will be
charged on the ARV basis. This charge is no measure of willingness to pay
for incremental output. For most consumers the weter charge is an arbitrary
percentage of a general tax base and it cannot be avoided by not using
water. Moreover since as indicated by an extensive study, metering water
supply in Lahore is rarely warranted it is not possible to demonstrate
project justificat 'on on the basis of consumers willingness to pay for
water supply or for its disposal (see part (b) below). The ultimate
benefits of the project namely, improvements in health, amenity and environ-
ment cannot be quantified in economic terms. Only 8% of connections are
metered and it is proposed to carry out selective metering of commercial
and industrial connections which use water as part of their working process
and domestic properties where cattle or horses are kept or which have large
gardens. A comprehensive program of consumer sampling will be made to
establish which consumers should be metered and what benchmarks should be
used for capacity planning and billing control. A program for this is
included in the project implementation schedule (see Annex 1, para 45, B6).



- 13 -
Metering to control normal domestic use of water cannot be justified due to
the low production cost of water at present but continual reassessment of
this policy must be carried out in view of the lowering water table and the
increasing power costs, which over time will make metering increasingly
justified. The proposed price of metered water at PRs 3.00 per 1,000
gallons (US$0.24 per 1,000 gallons) is high in relation to the marginal cost
of water estimated at about PRs 1.00 per 1,000 gallons (US$0.08 per 1,000
US gallons). The metered price will however be a restraint on excessive
consumption of water by metered consumers and along with charges for unmetered
consumers, will provide revenues sufficient to supply water for standpost
users who constitute about 17% of the service area population.
(b) Sewerage and Drainage There are no direct charges for sewerage
and drainage and none are proposed since these services are popularly held
to be covered by property tax; part of this tax will continue to be trans-
ferred to WASA (see para 6.10). For the same reasons as those discussed in
part (a) above on the water supply component it is not possible to demonstrate
project justification for the sewerage and drainage components on the basis
of willingness to pay for these services. The economic benefits from the
project which are quantifiable are land value enhancement, increased agri-
cultural output attributed to the use of waste water for irrigation and
savings on night soil collections. About 40 ponds totalling 70 acres,
scattered throughout the city will be drained. It is estimated that a
further 30 acres adjoining the ponds would also be improved. Total area
benefiting from the project will therefore be about 100 acres.  Ponded areas
are estimated to improve from a nil value to the value of land in the
surrounding area. Land adjoining the ponded areas is assumed to rise in
value from PRs 8,000 per acre to the value of land in the area. Substantial
economic benefit is derived from the use of waste water for irrigation
purposes. It is estimated that an additional 5,000 acres can be irrigated
by the waste water removed from the city as a result of the Phase II proj-
ect. The estimated value of increased output for land under fodder is PRs
1,600 and for land under vegetables is PRs 1,000 per year per acre.   The
benefit from the project in respect of all these factors is estimated to
be about PRs 7.5 million a year from savings on nightsoil collections and
increased output of crops from irrigation with an increase in value of land
from draining of ponds amounting to PRs 15.8 million. These benefits alone
will produce a modest but positive rate of return of about one percent which
is significant when considered along with the benefits to health, convenience
and environment which however cannot be quantified in economic terms.
E. Urban Development and Traffic Study
4.06      Lahore's urban problems are described in a Master Plan for Greater
Lahore, prepared in the 1960's and published by PP in 1973. Already then
urgent needs existed for public services to residential housing and the
rehabilitation of low-income neighborhoods; there was a deficit in affordable
low cost shelter to house an estimated 500,000 squatters; there was a need
for improved transportation and for integrated urban planning that would
rationally relate commercial employment, transportation, residential develop-
ment and other sectors. The conditions that exisSed in the 1960s have been



- 14 -
aggravated in the intervening years. Physical and social infrastructures
have deteriorated and, with the city's growth, the distribution of economic
activities and labor location hatve become more disparate while transport-
ation services deteriorated. PP and GOP desire to actively address and
solve the major existing problems of Lahore, to guide its physical and
economic growth and to initiate development projects for which preinvest-
ment assistance and training are needed. The Lahore urban development and
traffic study is designed to meet some of the most urgent needs in this
area.
V. THE BORROWER AND BENEFICIARY
A.   The Borrower
5.01      The borrower will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan which
will make the proceeds of the IDA credit available to the Punjab
Province for on-lending to WASA and LDA (see para 6.08).
B.   The Beneficiary
5.02      The principal beneficiary, WASA, has been created by a Special Order
made under an Ordinance amending the Lahore Development Authority Act 1975.
WASA is a semi-autonomous agency under the LDA. The agency was created
as a result of discussions between PP and IDA in September 1975. WASA
will have adequate powers to operate the water supply, sewerage and
drainage systems within the city of Lahore, to carry out the project, to
maintain its own funds in a separate bank account and to make its own rules.
The approval of the amending Ordinance by the Provincial Assembly was
given during the March/April 1976 seasion.
5.03      The Board of LDA is ch.aired by the Chief Minister of the Punjab
and would have ten other members made up of two ministers, the chairman of
the Planning Board, four secretaries to the government, the mayor of Lahore,
the director general of LDA and the managing director of WASA. This is a
powerful board with the capacity for making decisions and getting things
done. However, it is a new body and basically a planning and development
institution and its performance :Ln managing the water supply, sewerage and
drainage services as a public utility will require to be monitored by IDA
and evaluated at the end of the project (see Annex 1, para 48).
C.   Organization and Management
5.04      The chief executive officer of WASA is the managing director who
will have full executive powers for the administration of WASA except for
tariff fixing, annual budget and capital program approval, major contract
awards, appointment of senior staff, fixing salary structure and staffing
levels, and incurring of long-term debt. These matters will remain the
prerogative of the LDA Board and PP. The proposed organization chart of



- 15 -
key positions for WASA is satisfactory and is shown in Annex 10. Agreement
was reached with PP, LDA and WASA that WASA's organization will be staffed
down to director level by December 1, 1976 in accordance with the organization
chart.
D.  Management Systems
5.05      Systems for the financial management of WASA have been designed by
financial consultants and are now in the process of implementation. These
include financial and budgetary controls, reporting procedures and redesigned
accounting and billing and collection systems, and training of staff in their
operation. The services of the consultants will be extended for long enough
for this work to be taken over by a management team to be provided by the UK
Overseas Development Ministry (ODM)(see para 5.08). The systems are satis-
factory and the project implementation schedule contains target dates for
their introduction.
E.   Staffing
5.06      The staff of the former LITWW and latterly the LDA Water Wing
will form the new WASA and except for some additional technical staff re-
quired for the project, is adequate. The position of managing director
has been filled by the former Project Director who was the most suitable
candidate for this appointment having been involved in the preparation of
the present project during the last twelve months. He was also for some
time director of construction during the first IDA project and is familiar
with IDA procedures. Additional technical and accounting staff below
director level (see Annex 1, para 29) will be required to carry out the
project and to operate the improved accounting billing and collection systems.
WASA has undertaken to prepare a detailed organization chart for positions
below director level and fill the vacancies. Agreement was reached with PP,
LDA and WASA that they will cause WASA to continue to fill the position of
managing director with a person having appropriate qualifications and ex-
perience and that WASA will be staffed with qualified people in sufficient
numbers. It was also agreed that IDA would be consulted on the appointment
of any future managing director. Agreement was also reached that WASA will
follow personnel policies that will be no less attractive than those of other
public utility authorities (like WAPDA) in attracting and keeping qualified
staff (Annex 1, para 33 (i)).
F.   Training
5.07      There are adequate facilities for professional training in Pakistan
and these supply a steady flow of graduates in engineering and commerce.
However, there is a drain of experienced professional and subprofessional
staff to the Middle East and a positive staff recruitment, retention, and
training program is being prepared by WASA.
5.08      An important feature of the training program will be the
provision by ODM of a management team initially of five people for three
years. The primary function of the team will be to establish a training



- 16 -
unit and to train counterpart and other staff.   The team will be made up
of specialists in engineering management, financial management, leak detec-
tion and repair, maintenance, procurement and training. Agreement was reached
with PP, LDA and WASA that technical assistance satisfactory to IDA will be
provided throughout the project period.
5.09      Many of the more senior positions are held by seconded engineers
from PHED. The training program will enable these persons to be replaced
by WASA's own trained staff. Agreement was reached with PP, LDA and WASA
that WASA will make every effort to replace all seconded engineers with
their own staff by the end of the project period (see Annex 1, para 34).
5.10      Another aspect of the training program will be the provision under
the project of a small residential training school capable of classroom
training of twenty staff members at a time. Agreement was reached with
PP, LDA and WASA that WASA will establish a training unit and carry out a
training program.
5.11      Manufacturers are expected to provide some specialist training
and under the UNDP Project, the consultants' work includes a large train-
ing element in design, tendering, contracting, and construction supervision.
The UNDP is also financing eight overseas fellowships (see Annex 1, Section
E).
G.   Audit
5.12      Annual audits are performed by local professional accounting firms
but have been unsatisfactory in the past, due to the lateness of the appoint-
ment of the auditor. Thus, no concurrent audit work has been possible and
the audit reports have been received so long after the year's end, as to
lose much of their effectiveness. In addition to this, the state of the
accounting records was such as to reduce the scope of the actual audit
carried out. With the new systems of accounting now being implemented and
the early and regular appointment of auditors in future, these problems
should be eliminated. Agreement was reached with PP, LDA and WASA that
independent auditors acceptable to IDA will be appointed for periods of at
least two years at a time to achieve continuity and before the commencement
of the period to the audited and that the audit report will be produced, re-
viewed by the Board and furnished to IDA within six months of the end of each
fiscal year.
H.   Operations
5.13      Several improvements in WASA's operations are included in the
project. These improvements include the setting up of an adequately staffed
and equipped hydrology cell and a leak detection and repair cell. A planned
preventive maintenance program for all mechanical and electrical plant has
been prepared and there is provision in the project for the necessary tools,
equipment and spare parts to implement the program. Metering of water pro-
duction and selective metering of domestic and industrial consumption is



- 17 -
also included in the project for priority implementation. Necessary labora-
tory equipment has also been provided to enable routine surveillance of
water quality. Agreement was reached with PP, LDA and WASA that WASA will
make these improvements and meet the targets set out in the implementation
schedule detailed in Annex 1 (see para 6.21).
I.  Project Risks
5.14      There is adequate provision in the project for engineering con-
sultants to advise WASA with design and construction and for a management
team to assist with operations and training. However, as a new organization
WASA would require time to overcome the institutional short-comings inherited
from the former LITWW (see paras 2.11 and 3.02).  Nevertheless, WASA's present
managing director is capable, and the powers conferred upon him, under the
LDA act are adequate to enable him to carry out the project as planned and
achieve project targets. It is also possible that because the Chief Minister
is Chairman of LDA, important decisions would be implemented expeditiously.
5.15      In order to maintain its role in the long process of institution
building, IDA should continue its financial participation and accept the
risk of dealing with a new institution. Supervision missions will be alert
to this problem and recommend steps during project implementation to correct
any situation before it seriously affects the project.
J.   Lahore Urban Development and Traffic Studies
5.16      The LDA has broad powers and responsibilities for the formulation
and implementation of urban development programs in Lahore and for regulatory
functions in a metropolitan area of about 680 square miles. At present, LDA
is executing several housing schemes and has a small staff unit in urban and
regional planning. However, a review of IDA's existing and prospective
staff capabilities in September 1975 indicated that LDA would not be able
to undertake the proposed urban development and traffic study without
major outside consulting assistance.  Agreement was reached with PP and LDA
that PP shall cause the LDA to carry out and complete by December 1978 the
study with the assistance of consultants whose qualifications, experience
and terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to IDA.

VI. FINANCE
A.   Past Performance and Present Financial Position of WASA
6.01      Before the establishment of LITWW in 1967, the water supply and
sewerage operations of Lahore Municipal Corporation (LMC) were characterized
by repeated annual operating losses in the order of PRs 1.0 to 3.0 million.
These were due to low tariffs, abnormally high operating costs and
lack of proper maintenance. The transfer of responsibility from LMC
to LITWW and doubling of water rates in 1967 were designed to improve this
situation but while some progress was made, annual losses continued-FY1968
PRs 0.8 million, FY1969 PRs 1.2 million and FY1970 PRs 2.5 million.
6.02      Annexes 11, 12 and 13 show income and expense statements, cash
flow statements and balance sheets for the past five years -- FY1971 to 1975
and projections through FY1983. The assumptions for financial projections
are shown at Annex 14. The figures are taken from the audit reports for the
years FY1971 to 1974, from estimates for FY1975 and FY1976 and from the
mission's projections through FY1983. The financial performance of LITWW has
fallen far behind that forecast at the time of appraisal of Phase I in
1967. Revenues have lagged as much as 50% behind the forecasts, whereas ex-
penditures have climbed to almost match the forecasts. Collection of only
about 30% of billings in any one year has resulted in accounts receivable
climbing to an amount larger than one year's billings, in FY1975. The
billing records, themselves, contain many errors and do not, at present,
include all the charges that should be billed and the billing itself is six
months in arrears. The effects of these poor performances have been to make
it necessary for LITWW to use some loan and grant monies to finance operat-
ing costs and also to reduce the rate of return on average net fixed assets
from a forecast 6% to a very small or even a negative figure.
6.03      Flat rate water charges were doubled in January 1975 with the
lowest rate increased from PRs 6.00 a month to PRs 12.00 a month. Metered
charges were increased from PRs 1.50 to PRs 2.00 per 1,000 gallons for
domestic consumers and from PRs 2.00 to PRs 3.00 per 1,000 gallons for
commercial and industrial consumers. No charges were made for the sewerage
and drainage service. These charges are shown at Annex 15. CDM assisted
by Fergusons has designed a new billing and collection system which will
make better use of a computer operated by the WASA's bank in Karachi. The
new system should give WASA better control over the billing and collection
cycle, enable consumers' complaints to be dealt with promptly and ensure
the efficient disconnection of delinquent consumers (see para 6.10).
6.04      CDM, assisted by Fergusons, has also reviewed all of the account-
ing systems in use, and has redesigned these where necessary to accurately
record and control the financial affairs of WASA and to produce promptly
all the reports, statistics and accounts needed by management for decision-
making and for planning.  Manuals have been prepared, the redesigned systems
have been introduced, and the staffE are being trained in the use of these
systems. This training will continue under the guidance of the ODM experts.



- 19 -
6.05      Apart from the IDA/SIDA Credits of US$3.5 million equivalent and
a small loan from LDA, all of the loans to LITWW, amounting to US$12.6 million
equivalent, have come from PP and at the end of FY1975 the outstanding loans
totalled about US$16.0 million equivalent. At this time, net assets with
work in progress totalled about US$14.8 million or rather less than the
loan debt total. The debt equity ratio was 84:16.
B.   Financing Plan of WASA
6.06      The financing plan for the years of the project's implementation
-- FY1977 to FY1980 -- is summarized below:
WASA FUNDS REQUIREMENTS AND SOURCES FY1977 TO FY1980
PRs     US$          Percentage
(millions)
Requirements
Project expenditures            458.2   46.3             88.4

TOTAL                518.2   52.4             100.0
US$25.0 million of the proposed IDA Credit will provide about 48% of the
financing required during the project period. PP would provide US$20.7 mil-
lion or about 40% of the financing and UNDP would provide US$0.6 million



- 20 -
or about 1% of the financing for employing consultants. The balance of
financing amounting to US$6.1 mLllion or about 12% of the financing plan
will be provided by internal cash generation. The financing plan is satis-
factory. During negotiations it: was disclosed that WASA would acquire
some PRs 45.0 million worth of assets during FY 1977 to FY 1979 including
about 40,000 new connections from PHED and LDA at no cost. This has been
accounted for in the financial projections.
6.08      GOP will make the proceeds of the IDA credit available to PP for
onlending to LDA and WASA under a subsidiary loan agreement to be entered
into between GOP, PP, LDA and WASA under terms and conditions acceptable
to IDA. GOP proposes to onlend the proceeds of the credit to PP on IDA
terms and PP proposes to onlend the proceeds of the credit to WASA for water
supply, sewerage and drainage and to LDA for the urban development studies
at 8-3/4% for 25 years with a grace period and waiver of interest for five
years. The effective rate for the loan period will be 7.0%. The execution
of the subsidiary loan agreement: is a condition of effectiveness of the
credit.
6.09      PP will make a loan to LDA for onlending to WASA of an amount of
US$20.7 million equivalent on terms and conditions mutually satisfactory
to IDA and PP. The financial projections are based on a twenty five year
term at 3-1/2% interest with a grace period and waiver of interest for five
years. The effective rate of interest for this loan would be 2.8%, which
is low, particularly in reference to the need for maximum resource mobiliza-
tion, but is justified because of the low revenue earning capacity of the
sewerage and drainage component.
C.   Present Charging System
6.10      The Greater Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Ordinance
1967, Schedule II (as subsequently amended) prescribed monthly charges for
domestic water supplies related to the size of ferrule 1/ and the number of
taps; subject to an alternative charge of a percentage of the annual rental
value (ARV) if this produced a higher sum. Fixed charges were prescribed
for unmetered katries (private standposts) and commercial premises and for
hamams (public bathhouses). Religious and charitable institutions were to
be charged at half the domestic rate. The Ordinance did not prescribe which
premises should be metered, but provided for charges per thousand gallons for
domestic supplies with increased charges for commercial and industrial use,
meter rents, minimum charges and a special rate for bulk supplies. A metered
charge payable by the "Municipal Committee" for water supplied by community
standposts, was laid down. All charges were subject to a surcharge of 10%
1/   A ferrule is a metal adaptor for making a tight joint between a water
main and a service pipe.



- 21 -
if payment is not made by the due date. The Ordinance prescribed separate
rates as percentages of net annual value for sewerage and drainage, although
these have never been collected, and acreage charges for the disposal of sew-
age from premises occupied by corporate bodies and factories. A part of the
operating costs of the sewerage and drainage services has been met by a trans-
fer of property tax from PETD to LITWW. This tax is charged on all properties
and collected by PETD. The proportion transferred was increased in FY1975 and
has been increased again recently. This is shown in Annex 11 as Sewered Area
Rate. Agreement was reached with PP, LDA and WASA that PP will transfer to
WASA during each fiscal year until June 30, 1986 not less than 42.5% of
property tax collected in Lahore.
D.   Application of Charging System
6.11      The basis of charging on the size of ferrule and number of taps was
introduced as a financial incentive to help conserve water. Less water
would be used with a smaller size pipe and fewer taps. In order to achieve
this objective it is essential that every new connection is inspected before
the excavation is back filled to ensure that the size of the ferrule connec-
tion is recorded accurately; and a continuous process of inspection is neces-
sary to ensure that taps added after connection, are recorded and charged.
Neither of these essential requirements is observed by LITWW and, in conse-
quence most unmetered connections are recorded as 1/4" ferrule with not more
than 2 taps. Out of 95,489 unmetered consumers at June 30, 1974, only
29,394 or 30% were charged more than the minimum of PRs 18 (US$1.82) per
quarter on account of higher ARVs.
6.12      In January 1975, the records of LITWW indicated that 8,477 consu-
mers were billed as metered connections, but in fact only about 60% of these
have effectively registering meters.  The remainder are out of order or miss-
ing. Even where meters are registering, bills are sometimes issued on an
estimated consumption basis or for false consumptions.
6.13      LMC has declined to pay any charges for water taken by community
stand posts because when they owned the system, no charge was made. No
direct charges are made for the sewerage service at present (see para 6.10).
E.   Tariff Study
6.14      The inadequacies of the present charging system prompted GOP to
include a tariff study to be carried out by CDM in preparation for the Phase
II project. The main recommendation of the study concerns flat rate charges
with the abolition of the charge on ferrule size and the use of ARV as a
basis for flat rate charges. The proposed tariff to be implemented in
January 1977 was arrived at in consultation with PP, LDA and WASA and is
shown in Annex 16. The proposals are reasonable and are used in the finan-
cial projections. However, the recommendation to use flat rate charges on
the basis of ARV will require that WASA carries out a major improvement to
its recording of ARVs for each house. ARVs are revalued every five years



- 22 -
by PETD and agreement was reached with PP, that it will cause PETD to supply
WASA with full details of all ARVs and that these will be kept up to date
on at least a monthly basis in the form of computer printouts or other
listings.
6.15      The study concluded that universal metering should not be applied
in Lahore as the saving of water required to make this financially viable
could not be achieved. This confirms a previous recommendation made by
Bank staff. The study recommends an increase in the metered rate of charge
and to make the charge uniform to all categories of metered consumers.
6.16      PP has agreed to impose an increased water charge effective
January 1, 1977 and to make subsequent increases which would be sufficient
to yield a return on revalued net fixed assets in service of 4% in FY1978 to
FY1980, 5% in FY1981 and FY1982 and 6% from FY1983 onwards. PP did not agree
to the imposition of a separate sewerage charge on the grounds that this
service is already financed by the existing property tax, part of which
is, in fact, already transferred to WASA (see para 6.10) and an additional
sewer charge would arouse adverse public reaction. PP has also taken
into account new housing development (see para 6.07) and hence more rapid
growth in revenues. The water charges proposed by PP are satisfactory
and the major ones are:
Flat rate - Fixed monthly rates up to PRs 1,500 ARV, thereafter
20% of ARV annually.
Metered rate - PRs 3.00 per 1,000 gallons with a minimum
charge related to meter size.
A study of the ability to pay, of a household in the minimum income bracket,1/
was made by the consultants who established that at 5% of monthly income, such
a family could afford PRs 155 a year for water supply and sewerage services
in FY1977. The cost to such a family living in a house with an ARV of
PRs 300, would be PRs 144 a year on the proposed tariff.
F.   Future Finance
6.17      The projections through FY1983 show, that on the basis of the new
charges in FY1977 and assumed further increases of 30% in FY1979, 20% in
FY1981 and 10% in FY1983, billed income will rise from PRs 25.4 million in
FY1976 to PRs 152.6 million in 1983. In the same period net revenue is
expected to improve ffrom PRs 10.4 million to PRs 42.8 million but this
improvement derives mainly from the water supply service. The overall rate
of return on unrevalued average net fixed assets in FY1981 is 7.3% made up
of 13.3% on water assets and zero percent (break even) on sewerage and
1/   The household minimum income bracket in based on a GOP study of house-
hold income and expenditure in 1972 and on a low income housing in urban
areas in 1972.



- 23 -
drainage assets. The cost of the sewerage and drainage service is high in
relation to the income -- there is no income from drainage -- so that these
services are less financially viable than the water supply service. For
comparison purposes an estimate of average net fixed assets has been made
on an annual revaluation basis and the rate of return in FY1981 is about
5% made up of about 9% on water assets which is commendable and zero percent
on sewerage assets. The basis for calculating the annual revaluation is past
GOP price indices and future inflation factors as used for project price
contingencies. The overall rate of return although low is reasonable and
will be achieved by the imposition of large increases in the charges for
the water supply service. The income from these charges will cover all
operating costs and debt service charges and from FY1980 will cover 25% or
more of future development. The assumptions used in the financial projections
are shown in Annex 14.
6.18      The concept of fixing tariffs by reference to a rate of return on
assets is not customary in the water supply sector in Pakistan and the idea
of revaluing assets periodically to reflect inflation is equally uncommon.
However, agreement was reached during negotiations with PP, LDA and WASA
that LDA and WASA will (1) complete by not later than June 30, 1977 an
inventory of all WASA's physical assets and adjust WASA's books of account
to record such assets at their correct historical cost (2) revalue these
assets each year on the basis of increases in the Pakistan Government's
consumer general price index number and achieve the rate of return targets
(see para 6.16).
6.19      The consultants have made detailed recommendations for making im-
provements in billing and collection. These are satisfactory and are an
essential part of the project and agreement was reached with PP, LDA and
WASA that LDA and WASA will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that
WASA's outstanding receivables are reduced to 100% of billings in FY 1977,
60% in FY 1979, 20% in FY 1981 and 15% from FY 1982 onwards. As well as the
improvement in the billing system it is necessary to correct the basic in-
formation upon which the billing is carried out. A survey of the whole
service area for water and sewer connections would be carried out by a special
section set up for this purpose and make the corrections in a period of one
year. This period is probably optimistic for the amount of work to be carried
out, nevertheless an early completion date is necessary and a reasonable
target period of say two years should be set. Agreement was reached with PP,
LDA and WASA that LDA and WASA would by June 30, 1978 carry out a survey of
the whole of WASA's service area.
6.20      Although the borrowing program for WASA is heavy, the debt service
requirements in the first five years of the projections are amply covered
due to the 5-year grace period including waiver of interest. From FY1981
however, debt service requirements rise very rapidly but are covered 1.3
times in FY1982. Because debt service requirements will continue to rise,
agreement was reached with PP, LDA and WASA that no further debt shall
be incurred by WASA unless the net revenue of WASA shall exceed 1.25 times



- 24 -
the maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding year. Again,
because of the heavy borrowing program the debt/equity ratio is high at
71:29 in FY1983 but this should improve in later years. WASA's capital
expenditures outside the proposed project would be limited to US$1.0 million
per year.
G.   Performance Monitoring
6.21      The past performance of LITWW has been unsatisfactory in most
aspects of management. It will be necessary to closely monitor all future
performances of the new WASA arnd the project implementation schedule detailed
in para 47 of Annex 1 includes a list of key indicators for monitoring pur-
poses.  Agreement was reached with PP, LDA and WASA that WASA will carry
out the project with due diligence and efficiency and in conformity with
appropriate administrative, financial, engineering and public utility
practices and in accordance with the implementation schedule.
H.   Insurance
6.22      Materials for the prcject will be fully insured.  Since WASA is
Government owned, it does not carry other insurance. Agreement was reached
with PP, LDA and WASA that WASA will (1) insure all of the imported goods to
be financed out of the proceeds of the credit and (2) make provisions
satisfactory to IDA for insurance against such risks and in such amounts
as shall be consistent with appropriate practice in Pakistan.
VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      Agreement has been reached with GOP, PP, LDA ard WASA on the
following principal points which have been recorded as covenants in the
draft legal documents:
(a) (i) The proceeds of the credit will be made available to PP
on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA and (ii) The
proceeds of the credit will be onlent by PP to LDA and WASA
at 8-3/4% for 25 years with a grace period and a waiver
of interest for 5 years (para 6.08).
(b) WASA will carry out ani inventory of all physical assets
and adjust its books of account to record these assets

APPRAISAL OF THE
LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT - PHASE II
A. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT - WATER SUPPLY AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
1.        The overall Phase II project objectives are summarized in para-
graph 3.03 of the main report. The existing water supply facilities, water
sources and hydrology are described in Annex 6. The consultants have prepared
a new Master Plan for a ten-year period ending 1986 and recommended a three-
year investment program for Phase II estimated to cost US$54 million equiv-
alent, with investments in water supply, sewerage and drainage in the approxi-
mate percentages of 53, 30 and 17. However, because of the Province's desire
to proceed cautiously with water supply development until more is known of
the groundwater hydrology (Annex 6, para 15), concern that the increases
in rates and tariffs needed to support an investment of this size would be
difficult to impose and collect, the placing of greater priority by Govern-
ment at this time on sewerage rather than water supply and the need for
WASA's new management to substantially improve operational and financial
performance, the proposed investment in the Phase II project is reduced to
US$44 million equivalent in the percentages of 50, 47 and 3, between water
supply, sewerage and drainage. The shortfall is proposed by WASA for in-
clusion in a future Phase III project.
2.        The physical components of the project are:
(i) Tubewells. 47 to be constructed to varying depths of
pumphousing and bore and with 14 electric and 17 natural
gas engine driven vertical pumps and 16 electric sub-
mersible pumps.
(ii) Mains. 2-1/2 miles of AC pipe and 2-1/2 miles of RCP
pipe connecting the tubewells and 31 miles of AC and
7 miles of RCP pipe for the main grid. Pipe sizes will
vary from 12 inches to 48 inches.
(iii) Distribution Network. About 150 miles of piping from
3 to 8 inches installed in 3,030 acres and for reinforce-
ment and replacement.
(iv) Detailed Design. Consultants financed by the UNDP Project
for which the Bank is executing agency will provide 18 man-
months of design work and training of the hydrology cell
staff.
(v) Operations. A leak detection cell will be established by
WASA and a specialist will be provided under the UNDP Project



ANNEX 1
Page 2
who will design a program to be carried out during the
project by the staff of the cell. The staff will be
trained by the specialist and later by the ODM team.
ODM will also assist in training WASA staff in a planned
preventive maintenance program for plant, particularly
pumps and motors. Spare parts and tools for repairs and
vehicles for transporting men and materials are also
included.
(vi)  Meters.  Meters for the selective metering of commercial,
industrial and large domestic consumers and for installa-
tion on tubewells, amounting to 7,400 in total, are included
in the project.
(vii)  Radio Communication for well centers and other operational
centers is provided.
(viii)  Offices, Housing and Training and Facilities.  Two offices
for senior engineers and ten offices for junior engineers,
accounting machines, housing for essential workers, and
five houses for senior staff are included in the project.
A small training building for about 20 students is also
provided.
B. DESIGN
Tubewells
3.        In addition to reducing the number of wells from the number
recommended by the consultants as shown below, WASA proposes a more con-
servative design for the wells and an Immediate Works Program to be under-
taken by WASA ahead of the proposed Phase II project.

ANNEX 1
Page 3
4.        On the basis of the review of the groundwater hydrology studies
carried out by the consultants there are two options for the selection of
tubewell pump housing depths. The first option is to accept the consult-
ants recommendations (Annex 6, para 19) for the preliminary engineering
design and cost estimates for wells with pump housings going down to a
maximum depth of 220 feet and base the final engineering design on the
results of pumping tests to be carried out under the UNDP Project. If this
course of action is followed and should the pumping tests and studies
indicate a greater regional drawdown than assumed by the consultants, the
reduced program discussed above may have to be even further reduced. The
second option will be to base pump housing depths upon two factors (1) WASA's
forecast of regional drawdown (Annex 6, para 20) which shows that this could
vary between 400 feet and 270 feet in the high demand areas of the city and
200 feet at the periphery and (2) the consultants economic studies which
show that with a drawdown greater than about 322 feet, wells within Lahore
may become more and more uneconomic (Annex 6, para 22). WASA proposes
following the second option for the purposes of making the preliminary
engineering calculations and cost estimates. Based upon this option the
following depths have been selected for the 59 wells:
Wells (Nos.)                    19     20      10     10
Pump Housing depth (feet)    200    250    300    350
Boring depths (feet)           415    465    515    565
5.        The forty-seven wells which are in the Phase II project will be
constructed with stainless steel screens and the 12 wells in the Immediate
Works Program will be constructed with fibre glass screens. At January
1976 prices (excluding contingencies) the average cost of a well with stain-
less steel screens at the above depths is about PRs 348,000. The consult-
ants' estimate of cost for a 220 feet deep well is PRs 257,000. Should the
pumping tests and further analysis indicate WASA assumptions are conservative,
there could be a saving of about PRs 4.3 million on the 47 wells to be built
in the Phase II project. This saving could be utilized in building add-
itional wells and water pipelines as a continuation of the work in the new
Master Plan. These proposals represent the least cost solution on the basis
of the present information and will be revised when more data becomes
available in the coming years.  The reference numbers o.. aie 12 wells to
be built i., the Immediate Works Program and 47 wells to be built in the
Phase II project are listed below and shown in IBRD Map 11913.

6.        The 12 wells in the 11975/76 Immediate Works Program will be built
to meet unsatisfied demand and replace some of the capacity lost by the
retirement of 30 wells in that time (Annex 8). The sites of the 47 wells
in the Phase II project are selected for meeting (1) demand in new areas -
14 Nos., (2) replacement wells - 17 Nos., and (3) high demand areas - three
well centers of six, six and four wells respectively.
Pumps and Motors
7.        Submersible units and motors will be installed at all of the 16
wells at the three well centers. Pump houses are not required, and each
motor is to be connected to the starter by underground cable. One control
building is to be provided to accommodate the starter units, and provide
slhelter for the operator. In this manner, only one operator, per shift,
would be required at each well center. Since the three well centers are
located in areas which are subjected to flooding, the well casing would
be extended to the height of the Bund Road, and the area around the well
would be filled. The consultants have recommended a generator sized to
supply power to operate all the wells at each well center. This would be
included in the next phase of the project to provide standby service in the
event of a power failure. LITWW has obtained assurances from the WAPDA
that power will be available for the project. All of the remaining wells
are to be at separate locations, and it would not be practical to provide
standby power for each well sile. Some standby capacity is provided in
the Pnase II project and adequate capacity to meet average day demands will



ANNEX 1
Page 5
be provided in the future if electrical outages become a serious problem
to satisfactory water supply operations. Vertical turbine pumps driven
by gas engines will be installed at 17 wells at sites where gas is availa-
able. The remaining 26 wells including the immediate works program would
have vertical turbine pump sets with electric motors.
Transmission Pipelines
8.        In selecting the proposed configuration of 175 wells and trans-
mission pipelines as being the most economic arrangement for supplying
water to Lahore for the next ten years the consultants studied by a com-
puter network analysis program the two alternative schemes discussed below
designed to satisfy 1986 maximum day conditions. As there was very little of
the existing system that could be utilized in the future distribution system,
only significant pipelines were included in the computer analysis and there
was no verification of the existing system. The computer program would,
therefore, have to be utilized in final design of the distribution system to
verify the adequacy of pipelines, as they are designed and constructed.
Due to the characteristics of the head-capacity curves for typical centrifu-
gal well pumps, a maximum range of 40 to 50 feet in elevation of the system
hydraulic gradeline was selected. This range would be centered around
the maximum efficiency point when selecting well pumps. In addition to
limiting the variation in hydraulic gradeline to 40 to 50 feet, the pres-
sure within the system is assumed by the consultants to be between 46 feet
and 138 feet. 46 feet is the minimum pressure required to properly service
buildings up to three floors. 138 feet the assumed maximum pressure would
normally be considered high for the Lahore water distribution system though
there will be fluctuations caused by the well pump characteristics and
uncertainties concerning future drawdown. This will be reviewed after the
pumping tests and during detailed designs.
(a)  Scheme I - for maximum day conditions
This scheme proposed a system of 12 well centers, each
containing four wells, located to the north and east of
the north Bund Road, having a transmission main ranging
in size from 24 inch to 72 inch diameter, which discharged
to a 10 U.S. million gallon (8.3 IMg) capacity ground
storage reservoir. From this reservoir, the water would
be pumped to the distribution system. In addition, two
well centers of six wells each were proposed, one along
the west Bund Road, west of the Old City, and one north-
west of Shad Bagh, near the north Bund Road. One other
well center of three wells was proposed near the east
Bund Road. The remaining 112 wells were located through-
out the project area, and pumped directly into the
system. This scheme required a total of 918,900 feet
of pipe ranging in size from 8-inch to 72-inch diameter,
along with the reservoir and pumping facility. The
estimated cost of this scheme is PRs 402 million. If
water was pumped continuously from the reservoir, the
power charges for this pumpi..g would amount to over
PRs 7 million per year.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
(b)  Scheme II - for maximum day conditions
The scheme includes four well centers, the three near the
Bund Road, described in Scheme I, and a fourth, of six
wells, located at the north Bund Road, north of Shalimar
Gardens. The well center at the east Bund Road would be
increased to four weLls. The remaining 153 wells would
be located throughout the project area, and all wells
would pump directly to the system, thus eliminating the
need for a reservoir and pump system to meet maximum day
demands. A total of 690,100 feet of pipes, ranging in
diameter from 8 inch to 60 inich, would be required. The
estimated cost of this selheme is PRs 361 million.
Based upon the lower cost of the distribution system, and the elimination
of the need for a costly reservoir and pump system to meet maximum day demand,
Scheme II is preferable and planning has proceeded on this basis.
Peak-Hour Conditions
9.        A computer analysis of Scheme II was performed to check the required
pipe sizes to meet peak hour conditions in 1986. This analysis shows that to
meet peak hour conditions, the diameter of 37,000 feet of pipe would need to
be increased and that an additional 27,500 feet of parallel piping would be
required. The additional cost of piping is PRs 18,455,000 or 8.1 percent
of the cost of the pipe required to meet maximum day conditions. Since it
would be more costly to install 37,000 feet of parallel pipe in the future,
piping to satisfy peak hour conditions will be installed as the system is
expanded.  Also, in order to meet peak hour demands, storage will be required.
At present, there are 30 elevated storage tanks in the LITWW system located
throughout the project area having a total capacity of 2.57 million gallons.
These tanks range in size froim 20,000 gallons, such as at Rehmanpura to a one
million gallon tank at Lange Mandi, at the top of the hill in the Old City.
Two ground storage reservoirs of 40 and 10 million (33.3 and 8.3 IMg) U.S.
gallon capacity are proposed in future to satisfy peak hour conditions. Pump
systems will be included at each reservoir, and during peak demand condi-
tions, water will be pumped to the distribution system from these reservoirs.
These two reservoirs, along with the existing storage facilities, would be
capable of meeting peak hour conditions for periods of about four hours. How-
ever, until more is known of the ground water hydrology and the availability
of water and until such time as the distribution system is shown to be satis-
factorily o- crated and maintained, storage for meeting peak hour conditions
should not be provided as further wastage of water would result. It is expected
that these storage facilities, as recommended above, would not be required until
near the end of the planning period in 1986, and a careful study of conditions
should be made before investing in a storage facility of this magnitude.
10.       In the Immediate Works Program the Government proposed financing
about 3.2 miles of transmission mains for connecting the proposed new 12
wells to the distribution systems. Details of the transmission pipelines
and main grid for the Phase II project to connect the 47 wells are given

f1.       As discussed in paragraph 8 above the final diameters of the 40
miles of pipelines for the well centers and main grid will be calculated
with greater accuracy during the detailed design of the Phase II project.
Distribution Network
12.       Some 150 miles of pipe ranging from 3 to 8 inches in diameter
are included in the project to provide extensions in high demand areas, to
reinforce existing networks and for the replacement of old leaky pipelines.
The pipe will be laid in the following six specific locations and other un-
specified locations which will be identified by leakage surveys.

13.       On the basis of studies made of actual lengths of pipeline laid
in high, low and medium income localities the pipe requirements for the
distribution network are estimated at 260 feet per acre.  This length is
roughly distributed between three, four, six and eight inch diameter pipes
in the following percentages - 3 inch, 27%; 4 inch, 39%; 6 inch, 23%;
and 8 inch, 11 percent. During final engineering, detailed surveys and
designs will be made to correctly size the pipes for the network. The pipes
will be laid only in streets which are not presently served or do not have
an adequate water supply.
Detailed Designs
14.       Consultants financed by the UNDP Project will provide about 18 man
months of assistance on the design of the Phase II project both on water
supply and sewerage. WASA's design directorate will be trained in the correct
design of high capacity tubewells and leak tight water distribution systems
and required design manuals will be produced. The training will also include
the design of sewage pumping stations and sewage treatment plants (see Annex 2)
by specialist engineers. By the end of the project period WASA's technical
standards in the design of water supply and sewerage facilities should be
improved.
15.       WASA has created a new hydrology cell to make pumping tests and
collect data to develop long range programs for the management of urban
water in Lahore and its vicinities. Consultants financed by UNDP will assist
the hydrology cell and train staff in the collection and analysis of both
ground and surface water hydrological data. The Government's Meteorological
Department will also assist WASA in the installation of rain gauges and
flow recorders in storm channels and sewers, and in making infiltration
studies. The cost of installing this equipment is estimated at PRs 102,720
and is included in the project. It is expected that by the completion of
Phase II, future designs for tubewells, sewers and surface drains will be
made on more reliable data than are now available. The hydrology cell
will continue to collect and analyze the data on a permanent basis.

C. OPERATIONS
Unaccounted for Water
16.       Upon the consultant's recommendations WASA proposes to establish
a leakage detection and repair cell. A leakage survey specialist to be
provided with UNDP technical assistance will set up the leakage survey
program which will be implemented during the project, and staff will be
trained with the assistance of a leakage survey and repair engineer to be
provided by ODM. The project provides for equipping the cell in FY1977
to assist in preparing for leakage surveys and in making the subsequent
repairs. Replacement of corroded pipes and repair of major leaks would
be done by contractors while minor repair work will be done by the cell.
Leak detection equipment tools and four pick-up trucks estimated to cost
PRs 470,800 are provided and a significant reduction in leakage is expected
by the end of the project period to meet project objectives. The cell will
be initially headed by the ODM engineer who will train and hand over to
counterpart engineers and assist them with the program. Because of the
high levels of wastage and unaccounted for water, publicity equipment for
a waste prevention campaign is provided in the project to complement the
work of the leak detection and repair cell. Two motorcycles, a projector
and tape recorder are provided in the project. The estimated cost of these
items is PRs 26,750. During the project period unaccounted for water is
expected to be reduced from the presently reported 63% to about 45%. Con-
sidering the present shortage of trained staff to reduce leakage and the
time needed to educate the public on controlling wastage this is a real-
istic target.
Planned Preventive Maintenance
17.       Until the new wells in the project are commissioned, WASA will
have to make special efforts to maintain the existing plant to provide a
reasonable service to its consumers. WASA also proposes to implement a
planned preventive maintenance program with the assistance of specialist
engineers to be provided by the ODM, who will obtain the assistance of the
Training Division of the National Water Council of the British Government.
The project provides for pumps and motor spare parts estimated at PRs 585,000
for water supply and similar equipment for sewerage estimated at PRs 366,000.
Both the mechanical and electrical workshops are poorly equipped especially
for the repair of natural gas driven plant. The project provides for new
workshop tools at an estinated cost of PRs 626,000 to be used in the repair
and maintenance of water supply, sewage and drainage pumping equipment. Some
equipment for the meter repair workshop estimated at PRs 53,500 will also be
provided.
18.       The Operations and 1MIaintenance (O&M) Directorate will be re-
organized and initially headed by the O&M Engineer (to be provided by the
ODM) who will set up the planned preventive maintenance program, train
counterpart engineers and then assist them and evaluate the success of the
assistance. Training in the repairs of pumps and motors will also be car-
ried out by specialist engineers to be provided by ODM and the Training



ANNEX 1
Page 10
Division of the National Water Council. The 0&M Directorate has inadequate
transport facilities for setting up an effective planned preventive main-
tenance program covering the very large number of tubewell facilities and
sewage pumping stations that will become its responsibility. The minimum
requirements will be, one truck for the workshop, one pick-up truck for
the meter repair sliop, three trucks for the stores and transport of main-
tenance crews. In addition, five cars are needed for the five-man ODM
management team (see para 5.08 of the main report) comprising management,
financing, operations, stores, and leak detection. The cars will be used
by WASA after the departure of the ODM team. These vehicles, with a total
estimated cost of PRs 583,150 are included in the project.
Water Production and Consumption
19.       Meters are urgently required to be installed in all the tubewells
and WASA also requires spare parts for the existing meters.  Some 7,400,
1/2" size meters are needed for the selective metering of new consumers
(3,300), installations in tubewells (100) and replacement of existing meters.
These meters and spares for meters are provided in the project.
Control of System Pressures
20.       With several tubewells pumping into the system against the con-
tinuous hourly fluctuations of demand a central control station is required
in the O&M Directorate headquarters to regulate the numbers of wells to be
turned on or off and avoid irreversible damage to the tubewell gravel packs.
With the completion of new high capacity well centers this need is even
greater. Radio communication with the well centers and other important
operational centers has been provided in the project at a total cost of
PRs 55,640.
Surveillance of Water Quality
21.       WASA has made arrangements with the Ministry of Health for the
surveillance of water quality as recommended in the WHO International Stand-
ards. This surveillance will be carried out independently by the Institute
of lhygiene and Preventive Medicine (IPM) in Lahore.  WASA will provide
transportation and make budgetary provision to reimburse IHPM for their
services. In order to provide a safe water supply WASA will have to install
more chlorinators, repair those 1hat are not working and chlorinate all
through the year instead of only during the monsoon months as now practiced.
At the end of the Phase II project it is estimated that 82 tubewells will be
in operation. Thirty-six chlorinators are now installed but most of these
need spare parts and repairs. The cost of these and the additional 46
chlorinators, including installation, is estimated at PRs 282,500 and is
included in the project. Additional equipment for WASA's laboratory is also
needed, estimated to cost PRs 89,000 and is included in the project.



ANNEX 1
Page 11
Offices, Housing and Training Facilities
22.       Two offices for Senior Operations and Maintenance Engineers are
required in two new O&M areas. Smaller offices for Junior Operations and
Maintenance Engineers are required in ten sub-areas. At the present time
temporary office accommodation which is inadequate in most cases is pro-
vided in old LMC buildings or under overhead reservoirs. These new
offices are included in the project at an estimated cost of PRs 1,359,000.
Accounting machines required for the existing offices are included in the
project cost. Several key staff such as fitters, drivers, mechanics and
shift workers are not provided with housing and therefore cannot be readily
contacted for emergencies. Land is available at most of the pump sites and
storage yards for both water supply and sewerage. The required housing
is of the usual government standards which is based upon the pay scales and
is included in the project at an estimated cost of PRs 4,783,000. Senior
staff in WASA unlike their counterparts in similar government service are
not provided with housing. WASA has the option of building five houses
for senior staff under the project. These houses will be used to first
house ODM staff during the project period under the terms of the Colombo
Plan Agreement. It is more economical for WASA to build this housing than
rent accommodations at the current rates of PRs 3,000 per month for a house.
The amount of PRs 720,000 included in the project for renting housing may
be utilized for building this housing and would thus become eligible for
partial credit disbursement.
23.       The ODM Management team, WASA engineers and manufacturers, will
provide training for WASA staff. Because of the current brain drain to the
Middle East there is a high turnover of staff and facilities for the con-
tinuous orientation, and classroom training of new and old staff members
are included in the project for about 20 staff members at a time. The
facilities will provide for the trainees to be resident during the period
of training. The estimated cost of the facilities which include offices,
canteen, workshop and dormitory including furniture, is PRs 321,000 and is
included in the project.
D. CONSTRUCTION
24.       The cost estimates are based upon cost curves for pipelines pre-
pared by WASA for the consultants and quotations obtained from drilling
contractors, pipe suppliers and manufacturers in Lahore, Islamabad and
Karachi. The estimates have been verified by comparison with on-going or
recently completed water supply and sewerage works in Lahore. The prices
of imported equipment not generally used in the past were provided by the
consultants. The prices are calculated exclusive of customs duty for
imported components, with duty added on to the total. WASA will revise these
cost estimates on the completion of detailed designs. The foreign and local
components ok locally manufactured items with a significant proportion of



ANNEX 1
Page 12
imported materials are calculated from information given by the manufacturers
and include both the direct and indirect foreign costs of the materials and
manufacturing equipment used in mnaking them. Buildings have been estimated
as having a total local cost because all building supplies are manufactured
in Pakistan (some items are exported) and the indirect foreign component is
negligible.
25.       The January 1976 base line estimated costs of the water supply com-
ponent of the project for a 3-year construction program are shown on page 31
of this Annex.
26.       As the preliminary engineering studies have been based upon plan-
ning criteria and not on detailed surveys and designs, the consultants have
recommended that a 20% provision is made for physical contingencies both for
the water supply and for the sewerage and drainage components of the project.
WASA feels that this provision is reasonable, especially because some items
in the project such as the use of RCP pipe and tubewells of special design
are new in their experience. Any savings in this item will be utilized to
extend the network. There is only one pipe factory in Pakistan which
manufactures AC pipe. Because of this lack of competition, prices tend to
be high, though competitive with other locally available or imported pipe
materials. It is expected that both AC and RCP pipe which comprise the bulk
of the project will escalate at the same rate as projected on the basis of
international trade.
27.       Most of the items in the project are manufactured in Pakistan.
Important exceptions are stainless steel screens, well casings, submersible
pumps, sewage pumps and vehicles. All major procurement and civil works
contracts except on surface drainage works, rehabilitation of pipelines
and house connections would be by international competitive bidding, in
accordance with the latest Bank/IDA "rGuidelines for Procurement." A margin
of preference up to 15% or customs duty, whichever is lower, will be granted
to local manufacturers. No preference is proposed or requested for civil
works contractors. No interest was shown by foreign civil works contrac-
tors in the Phase I project, and the situation is expected to be the same
in the Phase II project. Assistance to the civil works construction contract-
ing industry is proposed by the import of a drilling rig, heavy duty tractor,
crane and excavating machinery so that the proposed construction program
can be completed on schedule. Provision will be made in the respective bid
documents for the prepayment of these items and recovery from the bidder.
The use of machinery is justified in the laying of large diameter sewer
pipelines because labor intensive methods are slow and dangerous and the
quality of work, especially in making pipe joints, is sometimes below
standard. Often pipes are visibly damaged because of mishandling. The
drilling rig is needed because pump housings may have to be provided down
to depths of over 300 feet and local drilling contractors are unable to
obtain the needed equipment themselves. Similar assistance is proposed for
the supply of high tensile wire and steel plate in the manufacture of large
diameter RCP Pipe. WASA has scheduled the proposed contract numbers for
the water supply sewerage and drainage project construction components. Fol-
lowing final design they will be grouped together in such a manner as to be
attractive for International Competitive Bidding.



ANNEX 1
Page 13
28.       WASA's Managing Director assisted by the Deputy Managing Director,
Operations and Deputy Managing Director, Engineering will be responsible
for carrying out both the Water Supply and the Sewerage and Drainage parts
of the project. It is expected that LITWW's Project Director who was the
Director of Construction of the Phase I project will be appointed the Man-
aging Director. The Deputy Managing Director, Operations will be the Proj-
ect Coordinator and ensure attainment of all the project objectives, espe-
cially in the matter of achieving the important technical and financial
standards needed for proceeding with Phase III of the new Master Plan with-
out further expatriate technical assistance. The Deputy Managing Director
(Design and Construction) will be responsible for project construction.
29.       The Design and Construction Directorates will require strength-
ening, as in recent years they have been working at about one-third the
capacity that will be needed for the Phase II project. In the category
of Senior technical staff five Deputy Directors and ten Additional Deputy
Directors are needed. Temporarily five surveyors, four draftsmen, supporting
clerical staff and a large number of other staff need to be recruited. Though
a number of such qualified men are leaving the country, the Project Director
gave assurances that competent engineers can be recruited from within
Pakistan and expatriate engineers would not be required.
30.       The acquisition of land for the construction of tubewells and
pumphouses is not expected to be difficult though special attention is
needed to complete early acquisition and prevent encroachments which may be
difficult to remove. The maximum time needed for acquisition is about six
months. As most of the pipelines will be laid in existing roads, no dif-
ficulties are anticipated in obtaining wayleaves. No other special con-
struction problems are expected and with the 12 man-months of assistance
by consultants to be provided under the UNDP Project, it is expected that the
proposed three-year construction program will be implemented on schedule.
About 10% of the project costs are expected to be disbursed in the fourth
year, in the payment of retention monies during the maintenance period and
completion of minor works in leakage repairs and house connections.
31.       In order to expedite the work on house connections, the Construc-
tion Directorate and Finance Directorate, through the Operations Directorate,
will commence work on providing the necessary fittings and make the house
connections immediately following the testing of the pipelines. The Deputy
Managing Director, Operations will coordinate this important activity and
ensure that the target number of connections both on water supply and
sewerage is achieved.
Consultants
32.       There is provision for advisory services by engineering consult-
ants in the project for detail design, specialist studies and construction



ANNEX 1
Page 14
supervision of approximately 50 man months financed by the UNDP. There is
also provision for a management team in the project on engineering manage-
ment, finance, leak detection, operation and maintenance of water and sewer
systems and training totalling approximately 15 man years financed by ODM.
Neither of these provide for ccontingencies either of foreign or local costs
and the ODM assistance does not' provide for housing and transport facilities.
Provision for the purchase of air conditioners and vehicle running costs
estimated at PRs 3,200,000 are provided under consultants services in the
project, as follows:
PRs
20% Contingencies on UNDP Project                1,000,000
20%     "          "  ODM team                   1,800,000
Air conditioning - 10 units                        100,000
Running Costs for vehicles                         300,000
3,200,000
E. TRAINING
33.       The principal training objective of the project is for WASA to
achieve internal competency for implementing the revised Master Plan and
provide Lahore with a safe water supply. For meeting this objective the
following subsidiary objectives are proposed by the Managing Director designee
for WASA:
(i) WASA will follow personnel policies that will be no
less attractive than those of other public utility
authorities (like WAPDA) in attracting and keeping
qualified staff capable of benefitting from training.
(ii) A continuous training program will be developed and
implemented to sustain the levels of competence needed.
(iii)  An annual evaluation report on the training program will
be prepared with each training budget by the Deputy
Managing Director (Operations).
34.       Except for a few WASA engineers and some accountants who benefit-
ted from training on the job by working with consultants in revising the
Master Plan, most of the more senior positions are held by seconded engi-
neers trained by PhED who have Little interest in WASA. Most of the junior
positions are held by untrained staff. This came about because service
conditions and benefits in WASA are worse than those of PHED or other public
utility authorities like WAPDA. With the upgrading of the Managing Direc-
tor's post it is expected that there will be a general improvement in per-
sonnel policies and better qualified and trainable staff will be attracted to



ANNEX 1
Page 15
WASA. The seconded engineers can then return to the PHED which is unable
to cope with its own workload and only releases them to WASA at present
with some reluctance, often withdrawing them at short notice.
Present Position
35.       The numbers of staff requiring training are shown below:

36.       The Assistant Director (Personnel and Training) is normally re-
sponsible for train;ing but does not have a well thought out comprehensive
program.  Some meager ad hoc efforts, were:
1)   A Senior Engineer was trained for three months at the
Institute of Public Administration.
2)   For about one year in 1973/74, newly recruited tubewell
drivers were given instruction.
3)   A contract was made with the Labor Department for
training electricians, mechanics and other tradesmen
but was not implemented for lack of funds, space and
instructors.
Training Programs
37.       The Directorates of Finance, Planning, Design, Construction and
Operations have prepared outline training programs for training staff in their
respective Directorates. These programs would be incorporated into an overall
program for WASA.



ANNEX 1
Page 16
Training Methods
38.       Four methods are proposed:
1)   Overseas training
2)   Institutional training in Pakistan
3)   On-the-job training
4)   Classroom training
39.       Overseas training is expected to be limited to specialized areas
in public utility operations which are not available in Pakistan. Six UNDP
fellowships each of six months duration and two study tours of one month
duration are provided in the areas of finance, administrative management,
engineering operations, construction engineering and preventive maintenance.
The Government is expected to provide overseas training through bi-lateral
assistance for advanced studies in groundwater hydrology and public health
engineering.
40.       Institutional training in Lahore is expected to be mainly in the
form of assistance to junior accounting and engineering staff to obtain
higher qualifications. The assistance will be in time-off for following
evening classes or for financial assistance with correspondence courses.
Short-term and long-term refresher courses in the Engineering University
and the Institute of Public Administration can be arranged and the needs
will be identified during the project period.
41.       On-the-job training has proved to be fairly successful when train-
able WASA counterpart staff were given an opportunity to work with consult-
ants on the review of the Master Plan. Very great emphasis will be placed
on this training method during the Phase II project. The following cate-
gories of counterpart staff will be appointed by WASA to work with the engi-
neering and management consultants.
(a) Senior counterpart staff to receive on-the-iob training from
engineering consultants
Hydrologists - 2
Tubewell construction specialists - 2
Detailed/Design Supervision of Construction Engineers - 15
Specialist Engineers, Leak Detection - 4
Deputy Managing Directors (Design and Construction) - 2
(b)  Senior counterpart staff to receive on-the-job training from
ODM Management team
Management Director - 1
Deputy Managing Director (Operations) - 1
Deputy Managing Director (Finance and Administration) - 1
Directors, Operation and Finance - 4
Specialist Engineers, Leak Detection - 4
Procurement and Stores Officers - 2



ANNEX 1
Page 17
42.       These counterpart staff will in turn provide on-the-job training
to the junior technical staff which will be supplemented by continuing class
room and field training where necessary. Classroom facilities with
bed and board for training 20 residential staff at a time, are provided in
the project on the assumption that each officer requires an average of two
weeks classroom training in each year for three years to make him reasonably
competent. About 400 officers representing most of WASA's junior opera-
tional staff can be given classroom training. The content of the training
is to be based upon the advice of the engineering consultants, and the ODM
team assisted by the National Water Council. All senior WASA staff will be
obliged to give classroom training as part of their normal professional
duties as would the ODM management team aided by other competent outside
lecturers as may be needed. The classroom facilities are to be completed
by the end of 1976.
Training Management and Budget
43.       Training management is the responsibility of the Deputy Managing
Director (Operations) (DMDO) assisted by the Director (Personnel and Train-
ing). DMDO will prepare the detailed training program in consultation with
the engineering consultants, the ODM management team and the advice of the
National Water Council of the UK and following IDA approval, prepare the
training budget, obtain required approval for training expenditures and arrange
for the recruitment and planned release of qualified staff to undertake the
training. Personnel management policies are to be so made that adequate
incentives are given to trained and competent staff. Incompetent or untrain-
able staff with tenure are to be found suitable employment in other Govern-
ment Departments or premzturely retired. The Trade Union will be involved
in the staff development programs and the employment of seconded engineers
is to be discontinued by 1979.
Training Evaluation
44.       Training is to be continuous until such time as only competent
staff remain with WASA and the current brain drain becomes less. The DMDO
will prepare a comprehensive report on the achievements of each year's
training effort for review by WASA and IDA and an assessment will be made by
the Managing Director of progress in WASA's capability for operating and
maintaining the Phase II project and for planning, designing and constructing
a Phase III project. Any minor shortcomings will be rectified by WASA as
they occur and major shortcomings involving budget increases will be rectified
in the following year. A quantitative assessment will be made at the end
of the project period based upon the value of the training program in increased
staff performance e.g., number of tubewell pump failures, implementation
of preventive maintenance, reduction of leaks etc.

Management Audit
48.       The LDA has a powerful board with a capacity for making decisions
and getting things done. However, it is a new body and its performance in
managing the water supply, sewerage and drainage services on public utility
lines will require to be monitored during the project period and evaluated
at the end of the project by a management audit. The following three key
indicators are proposed for monitoring LDA's performance (1) completion of
the Phase II project on schedule (2) achievement of a satisfactory level of
internal cash generation by WASA and (3) achievement by WASA of internal
capability for continuing work on the master plan. The management audit
should be a critical appraisal and review going beyond the everyday data
of management accounting into an overall examination of the executive pro-
cess in action. It should cover the extent and effectiveness of the pattern
of delegation, the channels of communication, the harmony of coordination,
the adequacy or otherwise of tools of planning and control, the skill in
the usage of management data as a guide to remedial decision, and, in
general, the competence of LDA's executive, supervisory and specialist
teams dealing with WASA.

APPRAISAL OF THE
LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT - PHASE II
Description of the Project - Sewerage and Drainage
A. INTRODUCTION
1.        The primary objectives of the sewerage and drainage components
of the project form part of the overall Phase II project objectives de-
scribed in para 3.03 of the main report. The existing facilities - sewerage
and drainage are described in Annex 7. The consultants have prepared a
revised Master Plan for a ten-year period ending 1986 and have recommended
a three year investment program for sewerage which WASA has decided to al-
most fully implement because of the prevalent insanitary conditions in the
poorer areas of the city. The consultants' proposals on drainage in the
recommended program has however been substantially reduced due to the
financial constraints.
2.        The physical components of the project are:
(i) Trunk Sewers. Some 17 miles of trunk sewers of 21 inches
up to 78 inches will be laid.
(ii) Collectors Sewers. Some 285 miles of collectors sewers
are to be laid in sizes from 9 inches up to 18 inches.
(iii) Pumping Stations. Four new pumping stations will be
erected. These will include Shad Bagh with 40 cfs
initially, Nawankot with 90 cfs initially, Multan Road
with 50 cfs initially, and Shahdara with 25 cfs
initially. The capacity of the Main Outfall pumping
station with be increased by replacing 5 pumps with an
80 cfs capacity by 3 pumps with a 90 cfs capacity.
(iv) Sewage Treatment. A prototype sewage stabilization pond
is proposed to treat sewage from Shad Bagh on 75 acres of
land, including an environmental study of the Ravi River
and the use of sewage effluent for crop irrigation.
(v) Vehicles, Equipment, Housing, Offices and Training Facilities.
Four motorcycles, two cars, one truck and half the cost of
the workshop truck are included for project supervision and
operations. Spare parts and tools for a planned preventive
maintenance program have been included along with half the



ANNEX 2
PAge 2
cost of the radio communication and accounting equipment.
Half of the cost of offices, housing and training facilities
is also included.
(vi) Drainage. Work on primary channels is presently in
progress as part of the immediate works program. The
project includes 21 miles of new and rehabilitated
secondary drainage channels.
B.  DESIGN
House Connections
3.        WASA has no policy on sewer house connections.  The project in-
cludes an investigation of making low cost sewer house connections and
connections for collecting sullage water as part of the works in the second-
ary sewerage network especially in the poorer neighborhoods where high
density housing will make it feasible for one connection to serve more than
one property. The present practice is to use six inches diameter concrete
pipes per house sewer connection because material other than sanitary sew-
age put into the sewers is thought to be the cause of frequent blockages.
The feasibility of using less costly four inches diameter sewer pipes per
house connections will also be studied. The average cost of a single house
connection is now estimated by the consultant to be PRs 1,765 and the inves-
tigation will seek less costly alternatives for the Phase II project.
Design Flows
4.        Based upon the preliminary design criteria, (discussed in Annex 8,
page 16) sanitary flows have been calculated at various points throughout
each sewerage district, in order to tentatively size trunk sewers, pumping
stations and waste disposal facilities.
Design Velocities
5.        The consultants have recommended that minimum velocities in the
sewers flowing full or half full should be 2-1/2 feet per second which may
be lowered to 2 feet per second if fall is not economically available provided
adequate maintenance arrangements we made. For the larger sewers, wherever
fall is available they consider that overall economies may be possible with
higher velocities and reduction in sewer diameters if the discounted operating
costs of sewage pumping are included, though pumping stations will be deeper.
This will be studied further during detailed design for some of the major
trunk sewers and pumping stations in the project.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Design of Sewer Layout
6.        Sewers already constructed are substantially as recommended in
the 1969 Master Plan. This is basically a radial pattern of independent
systems and the consultants recommended the continuation of this concept
because: (a) proposed future treatment is in lagoons, which have a negli-
gible economy of scale, (b) the natural fall is from the scarp in the north
east towards the river and (c) to combine the several drainage areas would
require a large and deep intercepting sewer and a very large pumping station,
with high capital and operating costs.
7.        The existing general pattern of sewers has been maintained in the
preliminary design. The main trunk sewers have been left to follow the
natural drainage, where this drainage is apparent, and to discharge on the
periphery of the city into the Ravi River on the north and west. With the
type of sewage treatment planned there is no significant saving in cost of
construction or operation of one large treatment works in place of several
with a combined capacity equal to the larger one. There are advantages in
having sewers discharging at points where, following treatment, the effluent
can be used for irrigation or ground water recharge if found feasible.
8.        In those areas in which street patterns and trunk sewers exist
the proposed sewers are to be laid as parallel sewers.  In areas where there
are no sewers, it is proposed to follow existing streets, and where no
streets are presently existing or planned, assumptions as to a future sewer
pattern have been made. During the final design of the sewers, the layout
pattern may be changed to satisfy new street patterns, or to overcome prob-
lems which may be encountered in the field. In the Northeast Sewerage
District three alternatives which involved the layout and sizing of the
outfall sewer and the location of the pumping station were studied in se-
lecting the alternative with the least cost recommended in the revised
Master Plan.  The existing layout and proposed sewers for the Phase II proj-
ect are shown in IBRD Map 11214.   Trunk sewers varying in diameter between
78 inches and 21 inches are proposed to be laid as follows. The base line
cost estimate is calculated for January 1976.

9.        Collector sewers are proposed for construction in the (1) Northern,
(2) Central, (3) South Civil Lines, (4) South West, and (5) Shadara sewerage
districts mostly in areas of poor sanitation and where minor flooding presents
a health hazard. The localities are generally (1) Ramgarh, Moghulpura, Shad
Bagh and Waranpura (2) MIartafa Abad area (3) Fata Sher Road, Rasool Park,
Bagh Gul Begum, Nanoun Kul and Pakki Thatthi (4) 1600 Acres Scheme, Rawan,
Multan Road and some areas of Ichara and (5) Shadara town.  These locali-
ties will be identified in greater accuracy during detailed design.  The
diameters of the sewers vary from 18 inches to 9 inches and the lengths
to be laid are approximately as follows:

TOTAL             1,427       149     873       405         53.6
The lengths of pipes to be laid were calculated after surveys
of typical areas in varying income groups and an assumption that about
half the streets in each locality would be provided with sewers in this
project. This matter requires further study during detailed design in
order to maximize the number of house connections in the project.
Pumping Stations
It is proposed that, in each of the sewerage districts, the
sewage will be conveyed in the trunk sewers to a pumping station where the
sewage will be pumped to the disposal facilities. New stations will be
required for each of the districts, and a brief description of those pro-
vided in the Phase II project, is given below:
(a)  Northern Sewerage District
The sewage from this district will all be directed to
the Shad Bagh Pumping Station. The existing facility
is an austere structure, with one 10-cfs and three
20-cfs pumps. There is insufficient room within this
structure to install additional pumps or space for
larger pumps. It is proposed that a new pump house be
constructed adjacent to the existing pumping station
during Phase II to provide additional pumping capacity.
The new pump house should be able to house pumps with a
capacity of 180 cfs. The existing pump station and
pumps are to be retained. Pumping capacity of 40 cfs
is proposed for installation during Phase II; with an
additional 40 cfs and 30 cfs, respectively, being



ANNEX 2
Page 5
installed in the near future. The pumps proposed are
of the vertical shaft centrifugal type, with electric
motors. The possibility of using a more economical
pump system will be investigated during detailed
design. Standby generator capacity is needed in the
event of power failure but due to financial constraints
is not provided in the Phase II project but will be pro-
vided in a future Phase III.
(b) Central Sewerage District
All of the sewage from this district will be directed to
the existing M4ain Outfall Pumping Station. This pumping
station is suitable for the installation of larger capacity
pumps, and it is proposed that during Phase II five of the
existing pumps (three 20 cfs and two 10 cfs) be replaced
with three 30 cfs capacity pumps. The Main Outfall Pumping
Station is the only pumping station within the system which
is not adjacent to the waste disposal facilities. A 66
inch outfall sewer will be required as part of Phase II
to carry the sewage from the pumping station to the dis-
posal facilities, a distance of about 3,000 feet. Alter-
natively a fenced open channel, similar to the existing
sullage carrier is considered to be more economically
feasible by WASA and will be studied during detailed design.
(c) South Civil Lines Sewerage District
It is proposed to build the New Nawankot Sewage Pumping
Station adjacent to the Bund Road, in lieu of expanding the
existing Nawankot Pumping Station, and providing an outfall
sewer. Upon the completion of the new pumping station and
the trunk sewers leading to this pumping station, the
existing Raj Garh and Nawankot Pumping Stations are to be
abandoned because of obsolescence. The new pumping sta-
tion will have an ultimate capacity of 200 cfs, of which
90 cfs will be installed during the Phase II project.
(d) Southwest Sewerage District
A new pumping station at Multan Road is proposed for this
district. To date only a small portion of this district has
sewers, but WASA is presently installing sewers for the 1600
Acre Scheme. A trunk sewer is proposed to connect this area,
and the area presently sewered, to the proposed pumping
station. At present, the proposed southerly extension of the
West Bund Road has not been started, and it will be neces-
sary to construct a small protective bund around this facility
to prevent flooding when the Ravi River overflows. The
pumping station, will have an ultimate capacity of 100
cfs, and it is proposed that pumps with a capacity of
50 cfs be installed in the Phase II project.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
(e) Shahdara Sewerage District
At the present time, no sewage collection and disposal
facilities exist within this district. A new sewage pump-
ing station and sewer network are proposed for this area.
The pumping station is to be constructed to provide room
for 50 cfs of pumping capacity, but only 25 cfs of
pumping capacity is to be installed in the Phase II project.
Proposed Method of Sewage Treatment
11.       The two methods of treatment considered were stabilization ponds
and conventional treatment. Complete conventional treatment was considered
rather than primary or partial conventional treatment because the effluent
from conventional primary treatment or from anaerobic, or first stage,
stabilization ponds would not be satisfactory for irrigation or for dis-
charge to the river for health reasons. The effluent from aerobic stabili-
zation ponds would be satisfactory for such use or discharge, considering
local conditions. Complete conventional treatment would be needed in order
to produce an effluent comparable to that of aerobic stabilization ponds.
A prototype waste stabilization pond of about 75 acres in area is provided
for the treatment of sewage from Shad Bagh. About 200 acres of land, out
of the estimated 470 acres required for treating ultimate flows will now
be acquired for this purpose. If the prototype treatment plant is success-
ful the sewage from the other pumping stations will be similarly treated
in future projects, subject to the findings of the environmental study
discussed in Annex 8.
12.       The densely populated Central Sewerage District with an estimated
ultimate population of about 1,200,000 persons having a population density
of 126 persons/acre and an average daily flow of 63 IMgd was chosen for
making a cost comparison between conventional treatment and waste stabili-
zation ponds. Because of the more sophisticated nature of the maintenance
that would be needed for treatment with the activated sludge process and
the difficulties anticipated in keeping out industrial wastes, a biological
trickling filter treatment plant similar to the two 20 IMgd plants at Karachi
was selected as the most feasible method of conventional treatment. A trick-
ling filter sewage treatment plant located on 300 acres of land with grit
removal and screening, primary sedimentation, trickling filters, secondary
sedimentation, recirculation, sludge pumping, sludge digestion, sludge drying
beds, laboratory facilities, garage, shops and yard piping is estimated to
cost about PRs 227 million. In comparison a three stage waste stabilization
pond system located on 850 acres of land is estimated to cost only PRs 33
million. As the cost of operation and maintenance of the stabilization pond
system would be proportionately lower, an economic comparison is not needed.
An inspection of the two Karachi plants showed that despite training, the
skills to operate and maintain a trickling filter plant on a long term
basis are not available at this time and therefore maintenance costs of
operating of a trickling filter plant would also include costly expatriate
assistance.



ANNEX 2

13.       It is unusual to find that stabilization ponds are cheaper than
other methods of sewage treatment for large cities because of high land
costs. In Lahore, land is available at a relatively cheap price outside
the bund, in the Ravi River flood plain. Because it is susceptible to
flooding this land cannot be developed for housing or industrial purposes,
without costly protection work, but is suitable for waste stabilization ponds.
The advantages of stabilization ponds over other methods of treatment may
be summarized as follows:
(i) Cost. Both construction cost and operating cost
are cheaper than for other methods which provide
comparable treatment.
(ii) Ease of Operation. This treatment system requires very
much less operating competence, as the process is very
simple.
(iii) Mechanical Equipment. Very little mechanical equipment
is required for this process, and no imported equipment.
(iv) Decentralization. Contrary to other methods of treatment,
the construction and operation of a treatment works at
each of the present sewer outlets is economically feasible.
There is no significant saving in the construction of one
large stabilization pond works rather than a number of
smaller ones. The cost of conducting all the sewage to
one or two points is, therefore, saved and other advan-
tages of dispersal maintained.
(v) Redundancy. The land acquired for the stabilization ponds
can be put to other use if more economical treatment methods
are found to be feasibile in future.
Design Criteria
14.       Based upon 100 composite samples collected by the University of
Engineering and Technology, 20 grab samples taken by CDM and with reference
to experience reported in India, the consultants have assumed a per capita
BOD5 of 0.13 lbs. for those portions of Lahore that will be served by the
sewerage system. This allows about 0.1 lbs. per capita for the domestic
contribution and an additional 30% for commercial and industrial con-
tributions which at a sewage flow of 53 gcd (see Annex 8, para 36) repre-
sents a loading of 245 ppm BOD5 (153 lbs. per 100 cu. ft.). Many of the
larger industries of Lahore are not presently connected and pretreatment
will be conditional to future connections.
15.       The consultants have recommended a three-stage pond system consist-
ing of anaerobic, facultative and aerobic ponds. The tentative design load-
ings and detention times are 45 lbs. BODs per 1000 cu ft and 3.9 days deten-
tion time for the anaerobic pond, 200 lbs. BOD5 per acre per day with a deten-
tion time of 10 days for the facultative pond and a 120 lbs. BOD5 per acre/day



ANNEX 2
Page 8
with 2.2 days detention time for the aerobic pond. The anaerobic ponds
are 10 to 15 feet deep and a loss in volume of 30% in two years is assumed.
The other ponds are assumed to be 4 feet deep and unlike the anaerobic ponds
are not expected to require protection from flooding. These criteria will
be reviewed on the basis of the environmental studies and future planning
on groundwater replenishment included in the Phase II project (see para 11
Annex 7).
Area and Location of Stabilization Ponds
16.       There will be a waste stabilization pond associated with each
of the seven sewage pumping stations. In most cases these ponds will be
located outside the Bund Road, where land costs are much lower. It is
recommended by the consultants that initially one prototype stabilization
pond be designed and constructed. The proposed prototype works will more
precisely determine proper loadings and design details for both the
anaerobic and aerobic ponds. The advantage of recirculation and multiple
inlets could also be considered for the prototype works. The replenish-
ment of groundwater which occurs by natural seepage from the treatment
works will be monitored so that the construction of experimental dosed,
spreading basins for deliberate groundwater replenishment with the efflu-
ent from the prototype treatment works, can be considered. The prototype
treatment works is proposed to be constructed across the bund from the
Shad Bagh sewage pumping station. Of the estimated total land area require-
ment of 470 acres, 200 acres are to be purchased now and the prototype built
on about 75 acres in the Phase II project. Because of the difficulties of
resettling farmers and for reasons of financial constraint, the Government
does not wish to purchase more land than absolutely required at this time.
Vehicles, Equipment, Housing, Offices and Training Facilities
17.       The cost of four motorcycles, two staff cars, one truck and a
half share in the workshop truck, have been included in the sewerage proj-
ect for project supervision and operations. M4aintenance spares, tools and
equipment have also been included in order to facilitate the implementation
of a proper preventative maintenance program. Half of the cost of communi-
cation and accounting equipment and furniture has been included in the
sewerage project costs. The need for housing, offices and training facili-
ties is detailed in para 22 of Annex 1 and 50% of the cost of these facili-
ties has been included in the sewerage and drainage part of the project.
C. CONSTRUCTION
Cost Estimates
18.       The construction cost estimates were prepared in a manner similar
to that for water supply discussed in Annex 1 and include the costs of
drainage amounting to PRs 13.3 million, about 3% of the total project cost.
The combined sewerage and drainage costs appear on page 11.



ANNEX 2
Page 9
19.       Other matters relating to construction, training and project im-
plementation are detailed in Annex 1 Sections D, E and F on the water sup-
ply component of the project and are equally applicable to the sewerage
and drainage component of the project.
D. STORM DRAINAGE
20.       WASA has in recent years carried out some work on the main chan-
nels of the storm drainage system. Primary drains in the Upper Chota
Ravi drainage district have been partly completed and work on the outfall
works is presently in progress. A part of the primary drainage channel in
the Lower Chota Ravi drainage district was completed and the drainage
pumping station was improved in the Phase I project. Work on the remaining
portions of the primary drainage channel is now in progress. The Mian Mir
II primary drainage channel is also being extended in the sections passing
through the Multan Road housing scheme.
21.       The secondary drainage channels have not, however, received equal
attention. Some of the secondary drains need rehabilitation and new sec-
ondary drains are needed in areas where minor flooding now occurs. Some
of the more urgent works in the secondary drainage system are included in
the Phase II project as follows:

22.       With the exception of the Railway Drain which has a cross section
of 10 ft x 5 ft and needs rehabilitation most of the other drains are small
with cross sections of 3 ft x 3 ft and 2-1/2 ft x 2-1/2 ft. It is there-
fore proposed that construction is by local competitive bidding as inter-
national bidders would not find the work to be attractive.

APPRAISAL OF THE
LAHORE WATER SUPPLY SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT-PHASE II
Existing Water Supply Facilities, Water Sources and Hydrology
Brief History
1.        The city of Lahore is :Located on the southeast bank of the Ravi
River, in the northwestern part of the Bari Doab, a roughly rectangular
area between the Ravi and Sutlej Rivers of the Indus Valley. The densely
populated walled city dating from Moghul times is on high ground created
by its own rubble. New urban development is mostly to the south, with
the eastern boundary about 30 miles from the Indian border. A bund extend-
ing from the river eastward to a low scarp at elevation 710 feet above MSL
protects the city from flooding by the river. Except for some recent growth
across the river to the northwest: most of the development over the past two
decades has been roughly in the shape of a triangle tapering down from the
scarp near the Army Cantonment down to the protecting bund. The Chota
Ravi drain loops the north of the city and the Lahore Branch Canal divides
it diagonally. This irrigation canal is supplied from the BRB Link Canal
which conveys water from the Chenab River and crosses the Ravi River through
a syphon about six miles to the niortheast and flows southwards about four miles
to the east of the city. There are numerous agricultural tubewells surround-
ing the city which now depends upon ground water for its water supply.
Water Supply Facilities
2.        Domestic water supplies for the city were first taken from the
river, canals or dug wells. About one hundred years ago a partial public
water supply was obtained for the walled city by excavation of 35 to 40
shallow wells at Badne Bagh in a former course of the Ravi River. The
original water table was at a depth of about 15 ft. In 1930, 1955 and
1962 many more tubewells were installed in central Lahore by several agencies
and in private homes. By 1967 there were about 200 wells, 106 belonging to
the Lahore Municipal Corporation (LMC) and others to government agencies
such as the Army Cantonment and P'akistan Railways. The wells, pipelines
and other appurtenances handed over by LMC to LITWW in 1967, additions made
up to the end of June 1972 under the Phase I project, and new facilities
added by LITWW and the Province between June 1972 and June 1975 are listed
below and the major components are shown in IBRD Map 11913.

Pumping Installations
3.        The condition of WASA mechanical and electrical plant is generally
poor, much below the standard expected for well operated and reliable equip-
ment of this type. Problems exist with major items of equipment, as noted
below:
(a) An analysis of 34 pumping tests performed in 1974
has shown that 26 of the 34 pumps tested (over 75%
had deteriorated well beyond the point where repairs
were required).



ANNEX 6
Page 3
(b) Records of the Motor Repair Shop indicated that
approximately 40 vertical turbine pump motors
(approximately 40% of the total number currently
in operation) are rewound annually.
(c) Virtually none of the 13 gas engines previously
installed at tubewell sites is presently capable
of operation at rated speed.
(d) An excessive number of problems occur with motor
starters (of 22 air-gap starters installed on
4 cfs tubewells, 8 are currently inoperative).
(e) It has been observed during tubewell inspection
that pumpset vibration and packing gland leakage
are generally excessive.
Meters for Tubewells
4.        WASA does not know how much water it produces, or for what
purpose the water is used. This lack of knowledge is because there are
no meters on the tubewells. The consultants have designed a low cost by-
pass meter for installation on tubewells which could be quickly made
locally. Evidence has been obtained from tests that such meters are rea-
sonably accurate and capable of maintenance in the WASA metershop. The
metering of all tubewells is given priority in the Phase II project.
Wastage
5.        Reports on the first 15 days of a wastage survey were that one
or two percent of the premises in the walled city were found to have no
valve or faucet on the water pipe so that water ran continuously in these
premises whenever there was water in WASA's distribution pipes. An
estimated fifty percent of the premises were found to have leaking water
taps, and almost an equal number had leaking service lines. Observations
were made of public use of public standpipes and the consultants estimate
that wastage amounts to 30% of water used. A public education program is
included in the project to reduce wastage. WASA staff require training
and management assistance on the maintenance of public standposts and
similar services.
6.        It is current practice of WASA to authorize service connections
which are installed by private licensed plumbers which consist simply of
a "ferrule", usually a 1/2" bend connected to the top of the distribution
pipe, and a short piece of flexible pipe for connection to the customer's
service pipe. The quality of materials used and standard of plumbing is
not supervised by WASA. A "Plumbing Code" and much stricter supervision
of plumbers is provided in the Phase II project to reduce leakage from



ANNEX 6
Page 4
improperly installed plumbing and service connections. This should be
complemented with the laying of water tight water mains and pipelines by
training of staff in design and supervision of construction.
Leakage
7.        Unaccounted for water including lost water, municipal use wastage
and leakage is estimated by the consultants to be around 63% at the present
time. Because of the lack of data these cannot be separated quantatively.
The proportion of leakage is judged to be a substantial proportion of the
unaccounted for water because of the low standard of supervision, workman-
ship in pipe-laying, making of service connections and repairs of mains
leaks. The Phase II project includes a leakage survey, repair of leaks
and training to improve standards in the construction, operation and
maintenance of the Lahore water distribution system with the objective
of reducing unaccounted for water to about 45% by 1980.
Meter Maintenance
8.        During eleven months in 1974, a total of 1,474 1/2-in and 3/4 in
meters were repaired and reinstalled in customers' premises, for a projected
annual total of approximately 1,600 meters. It is estimated that approxi-
mately 5,000 meters can be repaired annually in the meter repair shop
(which was built in the Phase I project) without an increase in the present
number of staff of 39 people. By the time that the number of meters which
require repair exceeds 5,000, additional staff will have been trained on
the job by the existing staff, and the capacity of repair facilities will
have been increased. The meter maintenance program is presently adequate
insofar as the competence and capacity to repair meters are concerned and
productivity in the new meter shop is reasonably satisfactory. There are
grave defects in the meter maintenance program itself but here also as in
several similar areas, improvement must await the strengthening of the
supervisory and administrative organization by management assistance to
be provided in the Phase II project.
9.        Aside from a small supply of spares purchased in 1970, for the
Japanese meters purchased at that time, no water meter spare parts are
available for meter repairs. Currently, meters are being repaired with
spare parts salvaged from a rapidly dwindling supply of unserviceable meters.
The consultants have recommended that standardization on two or three water
meter makes be implemented, with purchase of spares to be accomplished
before needs arise. There is provision for the purchase of meters and
spares in the Phase II project.
Chlorinators
10.       The majority of the gas chlorinators and hypochlorinators that are
installed are either not functioning at all or functioning poorly. WASA has



ANNEX 6
Page 5
recently ordered new chlorinators and spare parts for repairing the existing
chlorinators. Chlorination is only practiced in the monsoon season when
negative pressures in the distribution network allows polluted water to be
drawn into the pipelines.
Fire Hydrants
11.       There is no accurate record of the number of fire hydrants in
Lahore. The fire-brigade which is operated by the LMC has arrangements
with WASA to fill its fire pumps and water lorries. Fire hydrants are
included in the Phase II project to be installed in consultation with the
LMC. There is no provision in the system design for additional water for
fire fighting.
Present Water Supply
12.       The water supply of Lahore is presently drawn entirely from ground-
water. The producing tubewells are installed in an area of about 14 square
miles. The average capacity of these wells is about two cfs. Neverthe-
less, the regional drawdown in this part of the city is now over 45 feet in
a small area, over 40 feet in about one-third of a square mile and about
35 feet in one and one half square miles. The ground water level in this
area is falling at the rate of about 3 feet per year and causing increases
in the pumping heads of operating wells and abandonment of wells in which
the water level leaves the pump bowls exposed. The economical long-term
development and conservation of Lahore's water resources for domestic water
supply has become a matter of major concern and the available hydrological
information was studied by the consultants to assist WASA in planning future
action.
Surface Water Sources
13.       Besides ground water there are two possible sources of surface
water which might be used after treatment to supply water to Lahore. One
source is the Lahore Branch Canal and the other is the Ravi River. There
could be four feasible alternative ways of using these surface water sources:
(i) Taking water from the Ravi River above the most
upstream of the city sewage and drainage outlets;
(ii) taking water from the BRB and Lahore Branch Irri-
gation Canal system at Mughalpura where the Lahore
Branch Canal enters the city boundary;
(iii) transferring the Ravi River water to the BRB canal
five miles upstream at the syphon and withdrawing
it at the Lahore Branch at Mughalpura; or



ANNEX 6
Page  6
(iv) withdrawing water from the Lahore Branch at Mughal-
pura but replacing it below the city with treated
sewage effluent.
Ground water Hydrology
14.       For making any comparison between these development alternatives
of surface water with ground water a study was made of the available hydro-
logical data to select the most economic method of utilizing the ground
water resources. Until about 1973, detailed studies of ground water in
the Lahore area had not been made and information about ground water under
Lahore was even less complete than for the rest of the Punjab. No control-
led pumping test has ever been made in Lahore. Pumping tests made in the
Punjab close to Lahore have given quite variable results for permeability
and transmissivity. Data about strata below 500 feet are practically non-
existent, as are data about water quality below this depth.
15.       Based on available data the consultants have attempted to establish
the lateral permeability of the aquifer in the Lahore area. This included the
analysis of short-term drawdown and time recovery measurements from accept-
ance tests of 20 wells constructed by LITWW in 1974 and the consultants con-
clude that average transmissivity may possibly be 50% higher or even 50%
lower than the figure considered most probable - 362,000 US gallons/day/
foot width. Computer studies for forecasting drawdown were made on these
three alternative assumptions. A specific yield of 0.12 was adopted for the
purposes of the computer studies. IBRD consultant, Dr. Spiegel, agrees
with the assumption of specific yield but recommends a transmissivity of
100,000 US gallons/day/foot. The consultants have also recommended pump-
ing tests to clarify some of the major areas of differences between his
recommendations and their findings, including an extended program of field
data collection and analysis by the WASA ground water cell to predict the
long-term availability of ground water for Lahore.
Well Spacing
16.       The actual selection of well spacing was the result of trials,
based on crude calculations of interference effects between wells, together
with the assumption based upon experience in the Phase I project that a
well of 4 cfs capacity could be adopted as a standard design. In the part
of the city in which the most wells have been installed, 84 producing wells
(June 1975) are located in an area of about 14 square miles. This is an
average spacing of approximately 2,000 feet. The average capacity of these
wells is about two cfs. Doubling the pumping rate would be expected roughly
to double the drawdown. Considering the importance of continuing to utilize
groundwater as a water source for Lahore for the very long term, so that a
small regional drawdown of ground water is highly desirable, about 4,000 ft
has been recommended by the consultants as the suggested space between wells.



ANNEX 6
Page 7
This spacing is thought to be large enough so that drawdown of ground water
will be spread over a large area, comparatively small and uniform. The
drawdown will be initially larger in the center of the city near the walled
city than at the edges, but the center will slowly shift away when a more
uniform spacing is achieved with the growth of the city. A total of 175
wells are proposed for construction up to 1986, of which 59 are included
in the project.
17.       Grouping of wells in well centers is not generally recommended
by the consultants. Normally, the spacing of single wells uniformly
throughout the distribution system keeps pipe sizes and drawdown to a
minimum. However, adjacent to areas of high demand at the periphery of
the distribution system, well centers would provide additional water where
it is badly needed. This would minimize the length of transmission piping
which however in this case would not double as distribution piping. The
wells in each well center would interfere with each other and additional
drawdown would result within the group especially if the wells were operated
continuously. Significant additional drawdown among other wells would not
be likely because of the distance of the well centers from the city. Four
such well centers have been planned on the north and western edges of the
city adjacent to areas of high water demand (Annex 1, para 8). Three of
these centers are included in the project.
18.       Local infiltration may be due to rainfall, to irrigation, or to
seepage from canals, drainage channels, sewers or leaking water pipes.
It has been stated in the United States Geological Survey Water Supply
Paper 1608-H that in the Punjab, rainfall infiltrates into the groundwater
reservoir only when the rainfall exceeds about ten to fourteen inches a
year. The amount of rain which will cause recharge in Lahore has not been
established. After consideration and several trials with the computer,
the consultants have assumed a local infiltration from all sources equivalent
to two inches of rain a year. Dr. Spiegel does not agree with this and has
recommended that infiltration is ignored in the drawdown model.
Consultants Forecast of Regional Drawdown
19.       If river recharge and local infiltration are insignificant, and
if average transmissivity is about 50% higher than the figure presently
considered most probable (362,000 US gallons per day per foot width), then
regional drawdown may exceed 130 feet under an area of about five square
miles. Conversely, if average transmissivity is approximately 50% lower
than the value considered most probable, then on the basis of insignificant
river recharge and local infiltration and for the projected pumpage, regional
drawdown under Lahore may by 1986 exceed 270 feet in a small area.



ANNEX 6
Page 8
LITWW's Forecast of Regional Drawdown
20.       Because of the more conservative recomendations of IBRD consul-
tant, Dr. Spiegel, LITWW made parallel studies to forecast regional draw-
down using average transmissivities of 100,000 U.S. gallon/day/foot width,
insignificant river recharge and infiltration, for 10 existing wells, 12
wells to be built shortly and 47 wells to be built under the proposed
Phase II project. The regional drawdown would then exceed 400 feet in
a small area but reduce rapidly to 250 feet at the city boundary. The
preliminary design depths of future wells discussed in Annex 1 are based
upon LITWW's water level contour forecasts and studies of the most econom-
ical depth for wells within Lahore at which transportation of ground water
from outside the city becomes more economical.  Pumping tests will be made
in the Lahore area under the UNDP Project to check these forecasts before
completion of final designs.
Comparison of Water Sources
21.       For the purposes of comparison of water sources, the consultants
assumed pump housing pipes of 250 feet and a total pumping head of 180
feet for wells. An economic comparison is then made of the provision of
a 100 cfs increment of local supply by each of the four alternative
methods of obtaining surface water listed in para 13 and by additional
wells at 4,000 feet centers in Lahore as described above. At discount
rates of 8, 10 and 15%, the least expensive surface supply is seven or
eight times as expensive as ground water. The ground water level would
need to recede to about 350 feet below ground level for the operating costs
of well supplies to equal that of the least expensive surface supply.
Capital costs for ground water would be less than that of surface water
at any practical depth of available ground water in the Lahore area in the
planning period of 1976-86. Should the upcoming pumping tests indicate
that true transmissivities are much lower than assumed, it would become
necessary to further refine these economic studies. If the true transmis-
sivities are found to be greater there will be savings which could be
utilized in extending the network.
Well Fields
22.       On the basis of present assumptions of 4 cfs well capacities and
aquifer coefficients, the consultants compared a 200 cfs capacity well
field situated outside the city with their proposal of wells situated at
4,000 feet centers in Lahore. At discount rates of 8, 10 and 15%, water
levels in Lahore will have to drop to 322, 393 or 578 feet to justify the
well field. To justify a 100 cfs ground water transportation scheme from
a well field at a distance of about six miles to the north of Lahore, and
using the same discount rates, water levels in Lahore will have to drop to
396, 482 or 706 feet. The present studies, therefore, indicate that plan-
ning for 1976-86 should be contingent upon ground water levels being kept



ANNEX 6
Page 9
from dropping to around 322 feet within Lahore for as long as possible to
achieve a least cost solution in developing ground water. This objective
should be continuously reviewed with the collection of new data and further
analysis, commencing with the pumping tests included in the Phase II project.

APPRAISAL OF THE
LAHORE WATER SUPPLY. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT - PHASE II
Existing Facilities - Sewerage and Drainage
A. SEWERAGE
Brief History
1.        With the introduction of piped water supply about one hundred
years ago, a simple open drainage system for "sullage water" was intro-
duced in Lahore. Sullage water is defined as waste water from conser-
vancy latrines, kitchens and bathrooms excluding solid fecal matter. Work upon
the first sanitary sewer system, designed by the Public Works Department
commenced in 1937 and covered the Civil Lines Districts and some areas
to the north of the walled city. By 1967 there were 12 independent
sanitary sewer systems having a combined length of about 100 miles which
were handed over by the LMC to the LITWW. The original open drainage
system coveying sullage water was, over the years, connected to the
sanitary sewers. Under the Phase I project about 5 miles of main sewers
adn 28 miles of branch sewers have been constructed. Some of these sewers
formed missing links in the old system, others provided sewerage service
to the north and west of the city which was previously unsewered. The
existing pumping facilities were repaired and seven new pumps were supplied.
Sewered Areas
2.        There are no accurate records of the existing sewers or of the
number of house connections. Existing trunk sewers are shown, as accu-
rately as could be determined, on IBRD Map ;1914. The consultants estimate
that approximately one-quarter to one-thrid of the houses are directly
connected to the sanitary sewers. The majority of premises receive
sewer service by open drains of sullage water, and in some cases sewage,
to street gratings and to holes in the side of man-holes. The fecal
material from these houses is dumped into roadside "filth depots"
from which it is collected together with other refuse by LMC and dumped
in selected sites to the south side of the city. LMC workers often dump
refuse into the open drains, storm drainage channels or into sanitary sewer
man-holes causing serious obstruction to flows. In a substantial part of
the city estimated at thrity-five square miles, containing a population of
over 1,000,000, a large majority of the houses do not have water flush
latrines. Usually these houses are on small plots and the length of streets



ANNEX 7
Page 2
and lanes in such an area is relatively greater than in the rest of the
city. In three such areas surveyed, about 30% of the houses were connected
when the sewers were built in 1967 or before. These were located in the
street directly in front of the house and are called "Old Sewers". Data
from this survey which included "New Sewers" completed three years ago
are given below:

3.        In most such areas in which sanitary sewers have been installed,
about half or less of the streets or lanes have sanitary sewers. As des-
cribed above, the lanes without sanitary sewers, and even some of the
streets with sanitary sewers, have small drains for sullage and other dirty
water coming from the houses. The drains generally discharge into the
sanitary sewer at a street corner through a grating. These street drains
also carry some storm water into the sewers after rain. Such houses,
which have no water flush latrines, do not have a direct connection to
the sanitary sewer and are served indirectly through the sullage drains.
Sewerage Districts
4.        Lahore has a conventional system of collector sewers, leading to
trunk sewers flowing by gravity to pumping stations, which lift the collected
sewage into earth channels called "sullage carriers" either for irrigation
or discharge to the Ravi River. The trunk sewers follow the natural slope
of the ground and discharge at five outlets, one to the north and four to
the west of the city. There are five existing sewer districts. A new
sewerage district, Shadhara should be added because piped water service
is now provided and there is an urgent need for facilities to carry away
the waste water. Also, an existing sub-district is expected to develop
into a separate sewerage district in the future.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
5.        The 1969 Master Plan recommended that "partially combined"
sewers continue to be used in the part of the city now having them, but
that the rest of the city have separate systems of sanitary and stormwater
sewers. The consultants studied the feasibility of constructing "partially
combined" sewers, making them large enough to carry storm flows and light
rains of frequent occurrence. It is found that the large additional cost
of this type of system would not provide appreciable additional benefits.
Most dwellings in Lahore produce dirty "sullage" water, which is conducted
in surface drains to the street corner and then discharged into the sanitary
sewer, or into open ponds scattered throughout the city. Over a million
people mostly in the lower income brackets are estimated to use such a
system of sewage disposal, though most of them do not have a sewer in the
street directly in front of their homes. The expense of constructing the
necessary sanitary sewers and making the necessary connections, including
plumbing changes in the houses, required to convert these areas to complete-
ly separate sanitary sewers cannot be justified at present. As the waste-
water presents a health hazard, the consultants recommend that the present
combination of open sullage drains and underground sanitary sewers should
be continued in these areas. The sullage water drains will also carry some
storm water runoff after a rain and the system will therefore work as a
"lpartially combined" sewer system. In other areas of the city, where every
house is connected to the sanitary sewers, it is customary to drain roofs
and paved areas of the compound to the sanitary sewer, so that these areas
also have "partially combined" sewers. The drainage in a number of areas
was recently improved by connecting standing pools of water to the sanitary
sewer. There are, in most parts of Lahore, no local collectors for storm
water runoff. This use of the sanitary sewers enables the postponement
of the construction of storm water collectors and provides for the most
efficient use of the sanitary sewers.
6.        The temporary use of the sanitary sewers as local collectors
of stormwater has two principal disadvantages:
(a) It will not carry away rain water runoff very rapidly
unless the sanitary sewers are very much enlarged,
which is not the intention. Some local flooding will,
therefore, occur after a heavy rain. Lahore, however,
is flat, and the concentration of rainwater runoff in
a small area where it would cause serious property damage
generally does not occur. Considering the paucity of rain
and the infrequent rainstorms, little property damage will
occur, but there will be considerable inconvenience
during one month of each year at the peak of the
monsoon as some hours will elapse before the storm-
waters are all carried away.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
(b) the storm water which pools in the streets and open ponds
after a heavy rain is mixed with sewage, and is a health
hazard, but the use of "partially combined" sewers will
reduce this somewhat. In the areas with the greatest
density of population sullage water sometimes containing
sewage often overflows in the streets, and the people
already live with this hazard.
7.        Except in those areas such as the walled city in which, because
of congestion, it is not practicable to lay both sewers and storm drains,
the consultants recommend that the new sewers for Lahore should be designed
only for peak sanitary sewage flows, plus allowances for industrial waste-
waters and infiltration where applicable, but with no additional allowance
for storm water flows. In actual practice, these sewers would operate on
a "*partially combined" basis, using excess capacity during early years and
and off-peak hours to gradually carry away accumulations of rainwater
until it becomes feasible to build storm water collectors to carry away
all of the rainwater.
Sewage Disposal
8.        The present practice of sewage disposal consists of collecting
sewage and sullage water into reinforced concrete tanks at sewage disposal
stations. After removal of floating matter and coarse screening, the sewage
is pumped into "sullage carriers" leading to irrigable land for growing
food crops. Surplus quantities are discharged into storm water channels
which flow into the Ravi river. In times of flood, all of the sewage is
discharged into the river. Sewage is currently disposed of in this manner
at six points and about half is used for irrigation as shown below.

ANNEX 7
Page 5
9.        The amount of sewage used for irrigation purposes varies from
station to station, and with the season. If there are no crops needing
water, or after rain, relatively little sewage goes on the land and most
goes to the river directly. At Shad Bagh, the sewage is available at a
low level only, and little is used at any time. Principal crops in order
of acres irrigated are:
Shad Bagh      -    Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, cabbage, peas
onion, carrots, radish (mooli).
Bhogiwal       -    Summer - radish, pothery, onion, garlic, lady
finger, karala, rams, pumpkins, potatoes, cucumber.
General        -    Winter - cabbage, potatoes, coriander, cauliflower,
onion, radish, pothery, turnip, salad, fenageek.
Environmental Studies
10.       Considering the vegetables which are irrigated with sewage, this
irrigation may cause infection and disease both to the farmers and users
of the crops. There are no records available on the level of infection
or the economic loss to the community. Though most vegetables are cooked
in the form of curries, intestinal diseases are reported to be widespread
among the poor people. The Ravi River in its course towards the sea below
Lahore is used as a source for canal water in a number of places. Though
ground water is widely used, small numbers of people use canal water for
bathing and drinking. As the water is part Lahore sewage, this use could
cause injury to health. At present, the proportion of sewage in the river
is usually small and probably has never exceeded one-sixth of the low flow.
This proportion is, however, expected to increase because (1) the low flow
of the river is unlikely to increase and may even decrease and (2) the amount
of sewage discharged by the city will increase. This will tend to decrease
the natural purification now occuring in the river. The Phase II project
provides for setting up an environmental studies program including a study
of the river to collect and analyze data for future planning. A matter
to be studied first will be the feasibility of advising the public to
wash vegetables before use and initiating some control over the crops
grown with sewage.
11.       The sewage of Lahore is already a valuable resource in a location
with a shortage of cheap irrigation water. In addition, the natural ground
water reservoir now supplying water to Lahore is being overpumped, and its
level is dropping. Therefore, sewage is expected to become an even more valu-
able resource within a few years either as a means of replenishing the ground
water reservoir, as a substitute for irrigation water following treatment
or as industrial water supply (see Annex 1). The Phase II project provides
for collecting most of the data that will be needed to study these alter-
natives in future planning. Treatment of most of the sewage of Lahore will



ANNEX 7
Page 6
probably be required by 1986 and sewage treatment works for Lahore sewage
to be built between 1981 and 1986 have been provided by the consultants
in the revised Master Plan. Because of the need for staff and officials
to become familiar with sewage treatment procedures and with the results
of treatment, and because of the proposed method of treatment which is
new to the country, the consultants recommend the construction and
operation of a prototype sewage treatment plant in the Phase II project.
B. DRAINAGE
Existing Drainage Districts
12.       There has been one separation and some minor realignments made
to the four principal drainage districts of Lahore identified in the 1969
Master Plan. The Chota Ravi Drainage District on the north of the city
has been separated into two independent drainage districts. Some minor
realignments have been made to the Mian Mir I and Mian Mir II drainage
districts in the center of the city because of public pressures. The fourth
district called the Satto Katla Drainage District covering the south of the
city is not sufficiently populated for planning and development of its drain-
age system.
13.       In 1969, the Chota Ravi Drainage District included a main drain
approximately 61,000 feet in length, draining approximately 11,400 acres
within its boundaries. It has now been recognized that storm water channels
could be considerably decreased in size, while still maintaining adequate
drainage of tributary areas by separating the Chota Ravi Drainage District
into two independent drainage districts. The result of this separation is
a considerable decrease in the cost of future channels to be constructed
in this area. The two drainage areas thus formed are now to be called
the Lower Chota Ravi Drainage District and the Upper Chota Ravi Drainage
District with storm water flowing away from the railway line in an easterly
direction as well as a portion flowing to the west from the Shalimar Gardens
area. The levels in the Ravi River at the confluences with the drainage
channels from both drainage districts, permit gravity drainage of these
two districts under average flow conditions into the Ravi River and drain-
age by pumping during periods in which the Ravi River is in flood.
14.       In the Upper Chota Ravi Drainage District, construction of 23,000
feet of drainage channels has recently been completed or is underway. Con-
tract documents have been prepared for a further 25,000 feet. The channels
in this district are designed to carry a peak flow at the bund, at the
location of the Shad Bagh Drainage Pumping Station, of approximately 700
cfs.  In the Lower Chota Ravi Drainage District, approximately 7,000
feet of drainage channel hiave recently been completed, while contract



ANNEX 7
Page 7
documents have been completed for a further 5,000 feet. The channel is
designed to carry a peak flow at the bund, at the location of the Chotta
Ravi Drainage Pumping Station, of approximately 225 cfs. A portion of
the drainage channel between Ravi Road and the railway line has not been
designed because it is expected that this area will be utilized by the
Lahore Municipality as a recreational lake.
15.       A realignment of the main drainage channel, differing from that
suggested in the 1969 Master Plan, has been proposed by WASA for Mian Mir
Drainage District II. The channels proposed by WASA have been designed
for a peak flow of approximately 200 cfs at the point where the channel
crosses Multan Road, and approximately 800 cfs at the confluence with
the Ravi River.
16.       The current practice is to mount horizontal-shaft centrifugal
pumps, driven by diesel engines, on platforms supported over the main flow
sections of drainage channels. The suction piping of the pumps draw water
from a level of approximately 10 to 15 feet below the centerline of the
pumps. The pumps discharge the stormwater over stop gates provided to
prevent backflow from the Ravi River during periods of flood. The Lower
Chota Ravi Drainage Pumping Station has an installed capacity of 82 cfs
and the Babu Sabu Drainage Pumping Station which deals with Mian Mir I
has an installed capacity of 72 cfs. The new Shadbagh Drainage Pumping
Station has been designed by LITWW as described above, but with an installed
capacity of only 300 cfs. This pumping station will require extension in
the future to pump the peak design flow at the bund of approximately 700 cfs.
Long-Range Needs
17.       The need for drainage within WASA's Service Area arises from
the need to protect life and property in areas already developed and on
public pressure to develop existing under utilized land. The increased
risk of storm water damage (due to increasing imperviousness of built-up
areas) is increasing the need for storm water drainage facilities. The
Upper and Lower Chota Ravi and Mian Mir I Drainage Districts provide
illustrations of this. iany public complaints concerning drainage problems
in these areas are being miade.  It is no longer feasible within the Chota
Ravi Drainage District, to rely on nature to drain storm water to an ill-
defined northern area near the protective bund. Development of main
drainage channels is needed. It is also no longer possible to rely on the
older existing main drainage channels of the Mian Mir I Drainage District
for adequate protection against stormwater flows. The secondary channel
system needs to be developed. But the urgency for construction of drainage
facilities is presently only felt in a limited locality within the Mian
Mir II Drainage District (the 1600 Acre Housing Scheme Area), and to a
much lesser extent within the Satto Katla Drainage District. Some of this
work is being undertaken by WASA under the Immediate Works Program.



ANNEX 7
Page 8
Minor Flooding
18.       Sixty low-lying areas within the Service Area which become flooded
during periods of rain have been identified. During the monsoon season
these areas are nearly continuously filled with stormwater, which endangers
habitations built within them or simply creates a general nuisance. During
the dry weather these areas reduce to open ponds filled with sewage.
These areas can presently be drained only by means of portable pumpsets.
There are 14 locations where sanitary sewers, which become blocked by
debris-carrying storm water flows, overflow into adjacent roadways which
are situated at lower levels. The current capacities of the sewers and
sewage pumping stations are inadequate to prevent surcharging during periods
of rain. In addition, there are 16 locations where the construction of
storm water drains along existing roadways would considerably alleviate
the flooding problems experienced along the roadways and adjacent areas
during periods of rain. The Phase II project provides for constructing
new secondary storm water drains with channel design criteria developed
in the 1969 Master Plan Report and rehabilitating existing drains to
reduce some of this minor flooding but postpone major storm drainage
construction to Phase III.

Service Area
1.        WASA's total service area of about 120 square miles is made up as
follows:
(a) about 68 square miles out of the LMC area of 86 square miles
covered by the 60 Union Committees in the 1972 census;
(b) about 32 square miles outside the LMC southern boundary, and
(c)  about 20 square miles out of the Army Cantonment area of 36
square miles.
Only some parts of the service area in the Cantonment are provided with water
supply by WASA, but it is responsible for dealing with all the storm water and
some of the waste water discharged into the principal drainage channels flow-

Population Studies
3.        Through the cooperation of the Census Bureau, Government of Pakistan,
the 1972 Census data have been made available to the consultants. Although
certain minor items of information could not be obtained, these census data
are the most recent available, and serve as the basis for the projections of
population in the Phase II project. Due to changes in the area of both the
LMC and the Cantonment, a direct comparison of populations in these political
subdivisions in 1961 and 1972 would be misleading. It is necessary to distri-
bute the population within recognizable geographic limits in order to assess
the growth of population within the overall study area. These data are pre-
sented in the following table which shows various sub-areas within the study
area, their respective 1961 and 1972 census data, and the annual rates of
growth:

4.        The average annual rate of population growth for the period 1961-
1972 was the same as that for the period 1951-1961 (4.32%) even though there
were higher and lower rates in individual years. There is insufficient data
on such parameters as improved health resulting in lower infant mortality,
family planning, immigration and emigration patterns for making a demographic
study or urban planning analysis to forecast future population growth rates
or even to discuss high, low or median trends. Nevertheless, Lahore is the
cultural, govermental, educational and economic center for the Punjab, which
is the largest province in the new Pakistan and is expected to continue at
about the same rate of average growth, as in the past, for the next 10 years.
5.        For the 1972 census the entire LMC area, less the Cantonment, is
subdivided into 60 Union Committees. The Cantonment is subdivided into four
charges. In the 1961 census, the LMC area was divided into 60 wards, but the
limits of these wards do not coincide with the limits of the 1972 Union
Committees. Since there is no way in which the 1972 census data can be
correlated with the previously used wards, it is not possible to relate the
1961 and 1972 population densities except on an overall basis. Population
densities based upon the present Union Committees have, therefore, been used
by the consultants and the following assumptions relative to future growth
patterns within the service area have been made:
a.   For Union Committees which are partially within the service
area the percentage of people within the service area will
remain constant throughout the planning period, based upon
the 1972 proportions.
b.   Population densities will be based upon the total Union
Committee area within the project limits, without deduction
for unused areas, such as parks, golf courses, street
medians, etc.
c.   For the Union Committees within the Old City and other Union
Committees with 1972 population densities in excess of 200
persons/acre, the annual rate of growth for the projected
period will be the same as that for the period 1961-1972,
about 0.7% per year.
d.   For the Cantonment, as defined in 1961, the projected annual
rate of growth will be the same as that for the period
1961-1972, 0.25% per year.
e.   Those Union Committees having a 1972 population density of
75 to 200 persons/acre will have an annual rate of growth
equal to that projected for the Greater Lahore area, 4.35%
per year, with the limitation of maximum population density
of 200 persons/acre, after which the rate of growth will be
based on that for the Old City.
f.   For the area south of the LMC area, the following population
data is assumed:

1986                  250,000
On these assumptions the consultants have projected an overall rate of
population growth of 4.35% per year through 1986 as per the following table:

6.        Areal distributions of population for 1972, 1976, 1981 and 1986
have been prepared for each of the 60 Union Committees, the small area in
the Cantonment and the 36 square miles to the south of the LMC boundaries
which in all comprise WASA's service area.
B. POPULATION SERVED - WATER SUPPLY
Present Population Served
7.        In mid-1975, only a little over half the population in the service
area were directly served with piped water by the WASA system. An additional
8% are estimated to be served by government, private and industrial systems.
The remainder use hand pumped shallow wells or other private sources of water,
or carry water from standposts, sabeels, served premises or katries (see
paras 11 and 12). There are about 110,000 connections to the LITWW water
distribution system, of which about 8,600 are registered as metered. Meters
are installed at the request of the consumer. Metered premises, therefore,
are generally those who would pay higher charges on an annual rental value.
WASA's estimates of areas served are shown in IBRD Map 12095.
Present Unmetered Residential Use
8.        A program was undertaken to install and monitor meters on what
are normally unmetered residential connections. As of the end of March,
1975, about 200 individual meters and 4 bulk meters had been installed.
The individual meters recorded an average of 26 gpcd for a total of approx-
imately 324,000 person/days. It is believed that this result is biased on
the low side because of the respcnse of water users to the installation of



ANNEX 8
Page 6
the meters. One bulk meter recorded a figure of 29 gpcd for 2,933 person/days
over a 7 day period. Another bulk meter yielded 34 gpcd for 18,450 person/
days over a 75 day period. It, therefore, appears that water use in these
unmetered premises is approximately 34 gpcd, under present conditions of low
pressures in the water distribution system. It is, however, believed that
these premises are somewhat superior to the city-wide standard of unmetered
premises, and an average of 30 gpcd has therefore been assumed for unmetered
premises, by CDM. WASA however believes that because of the frequent break-
down of pumping plant overall consumption is lower (para 23).
Present Metered Residential Use
9.        Representative samples of LITWW records for residential metered
connections were selected and the monthly metered consumptions for the
periods November, 1973 to February, 1974 and May 1974 to August, 1974 were
obtained for these connections. The number of persons residing in each
dwelling was also obtained and the average daily per capita water use was
calculated on monthly and quarterly bases, reflecting the cooler and hotter
periods of the year. The average use during the period November to February
was 61 gpcd and that during the period May to August was 83 gpcd. The overall
average consumption was 72 gpcd. These figures include water wasted by the
consumer, after delivery through the meter. A check made by tabulating
population density classifications with sample meter readings confirmed this
result.
Present Commercial and Industrial Use
10.       There are about 1,560 listed small industrial and commercial con-
nections to the LITWW system. Data relative to metered consumption for
30 of these connections were obtained. The average daily consumption was
661 gallons per day per connection, including water wasted by the consumers.
There are, however, many industries within the Lahore area which use large
quantities of water each day, but these have their own private wells and it
is expected that they will continue to use these sources as long as it is
economical to do so.
Public Standposts and Sabeels
11.         - LITWW provides water to a portion of the population through
some 1,160 public standposts (fountains) and sabeels, the majority of which
are located in the more densely populated area. A sabeel is a public stand-
post which supplies water through a small reservoir and not directly from
the distribution system. Three ptublic standposts in a densely Dopulated
area wqere studied and the average daily water consumption per standpost
was about 2,000 gallons. Observations were made of the number of persons
using the standposts and the purpose for which they were used. It was
found that an average of about 150 persons used each standpost on this day,
for bathing, washing clothes and dishes and obtaining water to be carried
away. For planning purposes, it has been assumed that 200 persons are
daily provided with 13 gallons per person from each public standpost and
sabeel.
Katries, Hamams a



ANNEX 8
Page 7
Katries, Hamnams and Hydrants
12.       Katries are private standposts, used to provide water to small
groups of houses, usually about 5 to 6 and often in one compound. At
present, there are about 2,050 connections listed as katries. None of
these is metered. Since the distance from the house of the average user
to a Katrie is less than that for the average user of a public standpost,
it would be reasonable to assume that the users of katries would take more
water than users of public standposts. Based on an average of 8 persons
per household, and five households per katrie, it is assumed that an
average of 40 persons are served per katrie. Assuming an average per capita
daily use of 26 gallons, including wastage, the quantity supplied by each
katrie would average 1,040 gallons per day. Hamams are combination barber
shops and public bath houses. There are 760 of these facilities listed,
none being metered. On the basis of a previous estimate by LITWW, it is
assumed that the water used averages 500 gallons per day per hamam. There
are about 305 public garden hydrants of three-inch diameter reported to be
used by the LMC on an average of once every three days for irrigating pub-
lic parks and gardens. It is estimated that each of these hydrants pro-
vides 75,000 gallons per use. This would be about 7.5 IMgd during the
irrigation period, for all of the public garden hydrants.
Average Day Demand - 1974
13.       On the basis of the above studies and consumer surveys made for
the tariff studies, a best estimate of population served for calendar year
1974 will be about 1,300,000 - i.e. 58% of the total population in the
service area as detailed in the following table:
Daily per   Population    Average

Total                             1,300,000     38.7        117,199
/1   Because of the unreliability of this data WASA is making a connection
survey.
14.       As none of the wells were metered, water production was esti-
mated by the consultants (para 21). Average water production in December
1974 was about 100 IMgd. The difference between the average daily use
of 38.7 IMgd and the water production is 61.3 IMgd, and represents public



ANNEX 8
Page 8
use, wasted and unaccounted for water. Supplies were inadequate or dis-
continuous in some areas in 1974. Had supply been adequate it would have
affected both production and use, but it is likely to be the former more than
the latter, since leakage losses and wastage are likely to have increased more
than actual use. Also the studies on water demand were made with available data
and in a relatively short time period. To allow for these factors in the
water demand projections the consultants have assumed an increase of about 10%,
bringing unaccounted for water to 70.9 IMgd and total average daily demand
to 110 IMgd on the assumption of a continuous supply to the 58% served
population in the service area.
Assumptions in Average Water Demand Projections
15.       As recommended in the tariff study it is assumed that the pro-
portion of the total population which is served through metered connec-
tions, or which will have above average demand equivalent to that of
metered consumers, will remain approximately at its present level of 8%.
The per capita demand of this group is likely to increase to a level ap-
proximately equivalent to the domestic demand in developed countries.
It is likely to increase to even higher levels unless effective metering
and other waste control programs included in the Phase II project are
effectively carried out.
16.       Actual use by directly connected consumers of middle income and
in typical residential premises, at present represented by the unmetered
group, is not likely to change significantly on a per capita basis in the
near future. However, the extent of water wastage by this group is not
known, but is believed to be high and is likely to continue to be so unless
consumer education and the recommended selective metering program are
undertaken by the new W4ASA management.
17.       As the city grows, it is reasonable to assume that additional
small commercial or industrial establishments will apply for connection
to the system, and that their average daily use will also increase. The
consultants have assumed that, during the study period, the number of
commercial and industrial connections will increase to 2,500 and that
their average use will increase to 1,000 gallons per day.
18.       It is expected that the use of public standposts, sabeels and
katries will not increase and will eventually diminish. It is assumed
that the population using these facilities will remain at their present
level until 1981 and will then decrease to half of those levels by 1986.
Per capita consumption through these facilities is not expected to change
significantly. Allowing for future improvement in this situation, for
future detection and repair of water main leaks and for reduced leakage
from proposed new mains, it is expected that the total proportion of
water that is unaccounted for will diminish to about 40% in 1982.
19.       On the above bases, projections of water demand have been made
for the period 1974 to 1986 to represent a condition approaching adequate
water supply for 90% of the population in the service area in 1986, i.e.



ANNEX 8
Page 9
3,300,000 with an increased degree of control of leakage, metering
effectiveness and consumer education on reducing wastage. This ambitious
increase in the water service program will require a considerable building
up of the management, financial and technical resources of WASA. It has
been accepted as an attainable long-term target with some modifications
in the targets for the initial years because of financial constraints,
some additional studies made by the WASA ground water cell (see Paragraph
23) and time needed to improve management and technical performance.
Maximum Day and Peak-Hour Demand
20.       The 1969 Master Plan Report recommended maximum-day/average-
day and peak-hour/maximum-day ratios each equal to 1.5. The only data
available to check these figures are overall seasonal comparisons. LITWW
records of metered water consumption for the nine subdivisions of the
distribution system for 1974 show summer/average rates ranging from 0.96
to 1.77, with an average of 1.36. This appears to substantiate the maxi-
mum-day/average ratio assumption of 1.5. The peak-hour/maximum-day ratio
of 1.5 cannot be verified but appears reasonable on the basis of general
experience. Average day, maximum day and peak hour projections as pro-
posed by the consultants are given below. WASA proposes using these
estimates with caution as they are not based upon truly metered production
and consumption. Subsequent work by WASA discussed in the next section
indicates that the consultants' estimates of production may be somewhat
higher than the actual. Nevertheless the consultants' estimates are
acceptable for long range planning, and are as follows:

C. WATER PRODUCTION
Daily Water Production (Consultants estimate)
21.       At the end of 1974, there were 100 operating wells with a total
installed capacity of 242 cusecs in the LIT/WW system:

TOTAL                         100                   242
22.       As none of the wells had an operating meter, it has, therefore,
been necessary to estimate water production on the basis of daily hours
of operation, taken in conjunction with estimated pumping rates based on
rated pump capacities at estimated system head. In order to enable evalua-
tion of the relationship between pumping rates and rated capacities, LITWW
carried out pumping tests at 34 wells. System pressure at each tested
pump was estimated by approximately averaging observations of permanently
installed pressure gauges, supplemented where necessary by the use of tem-
porary gauges. In spite of the low operating efficiency of a large pro-
portion of the older pumps, the fact that the system operating pressures
are often lower than the rated pump head caused the consultants to estimate
average discharge to be practically equal to the average rated capacity.
The total present potential production (with all wells operating 24 hours
per day to meet maximum day demand) may then be assumed to be equal to the
total rated capacity of all operating wells, 242 cfs or 130 IMgd if the wells
actually discharged water at the rated pump capacity. The average daily
production, based on the present 18.5 hour average operating day, would on
these assumptions be about 100 IMgd as shown below:

Daily Water Production (WASA's estimate)
23.       WASA proposes to meter all of the 4 cfs tubewells by December 1975
and the remainder by June 1976 to control the dangerously excessive dis-
charges during periods of low pressure which have been the causes of tube
well failures by sand blowing and pump motors burning out from over loading.
A number of wells cannot produce their designed discharge at the rated heads
or even at the lower operating heads because of encrustation and require
frequent acid treatment which however makes only a temporary improvement.
WASA is also anxious to preserve the lives of the existing tube wells, for
as long as it is economically feasible. If these factors are considered
together with the generally poor condition of tube well plant - 40% of all
vertical turbine pump motors are rewound annually; 24 out of 30 pumps tested
had deteriorated well beyond the point where repairs were required; staff of
major breakdown crews perform work at approximately 16 sites monthly - esti-
mated daily water production is believed by WASA to be about 66 IMgd as
calculated below from the ground water cells discharge measurements com-
pleted in June 1975 after the consultants had completed the studies on water
production. Details of these measurements and information on WASA's tube
wells as on June 1975 are shown below. Actual production is probably somewhere
between the two estimates and will be known when the tube well metering
program is completed. Until more information becomes available as a result
of the tubewell metering program, the mission agreed with WASA to use the
statistics shown in paragraph 29, particularly WASA's more conservative
estimate of average daily water use.

24.       Reduction of well performance due to encrustation and complete
failures of tube wells because of sandblowing or very low discharges making
some uneconomical to operate is a serious problem. For instance, in the
month of July 1975, three wells at Lytton Road, T-Block and E-Block Gulberg
3 with a total capacity of about 1.7 cfs had to be retired. However in the
same month, five new 4 cfs wells were commissioned, four equipped with 4
cfs pumps and one at the Meherbano Scheme with a 2 cfs pump.
25.       Further retirements are planned in 1975/76 of 15 wells at Sanda
Kalam, Raj Garh, Coal Bagh West, Poonch Road, Nawankot, Muslim Colony,

26.       During 1975/76 two new wells awaiting pumps at Jaffra Colony and
Karim Park II will have 4 cfs pumps installed in them and the 2 cfs pump at
Meherbano will be replaced by a 4 cfs pump, increasing installed capacities
by 10 cusecs. Because of the increasing unsatisfied demand, WASA is com-
mencing "Immediate Works" on implementing some of the consultants' recom-
mendations beginning with the construction of 6 new wells at Ichara, Kamal
Gunj, Walled City, Samanabad Baghbanpuna and Gulbert areas, adding another
24 cfs by June 1976. Net water production in June 1976 will be as

27.       From June 1976 to June 1977 six more 4 cfs wells will be built
under the immediate works program at Dhelarwal, Simla Hill, Shahdara, Gujan
Pura, Kumhar/Sura and Mohwood Booti areas and wells to be retired will be
generally as shown in the detailed list at page 18 to this Annex.
Annual Water Production
28.       For the purposes of calculating annual water production WASA's
estimates are taken to be more realistic and have been used with the fol-
lowing assumptions:
(i)  For the purpose of the water consumption estimates CDM's
estimate of unaccounted for water is used through 1976 with
a small decrease thereafter in anticipation of improved
leakage control. By 1982 it is assumed the unaccounted
water is reduced to 40%, of which leakage and wastage may
be about 30% and other use about 10%. More accurate in-
formation will be collected during the project and these
assumptions would be revised accordingly.
(ii) Near the completion of the project period in 1980 about 33%
standby capacity is provided for emergencies, maintenance
of wells and pumps and to partially meet maximum day demand.
(iii) An unsatisfied demand of about 14% is assumed in 1982.
This unsatisfied demand is expected to be met by even better
control over leakage and wastage which has been assumed to
be 30% in that year.
29.       The water production and use statistics discussed above are
illustrated at page 19 to this Annex.
D. SEWAGE FLOWS
Population
30.       The preparation of the new preliminary sewer system design began
with the calculation of projected population densities for 1986 for each
of the Union Committees within the study area. The study area was then
divided into approximately three hundred small drainage areas, following,
in general, the layout of trunk sewers used in the 1969 Master Plan. Most
of the drainage areas were in more than one Union Committee, and the pro-
jected population density for each drainage area was, therefore, in most
cases, an average. The area in acres of each small drainage area was
measured and the projected population calculated by multiplying these areas
by the 1986 population densities. The population in 1986 was estimated
from this area and the average projected 1986 population densities. Certain
portions of the study area are expected to have low population densities by
the end of this period. It would be uneconomical to build sanitary sewers
in these areas. The areas proposed to be excluded are:



ANNEX 8
Page 14
(a) The South Cantonment
(b) Union Committee No. 19, east of the Pakistan Railroad
(c) The area referred to as "Area South of the Lahore
Municipal Corporation Limits," with the exception of
the area designated for the Lahore Township Scheme.
As a general rule, sewer systems should not be constructed in these areas
until population densities reach at least 25 persons per acre. If housing
or industrial development schemes are proposed for such areas, sanitary
sewers may be installed as part of the specific scheme. Until the growth
of population justifies sanitary sewers, newly constructed houses may be
served by septic tanks and leaching fields. The total population in the
sewered areas of about 80 square miles within WASA's service area is cal-
culated by CDM to be 3,549,000 by 1986.
Population Served
31.       Based upon a consumer survey (Annex 7, paragraph 2) the consult-
ants estimate that about 1/3 of the present population receive direct sewer
service and about 1/3 to 1/4 of the houses in the city are connected to the
sewers. WASA has commenced keeping records of new sewer connections and
will make a consumer survey to determine more accurately the number of
sewer connections and population served.
32.       Unlike water supply, almost one hundred percent of the 1986 popu-
lation in the sewered areas is assumed by the consultants to be served.
The people may be served either through direct connections, or through open
street drains, as many people are now served. The assumption of 100%
served is probably optimistic. However, as the locations of the people who
will not be tributary to the sewer system are unknown, it is preferable to
calculate sewer flows for the preliminary design assuming all are tributary.
By 1986 more of the existing private schemes are expected to be served with
water supply by WASA. Some big industries and institutions like the canton-
ment and railways would be continuing to own and operate their own water
supply schemes, but discharging the waste water into WASA's sewers. The
population served by sewerage in 1986 will be therefore greater than that
served by water supply (though there will be fewer direct sewer connections)
as shown below:

Sewage Flows
33.       None of the existing pumpings stations have devices for measuring
incoming sewage flows. There is also no record of the direct and indirect
sewer connections, or the total number of channels, or estimate of flows
to the gratings which lead sullage water to the sewers to enable a calcu-
lation of the quantity of used water that is now reaching the sewers (to
aid future planning). The collection of these statistics is included in
the Phase II project. The consultants, based upon their experience and ob-
servations of water use, discussed in part B above, have assumed that, be-
cause of considerable irrigation of parks and lawns with piped water in
some areas of the city, only about 80% of all the daily water used goes to
the sewers. A crude calculation is then made based upon the projected
average 1986 water consumption of 234 IMgd (paragraph 20) and an assumption
made that approximately 80% of this would be the sewage contribution from
WASA consumers, independently supplied institutions and industries in the
80 square miles of served area of the city for a population of about
3,549,000 people. This would give an overall per capita flow of 53 gallons
per day. This calculation is acceptable as a criterion for preliminary
engineering, only because of the lack of data and requires field verifica-
tion during detailed design. On the basis of this calculation the 1986
design sewage flows from the existing and proposed sewerage districts are
summarized below:

TOTAL          3,548,870            51,506                348.32
E. STORM DRAINAGE FLOWS
Rainfall
34.       Drainage is a problem in Lahore because of the flat terrain and
the need to pump the storm drainage over the flood protection bund during
high flood levels in the Ravi River. In selecting a rainfall for design
of stormwater drainage facilities the 1969 lIaster Plan utilized storms of
duration not exceeding 60 minutes, taken from records of the years 1957-1966.
The LITWW has since revised this design rainfall data to cover a period of
record of 23 years, 1947-1970, continuing, however, to utilize storms of



ANNEX 8
Page 16
duration not exceeding 60 minutes. The "5-year" frequency storm used in the
1969 Master Plan resulted in stormwater runoffs of much smaller magnitude
than those calculated by the consultants in the revised Master Plan made
with rainfall records covering the 27=year period from 1947 to 1974 obtained
from the Meteorological Department. On the basis of these records they de-
cided that storms of 6 hours' duration more nearly represented actual
rainfall conditions in Lahore. The maximum probable 6-hour rainstorms of
2-year and 5-year frequency were therefore derived from the above rainfall
data.  Only maximum annual storms were used for this analysis.
Runoff Assumptions
35.       Because of various characteristics of a watershed area, not all
rain which falls is available for runoff, some being lost as infiltration,
some stored in surface depressions, some intercepted by vegetation, etc.
The rainfall excess available for runoff after subtraction of losses has
been calculated by subtraction of 0.1 inch for the first hour, subsequently
applying appropriate runoff coefficients to all 6 hours of rainfall. The
runoff coefficients have been treated as time varying for the first three
hours. Because the rainfall excesses for the (various) different time
increments of a design storm do not reach a particular point simultaneously,
a method for calculating the peak runoff is required, and the consultants
have used the Hydrograph method *1s being most appropriate for Lahore.
Design Storm
36.       A rough estimate of construction costs of primary drainage chan-
nels and pump stations for two-year and five-year storms was made, assuming
immediate construction for the ultimate expected flow conditions. The re-
sults indicated channel and pump station construction costs of PRs 28,845,000
and PRs 249,962,000 respectively, for the "2-year" storm design, and
PRs 42,103,000 and PRs 453,687,000 respectively, for the "5-year" storm
design. Because of the excessive cost of the "5-year" storm design and the
relatively low damage potential from stormwater flooding in the service area,
though there will be some inconvenience from temporary flooding of the streets,
the preliminary design was prepared on the basis of run off derived from
the "2-year" frequency storm. A summary of peak flows calculated by the
consultants on these assumptions for the five drainage districts in WASA's
service area is given below:

LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT - PHASE II
Objectives, Phasing and Staffing of Lahore Urban Development
and Traffic Study
A.   STUDY OBJECTIVES:
1.        The purpose of this study is to initiate:
(a) a sustainable program of improvements in living conditions
for the lower income groups of Lahore by preparing pilot
projects in neighborhood upgrading and urban expansion;
(b) improvements in traffic conditions in congested parts of
the street system of central Lahore; and
(c) urban planning activities that will provide a perspective
framework for sectoral action programs in the Metropolitan
Area of Lahore.
2.        The neighborhood upgrading project will be concerned with an existing
residential area having a population of about 50,000. The project is to be
designed for the people now living there, with the following principal
objectives:
(a) to provide adequate municipal and social services, environmental
conditions and community facilities; and
(b) to encourage and facilitate the improvement (or construction)
of dwellings and the creation of employment.
The project is to improve living conditions for the majority of residents,
preserving significant amounts of investment in existing housing stock and
protecting, to the extent possible, the economic and social fabric of the
communities. Relocation of residents within the project area is to be
kept to the minimum compatible with the above objectives.
3.   The urban expansion project is to be an area of new settlement primarily
for lower income groups, designed for a total population of about 30,000.
The principal objectives of the project shall be those given in paragraph 2(a)
and (b) above. The project is to consist of site preparation and municipal
services for self-help housing development, with facilities for small-scale
industries, commercial establishinents and community services.

4.        For both the neighborhood upgrading and the urban expansion pro-
jects, the Study shall provide:
(a) a phased development program and budget, with recommendations
on organizational and financial arrangements for implementation,
operation and maintenance;
(b) preliminary engineering designs and detailed cost estimates; and
(c) assistance in implementation.
Since these projects are to serve as pilot operations for a series of similar
developments in other locations of Greater Lahore, replicability shall be a
primary consideration in project design and organizational and financial
structure.
5.        For traffic improvements in the street system of Lahore, the Study
shall provide:
(a) a classification of the existing street network in areas of
congestion and at points of significant traffic attraction,
to define primary street uses (e.g., bus movements, pedestrians,
market activities, freight movement, etc.);
(b) recommendations on policies and measures to ensure allocation
of road space in accordance with designated uses, to provide
priority use for bus movements and to restrain the growth of
private vehicle traffic in congested areas;
(c) a phased program and budget for traffic improvements in 1977-85,
comprising (i) traffic management schemes on major arterial
routes, (ii) standards for road signs and markings, (iii) a system
of traffic direction, (iv) improvements in street maintenance and
lighting;
(d) recommendations on organizational changes and training as
necessary for effective implementation of the proposed program
and policies;
(e) preliminary engineering designs, equipment specifications, cost
estimates and economic analyses of projects to be implemented
in 1977-79;
(f) assistance in implementation of these projects and of recommended
organizational changes and policies; and
(g) training of personnel in responsible Government agencies.

6.        Urban planning activities to be supported by this Study shall be
the minimum effort required for dimensioning and coordinating sectoral
action programs that will be consistent with overall economic, demographic
and physical growth prospects for the Metropolitan Area of Lahore. To
this end, the Study shall provide:
(a)  updating of the existing data base on population, employment,
land-use, economic activity and sectoral developments;
(b)  identification of key development issues, with recommendations
on the scope of preinvestment studies to be initiated for
highest priority sectors;
(c)  analysis of present deficiencies in urban development finance,
planning and plan implementation, with recommendations for
fiscal, institutional and functional improvements;
(d)  forecasts of economic and demographic development in the
Metropolitan Area of Lahore to 1985.
This shall be followed by support in subsequent stages of metropolitan
planning and in the coordination of sector programs.

APPRAISAL OF THE
LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT - PHASE II
Assumptions for Financial Projections
A. INCOME STATEMENTS
Operating Revenues
1.        Water - metered revenue is based upon the proposed tariff and a
policy of selective metering which would include commercial, industrial and
large residential consumers so that the present ratio of 8% of metered
consumers to total consumers will be at least maintained. The average
consumption of metered connections is estimated by CDM to be about 273,000
gallons in FY1977 with a small increase in each subsequent year. WASA
have estimated a more conservative figure of 257,000 gallons per year and
this has been used throughout.
2.        Revenue from water - unmetered is based upon the proposed tariff
and WASA's estimates of the new connections which will be made in the old
and newly served areas and the total Annual Rental Value (ARV) upon which
charges can be made for these and the old connections.
3.        The sewer rate is a share of the property tax collected by the
Provincial Department of Excise and Taxation and paid over to WASA. The
share paid to WASA was increased in FY1975 and has been increased again
in FY1976. The amount projected has been calculated by WASA after discus-
sions with the Excise and Taxation Department (see para 6.10 of report).
4.        Revenue from meter rentals is calculated on rates of charge in the
proposed tariff which are sufficient to amortize the cost of the meter over
ten years.
5.        Connection charges are calculated at PRs 50.00 for each new
connection forecast for each year.
6.        The basis for surcharge revenue remains as before at 10% of amounts
that are not paid by the due date.
7.        Other includes receipts for sales of sullage, license and other fees,
miscellaneous income, and an LMC contribution which is a sum calculated in



ANNEX 14
Page 2
respect of municipal firehydrants, schools, latrines etc. The charges are
extremely low for the services provided and appropriate charges are to be
negotiated between LMC and WASA. For projection purposes the present
calculated charge has been used.
8.        Increases in charges of about 30% in FY 1979, 20% in FY 1981 and
10% in FY 1983 have been estimated to keep pace with inflation and the cost
of the improved services.
Operating Expenses
9.        Salaries have been assumed to increase at 5% per year for new
employees to operate the larger facilities and 10% a year for improved
salary scales, increments and general escalation.
10.       Energy power has been calculated for water upon the number of
tubewells in service with one third on standby. The charges are based on
a two part tariff of a fixed charge for the installed load and a unit
charge for units consumed during an 18.5 hour pumping day. Escalation of
price has been calculated at 15% in FY1976 and 5% in each year from FY1978
onwards.
11.       Energy gas has been calculated on the same physical basis as for
tubewells and the price escalation has been taken at 5% per year.
12.       Repairs and Maintenance (R & M) have been running at an average
of about 1.5% of gross assets in service. with the value of the new assets
to be built a level of 1.5% will provide sufficient funds for improvements
in maintenance.
13.       Other expenses are for office costs and other employees benefits
and are based on 20% of payroll costs.
14.,      The provision for bad debts is calculated at 15% of total billings
initially, reducing to 10% in FY1980 and 5% in FY1982. The rate of collec-
tions, at present only 30%, of annual billings is expected to improve with
the introduction of the new billing and collection system and to reach 85%
by FY1982. During negotiations targets for improvements in collections were
discussed and set. At the end of FY1975 net accounts receivable were
about one and one-third times that year's billing and the level of improve-
ment to be expected will be a reduction to 100% in FY1977, to 60% in FY1979,
to 20% in FY1981 and to 15% thereafter (See para 6.19 of report).



ANNEX 14

15.       Depreciation - is based upon percentages as follows:
Percentage
Land                                NIL
Water and Sewer Pipelines            2
Buildings                            2
Tubewells                            5
Pumping Stations                     6.7
Machinery and Equipment             10
Office furniture fixtures
and fittings                      10
Vehicles                            20
These average about 2-1/2% of fixed assets so this percentage has been
used for projection purposes.
B. FUNDS FLOW STATEMENTS
16.       Future Project.  This has been projected to start in FY1980,
the year in which the Phase II project will be completed. It is based
upon the ten year work program.
17.       Future Loans are projected from FY1981 and are not expected to
exceed 50% of the future investment program. It is assumed that the
balance will come from internal cash generation.
C. BALANCE SHEETS
18.       The capitalization of Plant in Operation each year is 100% of work
in progress brought forward from the previous year plus 50% of the new
work carried out during the year leaving 50% of the new work as work in
progress.
19.       Accounts Receivable are projected on an improving collec-
Lions basis and after deduction of the accumulated provisions for bad
debts (See para 14 above and para 6.19 of the report).
20.       Inventories are projected on the assumption that the total value
of stores issued will be 70% of annual maintenance expenses and that the
stores inventory at the end of the year will be proportionate to the value
of stores issued. The proportion is also expected to reduce in future
years as follows:



ANNEX 14
Page 4
FY 1977               Value of Inventory = 1.50 x annual stores issues
FY 1978 and FY 1979    "    "       "     = 1.25 x annual stores issues
FY 1980 to FY 1983       f   "      "     = 1.00 x annual stores issues
21.       Receivables and Advances have been projected at an escalation
factor of 10% from the base year FY1976.
22.       Accounts Payable are projected as one month's total operating
expenses plus one half of the year end work in progress. It is assumed
that at the end of the year, two months' construction work is still to be
paid for plus 10% retention on the previous ten months -- one month -- a
total of three months which is one half of the year end work in progress
(see para 18).
23.       Deposits and others are escalated at 10% a year from a base of
FY1976.
