SECOND LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.        This report reviews the preparation, implementation and achieve-
ments of the Second Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Project,
(Credit 630-PAK) in Pakistan, for which a credit of US$26.6 million was made
to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The proceeds of the IDA Credit were
made available to the Punjab Province for on-lending to the Water and Sanita-
tion Agency (WASA) and the Lahore Development Authority (LDA). The credit was
signed in June 1976, and was closed in December 1983. The implementing agen-
cies for the project were the Water and Sanitation Agency of Lahore, and the
Lahore Development Authority (LDA) for the urban studies.
2.        The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Urban and Water
Supply Division, South Asia Projects Department on the basis of a project
completion mission which visited Lahore in July/August 1983, of WASA's
progress reports, the Loan and Project Agreements, and other reports related
to project implementation. The draft report was discussed with the
implementing agencies during suspervision missions in February and July 1984,
and the current version fully reflects their perception of what was achieved.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower, WASA, LDA and to UNDP and ODA which provided technical
assistance. Comments were received from WASA and these have been reflected
in the report and reproduced as Annex 7.

CREDIT 630-PAK
SECOND LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
i.        Credit 630-PAK was approved in May 1976 for an amount of US$26.6
million. It was the Bank's second credit for the improvement of Lahore's
Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage System. The first credit (106-PAK) was
for US$ 3.5 million. Credit 630-PAK was guaranteed by the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan and made available to the Government of Punjab to be onlent to the
Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), the implementing agency. US$1.5
million was used out of US$1.6 million reserved for studies to prepare an
urban project in Lahore for which the Lahore Development Authority (*JDA) was
the executing agency. The credit was intended to cover about 55.5 per^cnt ef
the total project cost of US$47.9 million, including US$1.6 million for urban
studies, as estimated at appraisal. Based on the average exchange rate the
credit met about 42X of the total actual cost. Approximately US$203,000 of
the total credit amount was cancelled.
ii.       The principal objectives of the project were:  (a)  to continue
with the improvement and extension of Lahore's water supply, sewerage and
drainage system; (b) to develop an efficient public utility organization
which would be competent to continue the implementation of a proposed ten
year investment plan; and (c) to develop an urban project which IDA sub-
sequently helped to finance (Credit 1348-PAK).
iii.      The credit became effective without delays (para. 3.01).  Project
start-up and implementation, however, proceeded much more slowly than
anticipated at appraisal because: (a) local funds were not promptly made
available at start-up (para. 3.02); (b) the lack of appropriately trained
and experienced technical staff caused serious delays in the preparation of
detailed design and tender documents (para. 3.04); (c) assistance by external
consultants was either insufficient (UNDP) or delayed (ODM) (para 3.07); and
(d) cost overruns necessitated revisions in the project scope (para. 3.03)
and caused delays in project execution (para. 3.05). Some elements of the
project were completed about four years later than forecast at appraisal
(para. 3.06). Credit disbursement was similarly affected (3.11).
iv.       The total project cost amounted to about US$62.3 million as com-
pared with the appraisal estimate of US$47.9 million. The cost overrun of
30.1 percent was met by additional funding from the Government of Punjab



-vii-
(GOPUN) and WASA's own equity contributions. Broadly, price escalation due
to late implementation represents over 60% of the total cost over-run, and
about 40X was due to underestimation of civil works costs (para 3.14).
v.        WASA's overall financial position has been improved satisfactorily
(para 4.09). The current organizational structure functions well (paras.
5.01 and 5.02). Its present staffing level 'para 5.08) and its accounting
system (5.07) are also satisfactory.
vi.       The project was successful in all major aspects.  The main project
objectives have been met and the physical componenZs implemented, albeit with
substantial delays (para 3.02). The latest tariff adjustment in July, 1983,
together with improvements in operational efficiency, helped WASA to make
good progress towards meeting the revised financial covenants agreed with IDA
(paras 4.01-4.04).
vii.      The project illustrates the need for allowing for sufficient time
in project implementation schedules for institution building and human
resource development. For more effective project execution it might have been
appropriate to extend or intensify the assistance of external consultants,
but then the effect of learning by doing might have been less beneficial for
WASA (para 8.04). The provision of adequate local funds at project start-up
should generally be a condition of loan effectiveness (para 8.03).
viii.     Much emphasis was placed on dealing with the physical implementa-
tion problems of the project, possibly at the expense of the operational
aspects; particularly in respect of cost recovery and the need to reduce
operating costs. This was recognized late in the life of the project, and an
attempt was made to rectify the situation by the preparation and implementa-
.tion of an Operational Action Plan (paras 4.01 and 4.02). Among other
things, the Plan involved a tariff adjustment; more energetic pursuit of
illegal connections; zoning the distribution to reduce system losses and
waste; reduced pumping and improved measurement of power consumption at the
well-heads; and changing over customers, who were billed on a percentage of
property value to metered status in an accelerated conversion program.
ix.       The Operational Action Plan produced the desired effect, although
not all the specifics could be achieved. For example, the attempt to cut
back on pumping and reduce operating pressures led to operational difficul-
ties and consumer complaints. Nevertheless, operating costs were sig-
nificantly reduced. For example, one reduction was achieved by paying the
electricity supply authority for power used on the basis of measured
kilowatts, instead of on rated installed horsepower and hours of working
which had become the practice because of the urgent need to commision new
well-heads. Further reductions in operating costs were made through the
conversion of electrically operated units to natural gas at the well-heads.



-viii-
x.        At the time the Operational Action Plan was prepared by the Bor-
rower IDA also demonstrated its flexibility by lowering the covenanted rate
of return from 6X, to be achieved in FY 1983 and thereafter, to a 3.5 rate
of return to be achieved not later than FY 1986, in a staged recovery. WASA
in FY 1985 is actually achieving a 4.8% rate of return on its assets (para
4.04).
xi.       The continued sucLess of the principles of the Action Plan, will
depend on due attention being paid to maximizing WASA's operating efficien-
cies at the minimum level of expenditures, coupled with increased revenue
collection and timely tariff adjustments. This is particularly relevant
because of the new investments in sewerage and the high operating costs of
the large sewage pumping stations, soon to be followed by wastewater treat-
ment facilities.
xii.      Lahore is fortunate in that it now enjoys a water supply 24 hours
per day and a comprehensive sewerage system which effectively removes was-
tewater from the city environs. For this situation WASA and its dedicated
staff are to be commended, yet there is no room for complacency. The service
needs continue to grow as the city expands while requests for increases in
tariff levels are met reluctantly.

SECOND LAHORE WATER SUPPLY. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The water supply of Lahore has been drawn for more than one hundred
years entirely from groundwater. The existing water supply system, developed
in several stages from 1930 onwards, uses tubewells installed in central
L-.hore. Rapid growth of the city has required major expansion of the system.
tes!des groundwater there also are potential sources of surface water at a
distance from Lahore, but economic evaluation revealed that surface water
supply might be seven to eight times more expensive as long as local
groundwater would not recede below the level of 350 feet. The current level
averages about 50 feet and is quite stable.
1.02      The first water-borne sewer system at Lahore was introduced in
1937. By 1967 there were 12 independent sewerage systems of about 100 miles
(161 km) discharging untreated wastes into drainage canals and the Ravi
River. In 1976 about 60 percent of the city was sewered without any provi-
sion for satisfactory disposal.
1.03      Drainage is a problem in Lahore because of the flat terrain and the
need to pump storm water, as well as "sullage water" 1/, over the city's
flood protection bund (during high flood levels) into the Ravi River. After
heavy rains, storm water mixed with sewage floods the streets, causing health
hazards to the population.
1.04      In 1969 a Master Plan for water supply, sewerage and drainage
(which was part of the Phase I project in Lahore) was prepared by consult-
ants. This Master Plan still represents the long range development plan of
which this IDA financed project was a part. UNDP funds were used, with ae
Bank as executing agency, to update the 1969 Master Plan; and to identil a
ten year investment plan for water supply, sewerage and drainage in Lahora up
to 1986; to prepare the project in 1974/75; and to initiate institutional
imp?ovements.
1.05      The appraisal of the project took place in March/April and Septem-
ber 1975, and a well balanced package of physical components was proposed for
the improvement and expansion of the existing water supply, sewerage and
drainage facilities; combined with measures for strengthening the implement-
ing agency, WASA, and training staff. The project, estimated to cost US$
46.3 million plus US$1.6 million for urban studies was found suitable for a
credit of US$26.6 million which was approved by IDA on May 11, 1976.

1.06      The project was implemented between August 1976 (effectiveness) and
December 1983 (closing). Due to delays in execution and cost overruns the
project had to be revised in June 1979, and the closing date was extended by
two years. Most of the physical components were implemented as planned and
WASA, the responsible public utility organization, satisfactorily improved
its effectiveness. The total project cost increased to US$62.3 million and
the additional costs were borne by the GOPUN and WASA.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      The water supply, sewerage and drainage project is part of a long
range program to rehabilitate and expand these facilities in Lahcre, the
capital city of the Punjab Province of Pakistan. Lahore is the second
largest city in the country, after Karachi. The need for the project arose
from the rapid population growth in Lahore from 2.2 million people in 1972 to
3.2 million people in 1983 (the present growth rate of the city's population
is about 3.35 Z per annum), and from the consequent strain of maintaining
adequate water supply service coverage. This required developing new sources
of water, strengthening the distribution arrangements and reducing leakage
and wastage of scarce supplies. The growth in population and the increased
quantities of water arriving in the city also necessitated improvements in
sewerage and drainage.
2.02      The first operation, which helped prepare this project, was
appraised in April 1967 and completed in July 1972. It had three objectives:
(i) to create an efficient institution; (ii) to develop a Master Plan for
Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage; and (iii) to carry out rehabilitation of
existing facilities and some new construction. The first objective was
finally reached in September 1975 when GOPUN created a semi-autonomous Water
and Sanitation Agency (WASA) under the Lahore Development Authority (LDA).
WASA has a Managing Director who also holds a seat on the board of the LDA.
A Master Plan for water supply, sewerage and drainage was completed in
October 1969 and some rehabilitation and new construction works were carried
out between 1969 and 1972. The first project largely attained the objectives
of meeting Lahore's urgent water supply requirements and improving sewerage
services, but with a resulting cost overrun of 120 percent, more than half
of which arose from a project revision in 1969.
2.03      In 1974 UNDP agreed to finance further studies in preparation for
the project. The Bank as executing agency directed the activities of the
engineering consultants and other consultants for financial, operational and
managerial improvements within WASA. The report presented by the consultants
in September 1975 included the updating of the 1969 Master Plan and the
identification of a ten year investment plan up to 1986, a hydraulic study, a



-3-
tariff study and the redesign of accounting, billing and collection systems.
The project package covered the first 3 years of the investment plan.
2.04      The staff appraisal report (SAR) dated April 13, 1976 was based on
the consultant's report, on information obtained by supervision missions to
review progress on the first project, and by the April and September 1975
appraisal missions. The consultant initially proposed an investment
estimated to cost US$54 million equivalent, with investments in water supply,
sewerage and drainage respectively in the approximate proportions of 53%, 30X
and 17%. However, because of (1) the GOPUN'S wish to proceed cautiously with
water supply development until more was known about the groundwater hydrol-
ogy, (2) the concern that the increases in rates and tariffs to support an
investment of this size would be difficult to impose and collect; (3) the
priority being placed on sewerage at this time; and (4) the need for WASA's
new management to substantially improve its operational and financial perfor-
mance the proposed project was reduced in scope to about US$44 million equiv-
alent; 50X for water supply, 47% for sewerage and drainage. The shortfall was
proposed by WASA for inclusion in a future project. The balance of 3% was for
studies to develop an urban project.
Negotiations and Approval
2.05      An IDA credit of US$25.0 million proposed to finance about 54
percent of the cost of the project including duties, or about 60% excluding
duties, was approved by the Board on May 11, 1976. An additional suaz of US$
1.6 million was included for urban studies making a total IDA credit of
US$26.6 million. The loan agreement between the Bank and GOP was signed on
June 8, 1976.
Major Objectives of the Project
2.06      The primary objective of the project was to continue and improve
upon the work started in the first project, to develop an efficient public
utility organization and to implement a three years construction program. On
completion of construction WASA would then be competent to continue the
implementation of the remainder of the proposed ten years investment plan
through improved management, financial and technical standards assisted by
training program included in the project. LDA would develop an urban project
which subsequently received IDA assistance and is on-going (Credit 1348-PAK,
Lahore Urban Project).
Project Description
2.07      The main components of the project consisted of the extension or
construction of new facilities to improve the water supply and sewerage and
drainage systems of Lahore. The project as originally appraised in 1976
consisted of the following:



-4-
(a) Water Supply
(i) ubewells. Construction of 47 tubewells each with
a capacity of 4 cfs (113 l/sec).
(ii) Mains. Instadlation of five miles of tubewell-associated
transmission mains and 38 miles of main grid.
The mains include 33 1/2 miles of asbestos
cement pipe up to 24 inches diameter and 9 1/2
miles of reinforced concrete pressure pipe
over 24 inches diameter, the largest size to be
used. (Total 43 miles).
(iii) Distribution Networks. Construction of 150 miles of
distribution network ranging from 6 inches
to 8 inches in diameter for extensions,
reinforcement and replacement.
(iv) Operations. Creation of a hydrology cell,a leak
detection and repair cell, the implementation of a
planned preventive maintenance program, the metering of
tubewells and creation of a control center for tubewell
pumping and the implementation of arrangements for the
proper surveillance of water quality and monitoring of
the ground water table. Appropriate spare parts, vehicles
and equipment were included.
(v) Offices, housing and training. Construction of offices for
operations and maintenance engineers,of housing for key
staff required to be available for emergencies, and of
training facilities.
(b) Sewerage and Drainage
(i) Trunk Sewers. Laying of about 17 miles of trunk sewers
in sizes from 21 inches to 78 inches diameter.
(ii) Collectors. Laying of about 285 miles of collector
sewers in sizes from 9 inches to 18 inches diameter.
(iii) Sewage Pumping Stations. Construction of four new pumping
stations at Shad Bagh, Nawankot, Multan Road, and Shadhara,
and increasing the capacity of the Main Outfall pumping
station.
(iv) Sewage Treatment. Construction of a waste stabilization pond
of about 75 acres at Shad Bagh, and an environmental study
of the Ravi River.



-5-
(v)  Vehicles, equipment, housing, offices and training.
Provision of facilities for project supervision and
operations, and the training of staff including vehicles,
equipment and a training unit.
(vi)  Drainage. Construction or rehabilitation of
secondary drainage channels - some 21 miles in
total.
(c) Urban Studies. Preparation of studies designed to address the
urban problems of Lahore (traffic management, city growth, etc.)
and to help prepare an urban project.
2.08      A comparison of the scope of the originally appraised project, the
first revision in June 1979, and the project as finally executed is shown in
Annex 1. The project also included a study to be made by the Lyallpur
Agricultural University and the Institute of Public Health Engineering for
selecting crops which may be safely irrigated by raw sewage.
2.09      To improve WASA's technical standards in the design of water supply
and sewerage facilities about 18 man months of assistance by consultants
financed by UNDP on the detailed design of the project was provided. The
consultants also assisted the hydrology cell of WASA to make pulmping tests
and collect data to develop long range programs for the management of urban
water in Lahore and its vicinities, and assisted the leakage and repair cell
by provision of a leakage survey specialist. The remaining 32 man months of
a total input of about 50 man months in consulting services was for assis-
tance to WASA in procurement activities, construction supervision, and
acceptance testing of completed work.
2.10      There was also provision for a management team in the project on
engineering management, finance, leak detection, operation and maintenance
of water and sewer systems and training, totalling approximately lg8 man
months financed by ODif. A function of the team was to establish a training
unit and to train counterpart and other staff. An important feature of the
training program was the provision of a small residential training school
capable of classroom training of twenty staff members at a time. WASA also
proposed, and later implemented, a planned preventive maintenance program
with the assistance of specialist engineers provided by ODM.
2.11      The urban study included in this project comprised services to
assist LDA in preparing a project in the old Walled City for slum upgrading,
traffic management and a sites and services development for low-income
groups. Assistance was also givext to LDA in planning urban development on a
metropolitan scale, and in training of staff (including study tours over-
seas).

Project Agreement
2.12      In the Project Agreement the following conditions were included,
inter alia:
(a) Section 2.02. In order to assist WASA: (i) in the preparation
of plans documents, the evaluation of bids, the award of contracts
and specifications, the preparation of bidding documents the super-
vision of the carrying out of the Project; and (ii) in staff train-
ing, leakage detection, maintenance operations and hydrological,
environmental and sewage irrigation studies; WASA as agent of the
LDA, shall employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and
terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the
Association.
This condition has been met by WASA for part i with the assistance of
consultants financed by UNDP, and for part ii with the assistance of
consultants financed by ODM.
(b) Section 2.03. In order to assist WASA in the improvement of its
accounting and management systems and procedures, WASA as agent
of the LDA, shall employ accounting and management consultants
whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment shall be satisfactory to the Association.
This condition has also been met by WASA with the assistance of consult-
ants financed by ODM.
(c) Section 2.06. WASA shall furnish to the Association promptly upon
their preparation, the plans, specifications, reports, contract
documents and construction and procurement schedules for the
project, and any materia'l modifications thereof or additions
thereto, in such detail as the Association shall reasonably
request.
This condition has been largely met with some delays.
(d) Section 2.10. The Government shall cause the LDA and WASA to carry
out and complete by December 31, 1977, or such other date as may be
agreed with the Association, an environmental study of the River
Ravi and the use of sewage for the irrigation of crops with the
assistance of consultants whose qualifications, experience and
terms and conditions of employment shall be mutually satisfactory
to the Association and the Government and undertakes to exchange
views with the Association regarding the implementation of any
recommendations for legislative action arising from such study.



-7-
An environmental study of the Ravi River and the use of raw sewage for
the irrigation of crops was carried out by WASA. However, the results
of these studies by themselves do not allow final conclusions to be made
on the method to be used for the future treatment of sewage effluents.
Legislative action was initiated by the Government.
(e)  Section 2.11.  The Government shall cause the LDA to carry out and
complete by December 31, 1978, or such other date as may be ag-eed
with the Association, the urban development and traffic studies
included with the assistance of consultants whose qualifications,
experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be mutually
satisfactory to the Association and the Government.
This condition has been met by LDA and led to approval of the IDA
assisted Lahore Urban Project, Credit 1348-PAK.
(f) Section 3.03. WASA shall, within three months of the date of
Agreement, establish a training unit that will be responsible for
introducing and carrying out, in a manner and in accordance with a
timetable satisfactory to the LDA and the Association, a plan of
action for staff training to ensure that an adequate number of
trained staff are available to manage, operate and maintain its
plant, equipment, properties and facilities.
The training unit was established with the assistance of ODM financed
consultants, and training courses and staff training continues on a
regular basis.
(g) Section 3.06. The Government shall cause the LDA and WASA to
undertake and complete by June 30, 1978, or such other date as may
be agreed with the Association, a survey of the whole of WASA's
service area to determine the number and legality of water and
sewer connection in the said service area, with a view to improving
WASA's billing procedures.
This condition has been met by WASA, and billing and collection has been
considerably improved.

III, PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness
3.01      A condition of credit effectiveness was the execution of a sub-
sidary loan agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA between GOP,
GOPUN, LDA, and WASA for onlending the proceeds of the credit to LDA and
WASA. The date of effectiveness was scheduled for September 15, 1976. The
above condition was met ahead of schedule and the credit was declared effec-
tive on September 21, 1976.
Start-Up
3.02      Start-up was slow and delays occurred for a variety of reasons.
Initial delays were caused to some extent by problems which WASA encountered
as a recently created organization:
(a) The initial lack of updated street plans and accurate contour maps
delayed the preparation of detailed design and tender documents.
(b) The implementing agency's unfamiliarity with the Bank's guidelines
on procurement delayed the finalization of tender documents for
international bidding and awards. Document revisions and reviews
were time consuming and continued well into the project; pre-
qualification procedures should have been more stringent. Cost
estimates for major construction work proved too low because of
high inflation during 1977-81 and poor contractor performance.
Rebidding was necessary because of contractor inefficiency and
delays occurred in obtaining funds to meet cost over-runs.
(c) WASA's unawareness of government regulations requiring the approval
of the project document (P.C.I) as a prerequisite for the release
of funds from the GOPUN loan to WASA of PRs 205.1 millions which
were meant to cover 40 percent of the project cost. This had a
ripple-effect on the whole startup of the project. It seems that
neither WASA nor IDA realized the importance of the approval of the
P.C.I. document at that time.
Revisions
3.03      The delays accumulated during the start up period resulted in a
slippage of the implementation schedule of the project to more than one year
at the end of 1978. First bid evaluations and contract negotiations during
1978 made it obvious to WASA that the scale of increased expenditure against
that originally estimated would make a project revision unavoidable. The
major changes in project work and cost are shown in Annex 1 and 2. They



-9-
resulted in a substantial reduction (61X) of the length of trunk sewers and
collectors to be laid and the deletion of all drainage works. For water
supply the length reduction was about 23Z. The most significant cost
over-runs occurred with sewage pumping stations and trunk sewers because the
originally sanctioned amounts were made up of cost estimates which were based
on the provincial government fixed rates. These rates were frequently
unrealistic when applied to the scale and difficulty of work to be undertaken
under the project. Additionally, the scale of sewerage works exceeded any-
thing previously built in Pakistan. It was later agreed that these fixed
rates were not applicable to major works which were supported by external
funding and open to international bidding. The reduction in scope of work
did not materially affect the overall concept of the project. Towards com-
pletion of the project in 1983 some minor revisions, caused by increased
expenditure, became necessary again.
Implementation Schedule
3.04      At appraisal the completion date for the project was estimated as
December 1979. At the end of 1978 the overall slippage of the implementation
schedule had already accumulated to more than one year, due to initial delays
which were mainly caused by WASA's limited experience and capacity in the
preparation of detailed design and tender documents and late availability of
funds from the provincial government (para 3.02).
3.05      Most of the construction work did not start before 1978, and was
almost one year behind schedule on the average. Construction problems arose
in some cases because of poor planning and design, and from the public
obtaining "stay orders" from the courts preventing entry to construction
sites. However, most of the delays in construction were caused by the inex-
perience of local contractors with projects of this scale. On the other
hand, international contractors were not attracted by larger civil works or
interested in joint ventures with local contractors. Payment delays, infla-
tion, terms for repayment of advances along with under-pricing of contracts
led many contractors to abandon work, rather than lose more money by trying
to complete contracts they had been uneconomically awarded. This in turn
led WASA to rescind contracts and start the bidding procedure again, thus
adding more delays to the construction schedule. Future works should allow
realistic advances for contractor mobilization, and permit market prices to
operate at the bidding stage, unclouded by the engineer's estimate as to the
target price.
3.06      When the project revision took place in June 1979, it was con-
sidered possible to complete the project by December 1982, but several occur-
rences partly outside of WASA's control (para 3.05) made the achievement by
this date impossible. The project was completed in June 1984. The total
delay in the project implementation was about four years. The original
completion dates estimated at appraisal and the actual for the most important
physical components of the project are as follows:

(vi)  New Drains                        Mid 1978           (abandoned)
3.07      Originally about 18 man months of assistance by UNDP financed
consultants were allocated to assist WASA in the preparation of detailed
design and tender documents, and 32 man months were to be used for assistance
in procurement activities and construction supervision. The consulting
services consisted of one resident advisor, on site at Lahore, and visits of
coordinators and technical specialists for specific inputs (ground water for
example). When it became evident that the original completion date would not
be met, WASA requested a further extension of consultant's services through
the end of 1982, which were then provided up to a total of 136 manmonths.
This more than trebled the funding required for this item. The consulting
firm which assisted WASA was well qualified and performed its work with
diligence and comprehension. In addition to UNDP financed consultants, WASA
was provided operational and management assistance under the ODM program.
At the initial stage of the project difficulties were encountered in staffing
the program. In view of this lack of impetus and a corresponding lack of
interest on the part of WASA, very little was achieved until the end of 1978.
The ODM program was then extended into a second phase, up to 1983, and
finally reached its objectives to improve engineering and financial manage-
ment, and to establish permanent training courses at WASA.
3.08      Most of the contractors used had no previous experience with laying
sewers in deep excavations, or with other projects of this scale.  There were
two factors relevant to the selection and use of local contractors:
(a) The exemption from ICB procedures of (i) water main rehabilitation
works; (ii) secondary construction works; and (iii) operational



-11-
buildings. The Project Agreement (Schedule B) allowed WASA to
award 11 out of 16 civil works contracts to local contractors using
GOPUN and WASA regulations which did not provide for preselection
of contractors which otherwise could have excluded inexperienced
and financially weak contractors from bidding.
(b) The GOPUN/WASA regulations in turn were very rigid in terms of
escalation and payment which lead many contractors to interrupt
work and caused most of the delays during the construction period
(para 3.05).
The adherence to stricter bid qualification procedures could have avoided or
reduced the delays which occurred with inexperienced and financially weak
local contractors. This problem was eventually overcome and local contrac-
tors completed the major works to a high standard. Periodical shortages of
cement and steel also caused problems for contractors, combined with the lack
of proper equipment and deficient management at construction sites.
3.09      The civil works elements of the project are considered to be of
fully acceptable quality.
3.10      WASA's problems with procurement were also administrative and
managerial. Throughout the project there were formal and frequent (but not
well integrated) contacts between the design, procurement and construction
directorates. Decisions on the award of contracts were taken mostly by the
Managing Director on recommendation of the procurement directorate. The need
for improved coordination was recognized and was being addressed. Same types
of problems which arose are listed below:
(a) Pipes: Large quantities of pipes of different diameters were
ordered in the beginning of the project without arrangements being
made for the procurement of special pipes and fittings such as
bends, tees, reducers, etc. This resulted in delays in laying
water supply pipelines. The pressure standards and wall thicknes-
ses of imported pipes differed from that already used in the sys-
tem. This caused connection problems at the time of execution and
resulted in cost increases. Inadequate arrangements for pipe
testing allowed local factories to produce and try to supply some
sewer pipes of doubtful quality. This problem was overcome through
closer supervision of the manufacturing process.
(a) Pumps: The contract for vertical turbine pumps was first given
to a firm which failed to meet any date set for the supply, despite
several meetings held in the presence of IDA supervision missions.
The contract had to be rescinded and re-awarded after fresh inter-
national tendering. Another firm supplied 18 submersible pumps
which all failed after six months of operation because of improper
insulation of the electrical motors. The case went to arbitration.



-12-
A decision was rendered with a dissenting opinion and so far no
financial settlement has been reached. In both instances IDA's
procurement guidelines were followed to determine the lowest
evaluated bidder. However, the procurement department of WASA,
before award, expressed reservations about both suppliers' inten-
tions with regard to complying with specifications, which unfor-
tunately proved to be correct. Finally, procurement of the pumps
was accomplishe4 by WASA in a satisfactory manner, but with sub-
stantial delays and cost over-runs.
Disbursements
3.11      Because of the implementation delays noted in paras 3.04 to 3.06
actual disbursements lagged considerably behind the appraisal estimate. At
the end of 1979, at which time the loan was to have been fully disbursed,
actual disbursement totalled about US$11.9 million or about 45 percent of
the credit amount. It took eight and three quarter years to disburse the
credit instead of five years as anticipated at appraisal. Disbursements as
expected at appraisal are compared with actuals below:

Fiscal Year
Until 1980, the actual disbursements follow a pattern quite similar to that
envisaged at appraisal, after allowing for the initial slippage (para. 3.03).
Thereafter it took another four years to disburse about US$10 million or 382
of the Credit.
Project Cost
3.12      The project cost was estimated at appraisal as PRe 474.06 million
(US$47.9 million equivalent), of which PRs 304.24 million (US$30.7 million)
was local and PRs 169.82 million (US$17.2 million) foreign cost components.
The project was expected to be completed by December 1979. The project was
scaled down in June 1979 and the cost estimate was revised to PRs 579.84
million. This cost estimate was later (in December 1982) revised to PRB
683.68 million. The final cost of the project is PRs 669 million or
approximately US$62.3 million at the average rate of exchange over the
project period.
3.13      The SAR estimated a base project cost of PRs 95.3 million (US$9.6
million), which was being the direct foreign cost requirement for equipment
and services. Leaving aside the urban study, but including a UNDP contribu-
tion to project implementation and the physical contingencies of 20% and



-14-
price contingencies of 8 to 10 percent per annum for equipment, the total
became of PRs 152 million (US$15.3 million). In practice the total project
foreign cost of the works as completed amounted to PRs 156.98 million
(US$14.6 million); US$13.5 million without the urban studies. The close
similarity between the estimated foreign requirements and the actual is
largely explained by the reduction in project scope. Had all the project
components been built as originally envisaged, there would have been a for-
eign exchange over-run of about 15% instead of an apparent saving of about
5%, in dollar terms.
3.14      The cost over-runs on civil works equipment and other local cosc
components were due to a mix of factors as explained in paras. 3.02 and 3.03.
The major variations occured in the following components.
(a) Water Supply: The actual cost of civil works material and equip-
ment for well construction, pumphouse mains and distribution lines
amounted to PRs 276.12 million vs PRs 214.65 million at appraisal.
The increase of 29X was mitigated by the reduction of mains (26
miles vs. 43 miles envisaged) and distribution lines (122.6 miles
vs. 150 miles envisaged) in the original project, and later revised
in June 1979. The length of distribution and mains, actually laid,
approximates closely with the 1979 revision.
(b) Sewerage, Drainage: The actual cost of civil works materials and
equipment for pumping stations, trunk sewers and collectors
amounted to PRs 297.20 million vs PRs 205.65 million at appraisal.
Trunk sewer lengths were modified from 17 miles at appraisal to
12.3 miles, actually laid, and secondary collectors from 285 miles
to about 106 miles. The rost increase of 45% occurred mainly due
to cost underestimating, inexperience of local contractors, price
escalation and other reasons explained in paras 3.04 to 3.06.
3.15      The cost over-runs were met by additional funding from GOPUN and
WASA's own equity contributions.
Reporting
3.16      Generally WASA adhered to the Bank's reporting requirements, but
sometimes with delay. Initially Progress Reports were prepared, nineteen of
these covering the period April 1976 to May 1979. These were then replaced
by Quarterly Reports, which in fact were prepared alternately with
semi-annual reports, i.e., every six months. Additionally, special monthly
reports, manuals and memoranda were submitted to the Bank throughout 1983
for monitoring of an Operational Action Plan (see paras. 4.01 and 4.03).

IV. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Covenants
4.01      In the Project Agreement the following financial covenants were
specified, inter alia:
(a) Section 4.02 WASA shall: (i) have its accounts and financial
statements (balance sheets, statements of income and expenses and
related statements) for each fiscal year audited, in accordance
with sound auditing principles consistently applied, by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association who shall be appointed as
WASA's auditors for at least two consecutive fiscal years prior to
the commemcement of the first such fiscal year; (ii) furnish to the
Association as soon as available, but in any case not later than
six months after the end of each such year, (A) certified copies of
its financial statements for such year as so audited and (B) the
report of such audit by said auditors of such scope and in such
detail as the Association shall have reasonably requested and after
it has been reviewed by the LDA; and (iii) furnish to the Associa-
tion such other information concerning the accounts and financial
statements of WASA and the audit thereof as the Association shall
from time to time reasonably request.
This covenant was generally met by WASA, however, with some delays.
(b) Section 4.03. To assist the LDA and WASA in carrying out the
Project, the government hereby undertakes that it will (i) make
a loan to the LDA for use by WASA of an amount in Pakistan rupees
equivalent to twenty-one million dollars ($21,000,000) on terms and
conditions mutually satisfactory to the Association and the Govern-
ment; and (ii) continue to transfer to WASA during each fiscal year
until June 3, 1986, not less than 42.5X of urban inmovable property
taxes collected in Lahore in each fiscal year.
This covenant was complied with by the GOPUN. The initial delay in loaL
disbursements was caused by WASA's inexperience with government regula-
tions and administrative procedures (para. 3.02).
(c)  Section 4.04.  The Government shall cause its Excise and Taxation
Depar;ment to provide WASA each month with details of any changes
in the annual rental value of properties situated within Lahore.
This covenant was generally met by GOPUN.
(d) Section 4.05. (a) The government, the LDA and WASA shall (i) take
all such action as shall be necessary on their part to modify



-16-
WASA's charges for water in a manner satisfactory to the Associa-
tion by not later than January 1, 1977; and (ii) except as the
Borrower and the Association may otherwise agree, take all steps
(including, but without limitation, adjustments of WASA's tariff
structure or the overall levels of such tariff) as shall be
required to provide WASA with revenues sufficient to produce an
annusl rate of return on the average value of WASA's net fixed
assets in operation of at least 4% in fiscal years 1978 to 1980, 5%
in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 and 6% in fiscal year 1983, and
thereafter.
This covenant could not be met by WASA. In the fiscal years 1978 to
1980 the annual rate of return on the average value of WASA's net fixed
assets dropped from 7.5 percent in 1978 to 0.5 percent in 1979, and
increased to 1.23 percent in 1980. The rate of return remained
similarly low in 1981, with 1.90 percent, when WASA in consultation with
the Bank prepared a detailed Action Plan in Octcber 1982 for improving
efficiency of operations and an increase of tariffs. At the same time
the financial covenant was lowered from 6 to 3.5 percent rate of return
to be achived progressively by not later than FY 1986. The plan
included making special efforts on leak detection, additional metering,
updating record maps, pressure reduction, reducing operating costs and
increased revenues. The rate of return for FY 1984 was 4.8% indicating
a satisfactory and improved performance, and the overall effectiveness
of WASA's Action Plan.
Operating Results
4.02      WASA's projected and actual income statements, cash flow statements
and balance sheets for the fiscal years 1975 to 1982 are shown in Annexes 3,
4 and 5.
4.03      With a view to improving the financial position of WASA, GOPUN, in
1982, carried out a detailed study of WASA's financial position and put
forward an Action Plan wherein various proposals were made to improve the
financial position of the Agency. The Action Plan hinged on two main assump-
tions, first that WASA would supply water in two shifts instead of three, and
second,that water tariffs would be increased each year from 1983 to 1985. It
was expected that as a result of a two-shift operation WASA would not only
curtail its expenditure on electricity but also on payroll. The first
assumption of the Action Plan could not fully be implemented because of
severe reaction from the public. However, the second assumption in respect
of year 1983 was duly implemented. In spite of deviation from the Action
Plan the financial results were encouraging. During fiscal year 1983 the
revenues were 2.6% higher as compared with those of the Action Plan. The
water revenue exceeded the Action Plan targets by 10.6% whereas sewerage
revenues were short by two percent (2%). Total operating expenditure



-17-
exceeded that of Action Plan Target by about two percent. The 1.96Z rate of
return was better by .43% than that of the Action Plan.
4.04      In fiscal year 1985 revenue was slightly less (4.4%) than projected
mainly due to a shortfall in the property tax and miscellaneous income.
However, the operating expenditures were also less by 3X. WASA was still
able to achieve a satisfactory 2.2% rate of return thus exceeding the
requirements of the Action Plan, through its own efficiencies. The cash
shortfall on debt servicing is still existing and the GOPUN is actively
considering the rescheduling of debt liability.
WASA's Services and Uses of Funds
4.05      WASA's funds flow is shown in Annex 4.  Most of the additional
funding requirements due to cost overruns will be met by the allocations in
the 4th and 5th-Year Plan of OOPUN.
Consumer Charges
4.06      WASA revised its tariff and established the current methods for
billing early in the project on April 1, 1977. GOPUN has allowed IASA to
increase its tariffs three times since then, on October 1, 1980 when all
connections were charged an additional 3 rupees per month, on July 1, 1981
when minor changes were made, and on July 1, 1983. Effective July 1, 1981,
the annual rental values (ARV's) were revised which would have automatically
increased water revenues by about 25 percent. However, OOPUN subsequently
ruled that the revised ARV's could not be used for the calculation of
non-metered water charges and that the old ARV's would continue to be used
for this purpose. The most recent revision of tariffs became effective from
July 1, 1983 onward. This tariff structure is shown in Annex 6. As a result
of these revisions the tariff has increased about 20 percent since 1977.
4.07      Over the course of the project, Bank representatives have con-
tinually brought WASA's inability to meet the financial covenants of the
lending agreement (see para 4.01) to the attention of WASA management and
&OPUN. WASA has responded by developing tariff proposals which would
alleviate the situation, but these proposals were not accepted by OOPUN to
the extent which IDA considered necessary.
4.08      IDA also suggested that any future tariff increase for metered
domestic service reflect a block tariff structure which would establish a
"life-line" rate for minimum consumption, and at least two blocks at progres-
sively higher rates for the average and over-average consumer. It was fur-
ther proposed that the commercial-industrial rates be separated from the
domestic rates and that these rates be higher than those for domestic serv-
ice. WASA agreed to utilize this approach. Separate domestic and commercial
rates were announced effective July 1, 1983.



-18-
Financial Position
4.09      WASA's financial position seems likely to improve further.  It was
expected that at the end of fiscal year 1985 the amended rate of return of
3.5Z would be achieved and perhaps exceeded. The financial target set for
fiscal year 1985 has already been met (para 4.04). COPUN however, will have
to ensure that any further need for increases in water tariff will be duly
implemented. For its part, WASA would have to ensure that the program of
conversion of unmetered connections to metered, and other measures, are
closely monitored and implemented as espoused in the Action Plan. It would
be preferable if some part of future increases could be levied on sewerage,
which is estimated currently to have a lower financial rate of return than
water supply.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
5.01      With the creation of the LDA in 1975, its subsidiary agency WASA
inherited responsibility for water supply, sanitation and drainage for
Lahore. Previously, water supply and sewerage had been under the control of
the Lahore Improvement Trust (LIT) which was part of the municipality. WASA
is under the direction of a Managing Director (MD), who reports to the Direc-
tor General of LDA. There have been three different MD's during the course
of the project since April 1976.
5.02      During the period of the project the organization of WASA under
the MD has varied from time to time. Por much of the time, there was one
Deputy Managing Director (DMD), but this post has now been divided into DMD
(Engineering) and DMD (Operations and Maintenance). Beneath the DMD posi-
tion, the organization is divided into functional groups, each headed by a
Director. The number and functions of these groups also has varied during
the period of the project. The presert (July 1983) organizational set up is
shown on Annex 7. These arrangements are functioning well and the organiza-
tion is stable.
Operational
5.03      According to estimates made in 1976, the average daily water demand
for the population of 1,696,000 then served by WASA was 113.0 IMgd, or 30
percent less than the production estimated at 79.5 IMgd. In the investment
plan it was envisaged 2,736,700 people would be served in 1983 and 3,300,000
in 1986, for which the corresponding average day demand was projected to be
184 IMgd in 1983 and 234 IMgd in 1986. WASA's long term planning was based
on the assumption thet the coverage of water supply services would increase
from 67 percent in 1976 to 77 percent in 1983 and 88.2 percent in 1986. This
would be achieved partielly by reducing the unaccounted water (including



-19-
public and illegal use, leakage and other unaccounted), estimated to be as
high as 63 percent in 1976, to about 40 percent by 1982, and by added produc-
tion. The increase in production by adding 47 tubewells under the project
was estimated to be about 76 IMgd by 1983, with the estimated unsatisfied
demand of about 15 percent being met by better control over leakage and
wastage. As no meters were installed on most of the tubewells, WASA could
not know for certain how much water was produced. Metering of tubewells
carried out under the project has since revealed that due to voltage fluctua-
tions, wear of pumps and other reasons, the average daily production in 1983
was actually about 125.5 IMgd.  Against a figure of 87.9 IMgd estimated for
average daily consumption in 1983, the total unaccounted for water was some-
what less than predicted (30 percent vs 40 percent). The conclusions are:
(a)  Production estimates were overestimated at appraisal.  Future
projects should be based on revised production figures.
(b)  Service coverage and average daily demand might be less than
assumed at appraisal, which calls for revisions in WASA's long term
planning.
(c)  The leak detection program executed under the project contributed
successfully to the reduction of unaccounted water.
(d)  The Action Plan assumed an average daily production of 146 IMgd
(663,716 m3), whereas the actual production is somewhat less.
5.04      The estimate of sewage flows was based on the assumption that 80
percent of the average day's water consumption enters to the sewers. The
1986 design sewage flows from the existing and proposed sewerage collectors
was calculated to be 348.32 cfs or 187.4 IMgd, for 3,549,500 people served
(100 percent coverage). This could be an overestimate. For a city such as
Lahore, it is difficult to be precise about the extent of the increased
coverage of the sewered area. However, in the light of the lower water
supply production figures (para 5.03), design of sewage flows would also have
to be revised for a future project, also taking into account privately
developed supplies contributing to the system.
5.05      For the operation of the major elements of the project, tubewells
and sewage pumping stations, WASA still requires to train more operators and
station managers. For other elements, such as water supply transmission and
distribution lines, and sewers and collectors, operational standards are
adequate. WASA takes considerable pride in having executed the project, and
the indications are that the installation will be well maintained.



-20-
Procurement
5.06      Throughout the project, procurement has presented various problems
for WASA, resulting in many cases in delays in the award of contracts, or
even the need to retender as offers passed their validity dates. WASA proce-
dures have meant that, in the past, many months have been required to invite
bids, evaluate them and award a contract. Non-adherence to the Bank's
procurement procedures also arose, resulting in tenders being rejected and
orders being cancelled. A point of concern was WASA's lack of adherence to
acceptable bid procedures as set out in the Bid Procedures and Construction
Manual prepared under the project. Acceptance of late bids, of letters
modifying bids, and negotiations with bidders were commonplace. Raising of
"letters of credit", "no objection certificates", etc. has been a problem for
WASA as have all procedures involving other government departments where the
processes are very slow. Procedures laid out by the Bank and described in
manuals prepared by consultants for WASA's benefit should be closely followed
and studied by all staff in the procurement directorate.
Accounting
5.07      During appraisal and start up of the project, it was noted that
WASA's financial management, especially the planning function, had not been
strong. The situation worsened in 1979 when the post of the Deputy Managing
Director (Finance and Administration) could not be filled for several months,
and later was eliminated. Subsequently, it was determined that the-Director
Finance and the Director Revenue could effectively cover the appropriate
responsibilities. Also, many lesser posts in the Finance and Revenue Direc-
torates were vacant for some time. By the end of 1980, both positions were
combined and filled by an employee who was excellently qualified and capable
of handling both posts. From 1981 onwards, significant improvements were
made in WASA's accounting function. Its financial records, including
accounts and inventory controls, are being kept according to the standards
laid down by GOPUN. The present staff is adequately trained, and the billing
system is fully computerized.
Staff Recruitment, Training and Development
5.08      At the outset of the project, the optimum number of WASA staff to
be assigned to the project was agreed upon with the Bank. This requirement
covered all categories of managerial, technical and administrative staff from
MD to junior clerk. While actual staffing of the project by WASA varied
according to the work in hand, there was difficulty in filling the more
senior positions. The level of work experience of staff throughout the
organization was a matter of concern during implementation of the project.
To match the required project staffing levels, key senior staff were seconded
on a temporary basis from other agencies, young engineers having limited
practical experience were appointed to senior positions, and many positions
were filled on a temporary basis, appointments not being confirmed. This



-21-
inevitably led to problems of staff turnover, reassignments between posi-
tions, and a certain lack of commitment to the agency and its work. This
contributed to disruption and delay in implementation of the project (para
3.02).
5.09      In addition to these staffing problems in this young organization
seeking to implement a series of major projects, other factors adversely
affected staff morale and motivation in the early part of the project, such
as the working environment at WASA's principal office and the low level of
reward as compared with other government agencies based in Lahore, (and much
more so with the private sector). During the project, steps were taken to
improve the situation, with some measure of success. A possible problem has
been that WASA, in its position as an agency of the LDA, is not regarded
equally with other public utility authorities under direct federal or provin-
cial government control.
5.10      Other than technical development of WASA through implementation of
project works, an important area of project assistance related to specific
training and development inputs. A training school was provided and equipped
to assist in this purpose.  This effort was assisted by inputs from ODM, in
addition to the UNDP assistance. A substantial program of overseas training
fellowships was provided by WASA under this project and advantage has been
taken of this assistance. Eight senior WASA staff took up six-months fellow-
ships, one a ten-months fellowships, and two of the Managing Directors have
travelled on one-month study tours. It should be noted that several of those
receiving training under these fellowships have subsequently been transferred
into different fields of work.
5.11      There have been no long-term training programs operated at the
Training Center, but a series of short but useful courses covering a range of
subjects have been given, and are still continuing. The ODM team has ques-
tioned the usefulness of many of the courses given and there remains a need
for appropriate, more practical courses given by experienced personnel, and
for continuous follow-up. The ODM assistance significantly contributed
towards successful implementation of the project at an operational level.
Meanwhile, WASA has continued to develop and improve the relevancy of the
curricula of its training school courses.
Growth
5.12      During the main project period, 1976 to 1983, WASA increased by 29%
the number of customers for water supply services from 1.70 million people in
1976 to about 2.20 million people in 1983, corresponding to 91% increase of
service connections from about 120,000 to 229,536 over the same period. The
extension of sewerage and drainage services over this period is more dif-
ficult to assess (para 5.04) but migbt be in the same range for service
coverage. WASA's total staff increased from 2,563 (August 1975) to 3,377
(June 1983). The SAR envisioned a workforce of 2,500, which suggests some



-22-
level of over-manning. This increase was mainly due to the effect of govern-
ment employment policies and local political influences. Thus the number of
water supply service connecticns per employee stands at 68. Assuming a staff
distribution ratio of 40/60 between water supply and sewerage and drainage
services the number of connection per employee is about 170 which represents
a quite reasonable figure in terms of efficiency of water supply services in
developing countries. The financial aspects of the organization during the
project period is explained in para 4.02 and 4.03.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01      At the start of the project, WASA was a recently created organiza-
tion and there was ample concern that WASA would need time to build itself
into a viable institution. However, IDA acceped the risk of dealing with a
new institution and maintained its role in the long process of institution
building, making adequate provisions in the project for engineering support
to WASA with design and construction advice, and for a management team to
assist in operations and training. Generally the Bank was aware of WASA's
inherent problems at the time of appraisal, but possibly underestimated the
effect. Too much faith was given to the inputs of engineering consultants to
overcome many of these problems. The capability of WASA's managing director
at this time was unknown and had to be developed, and it was thought that
supervision missions would be able to correct and overcome problems sooner
than was actually the case.
6.02      The project was supervised on average at about six month intervals.
The Supervision Reports generally highlighted issues in project execution and
followed up with letters to the Borrower and the executing institutions
urging corrective actions where required. However, there was limited success
in avoiding delays and WASA, despite sincere effort on its part, had dif-
ficulty in meeting the financial covenants of the Project Agreement. When
the problems were diagnosed, through the preparation of the Action Plan (para
4.03), WASA reacted promptly to comply with the revised financial covenant.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Institutional Aspects
7.01      A major contribution of the project has been the strengthening of
the executing agency, WASA, particularly in the areas of project execution
and administration, and and financial management. At first, WASA had dif-
ficulties in recruiting qualified personnel, but this was eventually overcome
(para. 5.09). It took about two years for its technical and financial direc-
torates to become fully operative and competent to continue the implementa-
tion of a ten-year investment plan for the improvement of water supply
sewerage and drainage in Lahore.



-23-
Water Supply and Sewerage Improvements
7.02      WASA was able to expand Lahore's water supply system, albeit with
considerable delays, and to improve its wastewater and drainage system to
meet the needs of Lanore's urban population; and more specifically to provide
reliable 24 hours water supply, and to remove health hazards carried by
impounded sewage and storm water. Water production facilities were con-
structed as planned. Trunk and distribution lines were reduced by about 23%
by project revision (para. 3.03). Trunk sewers and collectors were reduced by
about 61%. Pumping stations were constructed as planned, but two pumping
stations were not completed until mid 1984 (para. 3.06). The project con-
tributed remarkably to providing and maintaining the highest standard of
water supply, sewerage and drainage services for Lahore as an example to
other cities of Pakistan. The overall design of the project reflects the
appropriate and current state of proven technology, under the conditions
prevailing in the country.
7.03      The objectives of the project regarding sewage treatment, reuse of
treated water, and protection of surface (Ravi River) and groundwater resour-
ces resulted mainly in an investigation of design criteria, the monitoring
water quality and the identifying of health hazards, rather than the provi-
sion of treatment capacity. It is expected that such treatment will be
required by 1986, and that sewage treatment works for Lahore will be built
in a future project.
Economic Evaluation
7.04      At project appraisal no attempt was made to derive an economic rate
of return for the water supply component, but the willingness of consumers to
pay the proposed metered price of PRs 3.0 per 1000 gallons of water was taken
as a surrogate. This was compared with an estimated long run marginal cost of
PRs 1.0 per 1000 gallons. The present metered rate is PRs 3.15 per 1000
gallons for domestic use and PRs 4.50 for commerce. These rates are equiv-
alent to PRs 1.70 and 1>s 2.45, respectively in 1976 prices. Increases in
charges for unmetered customers were also imposed in July 1983 (see Annex 6).
7.05      Ideally, the calculation of an economic rate of return for the
project would include a measure of the health benefits, or health costs
foregone because of the use of safe water in preference to other supplies,
which are likely to be polluted. Unfortunately, such information is not
available, but the benefits are real enough and commonly understood, though
not measurable.
7.06      For the sewerage component a 1% rate of return was estimated on the
basis of land value enhancement by drainage and recycling of wastewater to
irrigate about 5000 acres of land. However, the drainage improvements were

treatment plant was built in lieu of the 75 acres of stabilization ponds
originally planned.
7.07      Project funds were used to provide heavy drain cleaning and dredg-
ing equipment which is now being operated by WASA to improve drainage and
remove environmental nuisance. Similarly, the "pilot" treatment is being
operated, in conjunction with the Public Health Engineering Faculty of Lahore
University, to establish important parameters for the design of the com-
prehensive wastewater treatment facilities to be built in the future.
Presently, all of Lahore's wastewater is being discharged untreated into the
Ravi River and, while it is being used agriculturally, it poses health risks
which may negate other benefits. The calculation of a rate of return for
this component therefore is not possible, because of the difficulty in iden-
tifying and quantifying the benefits.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Conclusions
8.01      Apart from execution delays, the project was successful in all
major aspects, namely:
(a) the infrastructure provided by the project performs as expected,
and contributes to improved health standards of the urban popula-
tion (paras. 7.02 and 7.03);
(b) WASA has developed into a well-run organization (para. 7.01).
Lessons Learned
8.02      This project confirms the importance of adequate project prepara-
tion. The project was appraised on the basis of preliminary engineering
designs, and of estimates of cost according to government fixed rates which
were unrealistic when applied to the scale and difficulty of the works of the
project (para. 3.03). This resulted in revisions to the project scope and
cost during implementation (para. 3.03 abd 3.12).
8.03      After loan effectiveness, local funds for the project could not be
made available at the time because of WASA's inexperience with government
regulations. Guarantees on the provision of adequate local funds at project
start-up generally should be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.02).
8.04      Institution building and human resources development required more
time than expected at appraisal. For more effective project execution, it
might have been appropriate to extend or intensify the assistance of external
consultants, but then the effect of learning by doing may have been less than
desired for WASA (para. 3.07).



-25-
8.05      Much of the delay in completing the Phase-II Project should not be
attributed to any lack of effort on WASA's part. During the course of the
project there was the world oil crisis which among other things caused abnor-
mal price escalation. The total 1979 (June) revised project cost, for
example, rose from about Rs 580 million to Rs 669 millions. Better planning,
more realistic prining and quicker tendering decisions could have offset this
effect, perhaps marginally. However, any project executed during a period of
severe economic crisis was bound to suffer implementation problems and high
cost over-runs.
8.06      It seems clear that excessive concentration on the execution of the
physical components of the project may have been at the expense of the opera-
tional improvements. These might otherwise have been achieved faster if both
IDA and the Borrower had focussed on this issue earlier. The importance and
impact of the efficiency of WASA's operations was highlighted when difficul-
ties arose in obtaining tariff increases to meet the covenanted financial
targets. It had been well demonstrated that the reduction of operating
expenditures should be the first area to be tackled in any cost recovery
plan.
8.07      The preparation and implementation of the Operational Action Plan,
at the Borrowers initiative, proved a turning point. For the first time WASA
examined in a comprehensive manner every facit of its operations, tightened
up its controls and implemented a number of well thought out actions to
achieve agreed goals. Once the plan was accepted WASA reported progress to
IDA on a monthly basis, and this further imposed a discipline on the entity's
staff to ensure that the separate measures, for which they were individually
responsible, succeeded.
8.08      This was a major engineering project for WASA and the staff must be
given full credit for the quality of the final product and the significant
improvement in service rendered to its consumers. Operational efficiencies
have been achieved in service delivery, planning, design, implementation and
administration, in which WASA can take pride. Purthermore, these improve-
ments are being carried over into its on-going operations and can be used as
a model for other public utility operations in the Punjab, and throughout
Pakistan.
