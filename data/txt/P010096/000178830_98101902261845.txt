REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR THE SECOND LAHORE
WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent
of US$26.6 million on standard IDA terms to help finance the Second Lahore
Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Project. The proceeds of the credit
would be relent to the Province of Punjab on the same terms as the credit,
and the Province in turn would onlend it to the Lahore Development Authority
(LDA) and the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) for twenty-five years,
including 5 years of grace, with interest at 8-3/4% per annum, except during
the grace period when interest would be waived.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Recent Trends and Development
Prospects" (1023-PAK, dated March 1, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 10, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as Annex 1.
3.        The economy of Pakistan (then West Pakistan) expanded at an
average annual rate of more than 6% during the decade of the 1960's. In
the Second Plan period (1960-65) this growth was spearheaded by industrial
growth of 13% per annum. During the Third Plan (1965-70) agricultural out-
put grew at 6.2% annually with the aid of new high-yielding wheat and rice
varieties, compared with less than 4% in the first half of the decade, but
the industrial growth rate fell to 8.6%.   During the 1970's, however, the
growth rate has been considerably lower.   During fiscal years 1970/71 and
1971/72, there was virtually no change in total output as political uncer-
tainties and the conflicts culminating in the separation and independence
of East Pakistan resulted in a decline in industrial activity, while drought
virtually halted agricultural growth. Since the return of civilian rule
in late December 1971, growth has been modest. After two years without
growth, the GNP grew by 7% in FY1973, but the increase declined to 5% in
FY1974 and in FY1975 it was less than 3%. Industrial expansion was the result
primarily of fuller utilization of capacity.
4.        In FY1975, Pakistan suffered a series of setbacks.   These included
record low river flows reducing irrigation and hydroelectric power, a deteri-
oration of about 20% in the terms of trade, and falling export demand caused
by the general world recession. In addition, because of damage to the
stilling basins, repairs to the Tarbela Dam have taken longer than expected
and irrigation potential will probably not be available till late in FY1976.
However, there have also been important positive developments, including an
acceleration of public investment, some upturn in private investment, closer
economic ties with, and capital flows from, the Middle East oil-producing

- 2 -
countries, the reopening of relations with Bangladesh, and prospects for a
slowdown in world and domestic inflat[on.
5.        In FY1975 the output of the major agricultural crops may have
declined by 3% or more owing to lack of water. River flows during the 1974
summer crop season were the lowest in the past 90 years. Fall and early
winter canal supplies were only 40% to 50% normal. Heavy rains in the
summer of 1975 make prospects for FY1976 quite bright. Good harvests are
expected for rice and sugarcane, although some flooding in Sind Province
will reduce cotton production. In late 1974 the government lowered agricul-
tural export duties and in early 1975 it announced higher procurement prices
and higher prices to consumers, which will help eliminate some food subsidies.
Procurement prices will probably need to be raised further, however, in order
to give sufficient incentive to production. Other government programs which
should assist agricultural growth are those to increase the supply of high
quality seed, to improve cultural practices through agriculture extension, to
increase availability of fertilizer, and to reduce water-logging and salinity.
With the increasing desire of small and medium-scale farmers to participate
in the "green revolution", agricultural growth in the next five years could
accelerate if appropriate pricing policies are followed and if adequate
priority is given to supporting services and programs. Substantial increases
in production in FY1977 can be expected when water from the Tarbela reservoir
becomes available.
6.        Domestic savings rates have declined steadily since 1969/70,
dropping from 13% to 5.6% of GDP in FY1975. Private savings declined from
12.1% to 6.5% of GDP over the same period while public savings moved from
+1% to -1% of GDP. Public savings will have to be substantially increased
if a satisfactory rate of growth in the future is to be maintained and
excessive reliance on external borrowing avoided. In recent months, the
government has taken some significant steps to reduce subsidies, restrain
other non-development expenditures, and increase revenues from Govern-
ment enterprises. These have included substantially higher prices for
wheat, vegetable ghee and sugar, a doubling of the price of natural gas,
and higher electric power and petroleum product prices.
7.        After more than a decade during which prices rarely rose more
than 2 to 3% annually, Pakistan has been experiencing price increases of 20%
to 30% annually since early 1972. Since mid-1973 the growth of the money
supply has been limited to about 14% annually by monetary and fiscal
restraint. At the same time (late 1973) that these restraints began to
curb domestic inflation, however, international prices began to increase
sharply. The dollar prices of imports rose by 37% in FY1974 and by a fur-
ther 20% in FY1975. Dollar export prices rose 52% in FY1974, but declined
by 2% in FY1975. With the presently lower rates of international inflation,
however, the rate of price increase in Pakistan has declined. For the first
half of FY1976 wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 5%, compared with
26% during FY1975.
8.        The deterioration in Pakistan's balance of payments resulting
from increased imports, particularly of goods related to investment, and of



- 3 -
wheat, and the adverse changes in the terms of trade, are reflected in an
increase in the current account deficit plus debt repayment from US$239
million in 1972/73 to US$665 million in 1973/74 and an estimated US$1,378
million in 1974/75. The deficit in 1974/75 has been financed principally by
aid from the Pakistan Consortium and from OPEC countries, which enabled
Pakistan to finance its balance of payments deficit in 1974/75 with only about
US$116 million of short-term borrowing and some draw-down of net reserves.
Indications of atd at the May 1975 meeting of the Pakistan Consortium amounted
to about $660 million and were significantly higher than in the previous year
and, combLned with expectations of assistance from OPEC countries and other
sources , suggest that long-term capital receipts may be sufficient to limit
new short-term credits in FY76. In the medium term, rising agricultural,
fertilizer and other domestic production should improve the current account
position, but the balance of payments as a whole will be adversely affected by
rising debt amortization payments, particularly after the end of the debt-
relief period in June 1978.
9.        Pakistan's external public debt at the end of June 1975 amounted
to about US$5.3 billion equivalent, of which US$1.2 billion was undisbursed.
At present Pakistan's debt service problem has been eased by the arrangement
concluded in June 1974 whereby countries participating in the Pakistan con-
sortium agreed to provide US$650 million equivalent in debt relief over four
years. In FY1975 the debt service ratio to export earnings and non-factor
service and factor income receipts was almost 18%. However, with the end
of the debt relief arrangement in FY1979, Pakistan's debt service ratio must
be expected to increase somewhat. It is therefore important that Pakistan
should make every effort to increase its domestic savings and exports and
that borrowing on conventional terms should be held to the minimum. For this
reason the major part of Bank Group operations in Pakistan consists of IDA
credits. All the projects scheduled for Pakistan this year, apart from the
Third Window Loan for the WAPDA Power Project, will be financed by IDA
credits. Including undisbursed amounts, Pakistan's debt to the Bank and
IDA now represents about 16% of its external public indebtedness; by 1980
this ratLo is likely to fall to about 13%. The share of the Bank Group in
total debt service (after taking account of the debt relief which Pakistan
will receive from other creditors) is now about 23%, but is expected to
decrease to about 9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
10.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclu-
sive of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the
former East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.2 billion. During
its long association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in
almost all sectors of the economy. Through FY1975, 43% of total commitments
were for public services, 24% for agriculture, 22% for industry, 10% for
industrial imports and 1% for education. Lending for public services has
amounted to nearly US$500 million and has included loans and credits for



- 4 -
railways, electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, telecom-
munications and water supply. A large part of past lending for agricul-
ture was for Indus Basin projects. The lending for industry has been mainly
through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC).
For most projects for which loans and credits are being disbursed, construc-
tion is now going ahead satifactorily. The principal problems being en-
countered are that the rates charged by some of the public services have
not kept pace with inflation and, hence, some utilities are not earning the
return which they need. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans
and IDA credits as of February 29, 1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
11.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.     One
of these is to support the directly-productive sectors of the economy, to
increase production of import-substitutes such as foodgrains, edible oils,
fertilizer and engineering and capital goods and to sustain export growth
in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial
and agricultural products. The main part of Bank Group assistance for
Lndustry will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as
PICIC, the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and the National
Development Finance Corporation (NDFC) which provides finance primarily
for industries in the public sector. The most important part of future
lending for agriculture is expected to be for the Government's new pro-
gram to increase productivity in the Indus Basin by controlling salinity
and improving the utilization of surface irrigation and groundwater. The
Bank is the Executing Agency for a UNDP technical assistance grant for
improving agriculture and water planning in the Indus Basin.
12.       Another objective is to support the necessary expansion and to
improve the institutions which are responsible for the principal public
services which have benefitted from Bank Group lending in the past, namely,
the Telegraph and Telephone Department, Water and Power Development Authority,
Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company and WASA, the successor
of the Lahore Improvement Trust Water Wing (LITWW). The present credit will
assist in the extension of water supply, sewerage and drainage for Lahore, the
second largest city in the country and the capital of the Punjab.
13.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. This proposed shift,
which implies increased lending for agriculture and rural development, will
involve significant lending for projects complementary to the Indus/Tarbela
works. This may involve both large drainage projects and smaller-scale
projects this shift has already occurred in terms of staff time devoted to the
preparation of projects in rural development, livestock and forestry.
14.       Further in support of the third objective, and at the Government's
request, Bank missions have been working with municipal authorities on the
plans for the urban development of Karachi, whose population now exceeds 4
million. A Karachi master plan was completed in 1974 with the assistance of
consultants financed by UNDP, and urban projects are being developed within



the framework of this plan. In view of the preparatory work which has already
been done on urbanization problems of Karachi, there are good prospects for
worthwhile participation by the Bank Group in this area, beginning with a
project in the Lyari section of the city. The Government has also asked the
Bank to study urbanization problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city.
Planning in Lahore is at a much earlier stage than in Karachi and the immediate
need is for technical assistance. Studies on urban developmment and traffic
in Lahore are included in the present project. A mission to examine problems
of urbanization and regional development of smaller cities and on a country-
wide basis visited Pakistan in March 1975.
15.       The emphasis being given to agriculture and to "new style" projects
in rural and urban development - projects which often have an exceptionally
low foreign exchange component - justifies the financing of some local ex-
penditure in specific cases, such as the proposed project. Limiting IDA financ-
ing to only foreign exchange costs would mean that the Association would be
unable to make a substantial contribution to the financing of individual high
priority projects in the most strategic development sectors. Furthermore, to
make an adequate contribution to meeting Pakistan's overall external capital
requirements without financing local costs, the Association would either have
to finance an excessively large number of projects or projects with lesser
priority but a higher foreign exchange content.
16.       Among the projects now being prepared for your consideration are
a third education project, an urban project in Karachi (Lyari improvement),
and an irrigation and drainage project in Sind. All of these projects have
been appraised. Preparatory work is also proceeding on a loan for a fertilizer
project, in which IFC may participate, a livestock project, a rural development
project and further irrigation and drainage projects.
17.       IFC has made nine investments in Pakistan for a total of US$28
million, of which US$20.7 million was by way of loans and US$7.3 million
by equity participations (these are shown in Annex II). About US$11 mil-
lion remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three
in the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in
steel, cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE IN PAKISTAN
18.       At present, the water supply, sewerage and drainage sector in
Pakistan is still in an early state of development. Only 50% of the esti-
mated 17 million people living in urban areas in Pakistan in 1972 had access
to piped water. This supply is often of .poor quality or intermittent. Of the
rural population of about 48 million, only about five percent had piped water
supplies. Waterborne sewerage systems exist in some parts of the larger
cities, serving only 15% of the urban population. In most other urban areas,
human and solid wastes are collected by sweepers. Only parts of some cities



- 6 -
have surface drainage systems and as the terrain is generally flat, floods are
commonplace during the rainy season. Moreover, rapid population growth places
a growing strain on existing public services.
19.       Development of water supply, sewerage and drainage is a pro-
vincial responsibility. In the bigger provinces - Punjab and Sind - these
functions are the responsibility of separate Public Health Engineering
Departments. In the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Baluchistan
they are assigned to the Public Works and Irrigation Departments respect-
ively. The cities of Karachi and Islamabad have development authorities
which, inter alia, deal with water supply, sewerage and drainage. In 1975,
the Punjab Government established the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) with
responsibility for planning and development in the Lahore urban area. Fol-
lowing discussions with the Association, the Provincial Government also
created a semi-autonomous Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) under the LDA
in January, 1976. WASA has its own Managing Director, who is a member of
the LDA Board, and adequate powers to operate the water supply, sewerage
and drainage systems within the city of Lahore, to maintain its own funds
and accounts and to make its own rules.
20.       The Government aims to reduce the number of people who are not
served with water supply, sewerage and drainage as rapidly as possible.
For the period 1976-1981, PRs 1,989 million has been tentatively allocated for
the expansion of water supply and sewerage. WHO has recently carried out
a sector study under the WHO/IBRD Cooperative Program and its report is
now under preparation.
Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage in Lahore
21.       At present the water supply of Lahore is drawn entirely from tube-
wells. However, the water table in the area is receding because of increased
pumping for agriculture as well as for public and industrial supply. This
has led to the abandonment of many tubewells and to increased pumping heads
in the wells still operating. Most water supply services are unmetered and
many householders leave their taps open or fail to repair leaking taps.
Because of the high rate of leakage and wastage and the low standards of
operation and maintenance it is not possible to maintain adequate pressure in
most of the distribution system.
22.       At present about 40% of the city is sewered and drained.     The number
of directly connected premises is unknown but is estimated to be one quarter
to one third of the total. Waste water is used for irrigation and the surplus
is discharged into the Ravi River.
23.        In 1967 the Association and the Swedish International Development
Authority made credits totalling US$3.5 million equivalent to help finance
the first phase of expanding and improving water supply, sewerage and drain-
age in Lahore. This project had the three objectives of creating a public
utility type institution, developing a master plan for water supply, sewerage
and drainage and carrying out some rehabilitation and new construction works.
Despite a delay of about two and a half years, and a cost overrun of about



- 7-
120%, more than half of which resulted from a project revision, the project
largely attained the objectives of meeting Lahore's urgent water requirements
and improving sewer service. The institutional objectives were not fully
achieved as the Lahore Municipal Corporation at that time agreed to the
creation of the Lahore Improvement Trust Water Wing (LITWW) intended only to
carry out that project. This caused uncertainty about LITWW's future, af-
fected the attitudes of its top management, brought about a high turnover
of staff and partly explains the lack of success in implementing administra-
tive and technical systems developed for long-term use. The Government
has recognized these deficiencies and, as indicated above (para 19), the
creation of WASA should help to overcome these problems in the future.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The proposed project is the second phase, covering a three-year
period, of a program for expanding and improving water supply, sewerage
and drainage in the Lahore area. The primary objective is to continue and
improve upon the work started in the Phase I project and to develop an effi-
cient public utility organization. The project has been prepared by the
Government of the Punjab with the assistance of consultants (Camp, Dresser &
McKee - USA and A.F. Fergusons - Pakistan) under a UNDP technical assistance
project for which the Bank is the executing Agency. It was appraised in April
and September 1975. The Appraisal Report (No. 996a-PAK) is being distributed
separately. A credit and project summary is attached as Annex III. Negotia-
tions were held in Washington during March 1976. The delegation was led by
Mr. Sarfraz Malik Khan, Joint Secretary, Economic Affairs Division.
Project Description and Implementation
25.       The proposed project includes the following main components:
(a) Water Supply
(i) The construction of about 47 tubewells and about 5 miles
of tubewell-associated transmission mains and the construction
or rehabilitation of about 38 miles of main grid and about 150
miles of distribution network;
(ii) The improvement of operations by the creation of a hydrology
unit and a leak detection and repair unit, the implementation of
a planned preventive maintenance program, the metering of tube-
wells, the creation of a control center for tubewell pumping,
and the carrying out of a training program;
(b) Sewerage and Drainage
(i) The construction of about 17 miles of trunk sewers, about
285 miles of collector sewers, 4 new pumping stations and the
extension of 1 existing pumping station and a prototype waste
stabilization pond of about 75 acres;



(ii) The construction or rehabilitation of about 21 miles of
secondary drainage channels.
(iii) The carrying out of an environmental study of the
River Ravi and the use of sewage for the irrigation
of crops.
(c) Offices, Buildings, Vehicles and Equipment
The provision of additional offices, operational buildings,
equipment and maintenance facilities for WASA;
(d) Training
The provision of training facilities and implementation of a
training program for WASA staff.
(e) Lahore Urban Development and Traffic Studies
The carrying out of studies of slum rehabilitation, housing and
social services and traffic in the Lahore area for the prep-
aration of urban projects for possible Bank Group financing.
These studies were originally intended to be financed by the UNDP,
which does not now have the necessary resources.
26.       The project will be implemented, with the assistance of consultants,
by the WASA, which has taken over the staff of the former Lahore Improvement
Trust Water Wing (LITWW). Part of the cost of consultants for the water
supply sewerage and drainage project will be met by the UNDP under a technical
assistance project for which the Bank will be the executing agency. In
addition, the Ministry of Overseas Development (U.K.) (ODM) will provide 15
man-years of management and other specialist services. Project construction
is expected to begin about January, 1977, and to be completed at the end of
1979. The urban and transportation studies will be carried out by the LDA
with the help of consultants and are expected to be completed by the end
of 1978.
Project Cost and Financing
27.       Total project costs are estimated at US$47.9 million including
US$17.2 million in foreign exchange. Of the total cost, about US$23.0 million
will be for water supply, US$21.9 million for sewerage, US$1.4 million for
drainage and US$1.6 million for the urban and traffic studies. A physical
contingency of 20% has been included in the above estimates because most of
the works are below ground and because the project has major components on
which there has been little past experience in Lahore; price contingencies
have been provided at 10% for equipment and 14% for civil works in 1976, and
at gradually declining rates thereafter, reaching 8% for equipment and 12% for
civil works in 1979 (US$6.7 million on local costs and US$3.4 million on
foreign costs).



- 9 -
28.       Of the proposed credit of US$26.6 million, US$25 million would cover
about 60% of the cost (net of duties and taxes) of the water supply, sewerage
and drainage components of the project and would finance the foreign exchange
costs and about US$10.0 million of local costs. The additional US$1.6 million
would finance the urban development and traffic studies. The UNDP would
finance about US$0.6 million of the cost of engineering consultants. The
remaining cost of the project will be financed by a loan of US$21.0 million
equivalent from the Province of the Punjab.
Procurement and Disbursement
29.       All procurement of equipment and civil works, except for water
main rehabilitation, secondary drainage construction and buildings in total
costing about US$2.0 million, will be on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. In addition, any
contract for water supply, sewerage and drainage equipment estimated to cost
less than US$50,000 equivalent with an aggregate of such contracts not ex-
ceeding US$500,000 equivalent, shall be awarded in accordance with local
procedures which are satisfactory. It is likely that civil works contracts
will be awarded to local contractors who will obtain equipment and materials
under the credit. Some participation by Pakistani manufacturers is envisaged
and a margin of preference of 15% of the c.i.f. price or the prevailing
duties, if lower, would be applicable. Disbursement would be made against
100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and of local expenditures
(exfactory) for domestically produced equipment, 50% of local expenditures or
100% of foreign expenditures for civil works, and 100% of total expenditures
for consulting services. A summary of the cost estimates and estimated
disbursements is shown in Annex III.
Financial and other Covenants
30.       WASA's predecessors, the Lahore Municipal Corporation and the Lahore
Improvement Trust Water Wing (LITWW) operated at a loss of the order of PRs 1
to 3 million annually for the past several years. These losses were caused by
low tariffs, abnormally high operating costs and lack of proper maintenance.
In 1967 responsibility for water and sewerage was transferred to the newly
created Water Wing of the Lahore Improvement Trust and water rates were
doubled but the losses continued. Also, only about 30% of the billings have
been collected, with the result that accounts receivable have risen to more
than one year's billings. The billing records contain many errors and do not
include all the charges that should be billed. Moreover, billing is, on an
average, six months -in arrears. The consequence is that LITWW has had to use
some loan and grant funds to meet its operating expenses. In January, 1975
flat rate water charges were increased from PRs 6.00 to PRs 12.00 per month
and metered- water charges from PRs 1.50 to PRs'2.00 per 1000 gallons for
domestic consumers and from PRs 2.00 to PRs 3.00 for commercial and industrial
consumers. This has improved the financial position although actions to
improve billings'and- collections have yet to show results (see para 32).



- 10 -
31.       At present about 92% of all water connections are unmetered and
are charged on a flat rate based on pipe size or a percentage of an Annual
Rental Value (ARV) assessed by the Provincial Excise and Taxation Depart-
ment (PETD). A recent tariff study concluded that, because of the low produc-
tion cost of water, universal metering is not justified. It is therefore
proposed that only connections of industrial and commercial establishments
using water as part of the working process, and domestic properties with large
gardens or where cattle or horses are kept should be metered. After January,
1977, all unmetered connections will be charged on the basis of the ARV of the
premises. Sewerage and drainage are not charged directly but 42-1/2% of the
property taxes collected by the PETD is allocated to WASA.
32.       In order to put WASA on a viable financial basis, the Provincial
Government, the LDA and WASA have agreed (Section 4.05 of the Project Agree-
ment) to put into effect a restructured tariff by January 1, 1977, and to take
steps to ensure that WASA's tariff will yield sufficient revenues to produce
annual rates of return on revalued fixed assets of 4% in FY1978 to FY1980, 5%
in FY1981 and FY1982 and 6% in FY1983 and thereafter. In addition, the LDA
and WASA have agreed (Section 4.06 of the Project Agreement) that they will
improve WASA's billing and collection system so that WASA's outstanding
receivables will be gradually reduced to 15% of the annual billings in 1982.
An important step towards this objective will be the carrying out of a survey
of WASA's water and sewer connections to be completed by mid-1978 (Section
3.06 of the Project Agreement). Furthermore, the LDA shall not incur further
long-term debt on behalf of WASA unless WASA's future net revenues are at
least 1.25 times its debt service. During the project period, WASA's capital
expenditures outside the proposed project would not exceed US$1 million per
year without the agreement of the Association (Sections 4.07 and 4.08 of the
Project Agreement). Allocations to WASA of part of the urban immovable
property taxes will be continued until FY1986 (Section 4.03 of the Project
Agreement).
33.       Particular attention has been given to WASA's need to attract
and retain capable staff by improved employment policies and the provision
of staff training. Accounting consultants financed under the UNDP tech-
nical assistance project have helped WASA staff to implement newly designed
financial management and accounting systems. The team of specialists to be
provided by ODM will continue this work and will also provide training in
engineering management, leak detection and repair, maintenance, procurement
and staff training. The Provincial Government, LDA and WASA have agreed
(Sections 2.02 and 2.03 of the Project Agreement) that WASA will employ
consultants for these purposes.
Justification
34.       Lahore has a population of about 2.5 million and is growing at about
4.35% p.a.. It is the second largest city in Pakistan and the capital of
the Punjab. The existing water supply, sewerage and drainage facilities are
inadequate in several respects. The water level in the aquifer is falling and
about 75% of WASA's tubewell pumps are defective. Leakage and wastage are



- 11 -
high, causing low and sometimes negative pressures in the pipes. This allows
the infiltration of polluted ground water into the mains, which gives rise to
health hazards. Only about one-quarter to one third of the population receives
direct sewer service and during the monsoon flooding is frequent. The proposed
project will help to alleviate these problems through improving WASA's effi-
ciency and capability, extending water supply, sewerage and drainage services
and reducing waterborne and fecal related diseases. Specifically, the project
would:
(a) increase the water service connections by 60% from 120,000 to
195,000 and the population served by 43% from 1.4 million
to 2.0 million. A large proportion of the increased connections
will be in the poorer areas;
(b) increase the sewered area by about 20% from which about 250,000
persons will derive benefit;
(c) improve the operations and institutional capabilities of WASA.
The benefits of the project, i.e., the improvements in health, quality of
life and environment cannot be quantified in economic terms.
35.       Lahore has an urgent need for public services to residential housing
and for the rehabilitation of low-income neighborhoods. There is also a need
for improved transportation and for improved urban planning which would relate
commercial employment, transportation, residential development and other
factors. Since the 1960's, when these problems were first identified, the
situation has deteriorated. The Province of the Punjab and the Government
desire to improve their ability to guide the physical and economic growth of
Lahore and to initiate development projects for which preinvestment assist-
ance and training are needed. The proposed urban development and traffic
studies are designed to meet some of the most urgent needs in this area.
Project Risks
36.       Although the project contains adequate provisions for assistance
to WASA by consultants in design, construction, operations and training,
it will take time to overcome institutional weaknesses inherited from the
LITWW. However, the present Managing Director of WASA is capable and with the
powers conferred on him, he should be able to provide the necessary leadership
to enable WASA to carry out the project successfully. Moreover, as the Chief
Minister of the Province is the Chairman of the LDA, important decisions once
taken should be implemented expeditiously. Close consultation between the
Provincial Government, LDA, WASA and the Association will enable problems that
may arise to be resolved promptly.
Environmental Impact
37.       The proposed project would benefit the environment in the Lahore
area by reducing the need to use shallow private tubewells which have a
high chance of being contaminated. It will reduce the need for private



- 12 -
sewage and night soil collection arrangements.    About 40 ponds scattered
throughout the city will be drained, reducing odors, nuisances, insects
and health hazards. To reduce the health hazards of the present practice
of using raw sewage and sullage water for irrigation, the Provincial
Government will initiate a study of crops that may be safely irrigated
by raw sewage. Also, a long-term program of monitoring the quality of
the River Ravi downstream of Lahore will be carried out to assist in planning
the appropriate standard of sewage treatment (Section 2.10 of the Project
Agreement).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Association and the Province of the Punjab, the Lahore Development Authority
and the Water and Sanitation Agency, the Recommendations of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
39.       Features of the Development Credit and Project Agreements of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 30 to 33 and 37 of this report.
The execution of the Project Agreement and of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
between the Borrower and the Provincial Government specified in Section
3.01(b) of the Development Credit Agreement are additional conditions to the
effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement.
40.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
41.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
Credit No. 50        Education:  US$8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 1964;
Effective Date: August 14, 1964; Closing Date: June 30,
1976
Project implementation, originally scheduled for four years has
been delayed by eight years, due to cumbersome administrative procedures,
wars, floods, labor unrest and price escalation. Despite delays and cost
inflation, the total project cost in US dollars will be within the appraisal
estimate because of the devaluation of the Pakistan rupee in 1972. Civil
works are 95% completed; equipment procurement is also virtually completed
except for the Polytechnical Institutes at Sind. The technical assistance
program has been completed. Disbursements to date amount to 92% of the Credit
and are likely to amount to 98% by June 30, 1976, the final Closing Date.
Loan No. 548         Tarbela Dam:  US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1968;
Effective Date: August 2, 1968; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first
impoundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one
of the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reservoir, in the course
of which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is
nearing completion. Agreement was reached with the parties to the Indus
Basin and Tarbela Development Fund Agreements whereby special contributions
were made by a number of the parties and IDA (Credit 581-PAK) to help meet
the costs of the repairs and additional remedial works. Meanwhile, the
reservoir was filled to within 20 ft. of the maximum pool level in the sum-
mer of 1975 and irrigation releases have been made through the Service and
Auxiliary Spillways. Plans for filling the reservoir to maximum operating
level during the summer of 1976 have now been finalized.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 8
Loan No. 590         Development Finance Company - PICIC:    US$40.0 Million
Loan of March 21, 1969; Effective Date: May 21, 1969;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date
of March 31, 1974 was postponed first to September 30, 1975 and then to
September 30, 1976, the current date, to enable disbursements to be made
for the last sub-project.
Loan No. 621         Railways:  US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969; Effect-
ive Date: August 28, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
About 80% of the Loan has been committed, and it is anticipated
that the project will be virtually complete by June 1977. To provide for
reimbursement of commissioning expenses during the following year, however,
the Closing Date, formerly December 31, 1975, has been extended to June 30,
1978. The main outstanding item is construction of the first stage of a
new marshalling yard at Pipri, near Karachi. The location of this yard
was changed twice following protracted investigations and negotiations bet-
ween various agencies and planning authorities. Consultants have modified
the design of the yard for the new location, selected to reconcile urban
planning and railway marshalling objectives, and construction is underway.
While progress on improvements to the main line, which will permit removal
of speed restrictions has been rather slow, a new timetable for passenger
and goods trains was introduced in November 1975. This should help to
improve utilization of motive power and rolling stock, especially freight
wagons, eventually producing large cost savings.
Credit No. 157       Agricultural Development Bank:   US$30.0 Million Credit
of June 26, 1969; Effective Date: September 23, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Although the Closing Date of this credit has passed, minor dis-
bursements are expected to continue into April, 1976, as the last tractors
ordered under the project are shipped. The Government has requested a fur-
ther credit for ADBP and discussions are taking place concerning the measures
necessary to remedy ADBP's financial and managerial problems.
Credit No. 177       Development Finance Company - IDBP:    US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Effective Date: June 25,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its
liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The
original Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to December 31,
1977. The Credit has been fully allocated by IDA. Progress has been
achieved on the Bangladesh liabilities issue. The major problem remaining
is the large arrears in IDBP's portfolio and its consequent effect on liquid-
ity. The liquidity problem has been temporarily eased with borrowings from



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 8
the Government but the long-term portfolio prospects will depend mainly
on developments in the textile sector which accounts for a large portion
of IDBP's outstandings. Disbursements amounted to $18.0 million as of
March 26, 1976.
Credit No. 206       Engineering Education:   US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Effective Date: July 14, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
The project is now about 24 months behind schedule. The physical
facilities of the project are expected to be complete nine months before
the Closing Date (December 1976), except for about 15% of the equipment
purchases, which are linked to the Technical Assistance program. This
program, if implemented, will require at least two years extension of
the Closing Date because of delayed recruitment of experts. Progress in
staff development is unsatisfactory, mainly because of low staff salaries.
Suggestions for improvement have been made to the Borrower during the
supervision visit. Project costs on civil works are expected to exceed
the appraisal estimates by 85% in rupee terms, but total project costs
are unlikely to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$6.3 million due to
the 1972 devaluation of the rupee.   Disbursement remains slow but is ex-
pected to improve in FY76 with the completion of the physical facilities.
Credit No. 213       Power Transmission and Distribution:    US$23.0 Million
Credit of August 13, 1970; Effective Date: December 11,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Implementation of the project, which had improved during the
past year, has suffered a further setback and the Closing Date has been
postponed for the second time, to June 30, 1977. The new delay is caused
by additionaL claims of Yugoslavian manufacturers on which negotiations
have now been completed.
Credit No. 422-PAK Third Karachi Port: US$18.0 Million Credit of July 19,
1973; Effective Date: December 14, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
The contracts for the construction of four shipping berths and
two transit sheds at Juna Bunder, and for the reconstruction of Napier
Mole Bridge were awarded, in June and October 1975 respectively, to the
same joint venture, National Construction Company (NCC) of Pakistan and
Chriastiani &S Nielsen (CN) of Denmark. Site work is due to commence pre-
sently. Materials for permanent way and pipes and fittings have been
ordered, and work on operational buildings is proceeding. However, there
have been delays in appointing consultants for supervision and in com-
mencing other parts of the project, such as the proposed study of KPT's
dredging fleet. Over 90% of the Credit allocation has been committed.

1974; Effective Date: September 18, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The four bids received for construction of the oil berth have
been reviewed and are presently under more detailed assessment by the
consultants & KPT. In view of the bids received, significant cost over-
runs appear likely. Consultants have not yet been formally appointed by
KPT for preparing contract documents for dredging works and dredger pro-
curement. The credit implementation is now some 18 months behind the program
prepared at the time of appraisal. No disbursement from the Credit has been
made to date.
Loan No. 961         Industrial Investment:  US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign cur-
rency liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.
Progress has been made in solving that problem although some pending matters
are still under discussion with the Government. The other major problem is
the large arrears in PICIC's portfolio and its consequent effect on liquidity.
The liquidity problem has been temporarily eased with borrowings from the
Government but the long-term portfolio prospects will depend mainly on dev-
elopments in the textile sector which accounts for a large portion of PICIC's
outstandings. Disbursements amounted to $10.7 million on March 26, 1976.
A new loan is under consideration.
Credit No. 466      Flood Rehabilitation:   US$35.0 Million Credit of
March 18, 1974; Effective Date: May 15, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1976
The general imports and civil works categories of this credit have
been fully disbursed. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1975 was post-
poned one year to permit completion of procurement of specialized spare
parts for the repair of construction and farm machinery.
Loan No. 988        Multan Fertilizer:   US$35.0 Million Loan of May 24,
1974; Effective Date: July 30, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. Work on major offsites
such as roads, railroad tracks and utilities is complete and plant construc-
tion is proceeding vigorously. Staff recruitment and training is increasing
steadily. The most likely potential problem appears to be the late delivery
of a few critical items such as heat exchangers and boilers, which could delay
startup by several months.

Credit No. 510       Third Telecommunications:   US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Effective Date: October 25, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This credit is proceeding satisfactorily though still at an early
stage. Procurement action for all the main equipment items is well-advanced
Reorganization of T&T to a form more suited to its commercial-type operation,
wlhich was an agreement of the first Telecommunications Credit and reiterated
in the Credit Agreement of 510-PAK, has not progressed. A Government ap-
pointed Committee was to have formulated by December 31, 1975, the steps
required to achieve this reorganization.
Credit No. 546       National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):    US$30.0
Million Credit of May 15, 1975: Effective Date: July 17,
1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
This credit was made effective on July 17, 1975. Commitments
amounted to $3.6 million and disbursements to $0.7 million on March 26, 1976.
Loan No. 1107        Fourth Sui Northern Gas:   US$60.0 Million Loan of
May 15, 1975; Effective Date: July 5, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Engineering and procurement are on schedule, as is construction,
despite unusually heavy rains and floods during late summer. Progress on
the purification facilities is falling behind original plans. Two problems
facing the Borrower are delivery delays due to congestion at the port of
Karachi and the loss of skilled craftsmen to the Middle East. The project
is expected to be completed on time and well within the estimated cost.
No action has been reported on the government's obligation to make a
reservoir study of the Meyal field by December 31, 1975 and the Bank has
taken the matter up with the Government.
Loan No. 1208T       Power Transmission:   US$50.0 Million Loan of
February 18, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
This loan is not yet effective.
Credit No. 620       Seed Project:   US$23.0 Million Credit of March 29, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
This credit is not yet effective.

Procurement
Arrangements:           All major items of goods and civil works required
for the project would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding, except water main
rehabilitation and secondary drainage construction
costing about US$2.0 million, with domestic manu-
facturers accorded a margin equal to 15 percent
of the c.i.f. cost of competing imports or the
import duties for a non-exempt importer, whichever
is lower. In addition, any contract for water
supply, sewerage and drainage equipment estimated
to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent with an
aggregate of such contracts not exceeding US$500,000
equivalent, shall be awarded in accordance with
local procedures.
