MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON FIVE PROPOSED LOANS
IN A TOTAL AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$68 MILLION
TO FIVE YUGOSLAV ROAD ORGANIZATIONS
WITH THE GUARZANTEE OF
THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
1.       The following report on proposed loans to the Road Organizations
(ROs) of Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Vojvodina and Croatia in the
aggregate amou.it of US$68 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loans would be repayable in 15 years with 3 years grace at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate and would assist the ROs in further
development and rehabilitation of existing primary roads, improving
investment and maintenance planning including adjustments to road user
charges, and improving inter-republican/provincial cordination.
2.       Background.  There have been twelve previous  Bank-assisted
higoway projects in Yugoslavia which have supported road construction
investments, road rehabilitation, staff training and institutional
development. Previous projects have generally focussed on upgrading key
links in the primary road network with a particular emphasis during the
latter half of the 1970s on the heavily congested parts of the
Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH). Local staff training and the strengthening
of planning and design capabilities in the highway subsector have also been
a major focus of previous projects. Project Completion Reports (PCRs) on
previous projects up to and including the Ninth Highway Project
(Loan 1535-YU) have confirmed that these projects were generally
implemented on schedule and substantially achieved their main objectives.
However, the slowdown in the economy since 1981 and an increasing shortage
of funds for the subsector have brought a need for better financial
discipline and greater care in establishing the balance of allocations
between new construction and rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing
road network.  A combination of rapid inflation, depreciation of the dinar
and a lag in adjusting road user charges --a specific tax on fuel which
provides the major share of highway funding-- had a major impact on the
highway investment and maintenance programs. Because of the shortage of
funds, both the Tenth ane Eleventh Highway Projects were included under the
Bank's Special Action Program in early 1983. As a result, according to a
combined PCR for these projects, they were completed fairly close to a
two-year extended implementation schedule. Also in 1983, in its letter of
development policy issued in connection with the SAL (Loan 2326-YU),
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslvia (SFRY) stated its intention to
adjust road user charges in line with inflation. As in the event the
adjustments were not sufficient to keep up with inflation, the issue was
again addressed under the First Highway Sector Project (Loan 2715-YU) in
connection with which the Federal Government agreed to make adjustments as
needed to ensure adequate financing for road investment and maintenance
programs. This project introduced a comprehensive approach to development



Cl
in the highway sector in the four largest republics (Slovenia, Croatia,
Serbia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina), focussing on investment planning, road
user taxation and improved overall coordination in highway matters.
3.       Proiect Objectives.  The proposed project is aimed primarily at
assisting the four remaining ROs (Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and
Vojvodina), not included under the First Highway Sector Project, in
implementing their highway development programs and extending
institution-building efforts throughout the country.  Together with the
First Highway Sector Project, which recently became effective, the project
will extend the Bank's involvement to cover the entire Yugoslav highway
system. As such, the project will consolidate previous
institution-building efforts with particular reference to investment and
maintenance planning, road user charges, and inter-republican
coordination. Although included under the previous project, Croatia would
also participate in a pilot road maintenance management system component
under the proposed project. The project would support further development
and rehabilitation of sections of the TYH as well as the rehabilitation of
existing primary roads and improved road maintenance.
4.       Project Description.  To achieve these objectives, the proposed
project will include: (i) a three year (1988-90) time-slice of the
investment plans of the ROs in Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Vojvodina;
(ii) training and technical assistance and the provision of road monitoring
equipment to assist the RO in Croatia to set up a pilot road maintenance
management system; (iii) a training program for the staff of ROs and their
associated maintenance enterprises and engineering institutions; and (iv)
provision of equipment for road maintenance in Croatia and planning
equipment for all five RO's. The main emphasis would be on improvements
and rehabilitation of the TYH in Vojvodina and Macedonia and the
rehabilitation of other primary routes, including sections of the Adriatic
Highway in Montenegro and Kosovo. The financing of technical assistance
and related equipment in Croatia for the implementation on a pilot basis of
a road maintenance management system, constitutes a follow up to ongoing
studies of road maintenance which have been included under the First
Highway Sector Project. The total cost of the program with contingencies
is estimated at US$585 million including about US$136 million for road
maintenance, US$111 million for debt servicing by the ROs and about
$11 million for administraLion. 'The cost of the Bank--financed part of the
program is estimated at US$141 million which represents about 45% of
construction and rehabilitation investments during the three-year period
1988-90. The Bank loans aggregating US$68 million would cover the foreign
exchange component (direct and indirect) of selected high priority
construction and rehabilitation investments, the foreign cost of equipment
and 100% of the cost of technical assistance and training. Local costs as
well as the remainder of the program would be financed from road user
revenues, vehicle registration fees, road tolls, taxes on foreign vehicles
and budgetary resources. A breakdown of road program costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the aisbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank

Group operations in Yugoslavia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
6748-YU dated September 18, 1987 is also attached.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Yugoslav authorities ^ontinue
to emphasize the transport sector because of its importance for the
development of the economy, integration of the various regions, as well as
growth in foreign trade arid tourism.  Continued assistance in the sector,
where the dialogue has been gradually broadened over the years, is
consistent with the Bank's country assistance strategy which is designed to
*          help consolidate and strengthen policy and institutional changes critical
to Yugoslavia's long-term structural adjustment and development. While
there has been progress in improving efficiency in the sector and in
introducing cost-based tariffs to improve resource mobilization, there is
currently a tendency to overemphasize the development of the railway
system, a position which is inconsistent with the relative share and growth
of traffic in each mode and the condition of the existing infrastructure.
The Bank is encouraging the various authorities involved to achieve a
better balance in modal investments by means of a detailed review of road
and rail investment programs in those republics and provinces where the
Bank is lending. Also, the Bank, with the cooperation of the Federal
Committee for Transport and Communications (FCTC), has proposed the
preparation of a Transport Sector Memorandum that will give a comprehensive
nationwide overview of the sector and contain an analysis of investment
programs. Transport lending, mainly for roads and railways, would be
geared to further promote planning and financing of sound investments,
improved resource allocation, including pricing policy, and to strengthen
inter-regional and inter-modal coordination. The proposed project is part
of this effort and would continue to assist and foster sound development of
the highway network.
6.       Agreed Actions.  A comprehensive Project Action Plan has been
discussed and agreed covering the investment and maintenance programs,
implementation of recommendations on road user charges, specific measures
for improving road maintenance strategies, an action program for the
Federal Association of Republican and Provincial Road Organizations (FARP)
for improving overall coordinatiL:i and monitoring in the highway sector,
and provision of adequate funding for the road programs by adjustment of
road user charges in line with inflation. At negotiations, assurances were
obtained from the Borrowers on the following actions and matters: (a) to
execute the project in accordance with the provisions of the Project Action
Plan; (b) to update the investment programs annually and review them with
the Bank, and reflect the finalized investment program in the ROs budgets;
and (c) to submit, through FARP, for the Bank's approval, a summary of the
technical and economic evaluation of sub-projects, to be included under the
project, such evaluations to be prepared accord.ng to agreed guidelines.
In addition, assurances were obtained from the guarantor that it would
review the road user charges levels from time to time and adjust them as
necessary to ensure adequate financing for road investment and maintenance
programs. Approval of the investment and financing plans by the concerned



Republican and Provincial authorities, including the allocation of road
user revenue to road expenditures, has also been received.
7.       Justification.  Removal of bottlenecks in TYH, rehabilitation of
the primary road network, improved road maintenance procedures and
financing, additional foreign exchange earnings expected from TYH and
Adriatic Highway development, and the policy and institutional improvement
measures amply justify the project. Economic benefits from the proposed
project are expected from reduced costs to road users and the prolonged
life of road pavements. The economic rate of return (ER) of sub-projects
ranges from 15% on the TYH improvement in Vojvodina to over 50% on some
rehabilitation sections. The overall average for road sections included
for lmprovement and rehabilitation under the Bank--financed program is about
23%. In addition, institutional and procedural changes introduced through
an improved pavement management system and through increased allocations
for road maintenance will typically yield ERs above 50% for the entire road
maintenance program end will result in substantial savings in road user
costs and in future road maintenance costs which would otherwise be
necessary.
8.       Risks.  The main risk relates to inadequate adjustment of the road
user charges leading to local fund shortages. However, periodic reviews of
road user charges with a view to making the adjustments necessary to
provide adequate financing for road investment and maintenance were agreed
under the First Highway Sector Project (Loan 2715-YU) which included four
republics; the inclusion of the remaining four republics/provinces in the
proposed project for which a similar undertaking has been made would
reinforce the earlier arrangements and encourage timely adjustments.
Although there had only been infrequent adjustments in road user charges in
the period 1983-85, four adjustments in the charges have been made since
negotiations for the First Highway Sector Project in November 1985, the
most recent adjustment being in June 1987. These adjustments have kept
pace with inflation and total road user revenue has increased in real terms
because of a substantial increase iil fuel sales in 1986 and timely
adjustments of road user charges in May and July 1986, prior to the tourist
season. Continued and adequate adjustment of these charges would be
monitored under both Highway Sector Projects.
9.       Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loans.
