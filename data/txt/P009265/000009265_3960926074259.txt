STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrowers:           The Road Organizations (ROs) of Kosovo, Macedonia,
Montenegro, Vojvodina and Croatia.
Guarantor:           Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
Amounts:             A total of US$68 million as follows: Kosovo -
$6.4 million; Macedonia - $17.9 million; Montenegro -
$9.6 million; Vojvodina - $28.2 million; Croatia -
$5.9 million.
Terms:               Each is payable in 15 years including three years of
grace at the standard variable interest rate.
Project Objectives:  The proposed project is aimed primarily at assisting
the four Road Organizations (ROs) which were not
included in the FY86 First Highway Sector Project
(Loan 2715-YU).  Although included in the earlier
project, Croatia will also participate with an
improved road maintenanct management component. The
project would support further development and
rehabilitation of sections of the Trans-Yugoslav
Highway (TYH), rehabilitation of other primary routes,
and improved road maintenance operations. It will
further consolidate the institution-building efforts
started under the First Highway Sector Project with
particular reference to investment and maintenance
plat,ning, road user charges, and inter-Republic
coordination. Together the two sector projects cover
the highway sector for the whole country.
Project Description: The proposed project will include: (i) a three year
(1988-90) time-slice of the investment program of the
ROs in Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Vojvodina;
(ii) limited training and technical assistance and the
provision of road monitoring equipment to assist the
RO in Croatia to set up a pilot road maintenance
management system; (iii) a training program for the
staff of ROs, maintenance enterprises and engineering



- ii -
institutions; and (iv) provision of equipment for road
maintenance in Croatia. The main emphasis would be on
improvements and rehabilitation of the TYH in
Vojvodina and Macedonia and the rehabilitation of
other primary routes, including sections of the
Adriatic Highway in Montenegro and Kosovo. The
financing of technical assistance and related
equipment in Croatia for the implementation on a pilot
basis of an improved road maintenance management
system, constitutes a follow up to ongoing studies of
road maintenance which have been included under the
First Highway Sector Project. The Federal Association
of Republican and Provincial Road Organizations (FARP)
would act as coordinator for the administration of che
loans and as executing agency for training and would
be a party to the Loan Agreement. The total cost of
the project with contingencies is estimated at US$585
million incluuing about US$136 million for road
maintenance, US$111 million for debt servicing by the
ROs and about $11 million for administration. The
cost of the Bank-financed part of the program is
estimated at US$141 million which represents about 45%
of construction and rehabilitation investments, during
the three-year period 1988-90. The Bank loans
totalling US$68 million would cover principally the
foreign exchange component (direct and indirect) of
high priority investments, selected on the basis of
economic and technical criteria. The loans would be
apportioned among the borrowers according to an agreed
allocation as follows: Kosovo - $6.4 million;
Macedonia - $17.9 million; Montenegro - $9.6 million;
Vojvodina - $28.2 million; and Croatia - $5.9 million.
Benefits and Risks:  Removal of bottlenecks on TYH, rehabilitation of the
primary road network, which has been neglected in
recent years, improved road maintenance procedures and
increased maintenance funding, foreign exchange
savings and earnings through road improvement, and the
policy and institutional measures, amply justify the
project. Economic benefits from road improvement and
rehabilitation include reduced road user costs and
savings from prolonged life of road pavements.
Institutional and procedural changes introduced
through an improved pavement management system will
also result in substantial savings in road user costs
anid in future road maintenance costs which would
otherwise be necessary. The main risk relates to
inadequate and/or infrequent adjustments in road user
charges leading to local fu.d shortages.



- iii -
However, since January 1986 there have been frequent
adjustments in road user charges, the most recent on
June 12, 1987, which have kept pace with inflation,
these adjustments having been agreed under the First
Highway Sector Project. Continued and adequate
adjustment of the charges would be monitored under
both Highway Sector Projects. In addition, the
investment and maintenance programs have been tailored
to available financial resources and they would be
updated and reviewed annually as part of the Project
Action Plan, thereby mitigating any problems in local
funding.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Transport and the Econoy
1.01     Because of its location, Yugoslavia is an important crossroads,
with its transport system traditionally providing access to the sea for a
number of central European countries as well as connections for
international traffic betweer Western Europe, Greece and the Middle East
(Map IBRD 17933R). The main aorthwest-southeast corridor following the
Sava/Danube Plain, shared by the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH) and the main
trunk railway route, serves the major centers of population and economic
activity in the country. The transport network is extensive and
diversified and comprises about 118,000 km of roads, including 48,000 km of
primary and main regional roads, 9,400 km of rail lines, 7 main ports, 15
airports and a sizeable network of inland waterways. The transport system
is administered by independent transport authorities in each of the eight
republics and provinces which make up the Yugoslav Federation (Map IBRD
20377R1). Although the system is well developed, its growth has slowed in
recent years.
1.02     Since 1980, Yugoslavia has experienced a considerable slowdown in
the economy, partly due to external factors such as increases in oil prices
in 1979 and a slump in the world economy, and partly due to domestic
factors such as high inflation which increased from about 40% in 1981 to
about 902 in 1986. During the period from 1981 to 1986, it is estimated
that the economy ,rew at less than 1% annually compared with a rate of 5%
to 6% per year throughout the 1970s. The combination of high inflation and
a rapidly increasing debt service burden through depreciation of the Dinar
exchange rate, has severely limited development of key sectors of the
economy. Current prospects call for a slow growth recovery during the
1986-90 Plan with emphasis on improving Yugoslavia's comparative
advantage. The Government's strategy centers mainly on increasing exports
to earn foreign exchange, restructuring the economy and improving the
systems for resource allocation and use, all of which have implications for
the transport sector. Balance of payments have recently shown a current
account surplus, estimated at US$400 million for 1986, and the Government
is forecasting increases of around 3% during 1987 in both industrial ..nd
agricultural outputs.
1.03     The Yugoslav authorities have long recognized the importance of
the transport sector in the growth of the economy and its role in achieving
balanced regional development. More recently, the impottatice of the sector
has been highlighted by the need to increase foreign exchange earnings
through tourism and the growth of exports, the sector providing
considerable support in these areas. However, despite the importance of
the sector to the economy, the share of transport has declined from about
152 of total investments during the 1976-80 Plan to less than 10% during
the 1981-85 Plan. This reduction has been felt largely in the curtailment
of the program of road construction commenced ,uring the 1976-80 Plan.



- 2 -
Despite lower growth forecasts, continued investments are required in the
transport sector in order to alleviate bottlenecks in the main road and
rail networks, and to strengthen the existing infrastructure. This is
reflected in the recent resolution on the implementation of the 1986-90
Development Plan.
B. Recent Developments
Traffic Growth
1.04     As a result of the decline in the economy, total freight traffic
in all modes increased at only 1% a year between 1980 and 1985, compared
with over 5% annually between 1970 and 1980. Passenger traffic similarly
increased at less than 2% a year over the same period, compared with over
6% a year in the 1970s. From 1980, road freight and passenger traffic
stagnated, and then declined in 1983 and 1984 due to fuel shortages,
followed by rationing. When rationing ceased in January 1985, road freight
traffic showed an immediate increase of up to 5% per year on m.st routes.
While road traffic stagnated during 1980-84, rail traffic continued to show
modest increases of 2 to 3% per year, although freight traffic has not
increased in the past two yeatrs. Road transport is the most important mode
in Yugoslavia, handling about 45 billion ton-km or 60% of total freight
traffic and about 32 billion passenger-km or 65% of total passenger traffic
handled by common carriers.
Investment Trends
1.05     Since 1980, investment levels in most sectors of the economy have
fallen in real terms by more than 30%, reflecting the combined effects of
high inflation and an increasing debt service burden. Investments in the
transport sector during the 1976-80 Plan period were about US$6.5 billion,
with about US$3.9 billion (60%) for roads and US$1.7 billion (26%) for
railways. During the 1981-85 Plan, however, transport investments fell by
about 35% to US$4.3 billion approximately, and this fall was accompanied by
a marked shift away from roads and into railways.

1.06     While railway investment has remained substantially at the same
level over the past decade, equivalent to about US$1.4 billion during the
1981-85 Plan, expenditures on road infrastructure, including maintenance,
fell to about US$2 billion, or about half the level attained in the
previous Plan.  The increased investment in railways has been supported by
regular increases in rail tariffs, but funding for roads has been allowed
to fall, since timely adjustments for inflation have not been made in roa(1
user charges - a specific tax on fuel which provides about half the total
road subsector funding. During the plan period, therefore, revenue from
road user charges failed to keep pace with inflation at the very time wlhelt
road authorities had to allocate an increasing share of their funds to
cover a growing servicing liability on foreign debts, following
depreciation of the Dinar. This underfunding came at a time when there
were still major bottlenecks in the road network, and a growing need for
micdernization, rehabilitation and more intensive maintenance of the
existing roads and bridges.
C. Sector Issues
Modal Investment Balance
1.07     The imbalance between investments in the various transport modes
is a fundamental issue affecting the transport sector in Yugoslavia. At
present, there is a clear tendency to give priority to development and
modernization of the railways, a policy which is inconsistent with the
relative share and growth of traffic in each mode and the condition of the
existing infrastructure. The Bank is encouraging the various at'thorities
involved to achieve a better balance in modal investments by means of a
detailed review of road and rail investment programs in those republics and
provinces where the Bank is lending. Also, the Bank, with the cooperation
of the Federal Committee for Transport and Communications (FCTC), has
proposed the preparation of a Transport Sector Memorandum that will give a
comprehensive nationwide overview of the sector and contain an analysis of
investment programs. The FCTC has started to collect data necessary for
this transport sector work, including details of modal investment programs
in each Republic and Province. By continuing the sector lending approach
in highways, emphasizing investment and maintenance planning, together with
an appropriate road user taxation policy, the proposed project is
consistent with the objective of achieving a better balance in transport
investments.
Pricing
1.08     Development of a tariff and pricing structure, which provides for
efficient use of the transport network, constitutes a second issue in the
sector. During the early 1980s, although increases were made in railway
tariffs (para 1.06), these failed to keep pace with the high rate of
inflation, so that compensation levels I' paid to the railways

compensation to the railways for low fare and tariff levels.

increased. Similarly, there was a time lag in adjusting road user charges
and the revenue was not always wholly allocated to roads (para 1.06). For
these reasons, in early 1983, a commitment was included in the Letter of
Development Policy under the First Structural Adjustment Loall (SAL I)
providing for regular adjustments of railway tariffs and road user charges
and for the allocation of road user revenue to road expenditures. This
approach was fairly successful. The Government agreed to raise railway
tariffs by at least 6% in real terms each year during the period 1985-1990
with a view to eliminating compensation payments to most railway
enterprises by the early 1990s. The same commitment was later included as
a specific covenant under the Sixth Railway Project, and since loan
effectiveness in July 1984, the railways have raised tariffs generally in
line with this formula. For road transport, however, the situation has
been less satisfactory. While vehicle registration fees and overall
pricing and taxation of motor fuels are set at realistic levels and are
comparable with most western European countries, the lag in adjusting road
user charges for inflation has had a major impact on the levels of
construction and maintenance in the road network.  -' A specific
covenant was therefore included in the First Highway Sector Project (FY86)
to provide for regular adjustments of road user charges in line with
inflation and, as a result, the position has now improved. Four increases
in road user charges were made during 1986 which kept the charges slightly
ahead of inflation. The next significant step will be the -pproval by the
Federal Executive Council of a draft Social Compact on roads, which defines
policies for road user charge adjustments. The Social Compact policies are
based primarily on the findings of a Road User Charges Study financed under
an earlier Bank project and are acceptable. Through an Action Plan, the
proposed project is designed to support several key features of road user
taxation as proposed under the Social Compact (para 3.33).
Efficiency
1.09     The need to improve efficiency in the transport sector is a
general issue which is being actively pursued by the various transport
authorities. Bank support for this objective, was provided under the
Fourth Railway Project with the introduction of action plans for railway
operations, including targets for operational efficiency. Over the years
there has been a gradual improvement in wagon and locomotive utilization.
Amongst other items, there is now a need to adopt a phased program to
rationalize locomotive maintenance in order to achieve economies of sca..e
and increased locomotive availability.
1.10     The organization and operation of the road transport industry is
to be reviewed as part of the forthcoming Transport Sector Memorandum
(para 1.07). Particular attention will be paid to the large own-accomnt
trucking fleets, which appear to operate at lower efficiency levels than
the for-hire trucking fleets and privately owned trucks (para 2.06). In
the area of road maintenance, federal, republic and provincial governments
are keen to improve the efficiency of road maintenance operations by better
planning and improved maintenance procedures. The proposed project
supports this objective through the pilot road maintenance planning system
in Croatia (paras 3.17 and 3.18).
1/ User charges are not ad valorum, and therefore do not automatically
keep pace with fuel price increases.



-5-
Coordination
1.11     Finally, an over-riding issue relates to the need to improve
coordination in the transport sector among the eight Republics and
Provinces and to provide for a national perspective in transport planning
and operations. Since the mid-1960s, there has been a gradual transfer of
authority to the republican/provincial transport agencies, thereby
increasing the number of decision-making bodies and making transport
planning and coordination more difficult. In supporting transport
infrastructure development, the Bank has emphasized the need for improved
coordination between sub-sectors at regional and national levels as well as
the need to develop adequate institutions and an appropriate policy
framework. At the national level, the Bank has encouraged and supported
the establishment or strengthening of important planning and coordinating
institutions. These include the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR),
which covers the overall coordination of railway planning and operations,
and the Council of Republican and Provincial Roads Organizations (CRO),
which was established in the early 1970s to cover the nationwide
standardization of engineering and design criteria in the highway
sub-sector as well as such other matters as highway safety. In 1983, a new
coordinating body, known as the Federal Association of Republican and
Provincial Road Organizations (FARP), was established, with broader
responsibilities for overall planning and monitoring of developments
related to road infrastructure and traffic. The First Highway Sector
Project (FY86) supported the initiative by defining a general work program
to be undertaken by the organization. The proposed project will continue
this support by providing an updaLad work program designed to strengthen
FARP's coordinating role (para 3.33, and Annex 4).
D. Previous Bank Transport Projects
1.12     Over the past 24 years, the Bank has played an active role in
developing Yugoslavia's transport system through a series of 23 loans for
highways, railways and ports totalling US$1,349 million equivalent
(Annex 1). Through these loans, the Bank has emphasized improvements to
the policy framework in the sector and the strengthening of project
preparation and investment planning capabilities. The main emphasis in
highways has been the improvement of key links in the primary road network,
including many sections of the TYH, the country's principal transport
artery (para 1.01). The Project Completion Reports (PCR) for the Seventh,
Eighth and Ninth Highway Projects indicate that they substantially achieved
their main objectives (which included improved planning and project
prenaration capabilities), were relatively free of major problems, and were
completed according to schedule. The Tenth Highway Project initiated
sector type lending in the less developed regions, an approach which has
permitted greater flexibility to adjust to current lower levels of roads
expenditures. The subsequent Eleventh Highway Project focussed entirely on
improvements to the TYH in Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Vojvodina. A
combined PCR on the Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects indicates that
these projects suffered delays in implementation because of shortages of
local funds, brought about by a downturn in the economy at that time
(para 1.02). After inclusion in the Bank's Special Action Program in 1983,
actual implementation from 1983 onwards was close to the two year extended
schedule. The First Highway Sector Project (FY86), the twelfth operation
for roads comprises a sector lending approach across four Republics with



- 6 -
the aim of not only financing construction and rehabilitation but also
addressing planned development of the roads network, investment and
maintenance planning, road user charges and inter-Republic coordination.
The proposed project will have similar objectives for the other four
Republics and Provinces and will extend support into the critical area of
road mainitenance planning (para 3.02). The Bank is also participating in
local road improvements and maintenance as part of the Kosovo and
Montenegro Regional Development Projects.
1.13     Seven loans totalling $491.2 million have been made for the
railway sub-sector; five of these were for investment in modernization and
one loan was for the construction of the Belgrade-Bar line. An additional
loan for $14 million was made for reconstruction following the 1979
earthquake in Montenegro.
1.14     In the ports sub-sector, a loan of US$44 million was made for the
Port of Bar in Montenegro. This project was nearing completion when the
port was severely damaged by the 1979 earthquake. Rehabilitation has now
been completed with a loan of US$30.1 million. A ports sub-sector survey
tias also been carried out with the Bank's encouragement. The study was
conducted by local consultants financed by the Yugoslav Association of
Seaports and has indicated priorities for future port development in the
country. The study will be reviewed during 1987 as part of the proposed
sector work program.
II. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. Road Network
2_01     Yugoslavia's road network comprises some 118,000 km of roads of
w'hich about 16,000 km are primary roads and 32,000 km are regional roads
(Tables 2.1 and 1). During the period from 1970 to 1980, the length of the
paved network doubled and now accounts for 57% of the total.

2.02     Modernizationi of the network continues to be a major priority for
the republics and provinces. In the more developed areas of the country,
tit- primary focus is on eliminating the major bottlenecks, par'icularly on
the TYH, while in the less developed areas the main focus is on upgrading
and modernization of the basic primary network (para 3.05). Maintenance
has been generally satisfactory, but has suffered recently be' ause of
budgetary constraints. In addition, as much of the paved network is still
relatively recent, routine rehabilitation programs have not been a major
part of the road investment progrars. However, in 1986 it was estimated
only 55% of the primary network and 37% of regional roads were in good or
fair condition, the overall average being about 40%.   Clearly, increasing
attention must now be paid to strengthening road maintenance operations and
to establishing rehabilitation and pavement strengthening schemes in order
to preserve the existing infrastructure.
2.03     The TYH system provides the backbone to Yugoslavia's highway
network and is a vital link between Western Europe, the Balkans and the
Middle East (para 1.01 and Map 20377R)). Although some 500 km of the
1,170 km of TYH have been improved over the past decade or are currently
under construction, it is estimated that a further 360 km could be
justified for upgrading to four-lane standard during the coming decade. Of
these sections, about 130 km will be improved during the period 1987-89
with financial assistance provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB)
and the Bank. The sections covered by this program incluue a start on the
critical TYH sections in Slovenia between Ljubljana and Zagreb and the
continuation of improvements eastwards in Croatia and westwards in
Vojvodina. Beyond this program, a further 230 km of high priority TYH
sections in Slovenia, Croatia and Vojvodina would remain for improvement in
the medium-term with implementation continuing beyond 1990.
B. Traffic and Road Transport
2.04     Average traffic levels on primary roads are about 4,200 vpd with a
range from about 500 vpd to over 12,000 vpd on four lane sections of the
TYH. It is estimated there are about 10,000 km of roads with traffic
levels of over 3,000 vpd and it is in this group of roads that there are
the major needs for modernization and rehabilitation. Average traffic
levels on regional roads are about 1,300 vpd with a range from less than
500 vpd to about 5,000 vpd. Although traffic levels had fallen in recent
years, particularly for passenger cars which were affecteG oy fuel
rationing, they have shown a steady increase over the past two years at
about 5% per year (para 1.04). Traffic levels are expected to continue
increasing in the next few years at a modest rate of about 3 to 4% per year.
2.05     Road transport has developed rapidly over the past 20 years with
the passenger car fleet increasing at over 20% per year through 1980 while
the number of heavy vehicles increased at about 9% per year. However,
there has been little growth in the vehicle fleet in recent years. The
total fleet was estimated in 1985 at about 3.1 million vehicles, excluding
motorcycles and agricultural tractors. Buses are estimated at 26,000
vehicles and trucks at about 247,000 vehicles. The total truck capacity is
estimated at about 2.6 million tons of which just under 70% is operating on
own-account, mainly for large commercial enterprises. Public freight



transport services are provided by about 300 specialized transport
enterprises with a total truck fleet of some 54,000 vehicles and which
account for about 25% of total capacity. There is also a growing number of
private owner-operators with a total of about 17,000 small trucks with an
average capacity of about 7.5 tons and which account for abot't 5% of total
truck capacity.
2.06     Of the total road freight traffic of about 45 billion ton-km,
own-account operations handle about half the total, the public transport
enterprises about 47% and private trucks only 3%. The public transport
enterprises appear to be run quite effectively with high load factors of
about 75%, the trucks avet"aging about 45,000 km per year with average hauls
of 124 km. On the other- hand, load factors for both private truckers and
the own-account fleets are in the range of 50 to 60%, the trucks averaging
only 25,000 km per year over average hauls of about 40 km. Both
own-account operators and private trucking serve mainly a local collection
and distribution function, the longer haul traffic being captured mainly by
the well-organized public transport enterprises. Public road passenger
services outside the urban areas are provided by a large number of
specialized enterprises which handled some 32 billion passenger-km in
1985. Load factors on these services exceed 80% and the average haul is
about 30 km.
2.07     Road transport tariffs are not regulated but are set by the
transport enterprises and operators based on market forces, taking in
account recommended tariff levels proNided by the Yugoslav Association of
Road Transporters (para 2.10). An analysis of the road transport industry,
including measures needed to improve data collection, as well as means for
improving efficiency in road transport operations, will be included in the
Bank transport sector review scheduled for 1988 (para 1.07).
2.08     Vehicle regulations in Yugoslavia are primarily safety-oriented
and focus on speed and load limitations. The maximum legal axle loading is
10 tons on a single axle and 16 tons on a tandem axle for all primary and
regional roads. Transport enterprises are generally well managed, so that
truck overloading is not a common problem, although it does take place.
The proposed project will provide equipment to investigate the extent and
scale of overloading and to provide valuable axle load data for the pilot
maintenance planning system in Croatia (para 3.20 and Annex 3).
2.09     Yugoslavia has a small automotive industry producing or assembling
vehicles. Apart from agricultural tractors, where output rose by about 70%
between 1975 and 1985, production figures have remained steady or even
declined over the past decade. Excluding tractors, bicycles and
motorcycles, vehicle production in 1985, the last year for which figures
are available, was about 250,000 units, of which 230,000 were cars. Cars
are exported to several European countries and about 40,000 units per year
are now also exported to the United States.
C. Administration
2.10     Over the years, there has been increasing decentralization of the
responsibilities for highway administration which is now located firmly in
the eight Republics and Provinces. Centrally, there is a Federal Committee
for Transport and Communications responsible for common policy and



- 9 -
regulatory matters such as vehicle regulations, road user taxation and the
international aspects of highway administration and road transport. In
addition, overall coordination and monitoring in road planning and
development is provided by FARP (para. 1.11). Road transport enterprises
and operators form part of the Yugoslav Association of Road Transporters
which provides information on the transport market, recommends tariff
levels and acts as a lobbying body with the Federal Government and the
republics and provinces.
2.11     At republic and province level, there are eight Road Organizations
(ROs) responsible for the primary and regional roads in the network,
amounting to some 48,000 km in all. These ROs deal with policy and
financial matters in construction and maintenance, interpreting and
administering the decisions of the Republic and Provincial Assemblies. ROs
do not have the facilities to undertake detailed design and investigations
themselves, nor to carry out the work required. Design, investigations and
even supervision of large works are done by staff of engineering
inatitutes, while the work itself is done by a number of self-financing
road construction and maintenance enterprises. The ROs are established as
self-management communities of interest (COI), and are governed by road
assemblies, made up of representatives of various groups with an interest
in roads, such as transport companies, industrial enterprises, agricultural
cooperatives and professional and road user associations. Executive boards
are responsible for day-to-day operations and preparation of highway
investment and maintenance programs. Details of roads administration vary
between Republics and Provinces, especially in respect to the way in which
the almost 70,000 km of local roads are improved and maintained. Annex 3
provides more detailed information on administration of the road network in
one republic (Croatia).
2.12     Through their long association with Bank-financed highway
projects, the ROs have developed adequate capabilities for the preparation
and implementation of projects according to acceptable criteria and
procedures. The overall investment planning approach introduced under the
First Highway Sector Project served to strengthen planning procedures and
to improve the balance between new investments, rehabilitation and
maintenance. The proposed project will build upon and extend this *ipproach
to all areas of the country.
D. Planning and Engineering
2.13     Proposals for road improvements come from the various interests
that use the network, from members of the road assembly, and from within
the ROs themselves. Standards of road maintenance are laid down in detail
in the laws and regulations of the Republics and Provinces. From these
sources, Five Year Highway Plans are prepared by the ROs for consideration
and adoption by the Republic and Provincial assemblies in coordination with
plans from other sectors. Resource constraints and high rates of inflation
have made it more difficult to meet all demands, and the 1981-85 Plan had
to be substantially revised by ROs and assemblies at mid-term due to
rapidly changing economic conditions. Investment plans are now reviewed
and updated annually by ROs, who apply strict economic criteria in their
selection of components for the Five Year Plan to ensure that the best use
is made of scarce resources.



- 10 -
2.14     Pre-investment studies of highway projects are gen3rally commis-
sioned by ROs from local engineering institutes (para 2.11), and in the
Bank's experience these feasibility studies are usually satisfactorily
done. Subsequent design and supervision which is usually contracted out by
ROs to engineering institutes, is also generally satisfactory, and to
acceptable standards.
E. Sector Financing and Expenditures
FinancinA
2.15     Road expenditures are financed at the republican and provincial
levels from earmarked sources which include taxes on fuel, vehicle
registration fees and road tolls, as well as from contributions made
available by community work organizations, republican/provincial budgetary
allocations, and from bank loans. The less-developed areas, particularly
Kosovo and Montenegro, also receive small amotnts from the Federal Fund for
Less Developed Regions (LDR). In most republics and provinces, revenue
from vehicle registration fees is used to finance local roads. For primary
and regional roads, revenue from the road user charge now represents about
50% of total funding for the highway sector, funds frc'n foreign and local
loans about 15%, republican/provincial budgetary allocations about 12%,
contributions from community work organizations 8% and the remainder from
vehicle registration fees, highway tolls and taxes on foreign vehicles.
The chart below shows the sources of funding.

- 11 -
During the 1980s, the ability of ROs to fund a reasonable level of
investment in upkeep of the network has declined mainly because of the lag
in adjusting the road user charges for inflation. In addition, despite the
earmarked nature of the revenue raised by the road user charge on fuel, the
republican and provincial governments had previously allocated part of the
revenue to other sectors, and this triggered the commitment included in
SAL I in early 1983 (para 1.08). By the end of 1984, all the republics and
provinces had reverted to an earmarking of over 95% of the road user charge
for road expenditures. Of the current price of gasoline of Dinars 240 per
liter (US 53 cents per liter or US$2.00 per US gallon), the road user
charge represents about 15%, sales tax 21% and other specific taxes 21%.
The current price of diesel fuel is Dinars 192 per liter (US43 cents per
liter or US$1.62 per US gallon) of which the road user charge represents
14%, sales tax 19% and other specific taxes 23% (Table 2). Currently,
Dinars 12.6 per liter of both gasoline and diesel are earmarked for road
maintenance which is estimated to provide some Dinars 75 billion
(US$160 million) annually for this purpose. This represents an average of
about US$3,300 per kilometer for primary and regional roads which is a
substantial improvement over the low levels of maintenance funding which
have been experienced since 1983 (paras 2.18 and 2.24).
2.16     At the time of a substantial increase in the road user charges in
December 1986, the Yugoslav authorities decided to give increased emphasis
to a 4,500 km E-route (European) network of common interest to the
republics and provinces, with the main priority being the completion of the
Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH). As from the beginning of 1987, seven Dinars
from the road user charges on gasoline and diesel fuel, representing 19% of
the gasoline charge and 25% of the diesel charge, are accruing into a
special Federal account, which would be used primarily as counterpart
financing for foreign loans for improvement of TYH. This represents an
interesting development for planning and administration of the highway
network in that it constitutes a first step towards a Federal highway
system of primary international and inter-regional routes.
Expenditures
2.17     During the 1976-80 Plan, annual expenditures on primary and
regional roads, including debt servicing, averaged US$900 million with a
maximum of about US$1.1 billion in 1979. Since then, total expenditures
have declined steadily in real terms and have averaged about US$640 million
annually during the 1981-85 Plan (para 1.06). Debt servicing has increased
from less than 20% of total expenditures during 1976-80 to about 36%, and
is now the major single item. Details are as follows:

2.18     While total expenditures on the highway network have decreased by
about 30X during 1981-85 compared with 1976-80, the main reductions have
been felt in new construction, which fell to only 40% of its previous
level. During 1981-85, there was a decline in rehabilitation while
maintenance expenditures had fallen to about US$1,900 per kilometer in 1985
compared to US$2,800 per kilometer at the end of the 1976-80 Plan. Due to
inadequate maintenance allocations the condition of the road network has
gradually deteriorated, particular the regional roads.

2.20     The marked decline in the amount of the road user charge was only
partly due to the effects of inflation (para 1.06).  The imposition of fuel
rationing in 1983 and 1984 caused a decrease in consumption, although this
effect was removed in January 1985. However, the increases made in road
user charges during 1986 (para 1.08) have helped to reduce the downward
,rend in funding. In addition, other road user taxes, such as vehicle
registration fees, tolls and taxes on foreign vehicles, have continued to
show regular increases since 1983. In 1986, expenditures on rehabilitation
and maintenance increased and are now expected to gradually return to more
acceptable levels.
F. Construction
2.21     There are about 50 road construction enterprises in Yugoslavia
compared to half that number about 20 years ago. Some of these are quite
large and have been successful in winning international contracts in other
countries. The value of road construction and rehabilitation executed by
the eight ROs in 1986 is estimated to about US$200 million.
2.22     The quality of construction work is generally good.  Road
construction and improvement is normally executed by means of unit price
contracts. In the highly competitive environment, very few foreign
contractors secure work in Yugoslavia. During the Tenth Highway Project,
only two foreign contractors requested prequalification, one was
prequalified, but did not submit a bid. In the Eleventh Highway Project,
six foreign firms requested prequalification, of which four were
prequalified but only one submitted a bid. Only one foreign contractor has
participated in Bank financed projects in Yugoslavia, and then as a
joint-venture partner with a local firm, thus confirming the competitive
spirit and general ability of the domestic industry.
G. Maintenance
2.23     While ROs are responsible for policy, program preparation and
financing of road maintenance (paras 2.11 and 2.12), since 1974, road
maintenance is being carried out by 42 self financing road maintenance
enterprises (RMEs), plus five special enterprises dealing only with
maintenance of motorways, tunnels and major bridges. Under agreement with
the ROs, these 42 RMEs are responsible for the maintenance of all primary
and regional roads (about 48,000 km), plus in Croatia and Slovenia, some
22,000 km of local roads. In other republics and provinces, the local
roads are maintained by local communities. Many RMEs evolved from the road
construction enterprises set up during the construction boom of the 1970s,
and their performance as maintenance organizations is variable. When
construction work was pleatiful, those enterprises which undertook both
construction and maintenance, tended to neglect the latter in favour of the
former. Recently passed laws now prohibit the RMEs from taking on
construction work.
2.24     The typical RME is required to maintain about 2,000 km of road,
and hzas one employee for each 3.3 km of road, with a range, varying from
less than two kilometers per employee in two republics/provinces to eight
kilometers per employee in Slovenia where more modern technology is used.
Procedures vary from place to place, but in all republics/provinces, RMEs
are used to maintain roads, and the amount and type of maintenance to be



- 14 -
performed is specified in the government regulations. Maintenance is
planned under the Five Year programs by ROs (para 2.13), and when funds are
restricted, as they usually are, RMEs are excused by the RO concerned from
a part of their legal obligations to maintain the roads to the set
standards. Emphasis is placed on road user safety, so that when funds are
low and once fixed costs are met, priority is given to clearing
obstructions, snow clearance and repairing failures which constitute a
danger to traffic. As a result, timely pavement strengthening is not
carried out, and small failures are not repaired before they become large
and a danger to traffic. The maintenance norms defined in government
regulations are reasonable, and if the funds were available to carry out
the work specified, roads would be kept in good order if they were already
in sound condition. Deterioration has taken place since 1980, however, and
with the new roads built in the 1970s reaching the end of their design
lives, this process must be expected to accelerate unless more resources
can be put into pavement strengthening. The 1986 Study on Pavement
Maintenance and Rehabilitation, carried out by Government, found that
overall, 18% of primary and regional roads required base repairs and
resurfacing, while 12% required complete reconstruction, indicating that
about one third of the road network is in urgent need of major maintenance
or rehabilitatior.. Allocations to road maintenance should be increased to
about US$190 million annually or about US$4,000 per kilometer (para 2.25).
Current revenue from road user charges will provide about 80% of these
needs, provided regular adjustements are made in the future for inflation
(para. 2.15).
2.25     Target figures for road rehabilitation and maintenance were agreed
under the First Highway Sector Project for the four ROs in Serbia,
Slovenia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia. These targets relate to the
period 1986-89, and are designed to bring routine and periodic maintenance
funding to an appropriate level by the end of that period, and to
rehabilitate some 3,100 km of roads in those four Republics. Average
maintenance expenditures would be increased gradually to reach about
US$3,800 per kilometer in 1989, ranging from US$3,100 per kilometer in
Bosnia-Hercegovina to about US$4,900 per kilometer in Slovenia. During
supervision of the project, annual investment programs will be reviewed to
ensure that no uneconomic investment is included, and that correct emphasis
is given to maintenance and road rehabilitation, in line with the agreed
targets. This same approach will be adopted in the proposed project for
the four remaining ROs, i.e. Vojvodina, Macedonia, Kosovo and Montenegro.
Appropriate adjustments in road user taxation are included in the Federal
Guarantee Agreement and are part of the Project Action Plan (paras 3.28,
3.32 and 3.33).
2.26     The Government's 1986 study of roads and bridges investigated over
4,400 bridges in six Republics, and found that 40%o of them, although
basically sound, required some structural repairs, while a further 21% had
serious structural defects and required strengthening or even replacement.
Rehabilitation and strengthening of bridges was incladed in the First
Highway Sector Project for the four Republics involved, and is to be
included in the proposed project as part of rehabilitation. The project
will include provision of specialised equipment to improve the speed and
accuracy of bridge condition evaluation, and training in bridge management
and maintenance (paras 3.19 to 3.22).

H. Trainig
2.27     Yugoslavia is a country with well-developed educational and voca-
tional training institutions. The highway sector is staffed with competent
professionals and technicians. There is, however, need to constantly
update the knowledge and skills of engineers and managers, particularly in
specialized fields, to provide economists with training in transport topics
and in the preparation of feasibility studies, and to introduce and
disseminate information on the latest techniques in road maintenance
planning and management. Once trained, Yugoslav personnel put their skills
to effective use, and adapt their system to appropriate technologies and
methods of analysis. Currently, regular training courses are provided to
the ROs and RMEs by the three main engineering institttes while the RMEs
themselves provide on-the-job training in road maintenance operations.
2.28     Since the Fifth Highway Project, all Bank-financed projects have
included training elements of three types: (i) short term fellowships and
seminars abroad for engineers and economists; (ii) on-the-job counterpart
training with consultants in the preparation of feasibility studies; and
(iii) seminars and courses in Yugoslavia. The Tenth and Eleventh Highway
Projects also included ttaining components designed to improve management
of the road network and traffic safety. In October 1981, CRO, in
cooperation with the Bank and the USA Institute of Transport Engineers,
organized a four day International Highway Safety Conference, and FARP has
organized seminars in Yugoslavia and overseas study tours in highway
management and design for traffic engineers and senior executives. These
training components have been particularly successful in developing a sound
capability for the preparation of feasibility and design studies, including
the complex methodologies required for multilane controlled access
facilities.
2.29     Under the First Highway Sector Project, the training effort is
concentrated on road rehabilitation and maintenance, and this emphasis will
continue under the proposed project, with the main emphasis being on
rationalization and optimization of road maintenance under conditions of
restricted funds (para 3.22).
I. Traffic Safety
2.30     The traffic accident rate in Yugoslavia is considerably above that
in some western European countries, as shown in the following table:
Fatalities per year per million
motor vehicles
(1980-83 Average)
Yugoslavia                               1,650
Greece (the next highest                 1,100
European country)
West Germany                               450
Great Britain                              320



- 16 -
Possible reasons for this high rate are increasing congestion on the roads,
(particularly during the all important tourist season) and the growing
number of new, and hence inexperienced, drivers. While the number of
vehicles registered increased 16 times between 1960 and 1980, the length of
improved roads increased only nine times. New drivers are coming on to the
roads at the rate of about 200,000 a year, and the number of foreign
v0-icles entering the country each year is now about 15 million.
2.31     Total fatalities peaked at about 5,500 in 197' and 1978, daopping
to 4,850 in 1980 and 4,300 in 1984. Injuries in traffic accidents average
about 58,000 per year. Accident rates are particularly high on unimproved
two lane sections of the TYH, and improvement to four lane standards will
reduce the accident rate. The Tenth and Eleventt Highway Projects included
highway safety components, including: (i) procurement of safety equipment
and equipment for accident studies, analysis and monitoring; (ii) technical
assistance for accident data collection and analysis, and for improving
design standards; and (iii) safety training. From the reducing trend in
fatal accidents over the period of these projects, it may be that the
assistance provided is having some effect. A particular concern of the ROs
in the field of road safety is the number of skidding accidents that take
place, especially on tourist routes following summer showers. The proposed
project will supply road condition monitoring equipment to identify
skidding "black spots", so that remedial measures can be taken, and
appropriate road surface retexturing equipment will also be provided
(para 3.20).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01 The Yugoslav authorities continue to emphasize the development of the
transport sector to support the development of the economy and the economic
integration of the various regions. Following several years of economic
stabilization, resumption of economic growth and development of foreign
trade and tourism will depend largely on an adequate and well maintained
highway network. With increasing restrictions on funds in recent years, at
a time when much of the road network is aging and nearing the limit of its
design life, there is a need to support adequate levels of road
rehabilitation and to increase the efficiency of road maintenance
operations through proper planning and budgetting of limited resources.
The First Highway Sector Project, for which the Loan Agreement was very
recently signed, has as objectives to continue the Bank's long-term
strategy to assist and foster sound, planned development of the highway
network, and to consolidate institution building efforts, particularly in
the fields of maintenance planning, road user charges and inter-Republican
coordination. The proposed project will extend these objectives to the
remaining four Republics and Provinces. The project represents the
continuing response to the Govermnent's and the Bank's priority objectives
in the road subsector.

B. Project Objectives
3.02     The principal objectives of the project are:
(a) to consolidate and extend past efforts to improve investment
planning, concentrating on achieving a balanced program
between new investments and adequate road rehabilitation and
maintenance and to remove major bottlenecks in the network;
(b) to improve the cost-effectiveness of road maintenance
operations;
(c) to encourage a sound road user taxation policy which will
ensure adequate funding for road construction and
maintenance programs; and
(d) to strengthen inter-Republic coordination in highway matters.
C. Project Description
3.03     The project includes the following:
(a) the 1988-9C 'ighway development programs of the ROs in
Vojvodina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo (paras 3.06 to
3.16);
(b) a training program for the staff of ROs, maintenance
enterprises and engineering institutes and planning equipment
for the ROs in Vojvodina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo
for setting up road data bases (paras 3.20 to 3.22);
(c) technical assistance and training and provision of road
monitoring equipment to assist the Croatia RO to set up a
pilot road maintenance planning system (paras 3.17, 3.18,
3.21 and 3.22);
(d) provision of equipment for road maintenance in Croatia (para
3.19); and
(e) technical assistance to FARP for project preparation and
planning (para. 3.21).
3.04     During negotiations, the project objectives and description were
confirmed.
3.05     The main focus of the programs in Vojvodina and Macedonia is on
improvements and rehabilitation of the TYH. The TYH is a link in the major
transport route between western Europe, the Balkan area and the Middle East
and improvements to TYH will therefore facilitate international transit
traffic and thus have a far-reaching impact beyond the borders of
Yugoslavia. In Montenegro, emphasis is on removing bottlenecks on the
Adriatic Highway and rehabilitation of bridges. In the less developed
province of Kosovo, the main focus is on rehabilitation of existing primary
routes, no1'Luding part of the Adriatic Highway, and construction of a new
5 km by-pass near Pristina to replace an existing gravel road. Croatia has



- 18 -
been selected to set up a pilot road maintenance management system which
could, under a later project, be extended to cover the whole country. A
financing plan has been drawn up for each Borrower and sources of funds
identified for all planned expenditures (para 3.27). Agreements have been
reached with each Borrower on the selection of subprojects for Bank
participation. Details of the road sections proposed for Bank financing
are shown in Table 8. In addition, the 1988-90 road programs include
subprojects financed by local resources. A summary of the individual road
programs, with financing plans and proposed Bank participation, is given in
the following sections.
D. Proposed Road Programs
3.06     The three year roa   onstruction and rehabilitation program of
Vojvodina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo is shown in Table 3.1 below and
the .otal road program cost is summarized in Table 3.11.  The individual
investment programs are given in paras 3.07 to 3.16.

3.09     The 31 km Sacinci-Kuzmin section of TYH proposed for improvement
would, when completed, together with the 30 km financed under the Tenth and
the Eleventh Highway Projects and the 4.5 km Sacinci-Ruma section financed
by EIB, provide a 66 km continuous four lane highway from the Serbian border
to Kuzmin. The project improvement would involve the construction of two
additional traffic lanes and the reconstruction of 24 km of the existing two
lane limited access road. The project includes two grade separated
interchanges, at Sremska Mitrovica and at Kuzmin.  The interchange designs
conform with the guidelines established by the Toll Study financed under the
Eleventh Highway Project. The rehabilitation program to be assisted by the
Bank will provide for asphalt concrete overlays on about 50 km of primary
and regional roads.
Macedonia
3.10     The investment and financing plans in current Dinars for the
Macedonia RO for the period 1988-90, with estimated actual expenditures for
1986 and estimated expenditures for 1987 are shown in Table 3.4.
Rehabilitation includes a limited amount of improvement, such as minor
alignment changes and easing of curves. The road investment and maintenance
program for Macedonia as a whole has been reviewed and found acceptable.

3.14       The main emphasis of Bank participation in the Montenegro program
would be to finance the foreign exchange cost of the rehabilitation of
about 90 km of the two lane Adriatic Highway between Kolasin,  Ivangrad and
the Serbian Border (Map 'IBRD 20377R). In addition, a 320 m. steel bridge
on the River Tara at Durdevica would be rehabilitated. The plan calls for
repairs to abutments and piers weakened by deterioration including cleaning
and protection of reinforcement, replacement of old deckplates and asphalt
paving. The proposed Bank participation in the investment program is shown

E. Pilot Road Maintenance Planning System in Croatia
3.17     The project will provide support and assistance to set up a
practical road maintenance planning system in Croatia, which would later be
extended to the other republics and provinces of Yugoslavia. The objective
is to establish a simple management system for the rational planning of
road maintenance, taking into account the availability of funds, and the
characteristics of the roads network and its traffic. The existing
maintenance system in Croatia and the rationale for the proposed
maintenance management system are discussed in Annex 3.
3.18     Initially, a central planning and information system will be
introduced which, based on evaluation of the network condition and the
funds available for maintenance, will prescribe intervention levels and
appropriate remedial actions for the various road classes and traffic
levels. This would allow FARP and the ROs to revise the maintenance norms
upon which maintenance programs are now estimated (paras 2.13 and 2.24) to
ensure that available funds are used in the best possible way. The system
will also indicate desirable funding levels for road maintenance, and the
costs which the community has to bear as a result of restricted funding.
The cost of the Croatia road maintenance planning system in current
Dinars during the period 1988-90 and the proposed loan participation in the
system are shown in Table 3.10. During negotiations arrangements for the
proposed road maintenance management system in Croatia was discussed and
confirmed.

F. Equipment
3.19     In order to support the pilot road maintenance management system
in Croatia, US$4.8 million of road and bridge maintenance equipment will be
procured under the project (Table 3.10). The project also provides for
automatic toll equipment for the Zagreb-Luzani section of the TYH. Details
are shown in Table 4. During negotiations the list of road and bridge
maintenance and toll equipment was discussed and confirmed.
3.20     Road maintenance planning equipment (US$700,000) additional to
that already available in Croatia, will be procured to set up and operate
the Croatia road data bank for the maintenance management system, and to
analyze the data collected. Similar planning equipment (US$400,000) will
also be procured for Vojvodina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo, and FARP,
to enable them to start setting up road data bases during 1988 based on
experience gained in Croatia. The equipment includes skid resistance
survey equipment and pavement retexturing equipment to help reduce the high
incidence of skidding accidents (para 2.31), and axle weighing equipment
(para 2.08). Details are given in Table 5. During negotiations the list
of road monitoring and planning equipment for road maintenance management
was discussed and confirmed.
G. Technical Assistance and Training Program
3.21     Technical assistance under the project will concentrate on the
pilot road maintenance management system in Croatia with the objective of
ensuring that the system is well designed and implemented and that the
experience in setting up the system is disseminated to the other Republics
and Provinces. The Civil Engineering Institute (CEI), Zagreb, under
contract to the Croatia RO will act as consultants in setting up the pilot
maintenance management system in Croatia, and 60 man-months of consultancy
services are provided to cover phases I and II. In order to identify
future road maintenance needs that would form the basis for a comprehensive
maintenance project to cover all eight republics and provinces, 80 man-
months of technical assistance to FARP is included for project preparation
and planning. This work would be undertaken by local consultants.



- 28 -
3.22     An estimated 65 man-months of foreign training is to be provided
to cover highway maintenance management, bridge management and maintenance
and traffic management and safety. An overseas seminar is proposed for
staff in Croatia concerned with setting up the pilot system followed by a
short assignment by one foreign consultant in Croatia . Local seminars on
the results of the pilot system will be organized by FARP for the benefit
of staff from other ROs, CEIs and RMEs who would later be concerned with
setting up maintenance management programs in the other republics and
provinces. The aim is, by the completion date of the project, for staff in
Croatia responsible for operating the maintenance management system to be
trained and experienced in this work, a cadre of maintenance engineers to
have had foreign training in various specialized aspects of maintenance and
traffic safety, and staff from other ROs in Yugoslavia to have had basic
training in the requirements for planning and setting up a road maintenance
management system. During negotiations, details of the training and
technical assistance program were discussed and confirmed.
H. Engineering
3.23     All feasibility studies of project components have been completed,
with the exception of the rehabilitation program for Vojvodina.
Preparation of studies was in line with guidelines established under
previous Bank-financed projects. Virtually all engineering has been
completed for the first year program and for the TYH section in Vojvodina.
The detailed engineering has been undertaken by Yugoslav engineering
institutes to design standards satisfactory to the Bank (Table 6).
Construction supervision would be performed by the same institutes under
contract t. the Road Organizations. The data used in the preparation of
the project and the source material are listed in Annex 6.
t. Cost Estimates and Financing
3.24     Cost estimates for the road investment programs have been prepared
by the ROs concerned in consultation with local institutes and are based on
recent cost experience with similar works. Cost estimates for the TYH
sections in Vojvodina are based on detailed engineering while the estimates
for other Bank-financed sections included under the first year of the
project are based on preliminary engineering design carried out for the
feasibility studies, both with unit rates according to recent work
experience. The cost of overseas training is based on a man-month rate of
US$3,500, including travelling and per diem, plus course fees where
appropriate. The estimated costs of short term expatriate consultants and
local consultants services are based on prevailing rates. Cost of
equipment is based on recent manufacturer's quotations and recent bidding
experience on Bank-financed projects for similar equipment.



- 29 -
3.25       A 10% physical contingency has been added to the cost estimates
for road construction. Price contingencies have been estimated assuming
local price increases of 70% in 1988, 55% in 1989 and 45% in 1990, and
international price increases of 1% in 1988, 1989 and 1990. The foreign
exchange component of civil works has been estimated assuming, as in
earlier projects, that local contractors would win the awards of
construction contracts after international competitive bidding. For
rehabilitation and betterment works, the higher proportion of bitumen
quantities in the works compared to new construction gives a higher foreign
component of 50%.
3.26       The cost estimates and Bank participation in the project covering
the five republics and provinces are summarized in Table 3.11.

Agreements have been reached with each Borrower on the selection of
subprojects for Bank participation. In addition, the 1988-90 road programs
include subprojects financed by local resources. With contingencies, the
total cost of the 1988-90 road programs in Vojvodina, Macedonia, Montenegro
and Kosovo, (including 1987 Vojvodina expenditures on TYH) is estimated at
US$579.1 million with a foreign exchange component of US$256.0 million.
New construction under the programs is estimated at US$103.7 million, and
rehabilitation at US$214.8 million, with a combined foreign exchange
component of US$149.1 million. Road maintenance costs and administrative
costs are estimated at US$146.2 million. Debt servicing is estimated at
US$ 111.4 million. Additional costs for road maintenance equipment as well
as planning equipment, technical assistance and training for the Croatia RO
are estimated at US$5.9 million. The total cost of Bank-financed items in
the road program for 1988-90 including equipment, technical assistance and
training is estimated at US$140.9 million. The proposed Bank loan of
US$68.0 million, would finance the foreign component of the Bank-financed
roads, the foreign cost of equipment and 100% of technical assistance and
training. The loan would be apportioned as follows: Kosovo US$6.4
million, Macedonia US$17.9 million, Montenegro US$9.6 million, Vojvodina
US$28.2 million and Croatia US$5.9 million. Table 3.12 summarizes the
Bank-financed program. During negotiations, the project cost estimates
were confirmed.

- 31 -
3.27     A financing plan has been drawn up for each republic and province,
and sources of funds identified for all the planned expenditures (Annex 2,
Tables 1-4). Revenue from the road use charge contained in the fuel price
will provide between 31% and 51% of the total, with an overall average of
about 40%. Contributions from republic and provincial work organizations
and communities will provide an average of 12%, varying from nil to 25%.
Other sources of funds (48%) include registration fees, tolls, taxes on
foreign vehicles, Republican funds, the Federal fund for LDR and bank
loans. Of the total foreign exchange cost of new construction and
rehabilitation, estimated at US$149.1 million, at least 75% is expected to
be met from: (i) the Bank loan; (ii) possible loans from EIB for
improvements to primary routes; and (iii) revenue from entry permits of
foreign vehicles. The balance of foreign exchange cost, principally for
rehabilitation works, would be covered by domestic sources. During
negotiations, the investment and financing plans were discussed and
confirmed.
3.28     The Federal Government is aware that periodic adjustments are
required to road user charges in both gasoline and diesel fuel in order to
ensure adequate financing for road construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance (para 1.08), and target figures for road maintenance and
rehabilitation have been confirmed (Annex 3, Table 4). The increases in
road user charges will be examined and reviewed as part of each annual
review of the program under the Action Plan (para 3.33). During
negotiations assurances were obtained from the Federal Government that road
user charges will be adjusted as necessary to ensure adequate financing for
the road investment and maintenance programs (para. 5.03). In addition,
the Republican and Provincial Governments have approved the investment and
financing plans, including providing a commitment to allocate road user
revenues to road expenditures in order to provide adequate funds for the
programs (para. 5.05).
J. Implementation
3.29     The ROs of the five participating Republics and Provinces are the
Borrowers under the project and are responsible for the execution and
management of their road programs with construction supervision
subcontracted to Yugoslav engineering institutes which designed the project
roads (para. 3.23). Bids for the first contract was invited in May 1987 in
Vojvodina with a contract award in September 1987. Bids would also be
invited between November 1987 and February 1988 in Macedonia, Montenegro
and Kosovo leading to contract awards by about March 1988. All projects
would be completed by December 1990 providing one year for completion of
works beyond the implementation schedule target date of December 1989
(Annex 5). The first phase of the Pilot Road Maintenance Planning System
in Croatia commenced in May 1987. The second stage would develop all
elements of the central system in tandem with the introduction of a
maintenance management system within selected RMEs and would commence in
late 1987. The RO in Croatia, assisted by the Civil Engineering Institute
(CEI) in Zagreb, would operate the proposed system. The CEI has recently
established a Maintenance and Rehabilitation Division with four staff to
handle work in this field, and one engineer from CEI has recently attended
a two week training course run by the Bank in Washington on the use and
operation of Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM) III.



- 32 -
3.30     FARP will act as fiscal agent for the project and as liaison on
project-related matters between the Borrowers and the Bank, and will
coordinate requests for reimbursement/disbursement from the Bank. FARP
would furnish to the Bank progress reports and progress charts in July and
October of each year. FARP will also be responsible for liaising with the
Federal Government on matters related to road user charges and for overall
coordination in the implementation of the training program and for the
procurement of planning equipment. FARP is already staffed by an acting
secretary (transport economist), a senior highway engineer and a traffic
engineer. In order to strengthen its coordinating role, FARP intends to
hire additional staff during 1987/88 including a second economist, an
accountant, a lawyer and two technical staff with computer experience.
During negotiations, reporting arrangements were discussed and confirmed.
3.31     Specific road sections to be improved during subsequent years will
be prepared on a continuous basis in time for approval by the Bank and for
inclusion in the annual programs. Feasibility studies for all
Bank-financed sub-projects and all other major investment items would be
reviewed by FARP prior to submission of summary sheets to the Bank
according to agreed procedure. Assurances were obtained from the Borrowers
that they will execute the project in line with the implementation schedule
and in accordance with the provision of the Project Action Plan (para. 5.02
(b)). Such information will be made available to the Bank by April 30 of
each year together with the preliminary updated investment and financing
plans so that the programs can be firmed up for the following year by
November 30. The criteria for Bank approval of sub-projects are that:
(i) the quality of preparation and analysis must be acceptable to the Bank;
(ii) the Economic Return (ER) of investment is at least equal to 122; and
(iii) implementation would not be started before the optimal year. During
negotia'          drances were obtained that, prior to bidding, FARP will
submit t         fy data on individual project road sections for the Bank's
approval,       ding to agreed procedures and criteria set forth in the
Action Plan.
K. Project Action Plan
General
3.32     The Action Plan shown in Annex 4 constitutes a comprehensive
record of project objectives and activities, including what action has
already been taken, as well as timing and responsibilities relating to
various steps and actions to be taken during project implementation. The
Action Plan provides for:
(a) agreement on the overall investment and maintenance programs,
including annual review and updating;
(b) a general framework for adjustments to road user taxation;
(c) specific measures for implementing improved road maintenance
strategies;
(d) an action program for FARP, with the aim of improving overall
coordination, monitoring and reporting;



- 33 -
(e) procurement and administrative arrangements for the project;
and
(f) provisions for further training in the field of management
and design of maintenance projects.
3.33     As part of the provisions of the Action Plan, the investment and
financing plans would be updated on an annual basis in consultation with
FARP and, beginning in 1988, would be submitted in draft for m by April 30
for the following year for the Bank's review and comment. The final
programs would be agreed by November 30 of each year and the ROs would
reflect the final investment programs in their annual budget
(para. 5.01 (c)). In line with the key features of the draft Social
Compact for Roads (para. 1.08), the Action Plan supports equity in the
recovery of road infrastructure costs from road users as well as the need
to maintain taxation levels in real terms. The Action Plan will also
encourage a simplification and standardization of vehicle registration
fees, including restructuring charges to reflect road costs for particular
vehicle categories. During negotiations, the contents of the Action Plan
and the proposed road investment and financing plans, including the road
maintenance and rehabilitation targets, were discussed and confirmed. The
project implementation schedule was also discussed and confirmed.
L. Procurement
3.34     Prequalification of contractors for works to be put to ICB
(para. 3.35) took place in February 1987 using the same prequalification
procedures and forms as agreed to under the First Highway Sector Project
(Loan 2715-YU). Bidding documents for ICB are based on the Bank's sample
document and have been reviewed and approved hy the Bank.
3.35     Civil works for Bank-financed items over US$3.0 million (totalling
US$104.5 million) for the improvement and rehabilitation of the TYH in
Vojvodina and Macedonia and the rehabilitation and betterment of primary
roads and bridges, as well as road maintenance equipment would be procured
through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Due
to its specialized nature, procurement of the planning equipment totalling
US$ 1.1 million would be through international shopping with individual
items not exceeding US$150,000.
3.36     Civil works for contracts under US$3.0 million (totalling
US$29.4 million) for the road rehabilitation program and the TYH new
construction in Kosovo would be procured by contracts through LCB. The
total estimated value is distributed as follows: Vojvodina, US$8.7 million;
Montenegro US$7.9 million; and Kosovo US$12.8 million. These works are
scattered and there is a need to encourage competitive bidding procedures
for road rehabilitation work. The Bank has reviewed and commented on the
Yugoslav local procurement laws and regulations. These procedures were
found to be generally satisfactory. However, although the participation of
foreign contractors in LCB procedures is allowed under Federal law, it is
not provided for specifically in the Republican and Provincial laws.
during negotiations, assurances were obtained that, under LCB, foreign



- 34 -
contractors would be allowed to bid and import the necessary materials and
equipment (5.01(d)).
3.37     Selection of consultants in setting up of the Pilot Road
Maintenance Planning System in Croatia will be made by the RO in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for the use of consultants. The selection of
consultants in the other Republics and Provinces would also be in
accordance with the Bank guidelines for use of consultants.
3.38     All contracts for the procurement of civil works and goods
estimated to cost over US$50,000 would be subject to the Bank's prior
review and approval. This review would cover about 952 of Bank-financed
procurement. The balance of contracts would be subject to random post
review after contract award.

proposed loan.
M. Disbursements
3.39     Disbursement would be made on the following basis:
(a)  Civil works: 452 of total expenditures for new construction
and 50% of total expenditure for rehabilitation;
(b)  Equipment:  1002 foreign expenditures; 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 60% of local expenditures
for other items; and



- 35 -
(c) Training and Technical Assistance: l00%
Retroactive financing in an amount not exceeding US$8.0 million would be
provided for civil works on road construction in Vojvodina for which
payment is made between July 1, 1987 and loan signature (paras. 3.29 and
5.04).
3.40     Disbursements would be made against Statement of Expenditure (SOE)
for eligible expenditures under contracts valued at $50,000 equivalent or
less. Supporting documentation for these would be retained by the
Borrowers and made available for review by the Bank during supervision.
The annual audits of the project accounts would include a separate opinion
on the disbursements made under the SOE procedure. All other disbursements
would be made against normal documentation submitted to the Bank.
3.41     In order to expedite project execution, Special Accounts would be
opened at a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank with an aggregate
authorized allocation of $6.0 million (four-month average of eligible
expenditures). The documentation for replenishment requests would follow
the same procedures as in paragraph 3.40. In addition, monthly bank
statements of the Special Account would accompany replenishment requests.
3.42     The closing date of the Bank loan would be December 31, 1991.  The
disbursement schedule shown in Table 7 has been developed from the
implementation schedule shown in Annex 5 and assumes the project would be
effective by January 1988, and would be completed by December 31, 1990.
Disbursements on loans under the previous Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth
Highway Projects have averaged only four years, a rapid rate of
disbursement compared to the average profile for 21 transport projects in
Yugoslavia, which is 6-1/2 years. These highway projects were not affected
by local funding problems which subsequently slowed disbursements on the
Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects. However, following the revision of
the timetable of these projects, disbursements proceeded genes.ally in line
with the revised implementation schedule, and covered 4-1/2 to 5 years. In
view of this and the intended close monitoring by means of the updating and
submission of annual programs in accordance with the detailed Action Plan
and agreed adjustments to the road user charges, disbursements should
closely follow the planned implementation schedule. On this basis,
disbursements under the project have been forecast over about 4-1/2 years
after the Board date. The estimated disbursements from the proposed loan
are shown in Table 7. During negotiations, the disbursement schedule was
confirmed.
N. Accounting and Audit
3.43     As a Community of Interest (COI), the form of each RO's accounts,
as with all Yugoslav enterprises, is prescribed by law. The accounting
department of a typical COI is well organized and have a staff of eight to
ten, headed by a director.
3.44     In each republic and province the accounting and financial system
is arranged for separation of responsibilities. A separate account is kept
for each subproject. The account records the budgeted sum for the
investment and the total committed (by contracts) as well as expenditures.
All major investments, as those in the proposed Bank project, are required



- 36 -
to be registered with and audited by the social Accounting Service (SDK)
and the sources of funds must be identified and the funds assured before
work may commence. Information registered with SDK includes a detailed
analysis of the estimated cost. A main part of the audit function of SDK
is to ensure that funds are used only for purposes for which they are
registered.
3.45     Agreements were reached with each of the ROs rega. ing the form
and timing of financial reports to be rendered annually to the Bank to give
information required on project expenditures, financing resources and Bank
loan disbursements. Assurances were obtained that arrangements would be
made with SDK by each RO for the audit of the Special Account and Statement
of Expenditures for the submission to the Bank, within six months after the
end of each financial year.
0. Environmental Impact
3.46     The project is not expected to have any significant adverse
environmental or sociological effects. There is little habitation along
the alignment of the existing TYH road section in Vojvodina to which two
additional lanes will be added and for which the rigth-of-way was acquired
prior to 1982. All other sections involve improvements following existing
alignments and there will be little need to secure agricultural land for
right-of-way. Reduction in noise and air pollution will result to the
extent that traffic congestion along the project road sections will be
obviated. With the rehabilitation work following the existing alignment
wild lands are not affected. Similarly, no cultural properties are
affected by the works.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01     Detailed feasibility studies have been completed for a substantial
part of the road investment programs in the four Republics and Provinces
included in the project. These studies cover all major construction items
as well as part of the routine rehabilitation programs which constitute a
minimum requirement for the more heavily-trafficked routes. The investment
and maintenance programs are considered to be appropriately balanced and
their general economic viability has been confirmed. In addition, the
project is designed to promote a systematic selection of sub-projects under
the later years of the investment plan and to provide for adequate
rehabilitation and maintenance programs.
B. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.02     One of the aims of the project is to improve traffic conditions on
two heavily-trafficked TYH sections, namely the E-70 route in Vojvodina
between Sasinci and Kuzmin (30.8 km) and the E-75 route in Macedonia
between Gradsko and Gevgelija on the Greek border (80 km). The TYH
investments under the project will account for about 44% of that portion of
the investment programs in which the Bank will participate. Because of the
inter-regional character of TYH, road improvement will benefit primarily



- 37 -
long distance traffic linking Yugoslavia's main centers of population and
economic activity. In addition, as the major transport route between
western Europe, the Balkan area and the Middle East, improvements to TYH
will facilitate international transit traffic an, thus have a far-reaching
impact beyond the borders of Yugoslavia.. Following the accession of
Greece to the European Economic Community, the international importance of
TYH has been greatly increased. However, because of traffic congestion,
permits for transit traffic are currently restricted by the Federal
Government and there is considerable potential for further growth in
international traffic. The main benefits of the TYH program will be in
savings in transport costs which will accrue directly to a wide variety of
road users from various sectors of the economy and from a range of income
groups throughout the country. Because road transport enterprises in
Yugoslavia are competitive and well-managed, the transport cost savings
would be passed on to producers and consumers. Similarly, benefits for
international traffic will ultimately accrue to Yugoslavia in the form of
revenue collected through transit traffic agreements authorized by the
Federal Government and partly through the participation of international
traffic in Yugoslavia's foreign trade. As the bulk of international
traffic on TYH carries the country's exports and imports, the inclusion of
transport cost savings as a surrogate for other more indirect benefits is
justified. Finally, although transport cost savings for pure transit
traffic may not be recuperated entirely through transit fees, this traffic
represents less than 52 of total commercial traffic and its exclusion would
not affect the viability of the sections considered. The provision of
specialized maintenance equipment for TYH will ensure adequate traffic
service during periods of severe winter weather and reduce costly delays to
traffic.
4.03     The road rehabilitation and betterment programs financed under the
project will provide substantial benefits to road users on many
heavily-traf'icked primary and regional routes, linking important urban
centers as well as industrial and agricultural areas. The program includes
rehabilitation of about 90 km of the E-65 Adriatic Highway route in
Montenegro and Kosovo. These sections are also part of routes which carry
heavy volumes of international tourist traffic during the summer months.
The main benefits of the rehabilitation program will be in reduced
transport costs which follow from improved driving surfaces as well as
avoided stepped-up maintenance costs which would otherwise be necessary to
maintain existing roads in serviceable condition. Benefits from the
improvement of a 5 km gravel route between Lebane and Milosevo near
Pristina in Kosovo will provide a 19 km distance saving for through traffic
travelling between the E-80 Nis-Pristina route and the E-65 Adriatic
Highway leading from Pristina to Skopje. Finally, the rehabilitation of
the 360 meter Tara River Bridge in Montenegro will generate user cost
savings through the elimination of severe operating restrictions on the
bridge as well as provide savings in maintenance costs. The effects of a
possible failure of the bridge in terms of the cost to diverted traffic, in
an area where there are few alternative routes, as well as the cost of
reconstruction of the bridge, have not been included.
4.04     As a whole, the Bank-financed road sections under the investment
programs will yield annual savings in foreign exchange of at least
US$15 million in the form of avoided expenditures on fuel and reduced
vehicle operating costs. In addition, the savings in road user costs



- 38 -
through improved road maintenance operations will also generate foreign
exchange savings. Moreover, taking into account the role of roads in
transit and foreign trade and tourism, improvements to TYH and other key
primary routes are expected to provide further contributions to the
country's foreign exchange earnings.
4.05     The project will also contribute in a significant manner to
improvements in good maintenance management, as well as provide attention
to such issues as investment planning, maintenance allocations, road user
charges, and inter-Republican coordination. Through the implementation of
improved maintenance of the road network, substantial savings will accrue
not only to road user but also to the Republican and Provincial authorities
in the form of avoided reconstruction of primary roads. In turn, these
savings will ultimately benefit the general population by increasing the
financial resources available for other purposes.
C. Economic Evaluation
4.06     In developing the four overall investment programs, all major
components have been evaluated by the ROs and projects were ranked, taking
into account available financial resources.   Several alternative solutions
were considered for major investment plan items such as rehabilitation of
the existing road, with a comparison of 10 year and 20 year pavement lives,
minor or major changes in alignment, stage construction of four-lane
facilities and detailed analysis of interchange and intersection designs.
ERs have been estimated for all sub-projects planned for Bank-financing
during the first year of the project, as well as for many items planned in
subsequent years. Project costs are based on substantially completed
detailed engineering for most road sections, and include costs of
right-of-way, engineering and supervision. The ERs are based on estimated
savings in vehicle operating costs, travel time costs and maintenance
expenditures, taking into account base-year traffic levels and projected
traffic growth. After the elimination of fuel rationing in January 1985,
traffic on most routes has increased annually at about 5% in 1985 and
1986. It is assumed to continue increasing by 4% per year through 1990,
falling again to 3% in the longer term, these modest rates being in line
with the forecast growth of the economy (para 1.04).
4.07     Details of the road sections proposed for Bank-financing are shown
in Table 8. The TYH section between Kuzmin and Sasinci (30.8 km) in
Vojvodina, which will be improved to four-lane limited access standards,
shows an ER of 15%. The alternative reviewed for this section was for a
20-year pavement design as a 10-year stage construction alternative and did
not show a higher ER. The other sections comprising mostly rehabilitation
with 10-year pavement designs, shows ERs ranging from 25% to 50%. The Tara
bridge rehabilitation in Montenegro shows an ER of 15% while the 5 km
by-pass section near Pristina in Kosovo shows a high ER of about 60%. All
sections yield acceptable first-year benefits in excess of 10%. The
overall ER for the proposed Bank-financed sub-projects is estimated at
about 23%. Even under pessimistic assumptions such as a 10% increase in
costs combined with a 10% decrease in benefits, all sections show
acceptable ERs above 12%.
4.08     Under the sector project, the Bank will be participating in about
47% of planned new investments (excluding maintenance) during the period



- 39 -
1987-89. Of the total investments planned in the four Republics and
Provinces, rehabilitation and minor betterment amounts to about 802 with
about 20% allocated to new construction. The rehabilitation and betterment
components would provide ERs of at least 25%. In addition, the improved
maintenance programs would yield substantially higher ERs, probably on the
order of 50Z and up.  As maintenance programs account for about 25% of
total expenditures on roads, a conservative estimate of the ER of the four
investment and maintenance programs as a whole would be in the range of 30%.
D. Project Risks
4.09     The main risk in the impl..nentation of the project relates to the
availability of local funds. Should local funds fall below the program
requirements, there is a risk that the investments might be delayed and
su1stantial benefits to the economy foregone.  However, the programs have
been closely tailored to available financial resources and the annual
reviews under the project of both the investment and financing plans should
mitigate any problems in local funding. In the event that local funflL were
restricted, it is expected that the Bank-financed sub-projects would
receive the highest priority thus ensuring their timely completion.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Borrowers that they will:
(a) submit through FARP, a summary of the data on individual road
sections for the Bank's approval, according to agreed
procedures and criteria set forth in the Action Plan
(para. 3.31);
(b) execute the project in accordance with the provisions of the
Project Action Plan (para 3.33);
(c) update the investment and maintenance programs annually and
review them with the Bank, including reflecting the final
investment programs in the RO's budgets (para. 3.33); and
(d)  under LCB allow foreign contractors to bid and import
necessary material and equipment (para. 3.36).
5.02     The Project Action Plan is mentioned in the Loan Agreement (para.
3.33). In addition, in view of the role of the Federal Government in
adjusting road user charges, the current policy of the Federal Government
to adjust road user charges in line with inflation was reiterated in the
Federal Guarantee Agreement together with an undertaking to adjust road
user charges to ensure adequate financing for road investment and
maintenance programs (para. 3.28).
5.03     Agreement to the investment and financing plans by the Republican
and Provincial Government authorities, including a commitment to allocate
road user revenue to road expenditures, was obtained (para. 3.28).
5.04     Retroactive financing would be provided up to US$8 million for
Vojvodina to cover expenditures on the Kuzmin-Sasinci section of TYH
between July 1, 1987 and the date of loan agreement signature (para. 3.39).



- 40 -
5.05     With the agreements reached on the above, the project would be
suitable for five Bank loans totalling US$68 million apportioned among the
five separate borrowers, namely, the Road Organizations of Vojvodina,
Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Croatia.

SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Previous Projects in Transport Sector
Previous Projects
1.       The Bank has lent US$1,345.6 million net of cancellations  to the
transport sector to date, including US$749.8 million for twelve highway
projects, US$488.3 million for seven railway projects, US$42.4 million for
the Bar Port Project, and US$6'i.1 million for earthquake rehabilitation
assistance for restoring damaged roads, railways and a port in Montenegro.
In addition, the Bank has loaned US$106.7 million net of cancellations for
two pipeline projects.
Highway Projects
2.       The First Highway Project (Loan 344-YU), US$35 million) in 1963
financed the completion of the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway
(422 km) and parts of the Belgrade-Nis road (174 km).  The Second Highway
Project (Loan 485-YU, US$10 million), financed in 1967, was for the
improvement of 367 km of roads connecting the Zagreb-Belgrade highway via
Sarajevo and Tuzla with the Adriatic highway. Both projects were completed
within the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The Third
Highway Project (Loan 608-YU, US$30 million), financed in 1969, and
comprising about 120 km of roads in Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, was
completed in August 1974 with a 20-month delay, primarily due to delays in
completing an access road. This project had an 8% cost overrun because of
inflation and foreign exchange adjustments. The Fourth Highway Project
(Loan 678-YU, US$40 million) was financed in 1970 for the construction of
about 220 km of roads in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and
Vojvodina. Because of expropriation problems in the section of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, the project was completed in December 1V7) witLh an
18-month delay. There was a 12% cost overrun due to iiuflation and foreign
exchange adjustments. The Fifth Highway Project (Loan 751-YU,
US$35 million) became effective eight months late in 1973 due to Government
administrative delays. The project comprised 153 km of roads in Kosovo,
Macedonia and Slovenia, procurement of US$1.7 million worth of engineering
equipment, consultant's services and a staff training component to improve
highway planning and project preparation. The engineering equipment was
been delivered and the consultant's services were completed
satisfactorily. The staff training component was delayed because of
difficulties encountered in securing training of candidates in the head
office of foreign consultants and in foreign institutes and because of
language problems (insufficient candidates proficient in English).
Consequently, a restricted program was adopted. Because of the delay in



- 42 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 6
training, the project was completed by the end of 1977, involving a delay
of about 15 months. This project had an 82 cost overrun because of the
combined effect of inflation and foreign adjustments.
3.       The loan for the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 990-YU,
US$30 million) was made in 1974. The project financed six road sections in
Bosnia-Hercegovina totalling 150 km, the training of transport economists
and road engineers, and US$1.1 million worth of engineering and laboratory
equipment. The loan for the Seventh Highway Project (Loan 1143-YU,
US$40 million) was made in 1975. The project comprised about 90 km of road
construction in Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro, and US$0.1 million worth
of technical assistance to improve preparation of highway feasibility
studies and to provide a related training program. The project was
completed by the end of 1979. The Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU,
US$56 million) was made in 1977. The project comprised about 130 km of
roads in Serbia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Macedonia and Kosovo, studies by
consultants of road user charges and rail costs and technical assistance
for the preparation of a highway master plan for Kosovo. The road works
were completed and the loan closed in 1981 and US$0.1 million cancelled
from the Bank loan. Both the Seventh and Xighth Highway Projects focused
on improving sections of the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH), which was to
become the primary objective of later projects, while at the same time
promoting regional development by improving selected regional roads in
lesser-developed areas. The Ninth Highway Project (Loan 1535-YU,
US$80 million) was made in 1978. The project comprised construction of
four highly congested sections of TYH in Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia,
totalling about 86 km, and the procurement of equipment for maintenance and
for monitoring loadings of vehicles using the primary highway network,
including TYH. All road works were completed by January 1982 and the final
delivery of highway maintenance equipment and weighing scales was made in
December 1982.
4.       The loan for the Tenth Highway Project (Loan 1678-YU,
US$148 million; US$147.5 million net of cancellations) was made in April
1979 and became effective in August 1979. It comprised the first phase (a
three-year tranche from mid-1979 to mid-1982) of the 1979-85 highway sector
programs of five participating Republics and Provinces. Although progress
was variable among the borrowers, most construction contracts suffered
delays of one to two years due to a shortage of local funds. Construction
was essentially completed by mid-1984, but the loan closing date was
postponed to June 30, 1985, to allow for completion of the training
component and procurement of equipment. The project also included an
updating of the Road User Charges Study, financed under the Eighth Highway
Project. The loan for the Eleventh Highway project (Loan 1819-YU,
US$125 million) was made in April 1980 and became effective in August
1980. It comprised construction of six sections of the Trans-Yugoslav
Highway (TYH) with controlled access facilities in four Republics and
Provinces, totalling about 164 km, and the procurement of highway
maintenance and road monitoring equipment, technical assistance, a highway
safety program and the preparation of a Toll Study. Although execution

ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 6
was delayed by up to two years because of the shortage of local funds, most
construction items were completed by the revised loan closing date of June
30, 1985 and US$0.1 million was cancelled from the Bank loan. The Tenth
and Eleventh Highway Projects were both implemented during a period of
economic difficulty and budgetary reductions. Because of the severe
shortage of local funds, both the Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects were
included under the Bank's Special Action Program in mid-1983. The
investment plans were revised, and the projects were then implemented as
planned, albeit with a two year delay. Re-estimated economic returns for
both projects were satisfactory. Several institutional improvements were
incorporated in the project including preparation of guidelines for toll
facilities on TYH, a highway safety program, and training.
5.       A loan for a Highway Sector Project (Loan 2715-YU, US$121.5
million) was made in 1986. The project finances a time slice of the road
investment/maintenance program of f,u. Republics with the emphasis on
removal of bottlenecks, rehabilitation, and completion of the basic
network. The project also emphasizes investment planning, increased
allocations to road maintenance operations, sound financial planning under
conditions of budgetary constraint, and strengthening of the new
coordinating body for roads (FARP). Project preparation was delayed due to
slowness in reaching agreement on the Republics to be included in the
project, the composition of investment plans, and delays in adjusting road
user charges. Following negotiations, project signature was delayed about
six months due to Government delays in providing bank guarantees to the
borrowers. Following substantial increases in road user charges during
1986 which exceeded actual inflation, the project was signed in February
1987 and became effective in July 1987.
Railways
6.       The First Railway Loan was made in 1963 (Loan 316-YU, US$35
million) to finance the conversion of the 195 km Sarajevo-Ploce line to
standard gauge, with electric traction and modern signalling and
telecommunications. The project was substantially completed and put into
operation in 1970, with a delay of four years.
7.       The Second Railway Loan (Loan 395-YU, US$70 million) was made in
1964 to help finance the modernization of 1,509 km of main lines traversing
Yugoslavia from the Austrian and Italian borders to the Greek border. It
included electrification, signalling, telecommunications, and the
improvement of six key marshalling yards. This project ran into major
difficulties because after the 1965 political and economic reforms the
railways' internal funds fell substantially below expectations, and also
because of deficiencies in project planning and preparation which resulted
in an underestimate of quantities and of time needed for completion of such
an extensive project. With hindsight, this was too ambitious a project in
relation to the railways' resources. The Bank loan was fully disbursed in
1972. The project was refinanced from the fourth railway loan and was



- 44 -
ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 6
completed in 1981 at a total cost of about US$410 million, over twice the
original cost estimate.
8.       The Third Railway Loan made in 1968 (Loan 531-YU, US$50 million)
helped to finance construction of 370 km of the Belgrade-Bar line, with
electrification, signalling and telecommunications for the entire 475 km
line. This was a project of great technical complexity involving the
construction of over 300 tunnels and several major bridges. The civil
works were satisfactorily constructed by local contractors. Completion was
originally scheduled for 1973, but geotechnical and other construction
difficulties delayed the opening of the line until 1976, and the project
was completed in 1978. Technical problems and inflation aggravated by
delays raised the cost of the project to US$422 million.
9.       Because of problems on the second project, the Bank, in agreement
with the Yugoslav authorities, unidertook a comprehensive study of the
railways with the assistance of consultants. This prepared the ground for
the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1026-YU, US$93 million), agreed in 1974,
under which the Bank's loan was allocated to the completion of the 1964
Modernization Program and to "Related Investments" needed to maximize its
benefits, all to be completed by the end of 1976. However, in contrast
with earlier projects which consisted only of investments to which the Bank
loan had been allocated, the fourth project was defined as the totality of
the railways' investments in 1974-76, whose cost was estimated at US$1,138
million. The Bank loan thus amounted to about 12% of the cost of the
project. Agreement was reached on measures to help overcome the railways'
financial problems, principally through tariff increases. An important
feature of the project was the preparation of comprehensive Action Plans
which, given Yugoslavia's decentralized system, were designed to contribute
to a common understanding of objectives and responsibility by all
concerned. Only about two-thirds of project investments were executed
under the project; however, they were reasonably balanced to maximize
system effects, and the remainder were included in the 1976-80 Investment
Plan. Execution of Bank-financed "Related Investments" was substantially
better (about three quarters). Except for the section from Skopje to
Gevgelija on the Greek border, the electrification of the main line
traversing Yugoslavia was completed during the period of implementation of
the project. Works were completed satisfactorily and the loan was closed
in 1981; US$0.3 million was cancelled from the Bank loan.
10.      The Fifth Railway Loan (Loan 1534-YU, US$100 million;
US$99.5 million net of cancellations) was made in 1978. The project
consisted of a three-year (1978-80) portion of the eight railways'
investment plans.  Its principal objective was to further improve the
efficiency and the competitive position of the railways though 1,285 km of
track overhaul or reconstruction, 93 km of route conversion from single to
double track, electrification of 314 km, equipping of 53 km with modern
signalling, installation of automatic block on 434 km, technical assistance
and staff training. Ninety percent of the project was completed on
schedule, and the economic return was re-estimated to be 18% against 15%
estimated at appraisal. Tariff covenants were not fully complied with due



- 45 -
ANNEX 1
Page 5 of 6
to unexpected inflation, but this situation improved under the Sixth
Railway Project. The Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) was successfully
strengthened under the project.
11.      The Kosovo Railways Project (Loan 1977-YU, US$34 million) was mnade
in 1981. The Project included reconstrucion of the Kosovo Junction,
signalling and telecommunications improvements, procurement of rolling
stock, and training and technical assistance to improve management and
freight operations. The project was completed two years behind schedule in
early 1987, due primarily to managerial inefficiencies including
procurement delays. The economic return is expected to be lower than
estimated at appraisal, but still greater than 102, due to a shortfall in
traffic. US$2.9 million in project funds were cancelled due to
appreciation of the US dollar. The loan was closed in December 1986.
12.      The Sixth Railway Project (Loan 2336-YU, US$110 million) was made
in 1983. The project consists of a four year time slice (1983-86) of four
RTOs investment plans, including the overhaul of 545 km of track,
signalling and telecommunications on about 320 km of line, electrification
of the Bosanski-Novi Knin line, spare parts tor locomotives, and technical
assistance and training. Project effectiveness was delayed by one year due
to delays in increasing tariffs, but the project is now proceeding on
schedule and within the cost estimate. The RTOs have complied with the
tariff covenant since effectiveness, leading to a reduction on compensation
payments by the Republics/Provinces. The project is expected to be
completed in 1988.
Port of Bar Project
13.      The loan (Loan 1060-YU, US$44 million) was made in 1974 to finance
port development and related railway facilities. All works have been
completed and the loan was closed in 1981 and US$1.6 million was cancelled
from the Bank loan. The PCR indicated that despite the delays in the
development of traffic following the 1979 earthquake, the project
represents a significant contribution to the economic development of
southern and eastern Yugoslavia. However, the port is somewhat
over-designed for present traffic levels and as a result the economic
return is marginal.
Earthquake Rehabilitation (Transport Facilities)
14.      The Montenegro Rehabilitation Project for Earthquake Damage, Roads
(Loan 1759-YU, US$21 million) was made in 1979. The project was
satisfactorily completed on schedule at the end of 1982. The Montenegro
Rehabilitation Project for Earthquake Damage, Ports (Loan 1768-YU,
US$50 million) was made in 1979, and the final equipment deliveries were
made in 1984. US$19.9 million were cancelled from the loan due to
appreciation of the US dollar. The Montenegro Rehabilitation Project for
Earthquake Damage, Railways (Loan 1769-YU, US$ 14 million) was also made in
1979. It comprised repair and restoration of railway facilities damaged by
the earthquake and the expansion of railway yards at Bar and Titograd.
Project completion was delayed due to the fact that much more time than



- 46 -
ANNEX 1
Page 6 of 6
anticipated has been necessary for design and geological works, while the
need for work under traffic has also hampered progress. The project was
completed by the end of 1984, and a remaining balance of US$0.04 million
was cancelled.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Proposed Road Programs
Vojvodina
1.       The RO in Vojvodina is responsible for 88 km of expressway on the
east-west international route E70 between Serbia and Croatia, 1,395 km of
primary roads and 1,651 of regional roads (Table 1). Traffic on 561 of the
primary roads exceeds 3,000 vpd, while on regional roads the volume of
traffic over 3,000 vpd is only 22%. Pavement on 77% of primary roads and
61 of regional roads is over 15 years old. Present maintenance
expenditures are on the average about US$3,300 per km per year with a
planned increase to US$4,920 yearly (July 1987 prices). In order to catch
up on some of the backlog and maintain the road network in a satisfactory
service condition, the RO should on the average carry out about 120 to 130
km of rehabilitation per year (Annex 3, Table 4). The planned budget
provides for this.
2.       The TYH in Vojvodina is 88 km long connecting the borders of
Croatia and Serbia with traffic volumes of about 12,000 vpd with a peak in
the tourist season over 22,000 vpd. The Tenth Highway Project financed the
north-south E-75 highway from Novi Sad to Feketic (43 km) and a east-west
section of TYH from the Serbia border to Popinci totalling (8.7 km). The
The Eleventh Highway Project financed a 17 km extension of TYH from Popinci
to Ruma.
3.       Details of the three year road investment and maintenance program
are shown in Annex 2, Table 1. Planned expenditures on new construction,
rehabilitation and maintenance during 1988-90-' are expected to average
about 40.8 billion dinars annually at July 1987 prices (US$68.6 million).
The road program continues to emphasize improvements to TYH which accounts
for about 50% of planned expenditures, the remainder being allocated to
rehabilitation and maintenance of existing roads.
Macedonia
4.       The RO of Macedonia is responsible for 967 km of primary roads and
2,896 km of regional roads (Table 1). About 311 of the network has traffic
volumes in excess of 3,000 vpd. Primary roads are 82% paved, while two
thirds of regional roads have modern pavement. About 65% of the road
network is over 15 years old and requires rehabilitation. During the last
decade, road development plans were mainly concerned with the expansion of
1/ Also includes expenditure on Kuzmin-Sasinci section during last quarter
of 1987.

the network of regional roads to serve key areas of development in the
Republic. Although some expansion of the network will still be made to
provide needed links, the emphasis is now being turned to the consolidation
of previous investments in terms of maintenance and rehabilitation of
existing roads.
5.       In the proposed program, maintenance and rehabilitation of the
existing road network would be increased substantially. The average
maintenance expenditures in 1986/87 were only on the order of US$2,290 per
km while average rehabilitation expenditures in the same years amounted to
the equivalent of about 100 km. The project aims at increasing r9utine
maintenance to about US$4,260 per km by 1990 and providing rehabilitation
of about 180 km per year (Annex 3, Table 4).
6.       Details of the investment program and financing plan are shown in
Annex 2, Table 2. Planned expenditures on rehabilitation and maintenance
during 1988-90 are expected to average 28.9 billion dinars annually in July
1987 prices (US$48.6 million).
Montenegro
7.       The RO of Montenegro is responsible for a relatively small network
of 1,722 km comprising 843 km of primary roads and 879 km of regional roads
(Table 1). Over 20% of this network is gravel surfaced, including about
100 km of primary roads, many of which are carrying traffic volumes in
excess of 400 vpd. Much of the primary network was completed during the
1970s with Bank assistance under the Seventh and Tenth Highway Projects and
additional support was provided through an Earthquake Rehabilitation Loan
for roads. Because of the recent age of much of the paved network,
pavement condition is generally good, except along the older Adriatic
Highway, the main primary route linking the coastal area with Titograd and
the interior. The rehabilitation of this route is of high priority under
the proposed investment plan for roads during the period through 1990.
8.       The proposed road investment program in Montenegro during 1988-90
focusses upon a modest program of rehabilitation of roads and bridges in
the primary network and urgent rehabilitation of an old 320 m. long
bridge. The program is drawn from the projects identified in the highway
master plan which was prepared under the Tenth Highway Project. High
priority is being given to adequate maintenance expenditures which averaged
US$ 3,000 per km in 1986/7 and would rise under the project to about
US$4,050 per km by 1990 (Annex 3, Table 4). These are reasonable levels
considering the average traffic volumes on primary and regional roads which
are in the range of 1,500 to 2,000 vpd. Annex 2, Table 3, shows estimated
expenditures on roads in Montenegro in 1986/7 and the proposed
rehabilitation and maintenance program during 1988-90 and the supporting
financing plan. Expenditures during the three year period are expected to
average about 9.8 billion dinars annually in July 1987 prices (US$16.5
million) with the emphasis on rehabilitation and maintenance of the
existing network.

Kosovo
9.       The RO of Kosovo is responsible for 571 km of primary roads and
1,194 km of regional roads more than half of which are gravel roads
(Table 1). About 222 of the network has traffic volumes in excess of 3,000
vpd. Primary roads are 93% paved, while 62% of regional roads have modern
pavement. Only 27% of the pavement is over 15 years old but much of the
network shows signs of maintenance neglect, in particular shoulder widths
in many places have deteriorated and pose serious traffic hazards.
Improved routine maintenance is urgently needed.
10.      The Bank's most recent participation in Kosovo was under the Tenth
Highway Project (Loan 1678-YU) when a three-year program focussed on the
construction and improvement of 148 km of inter-regional roads and 181 km
of regional roads. Due to the shortage of local resources, 44 km of
locally financed roads were deleted from the three-year program. However,
urgent rehabilitation of three major bridges on the Titova
Mitrovica-Ribarice section of the E-65 Adriatic Highway, was added to the
program. The average estimated maintenance expenditures in 1986/7 were
about US$2,500 per km and would be increased by 1990 to about US$4,700 per
km. The rehabilitation budget in 1986/7 provided for rehabilitation of
about 35 km of roads.   Under the project, the level of rehabilitation
would increase to some 50 to 70 km per year (Annex 3, Table 4).
11.      The road investment program and financing plan for the period
1988-90 as well as estimated expefnditures in 1986/7 are shown in Annex 2,
Table 4. Planned expenditures on new construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance are expected to average about 9.0 billion dinars annually in
July 1987 prices (US$15.2 million) with the main emphasis on rehabilitation
and maintenance.

SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Pilot Road Maintenance Planning System for the Republic of Croatia
A. The Road System and its Maintenance
1.       The road network of Croatia is made up as follows
Motorways                              199 km
Magistral (primary) Roads           4,335
Regional Roads                      9,263
Local Roads                        13,228
Total                              27,025 km
Under Republic of Croatia Road Law No. 29 of 1984, responsibility is given
to the Road Maintenance Enterprises (RMEs) for the following activities
connected with the road network: inspection; maintenance; preservation of
roads; traffic safety; technical administration; toll collection;
preparation of technical documents; and making proposals for future
maintenance activities.  Guided by decisions of the General Assembly of the
Republic of Croatia, the Republic Roads Assembly is responsible for making
policy decisions relating to roads and for providing funds. The Roads
Assembly has about 120 members representing groups having an interest in
roads, such as transport and commercial enterprises, agricuAltural
cooperatives, and professional and road user associations. The executive
arm of the Roads Assembly is the Roads Organisation (RO), set up as a self
managing community of interest to see that the decisions of the Assembly
are carried out. Day-to-day contact between the Assembly and the RO is by
means of executive boards. The Ministry of Transport, under the General
Assembly, is responsible for inspection of the activities of the RO and of
RMEs, and both are also subject to the normal government financial audit
regulations. In addition, the eight regional and more than one hundred
local assemblies have technical members who can, and do, subject the work
of RO and RMEs to scrutiny to ensure that public and community funds are
correctly used.
2.       There are 13 RMEs in Croatia responsible for the maintenance of
all primary, regional and local roads, unlike the other Republics and
Provinces (except Slovenia), where local roads are maintained by local
communities. There are also three special maintenance enterprises in
Croatia, one responsible for motorway maintenance, one for maintenance of
the Ucka Tunnel, and one for maintenance of the Krk Bridge. In Zagreb,
SOUR Ceste Hrvatske is a technical association to provide coordination
between all RMEs in Croatia. Each RME is thus responsible for the
maintenance of about 2,000 km of roads. The typical RME is divided into



- 55 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 7
three sections, and each section has four to six depots (stacionari), which
maintains 100 to 150 km of road. Depots have a small staff of about 25 and
some light equipment, tools and one or two trucks. Heavy equipment is held
at section or RME headquarters. Details of the staff and equipment in
Croatian RMEs is shown in Table 1 of this annex, and the administrative
hierarchy is illustrated in Chart 1 of this annex.
3.       The Regulations for the Maintenance and Preservation of Public
Roads (1985) stipulates in detail what maintenance shall be done and its
frequency. It also lays down how soon repair must be done after a failure
appears, and the frequency of road inspections. Each year, RMEs submit
estimates of funds required to carry out a work program for all classes of
roads based on these maintenance norms. RO then compiles budget estimates
from RME estimates, and calculates average 'per kilometer' rates of
maintenance funding for different classes of roads (motorway and primary,
regional, and local). The Republic Roads Assembly reviews the budget
request and revises the amount, usually downwards, according to the funds
available. Currently, 562 of the 'norm' rate has been allocated, and ROs
per kilometer rate for the various road classes is reduced accordingly.
4.       Since RMEs have a legal obligation to maintain roads under the
Republic of Croatia Road Law No. 29 of 1984, if sufficient funds are not
available for the purpose, RMEs are excused a part of their obligation
according to set priorities which ensure that fixed costs and routine
maintenance affecting road user safety are attended to first, and therefore
other works such as those needed to prolong pavement life. Hence, the
result of a continued shortage of road maintenance funds is that operations
such as pavement strengthening to prevent failure, roadside drainage, and
shoulder maintenance tend to be neglected. Also, small pavement failures
may not be attended to until they become large enough to be a traffic
hazard, when they are repaired, but at higher cost than need be.
5.       Under the 1985 Regulations, all roads are inspected at least
annually by the Ministry of Transport, RO and RMEs, and their condition is
rated in a five point index, as follows:
1 - Good condition
2 - Satisfactory Condition
3 - Bearable condition
4 - Poor condition
5 - Unusable.
Remedial action is recommended for each condition, varying according to
traffic volumes. The Government's 1986 Road Maintenance Study reported
road conditions as shown on Table 2 of this annex, but the most recent data
indicate that at present, 5,386 km, or 40% of the primary and regional
network, require resurfacing or rehabilitation, and this figure is growing
by about 131 a year. Since 1982, only 3% o0 the backlog has been
resurfaced or rehabilitated each year. This increasing backlog of
untreated roads and the low level of maintenance funds is obviously cause
for concern, and has given rise to the proposal to set up a maintenance
management system in Croatia.

ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 7
6.       If the full funding according to maintenance norms were provided,
and if the network were in good condition, funds would, on the basis of
local estimates, be sufficient for all routine maintenance and minimum
periodic maintenance. However, the backlog of rehabilitation is now
estimated to be about US$380 million, and the First Highway Sector Project
has a target for Croatia of about US$100 million for rehabilitation over
the period 1985 to 1989. Hence, about 252 of the backlog can be eliminated
under the First Highway Sector Project, and improved maintenance management
should help to eliminate the remainder over a number of years.
B. The Objectives of a Maintenance Management System for Croatia
7.       The primary objective is that maximum benefit should be obtained
from the scarce funds available for road maintenance, and that a rational
basis for determining the appropriate funding level and allocations should
be established. It is the intention to develop a method for setting
realistic maintenance norms for incorporation in the Regulations, say for a
five year Plan period, so that norms are commensurate with the funds likely
to be available for the period. This method would also indicate the most
effective maintenance policy to be followed in respect of the criteria for
maintenance, resurfacing and rehabilitation, and therefore also the basis
for allocating funds by work categories and regions. The method proposed
would also quantify the costs to the community (principally to road users)
of reductions in the road maintenance funds provided.
8.       A further objective is to improve the utilization of maintenance
funds by the RMEs, by providing them with a means to decide priorities for
work and to assist with preparation of their work program and in the
management of resources. In order to achieve these objectives, reliable
information is necessary, and a subsidiary objective is therefore to
improve and strengthen the existing roads inventory and monitoring ability
of RO in Croatia.
C. Outline of the Proposed Scheme
9.       Based on discussion with the RO, RMEs and the CEI, a two level
scheme is proposed. At the Republic level, there would be a cential
planning and information system for evaluating and setting the maintenance
norms, funding levqls and funding allocations.  At the RME level, there
would be a maintenance management system, operated by the RME and drawing
upon the central information system, for preparing annual work programs and
for managing resources. An activity outline of the scheme is shown in
Chart 2 of this annex, together with indications of the responsibility for,
and frequency of each step. Details of the scheme are given in the
following sections.
Central Planning and Information System
10.      The purpose of the central system is to optimize the overall
maintenance policy of the republic, based on an evaluation of the condition
of the network and the funds available. The maintenance policy would be
prescribed in a set of pavement condition intervention levels and



- 57 -
hNNEX 3
Page 4 of 7
appropriate remedial actions dependent upon the class of road and traffic.
The policy could thus form the basis for revision of the part of the
Regulation governing maintenance norms, made in conjunction with long-term
planning, such as the 5-year funding levels. The system would also
indicate desirable funding levels and the social costs of reduced funding.
11.      The primary component would be a network-policy analysis model,
for which the World Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Standards model
(HDM-III) is proposed. The model evaluates the economic benefits of a
maintenance strategy by a life-cycle simulation of pavement condition,
maintenance costs, and savings in road user costs, for an array of
strategies and road links. The model would be operated by a special unit
in CEI with an initial staff of three. This unit would act on behalf c
the RO in developing maintenance norms for proposal to the Republic
Assembly in long-term planning. It would also act on behalf of the RME's
annually in compiling the total annual program for approval by the RO.
12.      A complementary information system would comprise a central data
bank anid a service for special monitoring surveys of the network and other
data collection. Both these would be based at the CEI in Zagreb, where the
creation of a road inventory has already begun. The data bank would be
accessible to other users such as the RMEs and the RO, and a network-system
of communication, like that shown in Chart 3 of this annex, is a probable
option if the district (RME) management system is microcomputer-based.
Procurement is under way for the central computer that would operate both
the planning model and the data bank. In ensuring a well designed system,
consideration should be given to the quality and effectiveness of existing
Road Maintenance management systems in other countries. In particular, the
compatibility of a suitable system for micro-computer/mini/main frame
utilization should be thoroughly examined as well as an assessment as to
whether the main parameters work effectively in a similar environment.
13.      A summary of data currently included in the inventory is given in
Table 3 of this annex. The pavement condition and traffic flow records,
which are time-variant data that will be collected approximately annually
from monitoring surveys, would be stored differently in the new system to
permit historical trends and maintenance effects to be evaluated. The
present 5-class generalized index of pavement condition is inadequate for
the network-policy analysis, and so additional data on roughness condition,
and pavement strength would be collected through regular monitoring surveys
with special equipment. The potential for adaptation of the existing
index, and the scope of additional data needs is one of the first
priorities of the study, since excessive data collection may cause
unnecessarily high running costs. For example, it is recommended that
pavement deflection tests (with a deflectograph) be limited to sample
inventory measurements, and applied in detail only at Lne design
investigation stage when a road section has been designated for
rehabilitation. Roughness data are essential to the analysis, and
additional equipment and international calibration procedures are to be
implemented. Full axle loading spectrum data are to be collected by two
transportable weigh-in-motion systems. Other traffic and accident data,
collected by the Traffic Institute, will also be stored in the data bank.

District Maintenance Management System
14.      At the district level, the RMEs are responsible for road
maintenance to the community assemblies in the Enterprise 'district'. For
routine maintenance, the needs are identified through frequent inspections,
and repair is managed by individual methods; it needs to be established
whether or not any formal systemization (e.g., computerization) would
improve the efficiency of the present methods.
15.      Periodic maintenance needs however are based on the twice-yearly
(or annual) official condition survey, from which data are processed
largely by hand. The proposed system would provide for computer-assisted
data processing, and the Maintenance Programming Model would analyze that
data for the district-network, and prepare the annual work program proposal
according to the current republic maintenance norms and funds allocations.
The software for the data processing and Maintenance Programming models
would need to be developed locally, though examples may be found
elsewhere. Computerization, while desirable, is not essential, and manual
processing alternatives could be developed.
16.      A Resource Management model, which would assist the RME in
preparing equipment, material and labor estimates, and assist in the
general administration of deployment, maintenance, spares and performance
of equipment, is a possible further feature of the district system. This
model, and other possibilities such as financial management, are primarily
software features which may be added to the system, as and when they are
desired.
17.      The district system therefore needs a flexible configuration,
permitting greater or lesser degrees of computerization according to the
needs of the individual RME. This will be an important consideration to be
made during the course of developing the system.
D. Scope of Work and Implementation Phases
18.      It is anticipated that the systems would be developed in three
phases and the objectives of each are outlined below. Detailed definition
of the scope would be made in individual terms of reference prepared at the
inception of each phase.
Phase 1
19.      General objective:  An evaluation of the data currently available
for the network, and a preliminary application of the proposed central
planning model to evaluate present maintenance norms and tentative new
norms.
(a) Quantify the existing generalized (5-class) pavement
condition classification of the network in physical measures,
and evaluate its reliability for network analysis;



- 59 -
ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 7
(b) determine, using the current statistics of network condition
quantified in physical measures, the optimum maintenance
policy and funds allocation for the republican network under
planned 1988 funding, and compare these against the current
maintenance norms, and the optimum required level of funds;
and
(c) eva'luate and recommend, based on the above findings, the data
collection procedures and scope of regular network monitoring
that are appropriate to the needs of both the central
planning system and a district management system.
Phase II
20.      General objective:  The development of all elements of the central
planning and information system and of the district regional management
system, with procurement of equipment and pilot implementation of the
system.
(a) Evaluate and procure equipment for network monitoring, the
central information system and pilot district management
system (in accordance with Phase I recommendations);
(b) complete development of a central road data bank, and collect
data for a sample of the republican network under the new
requirements of the central planning system (e.g., axle
loading, roughness condition);
(c) complete the development of the central planning system, and
re-evaluate the maintenance norms and funding allocation for
the republican network, using the completed system and sample
data collected under (b), for possible application to the
preparation of the 1989 program;
(d) develop all elements of a district/regional management system
to be operated by the Road Maintenance Enterprises, which
would facilitate (i) the preparation of annual work programs
in accordance with the norms set by central planning,
(ii) the management of resources, and (iii) data processing.
(it is envisaged that the system would ideally, but not
necessarily operate on a microcomputer with suitable software
for each function);
(e) plan, and implement in a pilot region, the hardware for
microcomputer-based system for a sample of RMEs, appropriate
for the application of the district management system of (d)
above, and compatible for the communication (and
coordination) within the immediate financial or
administrative region, and with the central data bank;



- 60 -
ANNEX 3
Page 7 of 7
(f) review the institutional framework of the planning process,
including the organizational structures of the Central Road
Organization, the Institutes and RMEs, with intention of
maximizing the efficiency of the new planning and management
systems; and
(g) initiate the development of a bridge inventory-and management
system.
Phase III
21.      General Objectives:  Full implementation of the central planning
and district management systems throughout the republic.
(a) Implementation of the district/regional management system in
all RMEs;
(b) Extension of the network monitoring and central information
system to full coverage of the republican network;
(c) Formal implementation of the central planning system to
determine (a) the maintenance norms which are to replace
those laid down in the Regulations for the Maintenance and
Preservation of Public Roads (1985). and (b) the funding
allocations to construction, maintenance and rehabilitation,
for each financial region.
Timetable, Costs and Priorities
22.                      Estimated        Estimated Timing
Period        Start        End
Phase I         9 months       4/87         12/87
Phase II       2-2.5 years    7/87          12/89
Phase III       1-2 years      7/89         12/90
23.      Detailed costs of establishing and operating the system cannot at
present be reliably estimated, since they will depend on the findings of
Phase I. Costs of the necessary equipment have been included in the
project estimates, and 60 man months of consultancy assistance have been
included to cover Phases I and II. This is in addition to the services at
present given by CEI to RO Croatia.
24.      As normally used, HDM III, which is proposed as the means to
determine the maintenance policies, will suggest a strategy based on
minimum total travel cost over the life cycle. There is a possible
conflict here with government policy in the past of giving priority to the
safety of the road user, and these different points of view should be
discussed and evaluated as far as possible during Phase I. Draft Terms of
Reference for Phase I, the Preliminary Study oi Network Policy and Funding,
are attached to this Annex as Appendix 1.

Pilot Road Maintenance Planning System in Croatia
Phase I - Preliminary Study of Network Policy and Funding:
Draft Terms of Reference
A. Background
1.       These terms cover Phase I of the development of a maintenance
planning system for Croatia. Phase II will cover full development and
pilot implementation of the system, and Phase III would complete the
implementation.
B. Objectives
2.       The purpose of the first phase is to provide a quick preliminary
evaluation of maintenance policy in Croatia for possible application in the
1988 program, and to facilitate the development under Phase II of the full
management system by making a trial demonstration of the proposed central
planning model and parts of the information system. Specific objectives
include:
(a) To quantify the existing generalized 5-class condition
classification of the network in physical terms and evaluate
its reliability for network analysis;
(b) to determine, using current statistics of network condition
quantified in piysical measures, the optimum maintenance
policy and allocations for the Croatian network under planned
1988 funding, and to compare these with current maintenance
norms and the unconstrained optimum level of funds; and
(c) to facilitate Phase II by evaluating pilot tests of
procedures and making final recommendations of the scope and
procedures to be used for data collection in the proposed
system.
C. Scope of Work and Methodology
3.       The work is to comprise the following components, with final
details to be submitted in the Inception report:
(a) Selection of two samples of the network; a primary sample of
approximately 400 km total length of highway sections in one
administrative region, providing approximately uniform sample
sizes in each of the 5 condition classes and each of the 3
classes of road (main, regional and local); and a secondary
sample of 50 to 100 km total length of road sections
distributed uniformly in the 5 condition classes, and located
in one or two administrative regions which differ distinctly
from the region of the primary sample.

ANNEX 3
APPENDIX 1
Page 2 of 3
(b) physical measurement, on the sample sections, of roughness
(using a Bump Integrator trailer calibrated in accordance
with acceptable guidelines), surface condition (including
separate measures of cracking, rut depth, patching and
potholes), pavement strength (using a standardized deflection
test) and other nominal pavement characteristics);
(b) statistical evaluation of the 5 condition classes in terms of
the physical measures, and testing for significant difference
in the quantification of the classes across road class or
region;
(c) evaluation and development of final recommendations on the
scope and procedures to be used for measuring pavement
condition, road roughness, and pavement strength, under the
proposed management system;
(d) implementation of the Highway Design and Maintenance
Standards model (HDM-III) and inception of a three-person
unit for operating the model and implementing the network
maintenance analysis;
(e) preparation of input data for the HDM III model to represent
the Croatian paved road network (based on the network
samples, and available statistics of network condition,
traffic and inventory);
(f)  formulation of, and analysis using the HDM-III model of, a
variety of maintenance options as applied to the Croatian
paved road network (for this pilot study, the analysis should
include not less than 50 combinations of maintenance option
and link-type);
(g) comparative economic evaluation of the results from the HDM
III analysis, reaching preliminary conclusions on the optimum
set of maintenance strategies to be applied to the network
under the funding levels proposed for 1988, on the comparison
with current maintenance norms, and an the cptimum level of
funding for 1988.
D. Reporting and Timetable
4.       Details of the final study plan and staffing, and initial progress
should be presented in an inception report. A final report summarizing the
results and conclusions should be presented within 9 months of contract
effectiveness, and preferably by December 15, 1987. A preliminary
timetable is attached.
