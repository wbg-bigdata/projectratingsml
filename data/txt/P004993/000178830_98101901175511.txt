EGYPT
APPRAISAL OF THE TOURAH CEMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the proposed expansion project of Tourah
Portland Cement Company (TCC) in the Arab Republic of Egypt from a present
capacity of about 1.35 million metric tons per year (TPY) of cement to about
2.05 million TPY. The project is expected to be physically completed by the
end of 1977. TCC is wholly owned by the Government through the General
Organization for Building Materials and Ceramics (GOBM), one of the public
organizations under the Ministry of Industry. TCC is the oldest and largest
cement producer in the country and has a fully integrated plant some 15 km
south of Cairo on the Nile. The plant is very well located with respect to
the market and raw materials and is well connected by railroad and highway.
The project, for which Bank financing of US$40 million is being sought and
in which the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (Arab Fund) also
intends to participate, is to use for the first time in Egypt dry process
technology. The total financing required for the project, including interest
during construction and incremental working capital, is US$93 million, of
which the foreign exchange component is about 67%.
ii.       The proposed Bank loan of US$40 million equivalent would cover
about 64% of the total foreign exchange required for the project, including
interest during construction on the loan and would be made to the Government
and onlent to TCC, which is responsible for the implementation of the project
and its subsequent operations. The proposed Arab Fund loan of US$20 million
would cover the remaining foreign exchange requirement of the project, in-
cluding about US$3 million of interest on its loan during construction. The
Bank loan would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at an interest
rate of 8.5% per annum, and would be onlent to the Company for 15 years, in-
cluding 5 years of grace at an effective interest rate of 10% per annum. Of
the remaining financing required for the project of about US$33 million, the
Government is expected to provide US$31 million in the form of equity to meet
the local costs of the project. The residual financing of about US$2 million
for working capital would be met by the Company's own cash generation. The
Government would also cover any cost overrun and working capital requirements
of the project as and when necessary.
iii.      Equipment and machinery as well as related services for the project
are to be procured in 12 packages under international competitive bidding.
The Bank loan would cover the entire cost of the largest and most critical
package, mechanical cement machinery and equipment including engineering,
erection and start-up supervision, training and technical assistance, as well
as the foreign exchange cost of expatriate consultant services for the pro-
ject. The remaining 11 packages, mostly auxiliary equipment and machinery,
would be financed by the Arab Fund and would also follow international com-
petitive bidding under its regulations. Civil construction would not be part



- ii -
of the bid packages, but would be carried out by qualified local construction
firms. Requests for bids have already been issued and production is to start
early in 1978 with full capacity to be reached in 1980.
iv.       TCC, which will be responsible for project execution under the
general supervision of GOBM and with the assistance of the General Organi-
zation for Industrialization (GOFI), has capable management and technical
staff. While GOFI will provide assistance in international procurement,
GOBM will oversee the construction of the plant and its subsequent operations.
The supplier of the cement equipment and machinery package will bear respon-
sibility for timely project completion and be asked to enter into a suitable
performance guarantee for the entire cement production line -- from crusher
to dispatch facilities.
v.        The project is part of an overall program to increase Egypt's cement
production capacity from about 4 million to 8 million TPY by 1980 or shortly
thereafter to meet expected future demand. This program is considered vital
for the development of a broad spectrum of cement consuming sectors, such as
agriculture, housing, industry, tourism, rebuilding of infrastructure and
reconstruction and development of the Suez region. There are at present four
cement producing companies in Egypt, all owned by the Government through GOBM;
three plants (TCC, Helwan and National Cement Companies) are located near Cairo
and the fourth (Alexandria Cement Company) near Alexandria. According to a
program formulated in accordance with Egypt's current planning, three of the
four existing plants will expand and four new plants will be established.
Two expansion programs, other than the project, are underway and the remaining
four plants are in various preparation stages.
vi.       Domestic consumption of cement in Egypt has been repressed overall
due to shortage of foreign exchange, virtually stagnant production in recent
years, and the deferral of investment due to defense spending. As a result
cement consumption in Egypt grew at barely 3% per year between 1963/64 and
1971/72. During this period, no new capacity was added. Total rated capacity
and actual domestic production in 1973 were 3.85 million TPY and 3.62 million
TPY, respectively. Since 1967/68, Egypt has not imported cement but has been
exporting, at the expense of local construction, to earn foreign exchange.
Egypt has shipped over 500,000 tons annually since 1970/71, mainly to other
Arab countries and to West Africa. However, in order to meet the strong
domestic demand, exports have been embargoed in 1974.
vii.      Improved peace prospects in the Middle East have resulted in
ambitious development plans in Egypt and, consequently, the future supply/
demand situation is envisaged to be quite different from recent years. Sub-
stantial growth in construction expenditure is projected for all sectors,
including the planned reconstruction and development of the Suez Canal
area. Based on the projected investments during 1974-1984, cement demand
is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 11.3% with higher growth
rates envisaged for some intervening years, when reconstruction activity
is to reach its peak. This would result in an increase in per capita consumption



- iii -
from the virtually stagnant level of about 84 kg for the past few years to about
180 kg by 1984, which would still be less than the present per capita consump-
tion in most other Arab countries at similar levels of income. Combined with
production from capacity now in existence, under construction and in
preparation, the project would help make Egypt self-sufficient in cement
production by 1980; until then, substantial imports would be required to meet
local demand. Supply/demand comparisons indicate that in 1981 and 1982 Egypt
may have some surplus cement capacity for export, which could be absorbed in
other Middle East or West African countries.
viii.     The Egyptian Cement Office (ECO) is the sole organization respon-
sible for the selling and distribution of cement for both domestic and export
markets.  ECO is under GOBM and its operations are controlled by the cement
companies. The modal breakdown of distribution shipments in 1973 was about
95% by road, 3% by rail and 2% by barge. Cement distribution is poorly
planned and executed; problems include deficiency in planning and delivery
control, inadequate bulk-handling facilities, the lack of regional depots and an
inadequate and poorly maintained truck fleet. In order to rectify the present
deficiencies in the distribution system, GOBM will carry out an in-depth study
and implement appropriate recommendations of such a study prior to the start-up
of the project. Cement prices are fixed and controlled by the Government on
a bulk ex-factory basis. Bulk f.o.b. plant prices for ordinary portland
cement are (Fall 1974) LE 6.25 (US$15.9) per ton excluding taxes and LE 9.50
(US$24.2) per ton including taxes. Egyptian ex-plant cement prices compare
favorably with European domestic price levels and are projected to remain
at a level below estimated long-term c.i.f. import prices of about US$32.0
per ton of bagged cement at Alexandria.
ix.       The Company started operations in 1929 with a capacity of 100,000
TPY and at present it has a rated capacity of 1.35 million TPY. The plant
is operated and maintained properly and it has been running at close to 95%
capacity on the average over the past few years. The Company's capitalization
is sound with virtually no debt which provides a good base for expansion with
65% debt financing. The long-term debt/equity ratio would remain strong even
during the project implementation period with a maximum debt position of 50%
being reached in 1978. On the other hand, its liquidity position is strained,
because almost all its investments in the past few years were financed out of
internal cash generation. This situation will be rectified and the Company
is expected to have a satisfactory working capital position on completion of
the project. Long-term debt service coverage remains satisfactory throughout
the forecast period.
x.        The project has a high economic rate of return of 19%, with a very
low probability that the return would drop below 11% under even the most
adverse forseeable conditions. The annual incremental net foreign exchange
savings to the economy, once the project's additional capacity is fully
utilized in 1980, is expected to be about US$11 million equivalent, thus



- iv -
offsetting in about five years the foreign exchange cost of the project. An
important non-quantifiable benefit of the project is the transfer of dry pro-
cess technology for cement production.
xi.       Based on the assurances obtained and summarized at the end of this
report, the project is suitable for a Bank loan equivalent to US$40 million
to Egypt for a term of 20 years, including five years of grace, for onlending
to the Company for a term of 15 years including 5 years of grace at an
effective interest rate of 10 percent.



_. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the proposed expansion project of Tourah
Portland Cement Company (TCC) / from a present capacity of about 1.35 million
metric tons per year (TPY) of normal Portland cement to about 2.05 million
TPY, to be completed by the end of 1977. TCC is wholly owned by the General
Organization for Building Materials and Ceramics (GOBM), one of the public
organizations under the Ministry of Industry. It is the oldest and largest
cement producer in the country and has a fully integrated plant some 15 km
south of Cairo on the Nile. T'he project, for which Bank financing of US$40
million is being sought and in which the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development (Arab Fund) also intends to participate, is to use for the first
time in Egypt dry process technology and is to cost about US$93 million, in-
cluding interest during construction and incremental working capital. The
process together with other technical terms used in the report is described in
Annex 1.
1.02      The project is part of an overall program to increase Egypt's cement
production capacity from about 4 to 8 million TPY by 1980 or shortly there-
after, to substitute for present imports and to meet expected future demand.
This program is considered vital for the development of a broad spectrum of
cement-consuming sectors, such as agriculture, industry, tourism, the re-
building of infrastructure and reconstruction and development of the Suez
region. The program was formulated by GOBM with the assistance of the
General Organization for Industrialization (GOFI) and includes the expansion
of three of the four existing plants and establishment of four new plants.
Other than the project, two expansion programs are already underway and are
financed through USSR credit and Yugoslav suppliers' credit. For the remain-
ing four new plants, Egyptian authorities are still exploring the possibilities
of obtaining funds from Arab sources, private foreign and local capital and
other financial sources.
1.03      The project was identified in late 1972 and the Bank has assisted
in its evolution, including the choice of process to be utilized. The project
was appraised in June/July 1974 jointly with the Arab Fund. The Bank mission
consisted of Messrs. Nayar (Chief) and Duvigneau of the Industrial Projects
Department and Mr. Beckton (consultant).
II.  THE COMPANY
A.   Organizational Framework
2.01      Various government bodies are concerned with industrial develop-
ment and coordination in Egypt. In the case of TCC, the Ministry of Industry
1/   Although this is the commonly used English name for the Company, the
legal name is "Societe Egyptienne de Ciment Portland Tourah".



- 2 -
is the main authority. The project is to be carried out and operated by TCC
under the broad supervision of GOBM and with the assistance of GOFI, both
attached to the Ministry of Industry. A description of GOFI's and GOBM's
functions is given in Annex 2-1. GOFI, in collaboration with the respective
general organizations, is responsible for fostering and coordinating industrial
expansion in Egypt. GOBM, one of the seven public organizations under the
Ministry of Industry, is a holding company for the 13 Government-owned compa-
nies in the building materials and ceramics sectors, including TCC. The sub-
ordinate companies of GOBM produce a wide range of products with an annual
sales value of about LE 44.3 million (US$113 million) and are financially
independent and autonomous units, each with its own board of directors. GOBM's
board of directors consists of the chairman, Eng. Ahmed Aly Shaker; the general
manager; and the chairmen of all the subsidiary companies. Prior to assuming
the responsibility as chairman of GOBM in 1973, Eng. Shaker was the chairman
of TCC.
2.02      GOBM is responsible for the execution of Government policy and its
subsequent follow-up in the building materials sector, and works jointly with
GOFI and the company concerned in formulating, preparing and implementing
major investment projects. All major investment decisions are made at the
ministerial level and it is GOBM's role to disburse funds for investments
under its supervision. However, responsibility for actual project execution
and its subsequent operations are effectively delegated to the ultimate oper-
ating company--in the case of this project, TCC. GOBM was established in
1961 and was legally made a holding company in 1971 with the right to liqui-
date or dissolve, merge or consolidate, and divide its subsidiary companies.
To maintain TCC as an independent entity, the Government will not merge or
consolidate the company with other companies without prior consultation with
the Bank.
B. The Company Background
2.03      TCC was founded in 1927 as a private company with a share capital of
LE 200,000, owned principally by Swiss and Egyptian interests, and operations
commenced in 1929 with an initial capacity of 100,000 TPY of cement. In 1961
TCC, along with other major companies in Egypt, was nationalized I/ and is now
owned by the Government through GOBM, which holds the Company's entire share
capital of LE 2,230,608. With various expansions of the plant, TCC's total
capacity is now 1.35 million TPY. It is presently installing a lime plant,
which is expected to be operational by the end of 1975 and which is being
financed with cash generation and suppliers' credits from Poland. There has,
however, been a delay in the delivery of Polish equipment and in the civil
construction work.
C. Management
2.04      The Company is organized along functional lines and its organization
chart is given in Annex 2-2. The principal management body, the Board of
1/   Private interests were fully compensated by the Government.



- 3 -
Directors, consists of nine members. The chairman and four senior managers
of the Company are appointed by the President of the Republic and serve with
four labor representatives who are elected for a period of three years. The
Board of Directors meets once every month to formulate operational policies,
within the framework of overall Government policy, and submits its decisions
to GOBM for approval before implementation. TCC management controls day-to-day
operations and is expected to produce profits although it has little direct
control over the unit cost of its inputs or selling prices.
2.05      TCC's management team is headed by Eng. Mohamed Naguib Abdel Hady,
who became chairman of the Company in 1973, after having served TCC for
more than 20 years in various management positions; he is a capable executive
who provides stability and leadership. Most of the department heads
have been with the Company for more than ten years and have had considerable
experience of the cement industry; their caliber is high and overall coordina-
tion among departments appears satisfactory.
2.06      TCC has a good technical department which has provided technical
assistance to other cement companies in Egypt as well as consulting services
to cement producers in other Arab countries. Presently, TCC is providing
consulting services for a Libyan cement plant. Most of the members of the
technical department have extensive production and engineering experience
and have made frequent visits to cement factories abroad. The Company's
management is considered capable of carrying out the expansion project with
limited technical assistance (para. 5.13).
D. Plant Facilities
2.07      The plant is located near Tourah, 15 km south of Cairo on the east
bank of the Nile, and is well served by railroad and highway. The plant is
near its limestone, clay and sand quarries and includes the cement plant
proper, quarrying equipment, and transportation and stockpiling facilities
between the quarries and the plant. The existing cement plant uses wet
process technology and includes raw material preparation facilities, six
cement kilns, a clinker grinding plant, as well as packing, shipping and
all necessary auxiliary facilities. Some portions of it are 40 years old
and need modernization. Except for fuel, electricity and minor supplies,
the plant is virtually self-contained. A detailed description of the exist-
ing facilities is given in Annex 2-3.
2.08      The Company also operates a small foundry, about 3 km south of Tourah,
to meet plant requirements, primarily for grinding balls, although some sales
are made to nearby outside customers. Due to lack of foreign exchange, some
of the spare parts which would normally be imported are also being made by
TCC. A paper sack factory, located within the plant site, produces about
32 million sacks per year, not only for TCC's use but also for local lime
plants, fertilizer factories and other cement producers. On the whole TCC's
plant is well maintained and operated, although housekeeping could be improved.
At present the Company employs some 2,050 persons in its operations.

/1   Annualized from 18 months operation ended December 31, 1972.  All prior
years ended June 30.
/2   Fiscal Year ended December 31.
2.10      Over the past 4-1/2 years TCC has been operating at close to 95%
capacity on the average. This is particularly noteworthy in view of the age
of the plant, the difficulties in obtaining imported spare parts and other
factors not under the Company's control. The Company's financial performance
over the period has been satisfactory and improving. Net profits after taxes
as a percent of: (1) net sales, (2) average net fixed assets; and (3) average
equity have steadily increased. This trend is partly attributable to improved
efficiency of plant operations and partly due to higher export selling prices.
The 8% drop in sales volume in 1973 was mainly caused by a decrease in pro-
duction during the months of November and December, 1973, as a result of the
October war and a shortage of kraft paper for bagging. The paper shortage
also severely affected production during the first two months of 1974, when
output declined to 70% of capacity. However, this situation has now been
rectified and the Company is currently operating near capacity.
F. Recent Financial Position
2.11      TCC's balance sheets for the past four fiscal years (1969/70-73)
are given in Annex 2-5 and selected items are given below.

2.12      It can be seen that the Company's capitalization is sound with a
debt/equity ratio of 4:96 at the end of 1973. Equity, including reserves,
was then over LE 9 million, almost equal to net fixed assets of about LE 10
million, of which approximately LE 4 million were projects under construction.
TCC's liquidity position on the other hand is strained, primarily due to the
fact that all of the Company's investments undertaken in the last four years
were financed out of internal cash generation. Moreover, current liabilities
include the year's profits, a major portion of which have to be distributed
to GOBM and workers, as well as taxes, which are paid in the following year.
To improve its liquidity position, the Company has been borrowing short-term
credits. The Company is fully aware that the present situation is not a
satisfactory long-term solution and is taking steps to rectify it. This is
further discussed in paras. 5.04 and 6.09.
III. THE MARKET
A. Supply and Demand
1. Past
3.01      A detailed description of the cement market, including distribution
and pricing in Egypt, is presented in Annex 3. The following merely summarizes
the major findings.
3.02      Egypt has had a cement industry since 1900 and, while the country
relied on imported cement to supplement domestic production for many years,
it has not imported any cement since 1967/68. Prior to that time it had ex-
ported only moderate quantities of cement but since then it has increased ex-
ports substantially to alleviate its foreign exchange difficulties. These
exports have gone primarily to other Arab countries and to West Africa.



3.03      Overall domestic consumption, particularly in sectors other than
defense, has been repressed in recent years due to (1) the export policy;
(2) virtually stagnant domestic production; (3) the suppression of imports
due to a lack of foreign exchange; and (4) the deferral of other investments
due to defense spending. As a result, cement consumption in Egypt grew by
barely 3X per year between 1963/64 and 1971/72. The effect of this, coupled
with Government pricing control, has resulted in some black market activity
during the supply/demand imbalance of recent years.
3.04      The history of Egypt's cement supply/demand situation for the last
decade is shown in the following table:

3.05      There are four companies producing cement in Egypt, three (the TCC,
Helwan and National Cement companies) located 15 to 35 km south of Cairo,
and a fourth (Alexandria Cement Co.) near Alexandria. All these companies
are owned and controlled by the Government through GOBM (para. 2.01). No
new capacity has been added since the late 1960's and the physical deterio-
ration of plants and a shortage of imported kraft paper and bags has caused
some curtailment of production from time to time. The rated capacities,
actual production and plant utilization for the four companies were as follows
in 1973:

/1   Production at the TCC and Helwan plants has been restricted by shortages
of spare parts and by operating difficulties with extremely old kilns,
as well as the bag shortage and limited bulk storage facilities.
2. Future
3.06      The future supply/demand situation is envisaged to be dramatically
different from recent years. Improved peace prospects in the Middle East
have resulted in ambitious development plans in Egypt, for both the economy
as a whole and the cement industry in particular. Substantial growth in
construction expenditure and related cement consumption is projected for
all sectors, including the planned reconstruction and development of the
Suez area.
3.07      Three plant extensions (at TCC, Alexandria and National) and four
new plants (at Tourah-unrelated to TCC--Suez, Alexandria and Assiut) are
being planned for a total annual capacity of 8.37 million tons of cement by
1981 (table below).

Companies have started although that of TCC has reached an advanced state of

availability of funds, of some of the projects, they are included in the pro-
duction projections shown in the table below, together with demand projections,
the resulting import requirements and projected exports. The overall supply
and alternative domestic consumption projections are compared graphically in

/1   50% Kuwaiti share of output of Cairo plant.
/2   Including committed exports, which would be earmarked for Kuwait.
3.09      Even with its proposed expansion, the contribution of the existing
TCC plant to total national production will decline from its current (1974)
share of about 34% to about 24% by 1984, although it will still be the largest
single contributor to a substantially higher level of national production.
The above production build-up assumes that new capacity would be utilized
at 60% in the first year, 80% in the second year and at 100% thereafter.
While a somewhat faster production build-up may be attainable, the planned
start-up dates for the expansion of the Alexandria plant and for the new
plant at Tourah are already rather tight and continued full capacity oper-
ation may not be easy to maintain. Therefore, actual production may lag
somewhat behind the above projections. In addition, the scope and timing
of some of the new plants will be further reviewed with the aid of a market
study (para. 3.14).
3.10      As to future cement consumption in Egypt, the above demand projec-
tions have been built up from analysis of each of the major cement-consuming
sectors as well as from macro-economic correlations with such indicators as
the country's population and projected GDP growth--the latter having been
estimated at an average of 6.5% per annum between 1974 and 1980. During the
same period, average investment growth is projected at 14% per annum with
a corresponding strong growth in the construction sector. The resulting
average growth rate of cement demand is 11.3% Per year. Ilowever, since
reconstruction is envisaged as peaking in the late 70's, the highest
demand build-up will be in 1976 and 1977. Total investments of the order
of LE 3 billion have been envisaged over a 5 to 10 year period, but the
establishment of more definite phasing and the sectoral distribution of
this program will,await the completion of master plans studies for the
reconstruction of the Canal Zone. Although a study by the Institute of
National Planning shows reconstruction investment peaking at levels of



- 10 -
LE 400 million in 1978 and 1979, for the projections shown above it has
been assumed that this curve will be much flatter. Construction expend-
iture and cement consumption projections have been estimated accordingly. This
more conservative assumption makes allowance for financial, technical and
other resource constraints which could well restrain the level of reconstruc-
tion activity during a period when resources will be in high demand for other
sectors of the economy.
3.11      The above projections indicate an increase in per capita 1/ cement
consumption in Egypt to a level of 180 kg by 1984.  This compares with 84
kg/capita in 1972. The 180 kg level in the Egyptian context would be close
to the 1972 levels 2/ of 201 kg for Syria, 407 kg for Lebanon, 149 kg for
Jordan and 216 kg for Saudi Arabia.
3.12      Export prospects, including those within the Arab nations, are
difficult to predict. A substantial number of plants are being planned and
proposed, such that even if cement demand for each country were projected
with reasonable accuracy, the actual timing and size of new production
facilities could still vary widely from any forecast made at this time.
Although various studies 3/ have been made of the cement demand/supply situ-
ation in the Arab states, these are rather superficial and imprecise in their
estimates. A review of these, with some additional studies carried out by
the Bank, indicates that the demand/supply gap could be as low as one million
tons annually by the early 1980's, with perhaps only Kuwait as a significant
importer.
3.13      During the second half of the 1970's, the projections for Egypt
indicate substantial cement import requirements, with a cessation of exports
for about two years until the Cairo plant, also near Tourah, comes on stream
in 1978. If this plant goes ahead as presently envisaged with joint Kuwaiti-
Egyptian financing, one-half of its output will be earmarked for export to
Kuwait. By 1980, imports should cease, and there may be some temporary export
capacity, in addition to the Kuwait commitment. However, at present, it is
difficult to predict whether Egypt will in fact be able to execute its overall
investment and construction program, including the completion of all proposed
cement plants, with the speed now envisaged. Should cement demand not be as
great as projected, Egypt may be able to maintain the level of exports of
about 900,000 tons per annum achieved in recent years. However, although it
is likely that Kuwait could absorb a substantial proportion of Egypt's

projected temporary export capacity, cement production capacity in the Region
is expected to also expand rapidly in the future, and it is therefore uncertain
whether Egypt can rely on a substantial continuing level of cement exports.
In any event, Egypt's future export capacity is expected to be available only
for one or two years in the early 1980's. Moreover, if cement demand in the
country does not grow as predicted, the scope of some of the new plants could
be scaled down or implementation of these plants could be delayed. In any
case, the success of the project does not depend on exports of Egyptian cement,
which will at best only be marginal.
3.14      Due to the uncertainty of both demand and supply projections, these
aspects were further discussed with the Egyptian authorities during negotiations,
and agreement was obtained that, on the basis of terms of reference to be agreed
upon with the Bank by March 31, 1975, a comprehensive study of production, distri-
bution and marketing facilities in the cement sector will be carried out and, on
the basis of this study and in consultation with the Bank, an appropriate invest-
ment program will be prepared. The Bank will be consulted prior to the estab-
lishment of new cement production facilities if these were to increase total
capacity above the level contemplated in this investment program. The study
should be completed by June, 1976. Para. 3.18 contains further details.
B. Distribution and Sales
3.15      Distribution and sales of cement in Egypt are handled by the Egypt-
ian Cement Office (ECO) in Cairo, whose operating expenses are covered by
contributions from the four cement companies in proportion to their respective
annual production volumes. Besides being the recipient of all orders from
customers and intermediate dealers and arranging for cement dispatch from the
appropriate plants, the ECO also has its own fleet of trucks, which together
with sub-contractor fleets, transport 95% of Egyptian cement production. The
balance is shipped by rail (3%) and barge (2%). The continuing shortage of
kraft paper and bags has lent impetus to bulk transport, which in the past
has accounted for less than 2% of distribution. There are plans to expand
this through the acquisition of more bulk trucks and storage silos.
3.16      Transport tariffs are set by the Government and range from about
LE 0.04-0.05 per ton-kilometer for the short haul to Cairo down to LE 0.01
per ton-kilometer for longer hauls. Transport costs add from LE 0.60 (Cairo)
to LE 8.00 (Aswan) per ton to ex-factory prices and are passed on directly
to the customer. The decreed tariff levels are sufficient to cover the trans-
portation costs incurred by the ECO.
3.17      Cement distribution is poorly planned and suffers from various
bottlenecks and shortcomings, including poor rail delivery control, inadequate
bulk-handling facilities, excessive spillage, the lack of regional distribu-
tion depots, and inadequate and poorly maintained truck fleets. All of these
result in rather costly and time-consuming distribution of production.



- 12 -
3.18      These deficiencies will grow in importance with the planned rapid ex-
pansion of cement production. The comprehensive study mentioned in para. 3.14
above will help (a) to determine Egypt's future distribution requirements, in-
cluding necessary investments in handling and distribution facilities; (b) to
develop more effective distribution planning, and thus less costly distribution
of cement; and (c) to establish a training program for ECO staff for the execu-
tion of such planning.  Experienced consultants will be engaged to carry out
this study which will be one of the six sector studies included in the Bank
Agricultural and Industrial Imports Credit/Loan recently approved by the Executive
Directors. The study is expected to cost about US$200,000 equivalent, of which
an estimated US$150,000 is needed in foreign exchange.
C. Pricing
3.19      Cement prices in Egypt are controlled by the Government--both on
ex-factory and retail levels--and between 1965 and March 1974 only one general
increase 1/ was allowed (in 1969) in ex-factory and retail prices. Tax in-
creases, however, have been more frequent. The recent price increase in
March 1974 was substantial and was aimed at allowing cement producers a
margin of 30% on sales, a margin which according to Government policy is to
be approximately maintained in the future (see para. 6.01). Taxes and trans-
port charges were also raised, and previously-absorbed bag costs are now
passed on to the customer. The Cairo prices for ordinary portland cement as
at mid-1974 were determined as follows:
Cement. Prices, ex-factory and in Cairo, in mid-1974
LE/ton           US$/ton
Bulk, ex-factory price (excl. taxes)              6.25             15.9
Bulk, ex-factory price (incl. taxes)              9.50             24.2
Wholesale delivered price, bulk           10.10 - 10.60 /1  25.6 - 27.0
Wholesale delivered price, bagged         11.80 - 12.30       30.0 - 31.5
Retail delivered price, bulk               11.10 - 11.60      28.4 - 29.6
Retail delivered price, bagged            12.80 - 13.30      32.6 - 34.0
/1   The price range for wholesale and retail prices stems from the
difference in transport costs to different areas in the greater
Cairo region.
3.20      Regional prices vary substantially due to the transport cost and in
more remote areas can potentially inhibit cement use.  At Aswan for example,
retail prices are more than 50% above those in Cairo. The establishment of
decentralized plants planned for Suez and Assiut will eventually help correct
this imbalance.
1/   An exception was made in 1967 for the Alexandria Cement Co. which was
allowed a premium of LE 0.56 per ton to cover its higher production
costs.



- 13 -
3.21      Egyptian cement prices compare favorably with domestic prices in
other countries (although Egyptian production costs are reduced somewhat by
subsidized oil prices), as well as with the much higher international trading
prices, which are now weakening from their recent unprecedented levels. Even
when these eventually drop further, however, as they are expected to do with
substantial expansion of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and European production,
long-term c.i.f. import prices at Alexandria should still remain above Egyptian
lomestic price levels.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Scope and ObJectives
4.01      The project is designed (i) to expand TCC's normal cement capacity
by 700,000 TPY by 1978, from 1.35 to 2.05 million TPY of cement through use of
dry process technology; (ii) to modernize and improve some of the existing
equipment to enable the Company to maintain capacity in its present plant;
and (iii) to provide a better base for future conversion of the existing
facilities from wet to dry process. The project introduces no new products
and can be implemented without interfering with the existing production.
Due to lack of space, however, no further major expansion of the plant
beyond that contemplated by the project is possible, although some capacity
increase could still be achieved by the above-mentioned conversion of the
existing plant from wet to dry process (para. 4.05).
B.   Raw Material Availability and Analysis
4.02      The two principal raw materials, limestone and clay, will be from
the same deposits which TCC currently leases from the Government. Require-
ments of limestone and clay after the expansion will be about 2.7 and 0.6
million TPY respectively. Limestone reserves of satisfactory quality, con-
firmed by an independent study 1/ carried out in 1969, are sufficient to
ensure operations of the expanded plant, as well as the new lime plant (para.
2.03), for some 30 years. Beyond these confirmed reserves, there is an
abundance of limestone which could assure operations for a much longer period.
Confirmed clay reserves, with an adequate chemical composition, are also
sufficient and would allow operation of the Company's expanded plant for over
30 years. The Government has agreed to continue to grant to the Company the
exclusive right to use the clay and limestone quarries at Tourah for at least
a further 30 years. Total estimated clay reserves are about three times as
large as those confirmed but there is some question as to their chemical
suitability. These reserves are currently being investigated in connection
with GOBM's plans to build another new cement factory near Tourah under
separate management with a proposed annual capacity of 1.0 million TPY (para.
3.07). Other raw materials are partly quarried by TCC (sand, gypsum) and
1/   Polimex-Cekop of Poland.



- 14 -
partly purchased (pyrite ash, blast furnace slag). These current arrangements
will be continued and are adequate for the expanded plant's requirements.
Details on raw material deposits, and sources of supply are given in Annex 4-1.
C. Utilities
4.03      The Company's existing plant operates on mazout (heavy fuel oil--
Bunker C) for clinker burning and this will also be the fuel for the expanded
plant. Mazout is supplied at US$19.1 per ton by the General Organization for
Petroleum (GOFP) from their Cairo refinery via an 8" pipeline which is suffi-
cient to supply the needs of the expanded plant. The Government has agreed
to take necessary steps for adequate and timely supply of fuel. The project
design takes into account possible use of gas from the Abu Gharadig gas fields
which already serve industrial complexes around Cairo. If the gas is used
in the future as heating fuel, the mazout installations would be maintained as
standby.
4.04      Power for the project (presently costing US$0.0158/KWH) will be
supplied by the Cairo Electricity and Gas Administration (CEGA), through a
new 30 MVA substation connected to the Cairo grid. The Company's own power
station, which now contributes about one third of TCC's total current require-
ments of 120 million KWH per year, will be maintained as a standby. These
arrangements and the timely availability of power have been confirmed during
negotiations. TCC, as at present, will draw its additional water require-
ments from the Nile by replacing the existing pumphouse, which is obsolete,
with a new enlarged pumping station. The supply of all utilities is thus
satisfactorily assured. Details of utilities are contained in Annex 4-2.
D. Process Choice
4.05      In view of substantial fuel savings, the project will utilize dry-
process technology and will be the first of its kind in Egypt, although the
exact design of the process to be employed will be decided only after bid
evaluation. The basics of the dry process are widely judged to be economical,
efficient and competitive among international cement producers (Annex 1).
An economic comparison of the alternatives--dry versus wet process--for the
particular case of TCC, is made in Annex 4-3. In addition to its low fuel
requirements and, hence, lower operating costs, an important consideration
in process selection was the possibility of designing the project so as to
permit future conversion of existing equipment to the dry process. Such
conversion would not only reduce fuel consumption but would also allow an
increased output from the facilities, so converted, of between 30 and 50%
at relatively modest investment cost.
E. Physical Description of the Project
4.06      The project consists of a complete line of mechanical and electrical
cement machinery and equipment for the expanded output, as well as provisions
for updating existing equipment. Included are equipment for the limestone



- 15 -
and clay quarries, a new crusher, modification of limestone transport and
storage facilities, a raw grinding plant and raw meal storage, a kiln of a
rated capacity of 2,000 TPD of clinker complete with preheater, cooler and
electrostatic precipitator, a complete clinker grinding plant, cement storage
and dispatch facilities. Also included are a substation and all related
electrical equipment and cabling, the expansion of the existing control
station, a new pumping station and expansions of the existing mechanical
and electrical workshops and the laboratory. A more detailed project des-
cription, together with detailed equipment lists, is contained in Annex 4-3.
General plant layout and process flow charts are given in Annexes 4-4 and
4-5 respectively.
F. Ecology
4.07      The project will be designed to meet standards considered acceptable
in Western industrialized countries. The project will include facilities,
costing over LE 1 million, to reduce the amount of solid effluents-the main
environmental problem in cement plants--to internationally acceptable levels.
Currently TCC is executing a project designed to reduce solid pollutants from
;-he existing facilities to the same suitable level. The Company also oper-
ates a waste treatment plant for its sewage effluents. Other liquid and
gaseous effluents will not be harmful. Appropriate noise-abatement pre-
cautions and facilities will also be implemented, keeping noise pollution
within tolerable limits.  Depending on the type of dry process to be utilized,
special raw material characteristics may require a by-pass system to collect
harmful dusts, which would be difficult to dispose of. Tenderers have been
requested to suggest suitable and environmentally acceptable methods for dis-
posal of these dusts. The Company will install and maintain pollution control
facilities satisfactory to the Government and the Bank. Details on the
ecological precautions being taken by TCC, both for existing equipment and
for the project, are given in Annex 4-6.
G. Manpower and Training
4.08      Cement factories are capital intensive and have a very high labor
productivity. The project will therefore provide direct employment for only
about 200 persons, primarily skilled personnel. The present manning level
in the existing plant (about 2,050 persons) is high by European standards,
though this is more a function of the Government's social and economic
priorities than of the actual need for labor to operate the plant. The
project will, however, improve the Company's overall labor productivity by
about 40%, though considering the low prevailing wage scale in Egypt, the
economics of the overall plant are not unduly affected by the high manning
level. Training and recruitment plans have already been prepared in some
detail by the Company and are considered satisfactory. The supplier of the
cement equipment line, will provide training abroad on similar dry-process
facilities for about 20 key personnel. The remainder of the operational
staff will be trained locally in TCC's training facilities and in its exist-
ing plant. Details of labor force projections and training are contained
in Annex 4-7.



- 16 -
R.  Project Management and Execution
4.09      TCC will be responsible for project execution, under the general
supervision of GOBM and with the assistance of GOFI. Management of TCC,
with many previous plant expansions and modifications to its credit, is con-
sidered qualified to undertake such responsibilities. GOFI will provide
assistance particularly during the procurement stage and GOBM will oversee
construction and subsequent operations. The main burden of project execution
will rest on TCC's Project Department, recently established with staff pre-
dominantly from the Company's Research and Industrial Planning Department,
which has been responsible for execution of new projects, maintenance plan-
ning, technical trouble shooting, and consulting to local and foreign cement
companies. Mr. M. Taha, an experienced mechanical engineer and presently the
manager of the power plant, will head the project team, which will work under
the general guidance of the Company's Chairman. If required, GOBM and GOFI
will provide additional experts for assistance. This arrangement is satis-
factory and during negotiations TCC confirmed that it will assign to the
project sufficient competent staff.
4.10      The supplier of the mechanical cement machinery and equipment
package (para. 5.09) is to provide detailed engineering of all cement plant
facilities, including items not supplied by him, and will bear the responsi-
bility for timely project completion, attainment of capacity, performance
efficiency and warranties. These guarantees are possible because the items --
mainly electrical equipment, which form an integral part of the cement pro-
duction facilities and are to be supplied by different suppliers, -- will be in
accordance with the specifications and criteria to be set by the cement ma-
chinery and equipment supplier. Civil works will be designed and construction
supervised by an Egyptian firm with whom TCC has had previous experience.
Civil construction will be carried out by local contractors. The civil engi-
neering firm will work closely with TCC's project team.
I. Project Timing
4.11      Tender documents, prepared in accordance with the Bank guidelines,
were mailed out in July, 1974, after a joint review by the Bank and Arab Fund,
to interested suppliers of cement machinery and equipment, which is the most
critical item in the project implementation schedule. Technical bids are
expected to be opened on February 1, 1975, and the contract should be concluded
in spring 1975. Delivery, construction and erection schedules are based on
information provided by potential suppliers and TCC's past experience. The
detailed project implementation schedule, prepared by TCC, is shown in Annex
4-8 and is considered realistic. According to that schedule, the project is
expected to start up in early 1978.

V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Capital Cost
5.01      Capital cost estimates are detailed in Annex 5-1 and are summarized

|4   Above figures reflect direct and indirect foreign exchange costs.
5.02      The cost estimates were prepared by the Company based on quotations
received in late 1973 from European equipment suppliers and TCC's previous
experience. End-1974 base cost estimates for equipment are derived from these
quotations, after increasing them by about 35% to account for actual price
increases to the end of 1974. Import duties and taxes of about 10.7% of
the c.i.f. value of imported equipment have been added. Freight and insurance
from the port of shipment to the plant site is estimated to cost about 7% of
the total equipment cost. Since Egyptian regulations require all shipments
by vessels designated by Egyptian Maritime Authorities, assurance was obtained



- 18 -
that if this policy would cause significant project delays, exceptions will
be made for the shipment of equipment and machinery required for the project.
Civil construction cost estimates for the end of 1974 are based on enquiries
among local contractors obtained in late 1973 and include a 30% price escal-
ation over such enquiry prices. Pre-operating and start-up expenses as well
as engineering services are based on TCC's previous experience. To cover
possible omissions and changes in project design, physical contingencies of
10% of the total base costs have been added.
5.03      The allowance for price escalation amounts to about 33% of total
base cost plus physical contingencies. For imported equipment a declining
rate of 15% in 1975, 12% in 1976, 10% in 1977 and 10% thereafter has been
used, and for local civil construction works one of 25%, 20%, 15% and 10%
respectively. This unusually high price escalation provision for civil works
is considered realistic because the expected rapid increase in construction
activity in Egypt, particularly for reconstruction, is apt to exert an extra-
ordinary upward pressure on construction costs. Total physical and price
contingencies allowed for amount, therefore, to about 46% of total base costs.
The project costs, including contingencies, are considered realistic estimates.
B. Working Capital Requirements
5.04      As indicated in paras. 2.11 and 2.12, the Company's current
liabilities exceeded current assets at the end of 1973 by LE 2.1 million,
about equivalent to the bank overdrafts outstanding at that time.  To alle-
viate the Company's present working capital shortage and to provide the
incremental working capital required for the project, approximately LE 0.8
million (Annex 5-2), the financing plan envisages that funds from TCC's own
resources and contributions from the Government will increase net working
capital during project implementation by about LE 3.8 million, including re-
duction of the existing overdrafts. This was confirmed during negotiations.
By start-up of the project the Company is expected to have net working capital
of approximately LE 1.7 million and, in addition, will be able to borrow from
its line of credit with the Bank of Alexandria up to LE 3.75 million. These
arrangements are expected to provide adequate working capital for the Company's
operational needs. In any event, the Government will provide funds in order
to maintain a satisfactory working capital position on completion of the
project (para. 5.08).
C. Financing Plan
5.05      The plan to cover the expansion project's total financing require-
ments of LE 36.4 million (US$93.0 million) consists of LE 12.9 million
(US$33 million) in the form of equity and the remaining LE 23.5 million
(US$60 million) in loans. All machinery and equipment, including foreign
engineering, technical assistance and training, will be financed by loans
from IBRD and the Arab Fund. The financing plan for the project is
as follows:

/1   Represents working capital required for the project alone.  TCC and/or
Government total cash contribution to working capital during construction
period will be LE 3.8 million.
5.06      The proposed Bank loan of US$40 million equivalent will be made
to the Government for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, and at an interest
rate of 8.5% per annum. The Government will then relend the proceeds of the
loan to the Company for 15 years, including 5 years of grace, and will charge
the Company an effective interest rate of 10% per annum. The Company will
bear the foreign exchange risk on the loan. The proposed Arab Fund loan of
US$20 million equivalent (including an estimated US$3.0 million for interest
during construction) will be for 20 vears, including 5 years of grace, at an
interest rate of 6% per annum. The Company will again bear the foreign exchange
risk. While confirmation of the terms and conditions of Arab Fund financing
has been received, the finalizing of the financing arrangements between the
Arab Fund TCC will be a condition of effectiveness for the Bank loan.
5.07      The equity financing of LE 12.9 million consists of two portions:
(i) the LE 0.8 million of TCC's own cash generation to finance the incre-
mental working capital requirements caused by the project; and (ii) the
LE 12.1 million equity contribution by the Government to cover the remaining
local costs. The Company's additional cash generation during the project
implementation period--about LE 18.2 million--is expected to be utilized for
the completion of the ongoing lime plant construction, payoff of bank over-
drafts and the legally required distribution of profits to Government and
employees.
5.08      The Government's obligation to provide the LE 12.1 million equity
financing will be independent of the Company's ability to internally generate
cash during the project implementation period in addition to the amount now



- 20 -
projected. Moreover, whatever further resources--foreign as well as local--
might be needed to complete the ongoing investment programs and the project 1/
and bring them into operation, including maintenance of an adequate working
capital level, equivalent to a current ratio of at least 1.5:1, and inde-
pendently of whether the need for such additional funds is caused by a cost
overrun or a shortfall of cash generation, will be provided by the Government
(see also para. 6.09).
D.   Procurement
5.09      Equipment and machinery as well as related services for the project
are to be supplied in 12 packages which will be procured under international
competitive bidding. The largest and most critical package is that for supply
of cement machinery and equipment, including supervision of erection, and
startup training and technical assistance. To ensure single responsibility
for the implementation of this package by one contractor--deemed imperative
for a successful project--this package cannot be split further. The Bank
loan would be utilized to finance this critical package in its entirety at an
estimated cost of US$35 million. The Arab Fund will finance the remaining 11
packages consisting of all ancillary equipment and machinery.
5.10      The Bank-financed package will be internationally bid in accordance
with Bank Guidelines. While no Egyptian manufacturers qualify to bid directly
for this package, it is estimated that equipment worth US$3.5 million equivalent,
or about 10% of the total estimated cost of this package, could be supplied from
local sources. Therefore in order to give Egyptian Equipment Manufacturers an
opportunity to supply items fr the project while maintaining the overall guaran-
tee for the entire package from the main supplier, a 15% margin of preference or
the prevailing import duty, whichever is lower, will be allowed for purposes of
bid evaulation in respect of clearly identified Egyptian components, included in
foreign bids, and which except for the need to execute the package under single
responsibility could be bid separately. Procurement of Arab-financed packages
will also follow international (including non-Bank member countries) competi-
tive bidding, under the regulations of the Arab League.
5.11      Tentative agreements have been reached with the Arab Fund regarding
procedures to be followed during project execution and supervision, covering
such matters as procurement procedures, coordination of follow-up missions,
exchange of information and standardization of reporting requirements. These
procedures will be confirmed through exchange of letters between the Arab Fund
and the Bank.
5.12      Procurement of the cement machinery and equipment package--but not
of the others--will be based on performance specifications rather than de-
tailed technical specifications. This is done to encourage the maximum
1/   The project will be considered complete when the plant operates contin-
uously for a period of at least 90 days at or above 90% capacity.

number of suppliers to tender by deliberately not excluding any particular
dry process technology. Considering the technical complexity of these bids,
TCC has adopted a two-stage bidding 1/ procedure for both this and the equally
complex electrical equipment package. The remaining packages will follow
normal single-stage bidding. All prospective suppliers have been informed,
through tender documents, of the details of the bidding procedure.
5.13      To help the Company achieve an optimal design and equipment selection,
in dry process technology where it has little direct experience, it is essen-
tial for it to have assistance during the technical bid evaluation. The
Company has therefore agreed to appoint the necessary consultants before the
opening of the technical bids, scheduled for February 1, 1975, and to retain
them at least until the award of the contract. As the appointment of the
consultants before that time is crucial for meeting the project implementation
schedule, a small portion of the US$50,000-100,000 required for bid evaluation
services may have been expended before the Loan is considered by the Executive
Directors. It is recommended that the Bank reimburse this amount retroactively.
E. Allocation of Bank Loan
5.14      Bank and Arab Fund financing will be on a parallel basis with
separate specific lists of goods and services. The Bank will finance:
(i) the single responsibility package for mechanical cement machinery and
equipment, including engineering, training and technical assistance; and (ii)
consultant services for bid evaluation (para. 5.13), and (iii) interest during
construction. The Company is investigating the retention of consultants for
technical assistance of a somewhat broader nature than bid evaluation, in or-
der to help make the transition from the wet to the dry process more effective.
If funds are available, it is recommended that the Bank consider financing
these further services from any unallocated portion of the loan should they
be deemed justifiable. Allocation of the Bank loan is shown in detail in
Annex 5-3 and summarized below:
1/   First, firm technical proposals and separate price bids will be submitted
followed by opening, consultation and modification of the technical bids
to achieve reasonable uniformity among the final technical bids, and
secondly, and only at this stage, will the original price bids be opened,
accompanied where necessary, by supplemental price bids to reflect the
technical changes.

The Bank loan would finance about 64% of the total estimated foreign ex-
change requirement of the project. While, as mentioned previously, no Egyptian
supplier is expected to bid directly for this package, local sub-supplies
are possible and may amount to about 10% of the Bank loan.
F. Disbursement
5.15       The Bank loan would be disbursed against 100% of the foreign ex-
change cost of the mechanical cement machinery and equipment package and
against the ex-factory costs of any locally supplied components within that
package (para. 5.14), as well as against 100% of the foreign exchange cost of
consultant services. A schedule of estimated quarterly disbursements is
given in Annex 5-4, which is in line with the project implementation schedule
(para. 4.11).
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Revenue
6.01      Details of revenue calculations are given in Annex 6-1.  Sales
revenue has been calculated in constant 1974 prices for the proposed product
mix on the assumptions that the project will start up in early 1978 and reach
full production in 1980, and that the entire production will be sold domestic-
ally. Cement is sold on an ex-factory price basis and the customer pays for
the transportation cost. Ex-factory selling prices include taxes, which are
collected and remitted directly to the Government by ECO and are, therefore,
netted out from the sales price in calculating sales revenue. Selling prices,
which are set and controlled by the Government, were increased in March 1974,
and the weighted average selling price for the proposed product mix is about
LE 11.2 (US$28.5) per ton of cement, including weighted average taxes of LE 3.0
per ton and the cost of bags of LE 1.7 per ton of cement. The Government has
agreed to maintain ex-factory cement prices such that the Company would earn
a reasonable return on its investment and maintain a debt service coverage of
at least 1.5 times. Total revenue to the Company also includes revenue from



- 23 -
sales of lime and foundry products as well as revenue from consulting services
rendered. As a result of the expansion, TCC's sales revenue is forecast to
increase by about 50%, from LE 12.3 million (US$31.4 million) in 1977 to LE
18.3 million (US$46.7 million) in 1980, when the project would reach full
production.
B. Operating Costs
6.02      Production costs estimates (Annex 6-2), like those of sales, are
based on the proposed product mix as well as the planned production build-up
and are in constant (1974) prices, except for labor and imported spare parts.
To reflect relative price changes, it has been assumed that until 1978, TCC's
labor costs would increase annually by about 5% and the cost of imported spare
parts by 10%. Any increase thereafter is assumed to be compensated for by
increases in product prices. Considering the present pricing system in Egypt,
these assumptions are reasonable since cement prices will be periodically
readjusted to absorb the higher cost of labor and raw material inputs and to
conform with the price agreement mentioned in para 6.01 above. Thus effects
of production cost increases beyond the control of the Company are expected
to be offset by higher selling prices. Total operating costs in 1980 for
the existing facilities, the expansion facilities and total plant after ex-
pansion are given below.

/1   Excludes depreciation, financial charges and administrative overhead.
6.03      That operating costs per ton of cement will be low in comparison to
similar cement plants elsewhere is mainly due to: (i) good location relative
to raw materials and utilities; (ii) subsidized fuel prices; and (iii) com-
paratively cheap labor. The Company buys fuel at a subsidized price of LE
7.5/ton (US$19.1/ton) compared with an actual cost to Egypt of LE 22.5/ton
(US$57.4/ton). Even assuming a price of LE 22.5/ton, the total operating cost
per ton of cement compares favorably with similar plants abroad. This fuel
subsidy is virtually offset by the taxes imposed on cement prices. Total



- 24 -
production cost per ton of cement in 1980, when the project would reach full
capacity, is expected to drop by about 7% from present levels mainly due to
the fuel savings in the dry process, increase in plant efficiency, and economies
of scale. As can be seen from the above table, the dry process is expected to
save at least US$1.05 of fuel and electricity cost per ton of cement produced
as compared to the wet process even at the subsidized fuel prices. This saving
would amount to US$3.8/ton of cement if the subsidy were not taken into account.
Details of the operating costs, together with the major assumptions, are con-
tained in Annex 6-2.
C. Financial Projections
6.04      The financial projections are based on a gradual build-up of produc-
tion from the assumed start of expanded operations in early 1978 to full capa-
city utilization in 1980. Sales revenue as well as operating costs are based
on 1974 prices, as explained in paras 6.01 and 6.02. Assumptions used in the
financial projections are given in Annex 6-3. The technical and commercial
assumptions underlying these projections are considered sound and the proj-
ected levels of cash generation attainable.
6.05      Detailed income and cash flow forecasts through 1984 are given in
Annexes 6-4 and 6-5 respectively and selected items are summarized below:

6.06      Due to the cement price increase in March 1974, net profit after
taxes was projected to increase from LE 1 million in 1973 to LE 3.5 million
in 1974. More recent information from the Company indicates that production
and sales in 1974 are somewhat lower than originally projected, but the effect
on the income statement is not yet known, and the impact on cash flow is not
expected to be substantial. Thereafter, during the implementation of the
project, between 1974 and 1977, sales will increase by about LE 1 million,
reflecting the completion and operation of the lime plant, although net profit
after taxes will remain virtually unchanged because of the assumed increases
in labor and spare parts costs. During this period, TCC will be subject to
very low depreciation charges as most of the old facilities have been virtually
written off. As the new plant comes on stream in 1978 at 60% of capacity and
builds up to full capacity in 1980, its higher efficiency will be reflected in
increases in gross profit of more than 60% while sales will increase by only
about 50%. Nevertheless, with higher depreciation charges and high financial
charges in the early years of operation, net profits after taxes in 1980 will



- 25 -
still be below pre-expansion level. As can be seen from the above table, how-
ever, cash generation rises steadily once the new plant is in operation and
accelerates as financial charges decrease, demonstrating the beneficial impact
and financial viability of the project.
6.07       Forecast Balance Sheets for 1974 - 1984 are contained in Annex 6-6.
Significant data from these are shown below. For the purpose of comparison,
projected income statements and balance sheets without expansion are given in
Annex 6-7 and 6-8 respectively.

/1   Including surplus cash.
6.08       TCC has virtually no long-term debt and therefore, the long-term
debt/equity ratio remains strong during the implementation of the project
with a maximum debt position of 50% being reached in 1978. Thereafter, the
debt/equity ratio declines until, by 1984, TCC will have only 31% in debt.
This capitalization puts TCC in a good position to finance future conversion
of existing facilities (para. 4.01). Nevertheless, in order to maintain its
sound financial position, agreements were obtained that, without prior consent
of the Bank, the Company will (i) not undertake additional capital investment
in excess of LE 3.0 million annually until the project is complete; (ii)
during the life of the loan, not borrow additional long-term funds if its
debt would exceed its equity. Agreement was also obtained that the Company
will, after the project is complete, take every action within its powers to
ensure that its debt service coverage is at least 1.5 times.
6.09       While net working capital will remain relatively low during project
implementation, the Company's financial position should improve rapidly there-
after. At the end of 1978, the first year of operations, the Company's current
ratio is expected to be in excess of 2:1. While Egyptian law requires the
Company to distribute most of its net profit to the Government and to its em-
ployees, the Company's financial position is expected to remain strong dur-
ing operations as depreciation charges would be about two times debt service
obligations. Agreement was obtained that, after completion of the project,
the Government and the Company will undertake to maintain TCC's current ratio
at no less than 1.5:1 and the Government will not make withdrawals, other than
mandatory withdrawals, from the Company if, as a result, the current ratio
would fall below 1.5:1.



- 26 -
6.10      Since the Company's long-term debt outstanding is small, debt ser-
vicing should be no problem during project implementation or subsequent oper-
ations. Long-term debt service coverage is lowest, at 2.0 times, in 1980, the
first year of the repayment of the Bank loan, and rises thereafter. This is
ample and would permit additional borrowings in the late 1980s to help finance
the future conversion of existing facilities.
D. Break-Even Point
6.11      The profit break-even point in 1980, after reaching full produc-
tion, would be about 79% of capacity or 1.58 million tons of cement.  From
there on it would steadily decline as financial charges decrease. The cash
break-even point in 1980 would be only 64% of capacity, since debt repayment
would be less than the annual depreciation.  In other words, in 1980, assuming
full production, prices could fall about 21% before the Company's cash genera-
tion would be zero. Further details on break-even levels are found in Annex 6-9.
E. Reporting and Auditing Requirements
6.12      The Company submits to GOBM periodic reports concerning its operations
and projects under implementation. These reports generally provide adequate
information for proper supervision. The accounting system employed by TCC,
which was established in 1968 for all industrial and trading companies in
Egypt, is referred to as the "Unified Accounting System" and is designed to
meet the accounting and statistical needs of the Government. It is fairly
consistent with generally accepted Western accounting practices. In addition
to the internal audit carried out by TCC, the Company accounts are audited
annually by the Central State Audit Department (CSAD), whose methods corres-
pond to Bank requirements. The Company shall continue to be audited by CSAD
or by an independent auditing firm acceptable to the Bank.
F. Financial Rate of Return
6.13      Financial rate of return calculations are on an incremental basis
and the cost and benefit streams, including those for capital costs, are in
1974 real value terms and are derived from financial projections. Owing to
Government's policy of holding down domestic cement prices to encourage
reconstruction and regional development, and to its tax policies, the finan-
cial rate of return of the project of 10.4% in real terms is comparatively
low. The assumptions for the calculations and the cost/benefit streams are
given in Annex 6-10. Sensitivity tests have been made to determine the
effects of various alternatives on the financial rates of return. They are
shown in Annex 6-10 and are summarized below:



- 27 -
Sensitivity Tests
Financial
Case                 Description                         Rate of Return (%)
1.        Base Case                                            10.4
2.        One Year Delay in Project Completion                  9.1
3.        Capital Cost Increase 10%                             9.2
4.        Operating Cost Increase 10%                           9.2
5.        Revenue Decrease 5%                                   9.2
6.14      The project is most sensitive to changes in sales revenue.  A
drop of 10% in sales revenue without corresponding reduction in operating
costs decreases the return to 7.4%. If the selling price of cement is
increased by LE 1.0/ton the return would increase to 12.9%. If the fuel
subsidy were to be eliminated without corresponding selling price increases,
the return would be 6.6%. A one-year delay in project start-up would drop
the return to 9.1%. In view of: (i) the past experience of TCC staff in
managing and construction of similar projects; (ii) the expected guarantees
from the cement equipment supplier for timely completion and his participation
in erection and start-up; and (iii) the pricing policy in Egypt; the likelihood
of the return falling below 9% is low. Nevertheless, considering the sound
debt/equity position of TCC at this time, even a 9% return would still keep
the Company in sound financial condition under forseeable circumstances.
G.  Major Risks
6.15      The project has two major areas of potential risk:  (i) simultaneous
operation of dry and wet process production units; and (ii) distribution of
cement. After completion of the project both dry process plant (the project)
and the wet process plant (existing plant) will have to run alongside one
another. This may pose some initial operational as well as organizational
difficulties. The projections take this potential eventuality into account
and the production build-up has been made on a more conservative basis than
would be used in normal cases involving cement plant expansions. Moreover,
with the technical assistance for two years after start-up from the cement
machinery and equipment supplier, TCC is expected to overcome any initial
operational difficulties. In order to avoid the risk in distributing cement,
it was agreed that a detailed marketing and distribution study will be carried
out (para. 3.18), and that an investment program, based on the study's re-
commendations, would be prepared by the Government in consultation with the
Bank. This investment program would cover appropriate marketing and dis-
tribution facilities.

VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   Economic Rate of Return
7.01      The incremental economic rate of return of the project is about
19% in 1974 prices and is based on a conservatively estimated long-term
price (in 1974 prices) for imported bagged cement of US$32 per ton c.i.f.
Egyptian port, with the same price being assumed ex-factory at TCC, and a
delivered fuel price of US$ 57.4 per ton.  The use of world market prices and
the elimination of taxes explain the wide discrepancy between the economic
and financial rates of return. Further details of prices as well as sensitiv-
ity analyses are given in Annex 7-1. In the unlikely event that world cement
prices were to drop as low as the marginal cost of production, i.e. equal to
about US$28 per ton at Egyptian ports, the economic return of the project would
fall to about 15%. If the long-term fuel price is assumed to be US$70 per
ton, then the return would decrease to about 18%. The effects of price changes
on the rate of return are given in Annex 7-1. In order to take into account
prevailing uncertainties with respect to prices, equipment and civil construction
costs, a probability analysis has been carried out, as detailed in Annex 7-2.
Based on this analysis, there is a 90% probability that the return would be
between 11% and 25%, the most likely return being about 18%, with a 75% chance
that the return would exceed 14%. Thus the project provides a good return
under foreseeable adverse circumstances.
B.   Linkages and Employment
7.02      The project is crucial for the reconstruction needs and the future
development of the economy. Investments are expected to expand at an annual
rate of over 14%. This rapid growth would not be possible without the
availability of adequate cement supplies at reasonable prices. Without the
TCC expansion, Egypt would in the late 1970's have to depend on large-scale
cement imports at higher prices, straining the foreign exchange resources of
the country. Therefore, it is probable that some of the investment programs
would have to be scaled down or postponed if Egypt were to depend largely on
imported cement.
7.03      While the proposed project would create directly only about 200
additional jobs, it would also open up jobs, particularly in downstream indus-
tries, although it is difficult to quantify them. Nonetheless, the effect is
considerable, particularly in the construction industry and the transport
sector.
C.   Foreign Exchange Savings
7.04      The foreign exchange savings from the project by replacing cement
imports are considered of importance to an Egyptian economy burdened by
chronic balance of payments problems. The net foreign exchange savings from
the project, at 1974 prices, would be over US$11 million per year, offsetting



- 29 -
its estimated cost in about 5 years at full production. Further details of
the calculation of foreign exchange savings are shown in Annex 7-3.
D.   Transfer of Technology
7.05      Transfer of technology is also an important aspect of the project
since this will be the first dry-process plant operating within the country.
The experience that will be gained by TCC staff from this project could be
used in assisting other companies in Egypt in formulating, designing and
operating dry process plants in the country. It will also enable TCC to
plan the conversion of its existing facilities in an efficient manner.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      The following principal assurances and agreements were received
from the Government and the Company:
A.   The Government will:
(a) not consolidate, or merge the Company without prior
consultation with the Bank (para. 2.02);
(b) carry out a study of cement production, marketing,
and distribution facilities and prepare in consultation

consult with the Bank prior to establishing production
capacity in excess of the levels contemplated in that
program (paras. 3.14 and 3.18);
(c) continue to grant to TCC the exclusive right to use the
clay and limestone quarries at Tourah for at least 30
years (para. 4.02);
(d) provide adequate and timely supply of fuel and power

- 30 -
(i) not, after completion of the project, make withdrawals,
other than mandatory withdrawals from the Company, if
such withdrawals would cause the current ratio to fall
below 1.5:1, and provide funds to maintain that level,
if necessary (paras. 5.08 and 6.09); and
(j) maintain ex-factory cement prices such that the Company
would maintain a reasonable return on its investment and

5.13) and possibly some broader services (para. 5.14);
(e) not undertake additional capital investment prior to
completion of the project in excess of LE 3.0 million per
annum (para. 6.08);
(f) not borrow additional long-term funds if its debt would
exceed its equity (para. 6.08);
(g) take all action within its powers such that its debt service
coverage is at least 1.5 after completion of the project
(para. 6.08); and
(h) maintain a current ratio of 1.5 after completion of the
project (para. 6.09).
8.02      Agreement has tentatively been reached with the Arab Fund covering
such matters as procurement procedures, allocation of goods and services,
coordination of missions, supervision, exchange of information, and stand-
ardization of reporting requirements. These procedures will be confirmed
through an exchange of letters between the Arab Fund and the Bank (para. 5.11).
Confirmation of the terms and conditions of Arab Fund financing have been
received but finalization of the financing arrangements between the Fund and
TCC will be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan.

8.03      On the basis of the above agreements, the project provides a sound
basis for a loan to the Government equivalent to US$40 million for 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period, and for relending of this amount to TCC for
15 years, including a five year grace period.
