REPORT AND RECOMIIENDATION OF TIHE PRESIDENT
TO TILE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOA1N
TO TILE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT FOR THE
TOURANI CEMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
of $40 million to the Arab Republic of Egypt, to help finance the expansion
of the cement production capacity of the Tourah Cement Company (TCC). 1/ The
loan would have a term of 20 years including 5 years of grace, with interest
at 8.5 percent per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to TCC for
a term of 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at an effective cost of 10
percent per annum. TCC would also bear the foreign exchange risk. The re-
maining foreign exchange requirements of the project would be covered by a
loan of $20 million equivalent from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development (hereinafter referred to as the Arab Fund) to TCC for a term of
20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 6;percent per annum.
PART I - TEiE ECONOMY
2.        An Economic Report, "The Egyptian Economy in 1974:    Its Position
and Prospects", dated September 25, 1974 has been distributed to the Executive
Directors. A country data sheet is attached as Annex 1.
Background
3.        The background to, and recent developments in, Egypt's economy have
been elaborated in the economic report. The following paragraphs contain a
summary of the prospects for the future and the position with respect to ex-
ternal assistance and creditworthiness.
Prospects for 1975
4.        Egypt appears to be on the threshhold of a new economic era.     Pros-
pects for peace have improved, offering the possibility that resources can
gradually be transferred from military to civilian uses. The "October Paper",
presented by President Sadat to the people and the Parliament, and approved in
a national referendum, provides a new statement of general principles to guide
Egyptian development; it envisages consolidation of state-owned sectors,
liberalization of the private sector, incentives to private foreign invest-
ment and expanded economic cooperation with Arab countries. Egypt has recently
initiated a number of significant steps in furtherance of these principles.
These would lead to a significant restructuring of the economy. Mleanwhile, a

Tourah", is used in the legal documents.



-2-
whole new set of external relationships has evolved between Egypt, its oil-
producing Arab and other neighbors, Western countries, and Japan, resulting
in increased official and private capital inflows. These developments are
mutually interdependent and self-reinforcing. Thus, the increased availabil-
ity of capital will permit greater liberalization of the economy, which, in
turn, should improve the investment climate.
5.        Recently, the Government launched an Interim Program for development
in the period July 1974 - December 1975, the purpose of which is to have a
meaningful development strategy consistent with available resources and to
commence restructuring the economy on a peace-time development-oriented basis.
It is to be followed by a development plan for 1976-80, work on which was
begun in November, 1974. A sum of SE 520 million ($1,331 million equivalent)
was budgeted for public sector investment expenditures in 1974. This is
about 20 percent above the 1973 budget level of BE 430 million (actual public
expenditure was BE 380 million). The budget for 1975 foresees a further 40
percent increase (bE 200 million) over the 1974 figure, based on greater
availabilities of foreign project aid, including expenditures on the Suez-
Mediterranean pipeline and Suez Canal but excluding allocation for Canal Zone
reconstruction.  It also excludes investments in joint ventures which are
estimated to reach about bE 50 million annually beginning in 1975.    The share
of private investment, which in recent years has averaged about 10 percent of
total investments, is expected to increase to over 20 percent by 1980.
6.        In large part, Egypt's investment programs for 1974 and 1975 are
limited to completing or continuing carry-over projects. They emphasize
fertilizers, cement, tourism (private sector) and petroleum and pipeline
development -- all high priority projects aimed at increasing production or
saving or generating foreign exchange earnings. In agriculture the priority
given to poultrv and development of existing land rather than land reclamation
also seems appropriate to the country's needs. Programs to renovate or improve
the infrastructure (e.g. railways, telecommunications) are clearly urgent
because it had been run down during years of under-investment. Thus, Egypt's
investment program for the years 1974 and 1975 appears to be in accordance
with economic priorities.
7.        The resumption of full-capacity growth and the beginning of recon-
struction is expected to increase import requirements substantially in the
short-run, resulting in sizeable deficits in external trade and services (over
$1 billion in 1974 and in 1975). Although part of these deficits can be ex-
pected to be financed through grants from other Arab countries, large amounts
of additional assistance will be required on concessionary terms.
External Assistance
8.        Egypt obtained substantial amounts of external aid until the mid-
1960's.  Thereafter, new commitments of Western assistance practically ceased.
The gross inflow of medium- and long-term capital fell by nearly 50 percent
immediately after the 1967 war. Although aid levels gradually rose again,
net inflows averaged only $9 million annually in medium- and long-term capital



-3-
over the five-year period FY 1968-1972; amortization payments were $5 million
greater than disbursements in 1973.   As indicated in the Economic Report, the
total capital inflow required to cover the overall deficit in the balance on
current account for 1974 and 1975 together is projected at $1,450 million.
Assuming net disbursements of $990 million on loans committed as of mid-1974,
private capital inflows of $120 million, IMF financing of $48 million and a
reduction of $600 million in the use of short-term foreign financing (cf.
para. 89 of the Economic Report), the financing gap for the two-year period
was projected at $900 million. Also given the high absorptive capacity of
the economy, and the low level of investments over the past decade, the need
for external aid commitments in the succeeding years is expected to remain
at a high level.
9.        Substantial Arab aid was received in 1973 and is continuing.    A
$300 million grant from Saudi Arabia was reported in August 1974, while Abu
Dhabi and Qatar pledged $33 million and $10 million respectively. Large aid
offers have also been made by Kuwait. Commitments of non-Arab foreign aid
have also been considerable. Five countries have either firmly committed
new loans to be used over periods varying from two to five years (Iran $850
million, United States $250 million, Germany $225 million, Denmark $9 million)
or have announced their intention to do so (Japan $100 million). In addition,
the Government has concluded two Euro-dollar loans totalling $180 million and
is currently negotiating a third ($100 million). Also, in August 1974 the
IMF extended a credit (first tranche) of $48 million. A large share of new
loans is for unidentified projects and will disburse only gradually over the
next few years. Most recently in November 1974, Saudi Arabia agreed to extend
$161 million in project aid towards co-financing projects selected and appraised
by the Bank Group.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
10.       Egypt's medium- and long-term debt outstanding and disbursed at end
1973 stood at about $2.14 billion. In addition, the country owed close to
$500 million in short-term financial credits, and about $580 million in bila-
teral clearing balances. The USSR was Egypt's principal creditor, followed
in importance by the United States, Kuwait, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Germany.
IBRD/IDA debt comprised less than 1 percent of the total. Of the reported
outstanding medium- and long-term debt at end 1973, about 37 percent was due
to be repaid within two years, 46 percent within three years, and 53 percent
within four years. Service payments on these debts were estimated to reach
$530 million in 1974, equivalent to about 30 percent of the country's gross
foreign exchange earnings.
11.       The expected large current deficits in 1974 and 1975 together with
heavy debt service requirements, call for very substantial amounts of foreign
capital in the short-run. As the existing pipeline of projects suitable for
foreign financing is still relatively narrow, much of this assistance will
have to be made available in the form of program aid. The commitments already
made by foreign donors should go a long way to meet these short-term require-
ments, and to enable increased utilization of capacity in the economy.



-4-
12.       In the medium- and longer-run, the outlook for Egypt's balance of
payments is much more promising. Foreign exchange earnings are expected to
grow from a level of some $1.7 billion in 1974 to about $4.7 billion in 1980,
because of the reopening of the Suez Canal, operation of the Sumed pipeline,
rapidly rising exports os petroleum and petroleum products, a doubling of
manufactured exports, increased workers' remittances, and the development of
tourism. Imports of goods and services, on the other hand, can be expected
to grow at a slower pace, after the drastic increase of import levels, over the
next 3 to 4 years. As a result, the deficit on external trade and services
is projected to progressively narrow in the latter part of the decade, signi-
ficantly reducing the required net inflow of foreign capital. Following the
rapid increase in export earnings, and the slower growth and consolidation of
external debt, the debt service ratio could fall to some 15 percent by 1980.
13.       To attain these objectives, which would permit Egypt to establish
a sound financial position by the end of the decade with rapid growth, it is
necessary that Egypt not only mobilize substantial amounts of capital, prefer-
ably on concessionary terms from abroad, but also pursue appropriate debt man-
agement, fiscal and aid-utilization policies. In addition, domestic savings
will have to be increased through restraint in public and private consumption.
The Government's determination to continue the liberalization of the economic
system should facilitate this process. In particular, steps will have to be
taken to: rationalize the price system (including the relation to world market
prices), stimulate the latent potential of Egypt's private sector, encourage
foreign investment, and improve the management of overall Government economic
operations, including the reduction of bureaucratic bottlenecks and decentrali-
zation of decisions to the firm or enterprise level. The Government has
already taken a number of measures in this direction duri.ag t'iis year. Dis-
cussions are being conducted with the IMF towards achieving specific targets
with respect to debt management. Furthermore, active discussions are under
way between the Bank Group and Egypt on these and other matters relating to
economic policy. In the course of these discussions, the Government has
indicated that it expects to initiate effective additional measures on many
of the matters referred to above, and to seek assistance, where necessary,
from the Bank Group in formulating such measures. Such assistance has
already been initiated in the field of debt management, and an agricultural
sector review mission is planned for late January 1975. The next economic
mission, scheduled for the Spring of 1975 will carry out a detailed review
of the measures taken by the Government.
14.       Assuming that (i) these policy initiatives continue and are imple-
mented, and (ii) the sub3tantial aid offers committed or received can be ab-
sorbed rapidly, Egypt should, while facing a short-term liquidity problem,
experience little difficulty in meeting its external payments obligations in
the medium and long-term. While carrying a heavy short-term debt burden
(1974/76), Egypt can be considered creditworthy for a blend of Bank and IDA
lending in view of its promising medium- and long-term prospects.



-5-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN EGYPT
15.       The proposed loan would be the Bank Group's thirteenth lending opera-
tion in Egypt. It would bring Bank arid IDA commitments to $348.6 million.
Annex II contains a Summary of Bank Loans and IDA Credits as of November 30,
1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       In view of the overall demands upon IDA monies, and Egypt's substan-
tially increased need for external assistance to help finance an expanded
development program, its size and absorptive capacity, and the several economic
policy measures taken and contemplated by the Government to restore credit-
worthiness, it is proposed to increase significantly the scope of Bank Group
lending. In this fiscal year available IDA funds will be blended with Bank
funds, and it is expected that the projects for Bank Groun lending submitted
to the Executive Directors for consideration will total over $200 million.
In the context of the expanding economic activity and the proposed 1976-80
development plan, the Government has requested advice by the Bank Group
in policy matters. It is therefore expected that technical assistance,
both project and non-project, will also increase significantly, and will con-
stitute an essential ingredient of Bank Group participation at this crucial
juncture in Egypt's economic development. The dialogue begun recently (see
para. 13) will enable continuous monitoring of progress in implementation of
policies for the restoration of creditworthiness and realization of the
potential for rapid growth. The Bank Group lending program would support the
Government's economic programs and policies, which, as indicated earlier
(para. 6) are in accordance with economic criteria. Progress by Egypt in
pursuing sound economic policies will, it is hoped, enable the Bank Group to
continue a blend of IDA/Bank lending in a program of the magnitude envisaged
in this fiscal year. At this level, Bank Group disbursements would represent a
small portion, less than 10 percent, of Egypt's overall capital inflow require-
ments (see para. 8). It might be noted that the Government also attaches
particular importance to the catalytic role of Bank Group financing and is
actively exploring the interest of other donors in the complementary financing
of projects. The Bank Group's share of the total external debt outstanding
and disbursed was less than 1 percent at end 1973. For the future, the Bank/
IDA share of total external debt outstanding and disbursed is estimated to
reach about 10 percent in 1978; the Bank's share in 1978 would be about 7 per-
cent of external debt outstanding and disbursed. It is estimated that in 1978,
debt service payments due to the Bank Group will represent about 1 percent
of service payments due on all of Egypt's external debt.
17.       A project covering the second phase of the railway rehabilitation
program has been appraised, and is likely to be ready for consideration by
the Executive Directors later in FY75. A telecommunications improvement
project and a second DFC project with the Bank of Alexandria have also been
appraised. One of these projects is expected to be ready for consideration
by the end of FY75 and the other in early FY76. Other projects under prepara-
tion for FY76 include textile rehabilitation, production and export marketing
of fruits and vegetables, and the Port of Alexandria improvement.



-6-
PART III - THE CEMENT SUB-SECTOR AND THE BENEFICIARY (TC)
Organization of Sub-Sector
18.       The cement industry is the responsibility of the General Organiza-
tion of Building Materials (GOBM) which is iTn charge of the execution of
Government policy and its subsequent follow-up in the building materials sub-
sector. GOBM was established as an agency of the Ministry of Industry in
1961.  In 1971, it was made a holding company with the authority to modify
the statutes of the 13 subsidiary public sector companies in this sub-sector,
including the right to liquidate or dissolve, merge or consolidate, or divide
them. GOBM works jointly with the General Organization for Industrialization
(GOFI) which, in collaboration with the respective general organizations, is
responsible for overseeing, planning, and coordinating industrial expansion
in Egypt.
19.       The 13 companies controlled by GOBM produce a wide range of products
including cement, pipes, ceramics, porcelain, glass and other construction
materials. The companies have an annual sales output of about hE 44.3
million (US$113 million); they are financiallv independent and autonomous
units, each with its own board of directors. GOBM's own board of directors
consists of a chairman, the general manager and the chairmen of each of the
subsidiary companies. GOBM is well managed and organized to carry out its
functions. Major investment decisions are made at the ministerial leval and
it is GOBM's role to disburse funds for investments under its supervision.
However, responsibility for actual project execution and subsequent operations
is effectively delegated to the ultimate operating company -- in the case of
this project to the Tourah Cement Company (TCC).
The Cement Market
20.       Although Egypt relied on imported cement as well as domestic produc-
tion for many years, there have been no imports since 1967/68. Also, since
that time it has, as a matter of policy, substantially increased cement exports
to alleviate its foreign exchange difficulties. These exports have gone pri-
marily to other Arab countries and to West Africa.
21.       The overall domestic consumption of cement, particularly in sectors
other than defense, has been repressed in recent years due to (1) the said
export policy; (2) virtuallv stagnant domestic cement production; (3) supres-
sion of cement imports due to a lack of foreign exchange; and (4) deferral of
major new investment activities. For these reasons, cement consumption in
Egypt grew by barely 3 percent per year between 1963/64 and 1971/72; coupled
with Government pricing control, this has also resulted in some black market
activity.



-7-
22.       The picture of cement supply and demand in Egypt over the last
decade is illustrated by the following table:

1967/68         2,904                  -              600             2,432
1968/69         3,485                  -              868             2,637
1969/70         3,628                  -              629             3,060
1970/71         3,814                  -              900             3,103
1971/72         3,883                  -              971             2,944
1973            3,617                  -              n.a./2          n.a./2
/1   This includes adjustments for inventory changes.
/2   Not available.
23.       Under the five-year Development Plan which is presently being pre-
pared by the Government for the period 1976-80 (see para. 5), a greater share
of resources will be channelled towards development activities than was done
in the past several years. The indications are that the increase in public
investments might be of the order of 20 to 30 percent annually. Substantial
growth in construction expenditure and related cement consumption is therefore
projected for all sectors, including the planned reconstruction and development
of the Suez Canal Zone and other regions in Egypt. Thus, the future supply/
demand situation is expected to be considerably different from the past. Pend-
ing preparation of the 5 year Plan, precise investment projections and consump-
tion levels are difficult to predict. However, available data indicate that
during the second half of the 1970's Egypt will have substantial cement import
requirements.
Cement Production Facilities
24.       Cement is produced by four companies in Egypt, three of them (TCC,
Helwan and National Cement Companies) located 15 to 35 km south of Cairo,
and a fourth (Alexandria Cement Co.) near Alexandria. These companies are
owned and controlled by the Government through GOBM. No new capacity has
been added since the late 1960's; the physical deterioration of plants and,
in late 1973, a shortage of imported kraft paper and bags have caused some
curtailment of production.



-8-
25.       At present, three plant extensions (TCC, Alexandria and National)
and four new plants are being planned. If these plans materialize, total
annual capacity would reach 8.37 million tons of cement by 1983. So far,
however, only the said three expansion projects are either being implemented
or on their way to implementation. Even with the increase of capacity
at Tourah through the proposed project, the contribution of TCC to total
cement production in Egypt is projected to decline from its current (1974)
share of about 34 percent to some 24 percent; TCC would, however, still re-
main the largest single contributor to a substantially higher level of national
production. If all the three expansion plans and the investments in four new
plants are carried out on schedule, the need for cement imports should cease
by about 1980. A temporary excess in production capacity in the early 1980s
would possibly make some cement available for export. In any case, if cement
demand in Egypt does not grow as predicted, the scope of some of the new
plants could be scaled down or their implementation could be delayed (cf.
para. 28).
Distribution and Sales
26.       Distribution and sale of cement in Egypt are handled by the Egyptian
Cement Office (ECO) in Cairo, whose own fleet of trucks, together with sub-
contractor fleets, transports 95 percent-of Egyptian cement production. The
balance is shipped by rail or barge. The recent shortage of kraft paper for
bags has lent impetus to bulk transport, which in the past has accounted for
less than 2 percent of distribution. There are plans to expand this through
the acquisition of more bulk handling facilities including storage silos.
Transport tariffs are set by the Government. They range from about BE 0.04-0.05
per ton-kilometer for the short haul to Cairo down to bE 0.01 per ton-kilometer
for longer hauls; these levels are sufficient to cover the transportation costs
of ECO.
27.       Cement distribution is poorly planned and suffers from various
shortcomings. The lack of regional distribution depots, inadequate and poorly
maintained truck fleets, poor rail delivery control, inadequate bulk-handling
facilities and excessive spillage, result in inefficient distribution, and
could become a serious bottleneck if expansion of cement supply and demand
takes place as envisaged. The Government recognizes that given the increase
in production, the benefits of bagged and bulk distribution need to be studied
for the country as a whole. It also feels that a gradual transformation to-
wards more bulk facilities is likely to be necessary to improve the distribu-
tion and reduce transport costs, thus effecting overall savings to the economy.
Future Investments in the Cement Sub-Sector
28.       In order to ensure that there is no over-investment in cement pro-
duction facilities (cf. para. 25), and to improve the present cement distri-
bution system (cf. para. 27), the Government has agreed to initiate a detailed
study of production, distribution and marketing facilities for the cement sub-
sector for the purpose of analyzing the long-term investment requirements in
such facilities (Section 4.05 of the draft Loan Agreement). Terms of refer-
ence for the study will be agreed upon between the Government and the Bank by
March 31, 1975, and the study should be completed by June 30, 1976. The



-9-
Government has agreed to prepare, in consultation with the Bank, an investment
program for production, distribution and marketing facilities for cement on
the basis of the recommendations of this study. It has also been agreed that
the Government will consult the Bank prior to establishing, or permitting to be
established new.facilities for cement production, if, as a result, the cement
production capacity would exceed the level reflected in the investment program
referred to above (Section 4.05 (iv) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Pricing
29.       Cement prices in Egypt -- both ex-factory and retail -- are con-
trolled by the Government. Regional prices vary substantially due to the
transport costs. At Aswan, for example, retail prices are more than 50 percent
above those in Cairo. The establishment of plants envisaged at Suez and Assiut
will eventually help correct this. Nevertheless, despite a heavy tax element
included in the Egyptian cement prices, they compare favorably with domestic
prices in other countries and with international prices, which are currently
at unprecedented levels. Even if these should eventually drop, as is to be
expected with substantial expansion of Mediterranean and European production,
long-term c.i.f. import prices at Alexandria are forecast to remain above
Egyptian domestic price levels.
30.       Between 1965 and March 1974, there has been only one general in-
crease (in 1969) in ex-factory and retail prices of cement in Egypt. Tax in-
creases, however, have been more frequent. The price increase in March 1974
was substantial and was aimed at allowing cement producers a margin of 30
percent on sales. The Government expects to maintain this margin in the
future. The Government has also agreed to set the ex-factory price of cement
so as to ensure that TCC will, on the assumption of a production rate of not
less than 90 percent of installed capacity, earn in each fiscal year a reason-
able return on its investments, and will cover its debt service by at least
1.5 times (Section 4.04 of the draft Loan Agreement; see also para. 49).
The Tourah Cement Company
31.       TCC was founded in 1927 as a private company with a share capital
of 1BE 200,000, owned principally by Swiss and Egyptian interests, and opera-
tions commenced in 1929 with an initial capacity of 100,000 metric tons per
year (TPY) of cement. TCC was nationalized in 1961 (private interests were
compensated in full), and is now owned by the Government through GOBM, which
holds its entire share capital of LE 2,230,608. With various expansions
of the plant, TCC's total capacity is now 1.35 million TPY. The principal
management body, the Board of Directors, consists of nine members. The chair-
man and four senior managers of the Company are appointed by Presidential
Decree and serve with four labor representatives elected for a period of three
years. The Board of Directors formulates operational policies, within the
framework of overall Government policy, and submits its proposals to GOBM for
approval before implementation. TCC management controls day-to-day operations.
TCC has a good technical department, whose staff have extensive production and
engineering experience; in the past, it has provided technical assistance to



- 10 -
other cement companies in Egypt as well as consulting services to cement pro-
ducers in other Arab countries. TCC's management is capable of carrying out
the expansion project with limited outside help (see para. 44).
Plant Facilities
32.       TCC's cement plant, located near Tourah, 15 km south of Cairo, is
well served by railroad, highway, and inland waterway. Limestone, clay and
sand quarries are located near the plant, which consists of the cement plant
proper, quarrying equipment, and transportation and stockpiling facilities
between the quarries and the plant. The existing plant uses wet process
technology and includes raw material preparation facilities, six cement kilns,
and all necessary auxiliary facilities. Some portions of it are 40 years old
and need modernization. Due to lack of foreign exchange, some spare parts
which would normally be imported are also fabricated by TCC in its foundry.
A new f?ime plant and raw material transportation facilities currently under
construction are expected to be completed by mid-1976. Funds required for
completion of these ongoing investments will be provided by the Borrower.
On the whole, TCC's plant is well maintained and operated. It employs some
2,050 persons.
Operations
33.       Over the past 4-1/2 years TCC has been operating at close to 95
percent capacity on the average. This is particularly noteworthy in view of
the age of the plant, the difficulties in obtaining imported spare parts and
other factors outside TCC's control. TCC's financial performance over the
period has also been satisfactory and improving. Net profits after taxes as
a percentage of: (i) net sales, (ii) average net fixed assets, and (iii) aver-
age equity have steadily increased. This trend is mainly attributable to im-
proved efficiency of plant operations and partly also to higher export sales
prices. There was a small drop in sales volume during the months of November
and December 1973, as a result of hostilities and a shortage of kraft paper
for bagging. The paper shortage also severely affected production during the
first two months of 1974, when output declined to 70 percent of capacity.
However, this situation has been almost rectified and TCC is currently operat-
ing near capacity.
Financial Position
34.       TCC's capitalization is sound.   The debt/equity ratio was 4:96 at
the end of 1973. On the other hand, TCC's liquidity position is strained,
primarily due to the fact that all investments undertaken in the last four
years were financed out of internal cash generation. Moreover, current lia-
bilities include most of the year's profits which have to be distributed in
accordance with Egyptian law, to GOBM and workers, as well as taxes. To meet
its liabilities, TCC has incurred short-term borrowings. However, TCC's fi-
nancial position is expected to improve under the proposed project.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
Prolect History
35.       The economic mission of March/April 1972 identified cement and
fertilizer as priority sub-sectors for industrial investment. Missions in
late 1972 and early 1973 identified the proposed cement expansion project.
In view of the sizeable foreign exchange financing that was likely to be re-
quired and the importance of the project to Egypt, the Bank Group acceded to
Egypt's request to help complete the preparation of the project, appraise
it, finance a portion of the foreign exchange cost and help secure other
external financing. The project, which was prepared by TCC and GOBM, was
reviewed by a preparation mission in November 1973. A further mission to re-
view the progress of preparation and choice of process in the light of changes
in oil prices visited Egypt in March 1974. The Bank Group explored and
received an indication of interest from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development in providing a part of the foreign exchange financing requirement.
The project was appraised in June/July 1974 by a Bank mission, which was
joined by representatives of the Arab Fund. Technical discussions, followed
by negotiations on the proposed loan were held in Washington between December
13-17, 1974. The Egyptian delegation was led by Messrs. Rafik Sowelem, Under-
secretary, Agency for Arab and International Economic Cooperation, and Mohamed
Naguib Abd El Bady, Chairman, TCC.
Scope and Objectives
36.       The project is designed to (i) expand TCC's capacity by 660,000 TPY
of clinker (corresponding to 700,000 TPY of normal cement) thus raising TCC's
overall production capacity from 1.35 to 2.05 million TPY of cement, using dry
process technology; and (ii) modernize and improve some of the existing equip-
ment, taking into account the need to convert them in future from the wet to
the dry process to enable the Company to maintain capacity in its present
plant. The project introduces no new products and can be implemented without
interfering with the existing production. The wet and dry process equipment
can be operated side by side in the same plant without any difficulty. Due
to lack of space, however, no further major expansion of the plant beyond that
contemplated by the project is possible, although some capacity increase could
still be achieved by conversion of the existing plant from wet to dry process
as explained below. The details of the project are provided in the Loan and
Project Summary in Annex III.
Process Choice
37.       The dry process technology will yield substantial fuel savings and
be the first of its kind in Egypt. The exact design of the process to be
employed will be decided after bid evaluation. In addition to the low fuel
requirements and lower operating costs, an important consideration in process
selection was the possibility of designing the project so as to permit future
conversion of the existing plant to the dry process; such a conversion would



- 12 -
not only reduce fuel consumption, but also permit an increase of some 30 to
50 percent in the output from TCC's existing facilities at a relatively modest
investment cost.
Raw Materials and Utilities
38.       Supply of raw materials and utilities for TCC's expanded plant are
adequately assured. Limestone and clay, the two principal raw materials, will
be from the deposits which TCC now has on lease from the Egyptian Government.
To avoid any possible conflict over raw material sources, the Government has
agreed to continue to lease these quarries exclusively to TCC for the full
life of the project (Section 3.02 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement). Ade-
quate supply of fuel and power has also been assured (Section 3.02 (a) of
the draft Loan Agreement). The project design takes into account possible
future replacement of heavy fuel oil by natural gas available in the Cairo
area.
Capital Cost
39.       Capital costs of the project are estimated at US$84 million equiva-
lent, and interest and other charges during construction at an additional
US$9 million. Of the total financing requirements of US$93 million equivalent,
about US$60 million or nearly 65 percent would be in foreign exchange. The
remaining local costs of about US$33 million equivalent include an estimated
US$3.7 million equivalent in duties and taxes. A more detailed presentation
of the costs of the project is provided in Annex III.
Financing Plan
40.       The proposed Bank loan would contribute US$40 million equivalent,
i.e. 43 percent of the project's total financing requirements. The Arab Fund
has confirmed that it is considering a loan in the amount of US$20 million
equivalent, representing 22 percent of the financing requirements; this loan
which will include an estimated US$3.0 million for interest during construction,
will be made to TCC for a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at an
interest rate of 6 percent per annum. The signing of the Arab Fund loan agree-
ment (expected to take place in March 1975) will be a condition of effective-
ness of the proposed Bank loan (Section 6.01 (c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
The procedures to be followed for coordinating the Arab Fund's and the Bank's
activities during project execution and supervision, including the implementa-
tion of joint reporting requirements, have been agreed upon in principle with
the Arab Fund. A Letter of Understanding regarding project administration
arrangements will also be exchanged with the Arab Fund upon approval of its
loan.
41.       The proposed Bank loan would be made to Egypt for a term of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, at an interest rate of 8.5 percent per annum. The
proceeds of the loan would be on-lent to TCC for a term of 15 years, including
5 years of grace, at an effective cost to TCC of 10 percent per annum (interest
plus a Ministry of Finance charge) under a subsidiary loan agreement satisfac-
tory to the Bank (Section 3.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement). A departure



- 13 -
from the Bank's normal practice of lending directly to an industrial enter-
prise is proposed in order that the term of the Bank loan be consistent with
that of the co-lender, and to make the funds available to Egypt on somewhat
more concessionary terms than would be appropriate if the funds were lent
directly to the beneficiary. The proposed loan would include $5 million to
finance interest and other charges during construction. During the period
of the subsidary loan, TCC would bear the foreign exchange risk.
42.       The Arab Fund and Bank loans would finance separate lists of goods
and services. Equipment and machinery as well as related services for the
project would be supplied in 12 packages. The proposed Bank loan would fi-
nance: (i) the largest and most critical of these packages, i.e. the supply
of mechanical cement machinery and equipment, including engineering, super-
vision of erection and start-up, training and tecinical assistance; (ii)
consultancy services for bid evaluation; and (iii) interest and other charges
during constructioni on the Bank loan.  The Arab Fund loan would finance the
remaining eleven packages, comprising all complementary equipment including
the electrical works.
43.       To complete the financing plan in respect of the local currency
costs of the project, the Government has agreed to provide bE 12.1 million
(US$31 million) during the project implementation period in the form of
equity (Section 3.01(c) of the draft Loan Agreement). TCC is expected to
contribute US$2.1 million through internal cash generation. Moreover, the
Government has agreed to provide any additional resources which might be
needed to complete the ongoing investment programs and the project and
bring them into operation, whether the need for such additional funds is
caused by a cost overrun or a shortfall of cash generation; this obliga-
tion also includes the maintenance of an adequate level of working capital
equivalent to a current ratio of at least 1.5:1 (cf. para. 49; Sections
3.01(a), 4.02 and 4.03 (ii) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Execution
44.       TCC will be responsible for project execution, under the general
supervision of GOBM and with the assistance of GOFI. TCC is capable of under-
taking this responsibility. GOFI will provide assistance, particularly during
the procurement stage, and GOBM will oversee construction and subsequent
operations. The main burden of project execution will however rest on TCC's
Project Department, recently established specifically for this purpose. TCC
has also agreed to appoint an experienced consultant firm to assist in the
technical evaluation of bids for major critical packages. Since the consult-
ants should be appointed before bids are received in February, retroactive fi-
nancing of up to US$100,000 is recommended for the consultancy services. The
main supplier of cement machinery and equipment will be responsible for timely
project completion and attainment of capacity, and furnish warranties for
performance efficiency. Civil works will be designed and construction super-
vised by an Egyptian firm with whom TCC has had previous experience. Civil
construction will be carried out by local contractors who will work closely
with TCC's project team. This arrangement is considered satisfactory.



- 14 -
Employment and Training
45.       The present level of employment in the existing plant (about 2,050
persons) is high by European standards. However, given the low level of wages
in Egypt, the economics of the plant are not unduly affected by this. The
project will, however, improve TCC's overall labor productivity by about 40
percent. Satisfactory training and recruitment plans have already been pre-
pared in some detail by TCC. The main supplier of cement equipment will
provide training abroad on similar dry-process facilities for about 20 key
personnel during project execution and for two years thereafter. The remainder
of the operational staff will be trained locally in TCC's training facilities
and in its existing plant.
Procurement
46..      To ensure single responsitility for the implementation of the import-
ant cement machinery package by one contractor -- deemed imperative for the
success of the project -- this package, to be financed under the proposed
Bank loan, cannot be split further. It would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
While no Egyptian manufacturers would be qualified to bid directly for the
entire package, it is estimated that clearly defined equipment components
worth US$3.5 million equivalent, or about 10 percent of the total estimated
cost of this package, could be supplied from local sources. Therefore, in
order to give Egyptian equipment manufacturers an opportunity to supply items
for the project while maintaining the overall guarantee for the entire pack-
age from the main supplier, a 15 percent margin of preference, or the pre-
vailing import duty, whichever is lower, will be allowed for purposes of
bid evaluation in respect of clearly identified Egyptian components of for-
eign bids. Procurement of the remaining eleven bid packages financed by
the Arab Fund will also follow international competitive bidding (including
non-Bank member countries), under the regulations of the Arab League. The
Arab Fund has decided to accord a similar margin of preference for local
components in foreign bids to encourage domestic suppliers. Bids were in-
vited in July 1974, following a review of tender documents by the the Arab
Fund and the Bank, and are expected to be opened in February 1975. For the
major items, TCC will utilize a two stage bidding procedure: first, techni-
cal bids will be opened, analyzed and possibly modified to achieve reasonable
uniformity among them, and thereafter the original price bids, accompanied
where necessary by supplemental price bids to reflect technical changes, will
be opened (Schedule 1, para. 3, of the draft Project Agreement).
Disbursement
47.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against 100 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of imported items of equipment and the ex-factory costs
of any locally supplied components of the successful bid, and 100 percent of
the foreign exchange cost of consultant's services.
Ecology
48.       The project will be designed to meet standards comparable to those
of industrialized countries. It will include pollution control devices for



- 15 -
both existing and new facilities, costing over BE 1 million, to reduce the
amount of solid effluents -- the main environmental problem in cement plants
- to internationally acceptable levels. TCC has agreed to install and main-
-tain adequate pollution control facilities satisfactory to the Bank (Section
2.08 of the draft Project Agreement).
Financial Projections
49.       With the expansion, TCC's sales revenue is forecast to increase,
from bE 11.2 million (US$28.6 million) in 1974, to LE 18.3 million (US$46.7
million) in 1980, when the project reaches full production. Net profit after
taxes is projected to increase from BE 1 million in 1973 to bE 3.5 million in
1974, as a result of the price increase in March 1974 (see para. 30). TCC's
capitalization is sound and provides a good base for expansion. Although its
liquidity position is strained due to its previous investment programs, its
debt service coverage remains adequate. Agreement has been reached that TCC
will take all action within its powers in order to ensure that the ratio of
its current assets to current liabilities remain at or above 1.5:1 at all
times upon completion of the project, and that its net revenues in any fiscal
year shall not fall below 1.5 times the debt service requirements (Sections
4.03 (a) and 4.04 (c) of the draft Project Agreement). Furthermore, the Gov-
ernment has agreed that it will take steps to maintain TCC's current ratio
after completion of the project at 1.5:1, and not withdraw funds from TCC-other
than those withdrawals required by law -. if, as a result, the current ratio
would fall below this level (Section 4.03 of the draft Loan Agreement). More-
over, TCC has also agreed to obtain the Bank's prior concurrence before (i)
undertaking, during project implementation, any additional capital investments
in excess of UE 3.0 million annually; and (ii) borrowing, during the life
of the loan, additional long-term funds if its debt would exceed its equity
(Sections 4.04 (a) and (b) of the draft Project Agreement).
50.       Owing to the Government's policy of restraining domestic cement
prices to encourage reconstruction and its tax policies, the financial rate
of return of the project is relatively low. The project provides a financial
rate of return of 10.4 percent. Sensitivity tests carried out to determine
the effects of various alternatives on the financial rates of return indicate
that the likelihood of the return falling below 9 percent is low. Nevertheless,
considering the sound debt/equity position of TCC at this time, even a 9 percent
return would be acceptable and TCC is expected to remain in a sound financial
position under foreseeable circumstances.
Economic Benefits and Justification
51.       Given the Government's renewed focus on economic development, its
plans for reconstruction and development of the economy, Egypt is expected
to require large quantities of cement for the next several years. The proj-
ect is therefore crucial for the support of the country's development plans.
Without the project, Egypt would have to depend even more on imported cement
at higher prices, further straining the foreign exchange resources of the
country. The incremental economic rate of return of the project of about



- 16 -
18.9 percent is based on an expected long-term price (in 1974 prices) for im-
ported bagged cement of US$32 per ton c.i.f. (Egyptian port), with the same
price being assumed ex-factory at TCC, and a delivered fuel price of US$57.4
per ton. In the unlikely event that world cement prices were to drop as low
as the marginal cost of production, i.e. equal to about US$28/ton (at Egyptian
ports), the economic return of the project would be about 15 percent.
52.       The foreign exchange savings from the project would be of great
importance to the Egyptian economy. The net foreign exchange savings from
the project, in 1974 prices, would be over US$11 million per year, offsetting
its estimated foreign exchange cost in about 5 years at full production.
Transfer of technology is a further important aspect of the project, since
this will be the first dry-process plant operating within the country. The
experience gained from this project could be used in assisting to formulate,
design and implement other projects on the basis of this modern and economically
sound technology.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Tourah Cement Company and the
Bank, the Recommendation provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Arti-
cles of Agreement, and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed
loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
54.       Special features of the draft Loan and Project Agreements are refer-
red to in paras. 28, 30, 38, 41, 43, 46, 48 and 49 of this report.
55.       Conclusion of a loan agreement between the Arab Fund and TCC for
the provision of the remaining foreign exchange required for the project and
of a satisfactory Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and TCC
are conditions to the effectiveness of the proposed loan (Section 6.01 (b)
and (c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS iN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 181-UAR - Nile Delta Drainage Project; US$26 million Credit of April
17, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
In 1973 a revised implementation program was prepared, extending
this project until 1978, and the government agreed to take a number of actions
recommended by IDA to improve project performance and provide effective man-
agement. In February 1973, the National Drainage Development Authority (NDDA)
and the Egyptian General Authority for Drainage (EGAD) were merged in the
Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP) established by Presi-
dential Decree. A new Chairman and Vice Chairman for the Nile Delta and Upper
Egypt Drainage Projects were appointed and the staff reorganized and strengthened
by the appointment of additional qualified personnel. A panel of experts was
nominated to undertake project evaluation, and action is being taken to replace
the consultants who advise and assist the Authority on the implementation of
both the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt projects. The new Authority is actively
working on the arrangements for the maintenance of equipment and the storage
of spare parts and has drafted the terms and conditions under which project
equipment will be transferred to local contractors for construction of drain-
age works and for the manufacture of drainage tiles. Earlier this year, super-
vision missions expressed concern that sufficient local currency funds has not
been budgeted to keep project implementation up to the pace agreed in the
revised schedule; this matter was discussed with the Government in May and
again in September 1974, and a small supplementary allocation has been made
to permit continued implementation for the rest of 1974.
Cr. No. 284-UAR - Egyptian Railway Project; US$30 million Credit of February
9, 1972; Closing Date: (i) December 31, 1973, for track materials, loco-
motives and spare parts; and (ii) September 30, 1976, for signalling and
telecommunications equipment and installation.
The project is being implemented satisfactorily. Most of the pro-
curement contracts have been awarded and the bulk of the credit has been com-
mitted.
Cr. No. S-13-UAR - Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Engineering Project;
US$175,000 Credit of November 17, 1972; Closing Date: November 30, 1973.
This Credit was approved on November 7, 1972, and was declared
effective on June 15, 1973. It has been fully disbursed and subsequently
refinanced under Cr. 423 below.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 393-UAR - Upper Egypt Drainage Project; US$36 million Credit of June
8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Progress in implementing the project has been slow. A supervision
mission earlier this year reported insufficient budgeting of local currency
funds for the current fiscal year. The matter was taken up with the Govern-
ment, in May and again in September 1974 and a small supplementary allocation
was made to enable project implementation to continue. The schedule for work
in 1975 is satisfactory,
Cr. No. 412-UAR - Bank of Alexandria Project; US$15 million Credit of June 29,
1973; Closing Date: September 30 1977.
This Credit became effective on November 29, 1973. Since then, BOA
has approved several subprojects. As of November 1974, about $12.5 million of
the credit had been coTmmitted. The balance is expected to be conmnitted shortly.
Cr. No. 423-UAR - Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Project; US$18.5 million
Credit of July 30, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
This Credit became effective on February 15, 1974. A program for
retraining of displaced workers, prepared ny Fg'yrpt has been reviewed by IDA
and implementation will conmmence shortly. Prices of bids received in May 1974
for major equipment packages were much higher than expected, and the total
estimated foreign exchange cost is presently estimated at over $40 million.
At IDA's suggestion, the Government has been seeking the additional funds
required from other sources since the returns of the project to the economy
will still remain satisfactory as a result of the increase in cotton prices
since appraisal. In November, 1974, Saudi Arabia agreed to provide $23 mil-
lion to finance the cost overrun thus enabling implementation of the project
as appraised.  Awards for most of the major contracts will have been made
bv end of January, 1975.
Cr. No. 437-UAR - Population Project; US$5.0 million Credit of November 6,
1973; Closing Date: December 31 _1977.
This Credit was declared effective on Mslarch 25, 1974. The architects
have been appointed, and work is undenray on other elements of the project.
Cr. No. '-lS-U.AR - Talkha Urea Fertilizer Engineering Project; US$400,000
Credit of November 20, 1973; Closin Date: March 31, 1975.
This Credit was declared effective on April 24, 1974. Meanwhile, a
consulting firm, appointed as the technical advisors, did some of the work
covered by this credit and was paid by Egypt. The credit will be refinanced
under Cr. 484 below, when the latter is declared effective.

Cr. No. 484-UAR - Talkha II Fertilizer Project; US$20 million Credit of June
24, 1974; Closing Date: April 1, 1979.
This Credit was approved by the Executive Directors on June 18,
1974, and signed on June 24, 1974. Parliamentary ratification was completed
in early December 1974. The date of effectiveness was postponed for a second
time to January 23, 1975, to allow time for receipt of all the necessary
evidence for declaring the Credit effective. Meanwhile, negotiations are in
progress with the firm selected for the position of General Contractor.

Project Execution:       TCC, under the general supervision of GOBM and with
the assistance of GOFI, will be responsible for the
project execution. The supplier of the largest and
most critical item--the cement machinery and equip-
ment--is to provide detailed engineering of all cement
plant facilities and will bear the responsibility for
timely project completion, attainment of capacity,
performance efficiency and warranties; the supplier
will also provide technical assistance during project
execution and for two years thereafter. Civil en-
gineering construction and plant erection will be
carried out by TCC and/or other Egyptian firms.
Procurement:              The Bank-financed package will be procured through
international compe-itive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for procurement, following a
two-stage bidding procedure. While no Egyptian
manufacturers would qualify to bid directly for this
package there are some specific and clearly defined
components that could be supplied from local sources.



ANNEX III
Page 4 of 4 pages
In order to give local equipment manufacturers an
opportunity to supply items for the project while
preserving the comprehensive responsibility of the
single main supplier for the overall performance
of the cement plant, it is proposed that for pur-
poses of bid comparison, a preference of 15 percent
or the amount of customs duties, whichever is lower,
be accorded to clearly separated and identified
Egyptian components incorporated in the foreign
bids. Procurement of Arab Fund-financed packages
will also follow international (including non-Bank
member countries) competitive bidding under the
regulations of Arab League, and will accord a
similar margin of preference for local components
in foreign bids.
Consultants:              Several qualified international consulting firms have
been approached. A contract has been signed with
"Holderbank" Management & Consulting Ltd. to have
this firm provide assistance in technical bid evalua-
tion of the cement equipment and machinery package.
The contract is not yet in force and alternative
arrangements are still under consideration.
Estimated Economic
Rate of Return:         19 percent.
