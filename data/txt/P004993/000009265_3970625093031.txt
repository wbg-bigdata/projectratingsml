PROJECT COMPLETION REPOP-T
EGYPT - TOURAH CEMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
(LOAN 1085-EGT)
PREFACE
1.        This report covers the Tourah Cement Expansion Project supported
by Loan 1085-EGT. The Loan was made to the Arab Republic of Egypt and
onlent to the Tourah Cement Company (TCC). The Loan of US$40.0 million was
approved in February 1975. Of the total amount, 77Z was disbursed by the
end of FY78 (appraisal estimate of 100Z); full disbursement was delayed to
the third quarter of FY83 due to slow installation of the cement machinery
and related technical assistance.
2.        The project was identified in late 1972 and the Bank assisted in
its evolution, including the choice of process to be utilized. It was part
of an overall program to increase Egypt's cement production capacity from
about 4 to 8 million tpy by the early 1980s to substitute for imports and
to meet expected future demand. The project was appraised in June/July
1974 jointly with the Arab Fund. Negotiations were held in Washington in
December 1974.
3.        The main text of the Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared
by the Bank staff based on a preliminary report prepared by TCC, review of
progress reports, Bank supervision reports and other data gathered during
the PCR mission. Its findings and conclusions are judged to reflect
performance accurately under the project. No comments were received from
the Borrower.
4.        Th,is project was not audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLErION REPORT
EGYPT - TOURAR CEMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
(IAN 1085-EGT)
HIGHLIGHTS
(i)       The Tourah Cment Expansion Project was completed about five
years behind schedule, mainly as a result of delays in civil works. The
project cost, including extensive rehabilitation of the existing plant,
incremental working capital at start-up and interest during construction
was estimated at US$93 million with a foreign exchange component of
US$60 million, of which the Bank loan financed US$40 million and the Arab
Fund the remainder. The original closing date of June 30, 1979 was
extended twice to December 31, 1982 and the loan was fully disbursed by
March 31, 1983 (paras. 3.09, 3.19).-
(ii)      The production units have reached their rated output aithout
trouble and the new production line has been producing at 60% of capacity
during the first year of operation as anticipated during appraisal. The
re-estimated financial and economic rates of return of the project came out
at 6.5Z and 10.7Z, respectively, compared to IIZ and 18% at appraisal- The
main reason for these significant reductions especially the financial rate
of return is partly explained by the extensive delay of project completion
and partly by the Government of Egypt (GOE) regulated cement sales prices,
which are set at well below world market prices. Although a part of the
effect of such low output prices is offset by low input prices for energy
(fuel oil and electricity), also controlled by the Government, cement sales
prices have not kept up with the recent doubling of energy prices, which
nonetheless continues to be below world market prices. Egypt experienced a
construction boom at the time of project implementation and the
construction industry was unable to meet the demand in an efficient
manner. Consequently most construction projects in Egypt experienced
lengthy delays, and the civil works contractor for the TCC project failed
to perform according to contract. The delay and inflation caused the
project cost to increase from LE 32.137 million (estimate) to
LE 57.082 million, an increase of 78%. Because of devaluation of the
Egyptian pound the dollar value of the project decreased from
US$81.94 million to US$76.11 million. The increase in local costs was
financed by GOE as equity. No increases were incurred in the foreign cost
component (paras. 4.02, 4.20, 4.21).
(iii)     The main lesson to be learned from the Tourah Cement Expansion
Project was for the Bank to focus more on the civil works project
component. In subsequent projects only contractors and consultants who
could demonstrate that they had the experience, personnel, and equipment
for performing the job were retained and joint ventures between foreign and
local companies have been encouraged (para. 5.05).



Uiv)      On the whole, considering the period of rapid economic growth,
boom in construction activity in the oil exporting Arab countries and
the resulting transfer of skilled personnel from Egypt to neighboring
countries, the project ohculd be counted as having been relatively
successful in delivering its overall objectlves. The 3ank's role In
influencing project design has resulted in an energy-efficient plant that
will provide benefits to the Egyptian economy. The improvement of
managerial skills at TCC will be invaluable to future development of the
cement sector (para. 5.01).



PROJECT C0MPLETION REPORT
EGYPT - TOURAR CEIENT EXPANSION PROJECT
(LOAN 1085-Er)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the Tourah Cement Expansion Project supported
by Loan 1085-EGT. The loan was made to the Arab Republic of Egypt and
onlent to the Tourah Cement Company (TCC). The Bank loan helped finance a
part of the foreign exchange requirements of an expansion of TCC cement
production capacity by 700,000 tons per year (tpy) from 1.35 million to
2.05 million tpy through the use of dry process technology and
rehabilitation of the existing plant. The project was cofinanced with the
Arab Fund. The two external loans (Bank and Arab Fund) financed all
equipment and cement machinery including engineering, erection, start-up
supervision, training and technical assistance and services of foreign
consultants.
1.02      The project was identified in 1972. The initial planning and
definition of the project was done jointly by TCC and the General
Organization for Industrialization (GOFI) and the General Organization for
Building Materials and Ceramics (GOBM). The project concept was initially
based on wet process as utilized in the existing plant, partly because TCC
was familiar with that process and partly because it would have made it
easier to integrate the new production line with the existing plant. As
oil prices began to increase rapidly in 1973-74, Bank missions strongly
suggested that dry process operation be considered. Various studies were
carried out in order to determine cost/benefit ratios for the two types of
processes. The Bank was instrumental in convincing TCC, GOFI and GOBM that
this long-term investment required the latest technology in order to be
economically viable. As a result, the concept was finally changed to the
dry process, and project appraisal was carried out jointly with the Arab
Fund in June/Julv 1974.
1.03      TCC prepared a project completion report in September 1983.  As
most of the former senior project managers had left TCC, the report was not
as comprehensive as would have been desirable, particularl, as regards the
analysis of delays in project implementation and of cost overruns. This
report is based on the TCC report, a review of progress reports, Bank
supervision reports and other data gathered during a PCR mission in
November 1983.

II. TOURAH PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY - THE BENEFICIARY
A. Ownership and Control
2.01      TCC was founded in 1927 as a private company with a share capital
of LE 200,000, owned principally by Swiss and Egyptian Interests.
Operations commenced in 1929 with an initial capacity of 100,000 tpy of
cement. In 1961, TCC, and other cement companies in Egypt were
nationalized.  Through the end of 1975, TCC was wholly owned by the
Government through GOBM. On January 1, 1976, control of To;rah. and other
cement companies passed directly to the Ministry of Housing and
Reconstruction (MOHR). The Government's equity share rose from
LE 2,230,608 at end-1975 to LE 48,462,000 at the end of FY82/83 (June 30,
1983).
B. Facilities
2.02      The Tourah cement plant is located on the east bank of the Nile,
at Tourah El Asmand, 15 km south of Cairo. At the time-of appraisal the
existing plant consisted of two clusters of wet process operating units,
the -old section" dating from 1929 to 1948 with a capacity of 560,000 tpy,
and the  new section  from 1956-67 with a capacity of 740,000 tpy.
C. Organization and Management
2.03      TCC's Board of Directors consists of nine members; the chairman
and four senior managers are appointed directly by the President of the
Republic and serve with four labor representatives who are elected for a
period of four years. Major policy decisions, such as the establishment of
new plants, pricing of inputs and outputs, are irde at a high level in the
Government with cement company managers participating only to a limiced
extent. TCC management, therefore, ehas not been ir a position to operate
the company freely. Management incentives are inadequate despite the
establishment of a bonus system and subsequent improvements made to it by
TCC in the 1970s. The present organization of TCC is shown in Annex 1-1.
D. Financial Position at Appraisal
2.04      At the time cf appraisal, TCC was operating at about 95%
capacity, despite the aging plant, difficulties in obtaining spare parts
and other factors beyond the company's control. Its financial performance
over the four-year period prior to appraisal (i.e., 1969-73) was
satisfactory and improving. Net profit as percent of average net fixed
assets had risen from 12.2% to 16.2% between 1969/70 and 1973. There was
practically no long-term debt on TCC's books, but TCC's liquidity position
was strained due to its financing of new investments out of internal cash
generation. The company had been borrowing short-term to cover its cash
needs. In view of this strained cash position, the project financing plan
assumed that a substantial part of TCC's internal cash generation would be
used to pay off commercial bank overdrafts and build up working capital.

III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION ANqD IHPLEMENTATION
A. Project Background and Description
3.01      The project was part of an overall program of increasing the
cement production capacity in Egypt from 4 million tpy in 1973 to about
8 million tpy by 1980 by increasing the capacity at three existing cement
plants and by constructing four new plants.
3.02      The project was designed to add 0.7 1llion tpy of capacity to
the existing plant increasing the total capacity to 2.05 million tpy. The
project integrated the new units into the existing plant by installing the
new production units adjacent to the unit3 in the -new sectionu of the
existing plant. The old and new units could operate independently and the
project was conceived and designed in such a way as not to cause major
downtime of tie existing plant. This objective was largely achieved. As a
result of the integrated approach, less than 100 operating staff were added
for the new production line.
3.03      Apart from adding to the domestic production capacity, the
project also pioneered the application of modern dry process technology.
The new TCC production line was the first in Egypt to operate a preheater,
precalciner kiln. The specific fuel consumption of the new line is
0.09 tons of oil/ton of clinker, which is only 56% of the specific fuel
consumption of the existing wet process kilns (0.162 tons of oil/ton of
clinker).
3.04      The technical project design was broad and comprehensive.  The
overall production logistics of the combined plant were analyzed and
considered in -le engine--ing. Modern dust collection equipment was
piovided for AA L new pr. ::action units as well as f-r - n'lmber of  mnits in
the old plant which were deficient in emission control.
3.05      The new equipment comprised:  a 2,000 ton per day (tpd)
preheater, precalciner kiln with two dry rawmills and associated blending
and arorage facilities for dry kiln feed, three cement mills, additional
cement storage silos and cement packing machines and a Nile cement terminal
for shipping of bagged cement by barge.
3.06      With the higher production capacity the demand for raw materials
increased by 50%, and the project provided the components required to boost
capacity of quarries, raw material crushers and belt conveyers
accordingly. Additional mobile equipment as well as new crushers were
added in both limestone and clay quarries.
3.07      Other project components provided equipment for the chemical
laboratory and the electrical and mechanical work shops, and electrostatic
precipitators for a kiln dating from 1967 and some of the old mills. A
new 30 MVA substation was installed together with modern motor control
centers serving both the new and the existing plant.

3.08      The project also contained a component for training and technical
assistance. Twenty of TCC's operating personnel were trained abroad by the
main equipment supplier, and a technical assistance team was retained both
for start-up and fGr continued operating assistance. Two sector-wide
issues were tied to the project under the loan covenants:
(a) preparation of a Master Pl.n for the development of cement
industry capacity (para 3.13); and
(b) preparation of a country-wide cement distribution study and an
action plan to be inplemented subsequently.
B. Project Implementation
3.09      The chart shown in Annex 2 shows projected and actual
implementation schedules. The projected kiln start-up and commissioning
date was October 1977 and the actual start-up date was August 1982
corresponding to a delay of 58 months. Many factors contributed to this
extensive delay (which was common in Egypt during the years of project
execution). Delays in civil works and erection were the main cause for the
overall delay in plant startup. Some of the contributing factors are
discussed below.
3.10      Engineering Drawings.  When the equipment was grouped into bid
packages, the electrical motors, controls and equipment (package E) was
separated from the main machinery package (package D). Tendering of
package E was delayed causing a minor delay in preparation of mechanical
drawings which in turn delayed preparation of construction drawings.
3.11      Civil Works.  The civil works were about 9 months late in
starting, because GOE failed to provide the necessary local funds during
1976 and the early part of 1977. The major part of the subsequent delays
can largely be attributed to the civil contractor's performance. Based on
the quarterly progress reports, periodic Bank supervision reports, TCC's
project completion report and various interviews, the following reasons can
be listed for the poor performance of the main civil works contractor:
(a) the contractor was not experienced with this type of large
industrial project;
(b) the project coincided with a boom in construction activity
following the 1973 war. The contractor took on mauy other
contracts and spread his executive and supervisory personnel too
thinly;
(c) according to Egyptian customs at that time the civil works
contract required a downpayment of 30% of the contract amount
prior to mobilization. Such a contract feature provides more
incentive to the contractor to sign up new contracts with others
rather than to complete the existing jobs on time;



-5-
(d) TCC was unable to make the contractor perform according to
contract, and the important negotiations regarding the civil
works contract took place at higher ministerial and governmental
levels with no long-lasting effect on contractors' performance
relating to TCC;
te) initially neither the civil works contractor nor the erection
contractor owned much mechanized construction equipment. Long
delays were experienced before some construction equipment was
procured under Arab Fund financing and loaned to the contractors;
(f) field supervision appears to have been slack. It was reported
that many newly poured reinforced concrete foundations had to be
partially demolished and then repoured because of noncompliance
with drawings; and
(g) in addition to the above organizational problems there were
delays caused by unexpected but not uncommDn factors relating to
soil conditions. In two excavaticn areas, bigher than expected
groundwater levels led to major changes in design. In other
areas soil bearing conditions were less favorable than first
assumed and it became necessary to pile under some of the silo
foundations.
3.12      The table below shows how the project completion date receded
with every supervision mission. Successive Bank missions arranged meetings
among high Government officials, TCC and the contractor in order to
accelerate the project with only limited success. As mentioned many large
construction projects during this period suffered similar problems.

3.13      As far as the sector-wide studies were concerned (para 3.08), the
Government did carry out the study of production, distribution and



-6-
marketing facilities in the cement sector in order to prepare a
comprehensive investment program. The study was submitted for Bank review
about two years behind schedule. A strategy for investment in this sector
was never formalized despite continued efforts on the part of Bank
supervision missions to open a dialogue on sector wide investment and
pricing issues. GOE did not respond in a positive manner and failed to
evolve a comprehensive investment strategy. On the other hand, events,
particularly the rapid growth of demand and the far slower than forecast
buildup of capacity, somewhat overshadowed the initial urgency of preparing
a comprehensive investment program to avoid over capacity in the cement
sector.
C. Procurement
3.14      In order to ensure compatibility between the production units and
the associated material handling systems and to obtain an overall
performance guarantee all the main cement production machinery was grouped
into one large package (package D, excluding major electrical motors, but
lncluding some training and supervision of erection) which was financed by
the Bank. The remainder of the foreign equipment (financed by the Arab
fund) was divided into 11 packages. Civil works and erection were financed
by local funds and procured under LCB. Tendering of package D was done
under a two-stage ICB. Two major equipment suppliers were disqualified on
technical grounds and protested the decision which was upheld in a special
review meeting with a Bank mission attending. The table below shows
procurement amounts in US$ by country of origin. Denmark was the main
country of origin accounting for 82Z of the total international procurement
under the project.

D. Project Supervision and Management
3.15      TCC worked closely vith GOFI and GOBK during project
preparation. A first feasibility study, based on the wet process, was
prepared In 1973. When the decision was finally made In April 1974 to
utilize the dry process, a second feasibility study was prepared and joint
Bank/Arab Fund appraisal took place June-July 1974. TCC had never operated
a dry process plant and the appraisal team urged TCC to retain a consultant
experienced in dry process operation. In December 1974 the Swiss
consultant company, Holderbank Management and Consulting Ltd (HMC) was
retained to assist in the following areas: preparation of technical
specifications for the tenders, evaluation of tenders, contract
negotiations and i: pection of equipment prior to shipment. The
cooperation between Z4C, TCC and the governmental agencies was a success
and a joint venture consulting company, Arab Swiss Engineering Company
(ASEC) was established, with HMC and the four Egyptian cement companies as
shareholders. HMC assigned its contract to the new company.
3.16      When selection of a civil works consultant was discussed the Bank
urged TCC to retain an experienced foreign company to be financed by a
technical assistance loan. TCC, however, retained a local company with
responsibility for construction drawings and field inspection of civil
construction. Tenders on the main equipment package were received in April
1975 and the successful bidder, F.L. Smidth of Denmark (FLS) was selected
in October 1975. TCC established a project team headed by a project
manager and managed the project with the help of the Egyptian civil
consultant as shown in Annex 1-2. The main equipment supplier was
responsible for collecting and coordinating mechanical and electrical
technical data and for providing mechanical engineering drawings, which
were then converted into construction drawings by the civil consultant.
TCC, assisted by HMC, was responsible for procurement. For civil works
contract and the mechanical and electrical erection contracts the Bank
urged TCC to utilize joint ventures between experienced foreign companies
and Egyptian companies. However, TCC felt compell-"4 nvgr Egyptian law to
award these coarracts tc ,ocal companies.
E. Project Costs and Financing
3.17      Total project costs excluding interest during construction and
incremental working capital (including contingencies) were estimated at
LE 32.1 million (US$81.9 million equivalent) at appraisal. At project
completion the final project cost was LE 57.1 million (US$76.1 million
equivalent). During this time span the Egyptian pound was devalued by
48%. An analysis of the appraisal vs. actual costs is summarized in the
table below and detailed in Annex 3-1.

Note:  Exchange Rate at Appraisal:  LE 0.3922 = US$1; (FY83):  LE 0.75 =
US$1. The exchange rate of LE 0.75/US$1 was used by TCC to convert
total capital costs to US$. Central Bank rate is LE 0.8/US$l.
3.18      The capital cost analysis (Annex 3-3) shows that the project had
a cost overrun of 77.6% on the total cost expressed in Egyptian pounds,
while expressed in US$ there is an underrun of 7% (48Z devaluation of the
Egyptian pound). The foreign costs amounted to approximately $52.4 million
out of which the Bank disbursed $34.5 million (exclusive of IDC).  The
major overruns are in civil works and buildings (61.5%), installation and
erection (48.6%), and in pre-operating and consulting expenses (223.6%).
Most of these overruns are due to the delay in project implementation and
the gradual inflation in construction costs. Some overruns were due to
change in scope such as for instance an LE 2.5 million supplementary
payment to the civil contractor for change in design caused by unexpected
soil conditions. The information provided by TCC is not detailed enough to
permit a more thorough analysis. The Bank loan and the loan from the Arab
Fund financed all foreign expenditure including IDC. (After disbursement
of $17.9 million from the Arab Fund loan the reainder of the loan was
cancelled in 1978 because of the Arab League boycott). The required
additional local currency investment was provided by GOE.

F. Disbursement
3.20      Because of the delays in project execution, disbursement of the
Bank loan took place nearly 3 years later than estimated at appraisal, and
over a much longer period of time due to the slow installation of the
cement machinery.

IV. PROJECT OPERATION
A. Production
4.01      Technically the new production units meet the design criteria
for production rates and energy efficiency. During the guarantee test in
December 1982 the kiln produced 2,172 tpd at 853 kcalfkg (guarantee
2,000 tpd at 845 kcal/kg), and the various mills, crushers and conveying
equipment all meet design requirements. Minor mechanical problems, which
were encountered initially (cement pumps and clinker cooler), have been
resolved.
4.02      On a sustained basis during the first year of operation, the new
production line has operated at approximately 60Z of rated output as
projected in the appraisal. The plant is short of skilled personnel and
certain areas of the plant such as the electrostatic precipitators, do not
receive the necessary maintenance. TCC in agreement with the Bank's views
has retained the services of a technical assistance team from F.L. Smidth
comprising 14 people for two years and expects that six specialists will be
needed for at least two more years.
4.03      The issues of training of personnel and incentive programs
designed to retain skilled personnel have repeatedly been brought to the
attention of GOE by successive Bank missions. The last supervision learned
that GOE and MOHR had conducted negotiations with HHC regarding training
services and the establishment of a permanent training center, but
apparently no decision has yet been made. TCC-s record of industrial
safety was marred in 1982, when an accident in one kiln during routine



- 11 -
maintenance claimed the lives of a namber of workers. However, TCC's
overall industrial safety is on average better than other industrial
enterprises in Egypt.
B. The Domestic Cemnt Market
4.04      At appraisal, the Egyptian cement market was forecast to grow at
a remarkable average rate of 11.3% a year between 1974 and 1984. In
practice, the demand grew even more rapidly from 3.07 million tons in 1974
to 8.74 million tons at end 1982 corresponding to a growth of 14% p.a. At
the same time, the appraisal bad forecast a growth of 11.5% in domestic
production between 1974 and 1982 (from 3.5 million tons to 8.3 million
tons based on project implementation schedules considered reasonable for
countries similar to Egypt). However, although nearly 80% of the planned
expansions were implemented during this period, albeit with significant
delays, the new production lines have failed as yet to reach rated
capacity, and actual domestic production has risen only at about 1.8Z a
year, from 3.26 million tons in 1974 to 3.77 million tons at end 1982.
These new units are expected to enter into commercial operation within 1-2
years.
4.05      As a result of this slow increase in domestic production, cement
imports, which were forecast to cease by 1977, increased dramatically
between 1975 and 1982 (from 0.2 million tons to 5.8 million tons), as the
rapidly increasing demand outstripped domestic production. TCC's share of
domestic production had also been forecast to drop from 33% in 1974 to
about 25% by 1982/83. Because of the inability of the other new production
lines to obtain rated output, TCC at end 1982 had retained its 33% share.
However, as the new plants will come on stream, TCC's share is expected to
fall to the 25% level by end 1984/1985.
4.06      The variations of domestic demand and production, as well as
TCC's estimated and actual production levels ar- detailed in Annex 4-1.
TCC operated at 67% to 94% of rated capacity at the existing plant, and at
approximately 60% of capacity during the first year of operation with the
new oroduction li^.
- Prices and Production Costs
4.07      The Government controls cement prices under a two-tier pricing
system, with a low price for public sector consumption and a higher one for
the private market. The recent evolution of public sector cement prices is
shown in the following table. The present ex-plant sales price for bagged
ordinary Portland cement (O.P.C.) is LE 38.5 of which, the net revenue for
the old production lines is LE 21 and the net revenue for the new
production line is LE 31.

a/ Exchange rate for importers: LE 1.15 - 1.20 = US$1.
At present, except for the Suez Cement Company, just coming on stream, no
other privately owned cement plants are in operation and the consequent
pricing strategy for the private sector producers has not evolved.
However, it is likely that, due to the higher energy costs paid by the
private sector, cement prices will be set closer to the actual production
cost. The private sector is presently serviced mainly by licensed
importers who have set up bulk terminals at Alexandria, Port Said and
Suez. The Egypt Cement Office (ECO) imports some cement under some
bilateral arrangements and some through direct international competitive
bidding. ECO and the private importers have imported about 2.5-3 million
tons in the past two or three years. The substantial differential between
the private sector market price and the official price continues to exist
because of the large gap between domestic demand and production, that,
contrary to earlier expectation at appraisal, has continued to grow.

4.10       The current production costs listed in the above table are based
on prices submitted by TCC.  The allocation of labor and administrative
costs between existing and new production lines was modified in order to
reflect the allocation applied in the appraisal report.
4.11       The current manufacturing costs of both old and new production
lines is less than expected at appraisal. The following conclusions and
;-_.u.ents derive from the tablL:
(a)  Fuel and energy per ton of cement, subsidized by G0O  (even though
doubled recently from LE 7.5 per ton of mazut to LE 15.0 and
power from LE 0.09 per kWh to LE 0.14 per kWh), has gone down in
real terms (34% for the existing line and 31% for the new line
from costs estimated at appraisal). Similar reductions were
experienced for the power cost component (reduction of 43% for
the existing line and 47% for the new line from costs estimated
at appraisal).
(b)  The cost of paper bags have not gone up as anticipated at
appraisal. However any cost increases in paper will not affect
the profitability of the company, since under the present pricing
system, any such increase will be passed onto the consumer.
(c)  Cost of miscellaneous materials and supplies, unsubsidized and
mostly imported, has increased by about 19% over the appraisal
figure.



- 14 -
(d) TCC-s labor rates have increased sharply expressed as cost per
ton of cement, from appraisal. This is partly attributed to the
bonus system introduced in the late 1970s (paras 4.13 and 4.14).
Labor costs have increased by 65% for the existing line and 196%
for the new line (difference due to the arbitrary allocation of
total plant labor costs).
4.12      Total 1982/83 cost, including depreciation and financial charges,
have been estimated by TCC as follows:
Total Production Cost Per Ton TCC
(in LE)
Existing Line Expansion
Variable Costs (Para 4.10)          15.7          10.56
Depreciation                         2.05         10.55
Interest Charges                     2.00          5.50
Total                          19.75         26.61
Current Exfactory Cement Prices:   21.0           31.0
Source: TCC modified by Bank staff.
The new line shows a higher total cost due to the high financial charges
amortized over the incremental production base. Profit margins in prior
years for existing lines had steadily eroded as the direct costs have been
steadily increasing without matching increases in the ex-plant sales price.
With the .;-ent cement price increase of LE 21/ton for existing lines and
LE 31/ton for the expansion units TCC should be in a much better position
to cover their operating costs and reach a moderate level of profitability.
D. Labor and Training
4.13      TCC-s total staff has remained more or less constant, around
2,500 including personnel for the company's lime plant, paper bag plant and
workshops. The expansion project is estimated to have added around 100
persons to the staff. Throughout the project-s existence TCC was plagued
by resignation of key staff. The boom in the neighboring Arab states such
as Saudi Arabia and Iraq attracted a considerable number of Egyptian
engineers and skilled workers and TCC felt the impact. In 1971, the
Government permitted the cement companies to set up an incentive system
based on production volume to retain key personnel. Initially it was
ineffective.  After modification in 1978 it now provides a bonus of 40Z of
base pay at 70% of production target rising to a maximum of 80% of base pay
at 952 of the production target. In FY82/83, the average bonus amounted to
73.2% of base pay. The effectiveness of tnis bonus system is evident in
results. Total staff turnover, which had reached 10% by 1977, is now down
to about 5% while the number of key staff resigning has dropped from 144 in
1979 to an estimated 49 in 1982.



- 15 -
4.14      The evolution of labor costs follows the evolution of the bonus
system. Up to 1978, the wage bill rose very slowly to LE 1.8 million from
LE 1.1 million in 1974. From 1978, the rise has been dramatic from
LE 1.8 million to LE 5.2 million in 1982/83. Most of this rise can be
attributed to the bonus and Incentive system.
E. Ecological Considerations
4.15      The project incorporated Installation of electrostatic
precipitators to clean the kiln exhaust gases. The most recent supervision
missions observed that most of the electrostatic precipitators did not
function properly. Plant management explained that the electrostatic
precipitators were functioning as per design and that the excessive dust
concentration observed in the gases was caused by malfunction in the
material handling equipment removing the collected dust from the
precipitators. This malfunction must be ascribed to lack of proper
maintenance. The plant has not had any problems with liquid effluents.
F. Financial Perfor^mce and Rate of Return
4.16      TCC's financial performance over the past decade has been
conditioned by the price controls in the cement industry. Ex-plant sales
prices have not followed the soaring production costs and profit margins
have been reduced substantially (para 4.12). TCC-s gross operating profit
as percent of sales varied between 24-40Z. In FY82/83 it was 35.3Z. The
net operating profit has been reduced significantly as sales and
administrative overhead, depreciation and other charges have mounted
rapidly between 1974 and 1982. The net operating profit was around 14-16Z
of sales in the mid 1970s and fell to a uegative 4% in FY81/82. In
FY82/83 it was 3.3%.
4.17      TCC-s historica- income statements are detailed in Annex 4-2 and
summarized for key years below.

The main reasons for the substantial increase in operating expenses have
been discussed earlier (para 4.12). Depreciation provisions increased from
LE 2.3 million in 1979 to LE 4.367 million in 1982/83, with only a slight
increase in production and sales levels. Administration and other expenses
increased from LE 1.0 million to LE 2.872 million over the same period.
Despite frequent requests TCC has not elaborated on the reasons for this
large increase. Annex 4-2 also compares the appraisal estimates with
actual results.
4.18      TCC's audited Balance Sheets for key years are summarized below
and detailed in Annex 4-3.

4.19      TCC-s financial position at the end of the project should be
considered as barely satisfactory. The current ratio has deteriorated over
the last few years and TCC has a high level of accounts payable. No
explanations for this situation have been provided in TCC-s financial
s_atesents.  -Lis contrasts with the current ratio of 1.5 stipulated in the
financial coveuants. It is likely that payments to construction and
suppliers on TCC-s share of the projec. costs and other expansion programs
constitute the main reasons for this inordinately high level of accounts
payable. TCC-s Bank overdraft of LE 1.3 million in 1974 increased to
LE 14.6 million at the end of FY82/83. Long term debt increased from
LE 0.37 million in 1974 to LE 61.64 million in July 1983. The ratio of
long term debt to equity went from 4:96 in 1974 to 51:49 in FY83.
4.20      The incremental financial rate of return on the expansion project
was estimated at appraisal at 10.4Z in 1974 prices. The re-estimated
financial rate of return is 6.5%. Details of the calculations are shown as
Annex 4-4. The reasons for the lower financial rate of return is the
combination of delay of implementation and the low ex-plant sales price.
The incremental output has been held constant at 660,000 tons to be reached
in two years (i.e., 1986). Sales price is based on LE 31/ton (para 4.07).



- 18 -
G. Economic Rate of Return
4.21      In order to re-estimate the economic rate of return, a number of
adjustments to both input and output prices have been made to reflect their
value in terms of the foreign exchange costs to the Egyptian economy. The
adjustments are particularly important for fuel which is sold at a tighly
subsidized price to domestic consumers of electricity. As far as TCC's
output is concerned, the adjusted border price of cement has been used. On
the basis of the adjusted cost and benefit streams shown in Annex 4-5, the
economic rate of return of the expansion project works out to 10.7Z. This
compares to the appraisal estimate of 18%. The main assumptions are
indicated in Annex 4-5. The reasons for the lower economic rate of return
are the long delay in implementation of the project and the depressed world
market prices for cement.
V. THE BANK'S ROLE
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal and Supervision
Preparation and Appraisal ?hase
5.01      The Bank played a strong role during the early phase of project
preparation. To a great extent it was at the urging of the Bank that the
project design utilized the energy efficient dry process operation rather
than continuing the existing wet process operation. It was largely because
of TCC's decision that all subsequent cement projects in Egypt have relied
on dry process. Similarly, it was because of the Bank that TCC retained an
experienc-d foreign consultant to assist in the tendering process. The
appraisal, aI-L^ by a joint Bank-Arab Fund team, produced a project which
was based on a c.acise and practical design.
Procurement Phase
5.02      Because of the size and complexity of the project the Bank
recommended foreign participation in the areas of civil works consultant,
civil works contractor, and contractor for mechanical and electrical
installation. However, partly due to existing Egyptian laws, the Bank's
view was not accepted. In retrospect it appears that project
implementation would have been much faster had an experienced foreign
contractor been involved.
Implementation Phase
5.03      During the early phase of implementation, progress was slow.
During the initial two years following the date of effectiveness two
supervision missions were mounted, and the project fell behind during this
critical phase, mostly because GOE did not release the required funds.
However, subsequent Bank supervision insisted on improvements in



- 19 -
construction performance (para 3.12), but their impact in respect of
reducing implementation delays was nevertheless only marginal.
5.04      The Bank continued to stress the sector-wide issues throughout
the project phase. The study of cement production, marketing and
distribution facilities was delayed two years (para 3.13). Wh_n the study
was finally completed the danger of near term or medium term over-capacity
appeared remote and the Bank did not object to new investment projects
initiated by GOE. GOE seemed unable to agree on priorities for its cement
industry investments and a comprehensive investment program was never
formalized. However, in 1978 when TCC requested approval by the Bank (in
accordance with Section 4.04(a) of the Project Agreement) of a capacity
increase of 1.4 million tpy at Tourah, the Bank took a more active stand
and made its agreement to the expansion contingent upon the following
conditions:
(i) TCC management and technical staff were to be strengthened
through introduction of an appropriate incentive system.
(ii)  A strong implementation team would be established, assisted by
experienced consultants.
(iii) An equitable civil works contract had to be drafted.
(iv)  A proper financing plan for the project, based on a rational
pricing policy for cement, had to be secured.
This stand reflected the lessons already learned during implementation of
the Bank project and upon reflection TCC decided to postpone the proposed
expansion.
B. Lessons Learned
5.05      The basic problem encountered with this project was the extensive
delay in implementation. Obviously the size and complexity of the project
taxed the various entities involved beyond their capabilities, particularly
because it coincided with the building boom created by the ._onstruction.
The Bank's intervention imp-,oved the situation, but failed to accelerate it
sufficiently. The lessons learned have been applied in later projects,
particularly by having foreign companies participate as joint partners with
Egyptian companies in the various construction contracts. The experience
with the TCC project shows that the construction function is critical to
the outcome of the total project. For this reason despite not
participating directly in the financing of civil construction, the Bank
should ensure that the functions of project management and construction
supervision, are either covered by adequately qualified and experienced
staff of the beneficiary, or alternately are strengthened by a suitable
complement of consultants, external to the beneficiary. Any funding needed
for such assistance should be included in the financing plan for the
project a-. covered either by the beneficiary itself, the Government or the
Bank. ProLress reporting should include adequate information on critical



- 20 -
events and should provide regularly updated construction and plant erection
schedules to permit better and closer monitoring of all phases of project
implementation.
