3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
Context. The main objectives of the proposed fourth budget support grant was to assist Kosovo in the
implementation of a structural reform agenda aimed at enhancing medium-term macro-fiscal sustainability,
sustaining adequate public service delivery in the face of declining donor support, and promoting private
sector driven growth. The Economic Assistance Grant (EAG) IV provided US$5 million equivalent to the
Kosovo Consolidated Budget based on specific reforms in the areas of budget management and improving
the business environment.

In the area of budget management, the proposed grant was to support concrete measures towards
improving the transparency and accountability of public spending and the allocation of resources in line
with medium-term priorities. In the area of private sector development, the grant was to help improve the
business environment by making further progress on designing and implementing the private sector
regulatory framework, and taking first steps to improve the efficiency of publicly-owned enterprises.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The Grant objectives were not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
To meet the objective of the project the EAG IV components were as follows:

Component 1: Public Expenditure Management
         (i)     Strengthening Budget Management.
         (ii)    Improving Budget Execution and Accountability for Public Finances.

Component 2: Private Sector Development
         (i)     Strengthening Commercial Legislation.
         (ii)    Identifying and Reducing Constraints in the Business Environment.

3.4 Revised Components:
The Grant Components were not revised.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The operation was not selected for a quality at entry assessment by the Bank's Quality Assurance Group.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Context. The assessment of the Economic Assistance Grant IV operation should be set in the context of (i)
an exceptionally complex political situation that continues with limited progress toward a peaceful solution
of the final status of Kosovo, (ii) an increasing sense of frustration and recent eruptions of violence as a
result of this continuing uncertainty, (iii) weak institutional capacity and overlapping functions and
mandates as the development of nascent local institutions gets underway and takes over functions
previously undertaken by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).

In the context in which the EAG IV grant was designed, the priority for Kosovo was to put in place the
institutions and environment for a sustainable development agenda, based on private sector-led growth and
delivery of public services funded through locally-generated taxes. The EAG IV was designed to support
these objectives, primarily through ensuring the legal framework for an improved business environment and



                                                    - 2 -

public sector financial management was established. Remarkable progress has been made with establishing
a public sector capable of raising sufficient taxes, maintaining fiscal prudence and delivering services. At
the same time a legislative framework has been put in place to foster private-sector led growth. Progress
towards the main outcomes of the operation are therefore considered to be satisfactory. To date,
macroeconomic sustainability has been achieved and a strong revenue performance has resulted in a
sizeable cash reserve position that can protect public finances from short-term shocks. Increased public
resources have been dedicated to health and education provision and to capital expenditures to continue the
reconstruction effort. Given the successful drafting of legislation satisfactory to the Bank and a complex
process by which legislation was subsequently approved by both the UNMIK and the Provisional
Institutions of Self-Government (PSIG), the overall assessment of EAG IV's objective is considered
satisfactory.

The sustainability of progress is also deemed satsifactory. Key legal and policy reforms for sound fiscal
management and private sector led growth have so far continued to be implemented. However, the external
environment remains difficult. The final status of Kosovo remains unresolved and ethnic tensions in the
province remain high. Both these factors will continue to limit progress with private sector led growth.

Assessment. The main objectives ­ to enhance medium-term macro-fiscal sustainability, sustaining
adequate service delivery in the face of declining donor support and promoting private sector driven growth
remain the most important priorities for Kosovo. Progress toward these objectives has continued to be
made over the last 12 months. There is an emerging consensus among the international donor community,
UNMIK and the Kosovar authorities that the top priorities are (i) improved budget management ­
specifically working toward a medium-term fiscal framework, and (ii) private sector development: namely
privatization of socially-owned enterprises and restructuring of publicly-owned enterprises.

Progress toward these objectives has already been made. For example, passing the Law on Financial
Management and Accountability established the cornerstone legislation for sound budget management and
ensuring fiscal sustainability and the establishment of the Office of the Auditor-General ensures that the
policymakers are held accountable for the fiscal performance. Over the last year the government has
continued to accumulate a budget surplus. The main objective of macro-fiscal sustainability will require
that this surplus is spent on justifiable capital projects and not on unsustainable recurrent spending.

With respect to promoting private sector driven growth the PISG and UNMIK continue to take steps to put
in place a legal and policy environment for private sector businesses to make sound investment decisions.
While the external environment is particularly challenging for private sector driven growth every effort
should be made to improve the domestic environment especially for the small and medium sized enterprises.
Moving ahead with the privatization of state-owned enterprises, and restructuring of publicly-owned
enterprises has thus far proved extremely problematic and progress here has been very limited. To make
continued progress with this objective it will be important for the authorities to continue with these reforms.

4.2 Outputs by components:
The Fourth Economic Assistance Grant contained core conditions, upon which the IDA Board presentation
and disbursement were based, and other supporting policy actions. All agreed core conditions were
implemented successfully as prior actions before the EAG IV was taken to the Board. All supporting legal
and policy actions have also been achieved. In addition, there has continued to be progress in implementing
many of the medium-term outputs envisaged at the time the operation was approved by the Board.

Over the medium-term a set of benchmarks were agreed as the basis of monitoring continued progress, and
there has been some progress towards these benchmarks. However, there is still some way to go before



                                                       - 3 -

these reforms are translated into tangible improvements in either the management of the budget or an
improved business environment, and hence these remain the top priorities in Kosovo. In some policy areas,
the last 12 months has seen stagnation and indecision with respect to policy making and implementation,
amid increasing social and political tensions in Kosovo. Further progress toward both sets of priorities
requires close cooperation of the two administrations: UNMIK and the Provisional Institutions of Self
Government (PISG). A summary of progress made against the medium-term outcome benchmarks is
provided at Annex 1. These medium-term benchmarks were on the whole realistic but challenging for the
authorities to meet. The benchmarks have been objectively verified and monitored.

Component 1: Public Expenditure Management

         (i)     Strengthening Budget Management

All initial up front core conditions (in bold) and supporting legal and policy actions (non-bold text) were
met:

        l The 2003 Kosovo Consolidated Budget was approved by the SRSG on the advice of the
             EFC on 31 December 2002 (UNMIK/REG/2002/23).
        l The 2004-2006 macro and revenue forecasts and the budget calendar were produced and
             budget ceilings were discussed at the meeting of the Economic and Fiscal Council on 19
             March 2003, and subsequently agreed with the Special Representative of the UN
             Secretary General (SRSG) and launched on the 16 May 2003, to start the 2004 budget
             preparation process.
        l The Assembly adopted and the SRSG promulgated the Law on Public Financial Management
             and Accountability on 12 May 2003 (UNMIK/REG/2003/17).

-> The achievement of this component is rated satisfactory.

There has not been any policy reversal and the authorities have been continuing to manage the budget
process according to the Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability. The Law on Public
Financial Management and Accountability is the equivalent of an Organic Budget Law in Kosovo and is
the cornerstone of the budget process. It outlines the responsibilities and obligations of the institutions
involved in the budget process. The timing of the Law was such that it provided a legal basis and
clarification for the roles and responsibilities of the various institutions in the context of the handover of
responsibilities to the newly established Ministry of Economy and Finance from the former UNMIK
Central Fiscal Authority.

The budget ceilings were included in the budget circular for 2003, which started the budget preparation
process. While the medium-term budget framework continues to be produced as part of the budget
formulation process, Ministry of Economy and Finance priorities will continue to rest with the development
of a sound annual budget process rather than devoting additional resources to improving the MTBF at this
stage.

         (ii)    Improving Budget Execution and Accountability for Public Finances

The initial up front reform core condition with respect to establishing the Office of the Auditor-General was
met and there has been no policy reversal since the operation was approved by the Board. Progress with
drafting the law on public procurement was a supporting policy action (not core condition) and continued
beyond the disbursement of EAG IV.


                                                      - 4 -

        l The SRSG has promulgated a regulation establishing the Office of the Auditor General
             and the Audit Office, and the Audit Office has been established 4 October 2002
             (UNMIK/REG/2002/18).
        l In May 2003, the Government adopted and submitted to the Assembly a law on public
             procurement, satisfactory to IDA.

-> The achievement of this component is rated satisfactory.

The Officer of the Auditor-General and Audit Office were subsequently established once the regulation was
promulgated in October 2002. An international recruitment exercise was undertaken for the appointment of
the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General's appointment is being sponsored through an EAR-funded
program with a nominal commitment to establish the office for the initial three years of operation. Since her
appointment the Auditor-General has recruited a Deputy and 20 local trainee auditors who are currently
undergoing a training program.

The new Law on Public Procurement, which the Bank found acceptable in its draft form at the time of the
EAG IV Board discussion, was adopted by the Government in May 2003 and was submitted to the
Assembly shortly thereafter. The Law was eventually promulgated by the SRSG under UNMIK Regulation
No. 2004/3 dated February 9, 2004. It became effective on June 9, 2004 and has been an important
development in the budget process. Certain provisions of the previous procurement legislation contributed
to problems related to multi-annual appropriations.

Component 2: Private Sector Development

        (iii)    Strengthening Commercial Legislation

All prior core conditions under this sub-component have been met.

        l The Law on Liquidation and Reorganization of Legal Persons in Bankruptcy was passed
             by the Assembly on March 13, 2003 and promulgated by the SRSG on April 14, 2003.
             The draft law was reviewed by the World Bank's Legal Department using the Reports on
             the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) framework and the Bank's comments
             were reflected in the final draft of the law submitted to the Assembly.
        l The Law on Mortgages was adopted by the Assembly on October 17, 2002 and
             promulgated by the SRSG on December 20, 2002.
        l The Law on Establishment of an Immovable Property Rights Register was adopted by
             the Assembly on October 17, 2002 and promulgated by the SRSG on December 20, 2002,
             and supplementary legislation to render this law effective was adopted by the Assembly
             on June 26, 2003 and promulgated by the SRSG on August 18, 2003.

-> The achievement of this component is rated as satisfactory.

Promulgation of this legislation filled a fundamental gap in the commercial legal framework in Kosovo.
The Bankruptcy Law is compliant with EU standards and establishes the basis for the orderly exit or
reorganization of firms in distress and the protection of creditor rights. The Immovable Property Rights
Registry Law provides the basis for recognition of immovable property rights. The Mortgage Law
establishes the framework for commercial lending for residential and commercial property, and includes
voluntary provisions for non-judicial foreclosure procedures for commercial property. The latter two laws


                                                    - 5 -

are complementary: effective registration of immovable property rights is a prerequisite for the
development of mortgage lending.

        (iv)     Identifying and Reducing Constraints in the Business Environment

All prior actions under this sub-component have been met, they were not core conditions for the operation.

        l The new enterprise registration system was established under the Kosovo Business Registry
             (KBR), an independent body, and is now functioning satisfactorily; enterprises registered under
             the Interim Registry have been re-registered under the new system. The time for registration is
             about one day if done in Pristina. If done outside Pristina, the average time for registration is
             one week which is significantly faster than in any country in the region.
        l The Private Sector Advisory Group (PSAG) was established in January 2003. The PSAG is
             chaired by the Minister of Trade and Industry, and includes representatives from the private
             sector, municipal officials, and government ministries.

-> The achievement of this component is rated as satisfactory.

Implementation of the new enterprise registry played a significant role in simplifying and streamlining one
key aspect of entry requirements for enterprises. This system replaced the interim registry that was not
automated, required substantially longer to register enterprises and issue certificates, and did not have
capability to register trade names. Formation of the PSAG is an important step in establishing a dialogue
between the public and private sectors on key private sector development concerns problems and provides a
forum for development of consensus between these two parties on reform priorities.

        (v)      Reforming Public Utilities

The prior action under this sub-component was a core condition and has been met.

        l Operational and financial audits pursuant to terms of reference satisfactory to the
             Association, for the four principal publicly-owned enterprises (POEs): Korporata
             Energjetike e Kosovoes (KEK), Posts and Telecommunications Enterprise of Kosovo
             (PTK), Pristina Airport (PA), UNMIK Railways (UR) and each of the Water and Waste
             utilities, were completed in a manner satisfactory to the Association and were delivered to
             the Bank on June 2, 2003.

The achievement of this component is rated as satisfactory.

The audits of the POEs were a first and fundamental step in identifying and understanding the key financial
and operational problems facing Kosovo's infrastructure enterprises, several of which are recipients of
significant public funding. Prior to this, no audits had been undertaken for these entities, and thus no
benchmarks existed against which to measure their performance.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The Law No. 2003/2 on Public Financial Management and Accountability provides a comprehensive legal
basis for the public financial management (PFM) system. The local administrative capacity has grown
rapidly over the last 12 months. Whereas the Ministry of Economy and Finance and other central
authorities do still rely on support from international staff at management level, there are now local senior
staff working alongside internationals. It will however be at least another three years, if not longer, before
local capacity in key functions (e.g., the treasury functions in line ministries, external and internal audit)
will be able to operate without external support.

The partial transfer of budget management from the UNMIK to the PISG has resulted in a number of
institutional concerns, which continue to affect the management of the budget. For example, the SRSG has
the ultimate authority to appropriate public funds and has been able to do so on the basis of Administrative
Directives.

Substantial improvement has been made in the institutional environment for public procurement, with the
establishment, following the promulgation of the new Law on Public Procurement, of a new, independent
Public Procurement Agency (PPA), built upon the old Central Procurement Executive which had
previously been housed in the Ministry of Public Services, and of an independent Public Procurement
Regulatory Body (PPRB), which will take the lead on policy development and will undertake administrative
review of bidders complaints. The independent character of these two institutions is essential to their
effective functioning. Both the PPA and the PPRB are currently being strengthened by a 1.0 million
Technical Assistance program financed by the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR), which is
expected significantly to enhance their operational effectiveness.

With respect to the business registry, institutional capacity building was the primary focus of the PSD TA
component that supported establishment of the new registry.               Systems and procedures have been
institutionalized, and staff have received adequate training to operate and maintain the system in an
efficient and sustainable manner, as demonstrated by the recent massive re-registration exercise and recent
expansion of the capabilities of the registry (i.e, registration of trade names).

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
To a large extent the external environment has continued to exert an adverse influence over progress in
Kosovo. The results of recent Parliamentary elections in Serbia and Montenegro have caused increasing
concern among local authorities about their future prospects and political aspirations. At the same time
UNMIK has taken some time to resolve key legal questions, which has resulted in delays to key private
sector reforms, such as privatization. These factors are largely, although not entirely, outside the control of
the implementing agencies.

While all prior actions related to the private sector component were successfully completed, very little
progress against the outcome benchmarks for this component has been achieved. Failure to take these
actions in several instances is due to factors that are arguably outside of government control. With respect
to two medium-term actions associated with the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA), (i.e., preparation of
comprehensive restructuring strategies for the publicly-owned enterprises, and promulgation of a regulation
allowing for use rights of socially-owned land for SOEs subject to liquidation) no action has been taken.
This is largely the result of frequent staff changes within KTA management and continued policy
controversy over implementation of the privatization program that has distracted KTA management. KTA
has had three different Directors since preparation of the project began, and the position of head of the POE

department ­ responsible for development of the restructuring strategies - was vacant for about nine months
and is currently vacant again. These continuous disruptions within KTA have impeded the focus of staff on
the medium-term agenda.

With regard to the PSAG report to the Economic Policy Roundtable covering recommendations to improve
the business environment, delay in delivering the results of a World Bank-executed business environment
survey has prevented the PSAG from completing this action.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Considerable attention to achieving the core conditions and up-front policy actions was given by both the
UNMIK and the PISG authorities during the design, appraisal and negotiation of the project. The
commitment from UNMIK Pillar IV and the Ministry of Economy and Finance was such that rapid
progress on agreeing new and far reaching legislation was made in the project time frame.

With respect to the medium-term benchmarks we also find that progress was continued to be made on a
number of fronts. For example: implementing an annual budget cycle in line with the Law on Public
Financial Management and Accountability, establishing the Auditor-General's office, and recruiting
procurement offices.

Where progress has not been made we find that the following were within the control of the authorities:

   l No action has been taken to prepare a Law on Competition or a Law on Contracts.                     A new
         Company Law was drafted and submitted to the Assembly in January 2004, although this law is
         still under consideration by the Assembly.
   l No action has been taken on spatial plans.
   l No action has been taken to make publicly available the external audits of the public financial
         statements.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The limited capacity of newly formed government institutions is clearly a constraint in making rapid
progress with implementation. Progress with implementation should proceed at a pace that is sustainable
and where the capacity of the local institutions is built rather than maintain reliance on international staff
and consultants.

5.4 Costs and financing:
The grant provided the Kosovo balance of payment support in the amount of SDR 3.7 million (US$5
million equivalent).

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The probability of maintaining the achievements generated by implementing the up-front policy actions is
considered to be likely. While considerable attention will still need to made with respect to implementation
of the new legislation, building local capacity and improving institutions, all the up-front policy and
legislative actions are setting the foundation for work that is highly likely to continue under the commitment
of both PISG and UNMIK. The project was also designed with the technical assistance projects of other
donors in mind to provide complementary support to the reform agenda.

The International Development Association (IDA) remains committed to achieving the stated objectives of
the operation. In the new Transitional Support Strategy, two new technical assistance projects have been



                                                      - 8 -

included to assist with (i) improving the business climate and (ii) improving economic policy and public
financial management. These two operations will continue to support the Kosovo authorities in pursuit of
the objectives of the EAG IV operation and strengthen the sustainability of the reforms undertaken to date.

Under the IDA-financed Private Sector Development (PSD) TA project, training was provided to judges of
the Supreme and Commercial Courts on key aspects of the three laws included as prior actions under the
project (bankruptcy, mortgages and immovable property rights registry) and detailed commentaries on the
laws were prepared for the reference of judges. In addition, future technical assistance to the judiciary to
assist in strengthening enforcement of property, contract and creditor rights is expected to be included
under a FY05 project now under preparation.            This support will contribute to sustainability of
implementation of this set of legislation.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Not applicable. No transition arrangements needed since reforms carried through as regular operations.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank performance during project preparation was satisfactory. Risks and weaknesses related to the
context of the project were identified in the project documents. Aligning the policy actions with the
technical assistance projects of the World Bank and other donors assisted in taking sustainability
considerations into account.

If anything the project team were too optimistic about the timeframe included in the medium-term outcome
benchmarks. Unforeseen deterioration in the policy environment since Board approval is in part
attributable. Risks related to changes in key personnel and low capacity of institutions could have been
highlighted more prominently in the project documents and consideration to determining risk mitigation
strategies should have been considered.

7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision missions have maintained the dialogue with counterparts on the medium-term outcome
benchmarks and policies more generally that contribute to the overall objective of the grant. Furthermore,
during supervision the project team ensured that the sustainability of reforms should be taken into
consideration in the new Transitional Support Strategy and the design of future TA operations.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank Performance during all stages of the projects is considered satisfactory given the
implementation of all up-front policy actions, the progress made with medium-term benchmarks and in the
context of the adverse and deteriorating external environment and limited local capacity.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance during stages of project preparation was considered satisfactory. All efforts were
made by both UNMIK and PISG to ensure that all necessary regulations and institutional reforms were
undertaken prior to negotiations.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Borrower performance during implementation has been satisfactory. In a difficult operating environment
considerable progress with putting in place the core legislative framework is a necessary first step to



                                                    - 9 -

improving the policy enviornment and paving the way for private-sector led growth. Given the stage of
Kosovo's development and post-conflict needs, the borrower rightly focused on putting in place a
best-practice legal framework and subsequently working toward implementation and enforcement. With the
exception of specific actions outlined in the medium term benchmarks and reported in Section 5 and
summarized in Annex 1, progress with sustaining implementation over the medium term has also been
satisfactory.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Not applicable

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall borrower performace is considered satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

One of the positive lessons to learn from the success of EAG IV is the ability of a relatively small budget
support operation to generate significant leverage over policy and legislative reforms. This is largely a
result of the extremely good relationship that the project preparation team established with both the
UNMIK and PISG counterparts.

From this result there are a further two valuable lessons:

    l Changes in the key counterparts in UNMIK and the PISG can adversely impact the commitment to
         the medium-term policy agenda.
    l More generally, a one tranche budget support operation uses all of its leverage up front. Once the
         funds are disbursed into the budget the leverage over the medium-term agenda is weakened. In this
         case this was particularly so with no follow-up budget support operation in the pipeline which
         could have been linked to the medium-term benchmarks.

The first of these two is one that perhaps should have been highlighted in the Benefits and Risks section of
the program document. Despite changes in key personnel the Borrower with the support of the Bank have
continued to focused on the main policies required in the private sector development and public financial
management reforms, but progress has been slower than envisaged and subject to additional delays as a
result of the political environment.

The other lesson learned is the importance of linking key conditions in adjustment operations with the
technical assistance programs of other donors. In a number of cases, technical assistance provided by EAR,
USAID and DFID has assisted the authorities in achieving the overall objectives of this operation.

Since Kosovo has had budget surpluses in the past three years, a follow-up budget support operation would
have been difficult to justify. Therefore, the World Bank has responded with technical assistance operations
in critical reform areas to ensure sustainability of the reform agenda in both the private sector environment
and public financial management. Furthermore, this is an appropriate response in an environment where the
legislative framework is much improved but further progress is now hinged on successful implementation
of this environment ­ which is more difficult with an adjustment operation alone.
