APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone
Departnent's (BTT) First Five-Year (FY 1974-1978) Development Program,
of which the major part is the Second Telecommunications Project. BTT's
five-year program forms part of Bangladesh's First Five-Year Plan.
4-i.      Telecommunications services in Bangladesh are seriously defi-
cient in both quality and quantity and are unable to meet the domands of
business, industry and agriculture. At 0.07 telephone per 100 population,
the telephone density in Bangladesh is one of the lowest of the developing
countries. The effects of the hostilities have further aggravated the
situation with damage to the meager facilities, lack of maintenance and
a period when all construction ceased.
iii.      BTT's Five-Year Program aims at rehabilitating, improving and
expanding both local and long-distance services by increasing the capacity
of the local telephone system by 75,000 exchange lines (presently 65,000
lines) to permit 65,000 new connections, and by extending long-distance
facilities, including subscriber trunk dialling (STD), to new areas. The
estimated cost of the program is US$139 million including a foreign
exchange component of US$48 million.
iv.       The project identified for the proposed credit is the new works
in the last four years (FT 1975-1978) of the program and provides for the
expansion and automation of the local and long-distance telephone services,
and improvement in international services.
v.        The estimated cost of the project is US$87 million, including
a foreign exchange component of US$30 million. US$20 million of the
foreign costs would be covered by the proposed IDA credit and the remain-
ing US$10 million by bilateral and other sources of financing to be
arranged by Government.
vi.       Procureimnt of a*11 IDA-financed equipment by BTT would be
subject to international competitive bidding, except for local telephone
cables which would be procured from the Govermnent-owned local factory
whose production is satisfactory and prices competitive; IDA reimburse-
ment of the foreign exchange content of the cost of cables to BTT is
estimated at US$214 million, about 12% of the proposed credit. The local
switching equipment for the project will be procured from the Government-owned
switching factory without IDA financing.



- ii -
vii.      Government recognizes tlhe desirability of giving BrT greater
autonomy in order to allow it to operate along coumercial lines. During
negotiations agreement was reached that a Goverment Board with specific
powers and responsibilities to operate on the basis of sound financial
and management principles will be established by June 30, 1975, and that
outside assistance, acceptable to the ABsociation, will be retained by
December 31, 1974 to help implement important recommendations according
to a timetable for establishing a modern accounting system.
viii.     BTT's estimated past operating results, which were for only
FY 1973, showed an operating loss. However, with a substantial tariff
increase effective since July 1973 and the revenue from the new facil-
ities being provided under the program, future finances are shown to
progressively improve and become satisfactory. Forecasts show BTT
providing some 35% of its requiremnts from net internal sources and
earning a rate of raturn of 12% on average net plant in service by the
end of the project period in 1978.
ix.       The project is tochnically sound and economically justified.
The rate of return on the project investment is estimated at 21%. With
the assurances indicated in Chapter 7, the project forms a suitable
basis for an IDA credit of US$20 million equivalent.

APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELCO(QMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Governrent of the People's Republic of Bangladesh has asked
for IDA assistance in financing the foreign exchange cost of the five-year
telecommunications expansion program (FY 1974-1978) to be carried out by
the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Department (BTT). The borrower
would be the Government of Bangladesh and the beneficiary the BTT, a
Government department within the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone,
which is to be reorganized as a Government Board.
1.02      The project proposed for IDA financing is a four-year (July 1974
- June 1978) time slice of BTT's program, except for the ongoing works, and
is estimated to cost US$87 million, including a foreign exchange component
of US$30 million. An IDA credit of US$20 million is proposed. Government
is arranging bilateral and other financing for the remaining US$10 million
foreign exchange.
1.03      The project provides for expansion and improvement of local,
long-distance and international telephone services.
1.04      IDA has made foreign exchange available to the Bangladesh tele-
couxwnications sector under three previous credits. Credit 339-BD of
US$25 million for the coastal area rehabilitation and cyclone protection
project has a telecommunications component of US$5.6 million. Credit
343-BD for US$7.3 million, a purely telecomuunications credit, provides
for the financing and continuation of the projects scheduled in former
East Pakistan under Credit 145-PAK. Credit 3h5-BD of US$50 million for
reconstruction imports program includes a tolecommunications component
of US$0.5 million for import of essential equipment required for urgent
rehabilitation. After initial delays, progress is now being made on the
projects financed by each of the three credits.
1.05      This report is based on information provided by the BTT
Department and the findings of an appraisal mission consisting of
Messrs. J. H. Vance and D. F. D. Joshi, which visited Bangladesh in
October/November 1973. Mr. C. R. Dickenson was present during the
initial stages of the mission.



2. THE SECTOR
Economic Setting
2.01      The People's Republic of Bangladesh with an area of 55,126
sq. miles came into being in December 1971. It is bordered on the east,
north and west by India and on the south by the Bay of Bengal. The popu-
lation estimated at 75 million in 1973 is increasing at the rate of about
3% per annum; per capita income is about US$70. Approximately 94% of the
population lives in rural areas. Government has undertaken a Five-Year
Development Plan, FY 1974-1978, which aims at increasing GDP at an average
annual rate of 5.5% in real terms and improving the balance of payments by
import substitution and export promotion.
2.02      Export diversification is an important factor in the long-term
growth of the Bangladesh economy; this coupled with the wide geographical
dispersion of the main industries (jute, tea, leather, fishery products,
and paper and newsprint) places special demands on telecommunications to
aid the flow of information within the producing regions and between the
principal trading centers and ports. Similarly, the Administration with
its outlying Government districts has a substantial requiremnt for tele-
comaunications services. Bangladesh, however, has one of the lowest
telephone densities amongst the developing countries, and the situation
has been aggravated by the delay in the previous development program and
destruction of part of the existing system during the hostilities in 1971.
Sector Organization
2.03      The telecomuunications sector in Bangladesh comprises the
Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Department (BTT) and the two tele-
communication factories manufacturing telephone switching equipment and
cables (paragraph 2.05). The telecommunications sector functions under
the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone with a Secretary to the
Government within the Ministry having general supervision over the sector.
2.04      All public telecommunication services in Bangladesh are a state
monopoly with BTT having sole responsibility for developing, operating
and administering these services. As a government department, BTT has
insufficient autonomy for efficient management. For services, such as
accounting and financial arrangements, staff recruitment and civil works,
it is dependent upon other government departments whose policies may be
governed by considerations other than those of sound public utility prac-
tice. During negotiations it was agreed that BTT would be reorganised
as a Goveriment Board with an acceptable degree of autonomy (paragraphs
5.04 and 5.05).
2.05      A small telecommunication industry is functioning in Bangladesh
with two factories, each jointly owned by the Goverment (82%) and Messrs.
Siemens A.G. of Federal Republic of Germany (18%), and a workshop operating
under BTT. Telephone Shilpa Sangstha Ltd. manufactures telephone switching



equipment and Bangladesh Cable Shilpa Ltd., telephone cables. While the
latter is functioning reasonably well with its prices comparable to those
of similar factories in other countries, the switching factory is in an
early stage of operation and has yet to reach full production efficiency.
Details of these factories and BTT's workshop are given in Annex 1.
2.06      Close coordination between BTT and the two factories, which is
essential for ensuring the timely availability of equipment and cables,
is maintained. However, BTT is handling certain procurement functions
such as credit arrangements and customs clearances of material and com-
ponent imports which should properly be handled by the factories. During
negotiations an understanding was reached that any procurement functions
for the factories now performed by BTT would be transferred to the
factories as soon as practicable.
Existing Telecommunication Facilities
2.07      The local telephone system consists of 250 exchanges (20 auto-
matic and 230 manual) with an equipped capacity of 65,000 lines serving
52,900 direct exchange lines (DELs). Details of the telecommunmication
facilities existing on June 30, 1973, are listed at Annex 2. The local
automatic telephone exchanges employ earlier step-by-step and Si4ewen
END-type equipment, the latter being manufactured in the local factory.
Except for two microwave systm   and some old unreliable VHF systems, the
long-distance services are operated over openwire lines. While point-to-
point subscriber trunk dialling (STD) is in operation between Dacca and six
other towns, in general the trunk service is operated manually on a "delay"
basis. Telex service is available only at Dacca and Chittagong. Inter-
national telephone and telex services operate over HF radio circuits,
except those services to India which operate over openwire lines.
Service Standards
2.08      At 0.07 telephone per 100 population the telephone density in
Bangladesh is one of the lowest in the world (Annex 3). This results in
very heavy traffic per line causing severe overloads in local telephone
exchanges. This overloading, combined with maintenance problems partly
due to lack of essential spare parts, has led to a very poor quality of
local service. The long distance services are overloaded due to inadequacy
of circuits; further, with the exception of the two microwave systems, the
reliability of other equipment is poor. Consequently, the long-distance
circuits are unstable and of poor quality. The quality of international
services is also not up to standard due to operation over unstable openwire
lines and HF radio circuits which are susceptible to disturbances.
2.09      BTT is making special efforts to overcome the present operational
deficiencies, but the main improvements in the quality of service and in
meeting a reasonable part of the demand for waiting connections will only
be achieved with the progressive completion of the development program.

3. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The. Program
3.01      The program comprises BTT's First Five-Year Plan (July 1973 -
June 1978) which forms part of the national First Five-year Plan of the
Goverment of Bangladesh. The total cost of the program is Tk 1 ,040
million (US$139 million) with a foreign exchange component of Tk 360
million (US$48 million).
3.02      The program comprises the following:
(a) ongoing telecommunication projects under IDA Credits 343-BD,
345-BD and other bilateral credits expected to be completed
by June 1977;
(b) works to be executed during 1973-74 other than (a) above;
(c)  works under the proposed project to be executed between
July 1974 and June 1978.
3.03      During the program period, 75,000 lines capacity will be added
to the local telephone network (present capacity: 65,ooo lines). The
basic long-distance services will also be strengthened and extended by
microwave and UHF systems; rural communications will be extended and
improved through new openwire lines and carrier systems and the opening
of about 500 long-distance public call offices. Four trunk automatic
exchanges will interconnect 27 towns into a national subscriber trunk
dialling (STD) network. The telex service will be extended to six cities
and the gentex network will link large towns for speedier public telegraph
service. New international automatic telephone and telex exchanges will
enable introduction of semi-automatic telephone and telex operations with
other countries.
Cyclone Warning Project - IDA Credit 339-BD
3.04      Under Credit 339-BD, a "Cyclone Early Warning System" is being
provided through a microwave system between Chittagong and Cox's Bazar,
VHF systems and public call offices.  These works, estimated to cost
US$14 million equivalent, are outside BTT's program, being executed by
the Cyclone Reconstruction Board with technical assistance from BTT.
Following the appraisal mission's recommendation, agreement was reached
during negotiations that, on completion of the project, the telecommuni-
cations assets provided under Credit 339-BD would be vested in BTT and
operated and maintained by BTT and that Goverment would make arrangements
to pay BTT for providing this public service, all under terms and conditions
satisfactory to Government, BTT and the Association.
Other Ongoig Works
3.05      A number of projects are under execution by BTT, with their
foreign exchange costs financed by earlier IDA credits or other bilateral
credits. Microwave systems are to be installed under IDA Credit 343-BD



- 5 -
between Dacca and Bogra, Dacca and Mymensingh, Dacca and Sylhet, and Kushtia
and Rajshahi. A coaxial cable system is to be installed between Dacca and
Chittagong under a Japanese credit. An earth station for satellite conauni-
cations is under installation at Betbunia near Chittagong with a microwave
systen linking Betbunia and Chittagong. Telex network expansion is also
programied under other bilateral credits.
The Project
3.06      The project identified for I;he IDA credit comprises the follow-
ing new works in the last four years (July 1974 - June 1978) of BTT's
total five-year program:
(a)  installation of 65,000 lines of local exchange equipment,
together with cables and associated plant and equipment,
for connecting about 57,350 direct exchange lines;
(b)  installation of 6 microwave systems, openwire lines, openwire
carrier systems, UHF and VHF systems, and about 500 long-distance
public call offices;
(c)  installation of 4 trunk automatic exchanges (total capacity:
2,500 circuits);
(d)  installation of an international automatic telephone exchange
(capacity: 150 circuits);
(e)  consultancy services for management and accounting improvement.
One of the microwave systems included in (b) above is for the Bogra-
Rangpur route, for which a coaxial cable was earlier included under
Credit 343-BD. Because of a cost overrun in that Credit, largely be-
cause of changes in currency parities and considering present costs
of coaxial cable and microwave systems, the coaxial cable has been
substituted by a microwave system and included in the proposed project.
Details of telecommunication facilities to be added under the project
are given in Annex 4.
3.07      The estimated cost of the project is Tk 655 million (US$87
million) with a foreign exchange component of Tk 225 million (US$30 million).
The schedule below sets out the costs of the individual components of the
project and allocation of the proposed IDA credit of US$20 million. The
balance of foreign exchange is being arranged by Government from bilateral
and other sources. Details of annual expenditures are given in Annex 5.

-7-
Contingencies
3.08      Telecommunications development is a continuous process that
occurs through new installations or augmentation of plant at thousands
of locations in any year. Because of this, the overall risks of cost
increase du. to physical overrun is small. Also, the program is the
optimum that the BTT can undertake at present. The local exchange program,
which constitutes an important part of the project, is also limited by the
output of the local switching factory. The total physical contingency has
therefore been limited to about 2% of the new works, amounting to US$1.4
million, including a foreign exchange content of US$0.5 million.
3.09      Price contingencies of US$17 million, amounting to 24% of the
now works, provide for estimated increases in local and foreign costs
in light of the expected effects of increases in oil and comodity prices
on costs of telecommunications equipment as well as wages and salaries.
The overseas cost contingency amounts to US$5.5 million or about 23% of
the foreign exchange cost. The local cost contingency of US$11.5 million
is equivalent to about 25% of the local cost of the new works.
Procurement
3.10      All equipment financed with the proposed credit will be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank
Group's guidelines for procurement, with the exception of local subscriber
distribution and inter-exchange cables. These cables, excluding cost of
laying, are estimated to cost US$7.2 million, including a foreign exchange
component of US$3.26 million, and will be procured from Bangladesh Cable
Shilpa Ltd., a Government-owned local cable factory (see Annex 1).
Domestic procurement of these cables enhances operational efficiency by
reducing inventories and lead time for procurement and execution of works.
The prices for cables procured from the local factory are in line with
the international level of prices for similar cables.
3.11      Local telephone switching equipment is manufactured locally in
another Government-owned factory, Telephone Shilpa Sangstha Ltd., (Annex 1),
and will be procured from the domestic factory outside IDA financing. The
trunk switching equipment, which is not manufactured in the country at
present, will be procured through international competitive bidding, which
will allow Siemens EMD (the present type of switching equipment in the
country), crossbar, crosspoint or electronic equipment to be offered.
In respect of international bids for trunk switching equipment and sub-
scriber apparatus, a local preference of up to 15% or the applicable
customs duties, whichever is lower, would be applied to bids from local
manufacturers.
Project Execution
3.12      BTT engineers have the capability for planning and designing
the local and trunk telephone exchanges, the long-distance transmission
equipment and the power plant, and preparing the necessary technical
specifications.

The Program/Project service targets are given at Annex 6.
Disbursements
3.14      For equipment imported directly by BTT, the IDA credit would be
disbursed against the CIF costs.
3.15      For cables procured by BTT from the local factory, the IDA credit
would be disbursod against 45% of the selling price to the BTT (ex-factory
price plus excise duty and sales tax) representing the average foreign
exchange content of the product mix supplied from the factory as estimated
during the appraisal mission.
3.16      If either subscriber apparatus or trunk switching equipment is
procured from the local switching factory as a result of international
competitive bidding, the IDA credit would be disbursed against 75% of the
total selling price to MT. In the case of a locally appointed firm for
accounting improwexents, the IDA credit would be disbursed against 70% of
the consultant's fees. The percentages relating to goods would be sabject
to change itf ay aubetantial changes occur in material prices, exchange
rates or ftties and taxes.
3.17      The schedule of estimated quarterly disbursements is given at
Annex 7. As the present project will be the beginning of a continuing
development program for the teleconKunication sector, it is proposed
that any unused balances should be applied after consultation with the
Association for purchase of goods simlar to those provided under the
credit.

Local switching equipment is supplied and installed by local
switching factory under one contract.

4. PROJECT JITSTIFICATION
4.01      The existing telecommunication facilities in Bangladesh are
inadequate in quantity and unsatisfactory in quality. BTT's five-year
program is designed to improve their quality and provide minimum, basic
telecommunications required for economic development and general adminis-
tration of the country. At the end of the program, the total telecommuni-
cation needs of the country would not have been met but maximum relief
would have been provided within the constraints of available finance,
physical capacity and trained manpower availability. The program is
designed to give a balanced growth while providing for an improved
quality of service.
Local Telephone Service
4.02      The past rate of growth in the total demand for telephone connec-
tions (working lines plus registered waiting list) was 13%. BTT has,
however, adopted a slightly higher average annual rate of 15% for growth
in total demand because of the current very low telephone density, the
general increase in economic activity in the country and consequent higher
demands for telephones (Annex 8). Also, the registered waiting list does
not reflect the real demand, because of many potential applicants having
been discouraged from applying by the already heavy waiting list and long
delays in getting connections. This projected rate of growth of demand is
reasonable. Though the project will add 57,350 working connections to the
existing 52,900 connections,the number of applicants waiting for telephone
connections will increase from a current 26,000 to 37,000 at end of FT 1978
(Annex 9). Performance indicators for expected achievements in the expan-
sion of the local network during the 1974-1980 period are shown in
Annex 10.
Long-Distance Service
4.03      The project works in the long-distance network are designed to
relieve congestion, increase the reliability and quality of long distance
circuits, extend high-capacity and stable long distance routes to new
areas and provide better telephone service to rural areas. The number of
trunk circuits will increase at an average annual growth rate of 19%
which is higher (as is normal) than the rate of grovth in the number of
telephone connections. This rate of growth is reasonable and necessary
considering the poor state of present long-distance communications in the
country.
4.04      To reduce the cost of operation, improve service standards and
for optimum utilization of large blocks of circuits that would become
available, gradual automation of trunk service is planned during the
project period. The location and capacities of the four TAIS and the
provision of trunk circuits interconnacting these TAks (Annex 11) are
justified for meeting the initial needs for the first phase of introducing
subscriber dialling between 27 towns in the country.



- 10 -
International Telephone Service
4.05      A satellite earth station now under installation near Chittagong
will provide a large number of international telephone and telex circaits
between Bangladesh and other countries. An international trunk automatic
exchange provided under the project is necessary to efficiently utilize
these circuits. This exchange will enable gradual introduction of semi-
automatic international telephone service with other countries with
possibilities in the future of providing full automatic service especially
with neighboring countries.
Least-Cost Solution
4.06      Fundamental plans for establishing a basic telecommunication
network for the area now Bangladesh were prepared in late 1960's by NTB,
a German consulting firm which had examined the telecommunications needs
of Pakistan as a whole. These plans which BTT is now following were based
on sound, optimum engineering designs and provide a satisfactory framework
for development of telecommnications. The local network design and plant
provisioning follow accepted practices to minimize costs. Continuance of
use of local switching equipment and cables produced by domestic factories
is the correct solution bearing in mind the availability of local produc-
tion, the employment situation and savings in foreign exchange. The choice
of microwave and UHF systems for the new long-distance routes represents
the least-cost solution.
Return on Investment
4.07      The rate of return on the project - defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the project
with the capital and operating costs, excluding taxes - is 21% (Annex 12).
If the foreign exchange component is shadow priced at a value 87%
(Tk 14 = US$1) above the estimated cost, and labor is valued at 50% of
actual disbursements, the rate of return would be 22%. A sensitivity
analysis has been made showing that, under an unfavorable combination of
the main parameters, the rate of return would be not less than 16%.
4.08      The economic rate of return is undoubtedly higher than the fore-
going suggests since (i) the prices charged do not adequately measure the
full benefits to the subscribers, primearily business, industry and agri-
culture and (ii) the costs include the full costs of extending the network
and providing facilities in new areas even though the full benefits will
only obtain in the future when additional lines are connected.

5. THE BENEFICIARY - BTT DEPAR$fENT
5.01      All public telecommunication services in Bangladesh are pro-
vided under a state monopoly exercised by BTT under the supervision of
the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone.
Organization and Management
5.02      After the formation of Bangladesh in 1971, a headquarters
organization was set up in Dacca with the same organizational structure
as the one previously in Karachi. (Annex 13 shows the organizational
structure and functional responsibilities.) The internal structure is
satisfactory except for the organization of the accounting function
(see paragraph 5.12). Also, BTT as a governnent department lacks
adequate autonomy (see paragraph 2.04).
5.03      The top management are relatively young officers who are for
the first time occupying senior positions, but are not without experience,
having been members of the Pakistan T&T Department in middle management.
The Secretary for Post, Telegraph and Telephone, to whom the Director
General reports, exercises close supervision over BTT's operations. He
is a highly qualified teleconmmnications engineer and was Chief Engineer
of the Pakistan T&T Department. However, there is a general lack of
experienced and trained personnel in the areas of planning, maintenance
and operations.
Organizational Changes and Assistance
-,.04     In 1969 the Government of Pakistan retained IDA-financed con-
sultants (Arthur D. Little, Inc.) to review the operations of the Pakistan
T&T Department, which was serving both East and West Pakistan, and make
recommendations for improving the overall organization to permit it to
operate more efficiently and along commercial lines. One of the recom-
mendations was for the ultimate creation of a statutory corporation but
with an intermediate period during which time it would operate as a
Government Board with considerable autonomy and with its own management
held accountable for an efficient operation.
5.05      The Bangladesh Government had expressed agreement in principle
to thq recommendation for establishing a Board and for instituting changes
in BTT that would allow it to operate on the basis of sound financial and
management principles, including transferring BTT's accounting function
from the Government's Comptroller and Auditor General to BTT and estab-
lishing a modern system of accounting. During negotiations agreement was
reached that a Government Board with specific powers and responsibilities
to operate on the basis of sound financial and management principles will
be established by June 30, 1975. It was further agreed that the
accounting and internal auditing functions will be assumed by BTT/the Board
not later than June 30, 1975.



- 12 -
5.06      The appraisal mission ascertained that there are local accounting 
management firms qualified to undertake the work of implementing the Arthur
D. Little recomendations for establishing a modern accounting system, and
provided BTT with a suggested terms of reference for the now consultants.
During negotiations agreement was reached that BTT will employ management/
accountirg consultants, acceptable to the Association, by December 31,
1974; also,, a timetable was agreed for implemnting certain basic recoi-
mendations on which early action is essential in order to provide the
foundation for BTT to take further steps for developing an effective
accounting system. (Annex 14 contains these recommendations together
with timetables for their implementation.) The Goveriment is also seeking
three experts to be obtained under bilateral arrangements for a two-year
period to assist in the specific areas of stores management, billing and
collections and com=ercial office procedures, and alao to assist in carry-
ing out training programs in these areas. If these experts cannot be
obtained, the proposed consultants' terms of reference would be extended
accordingly or other outside assistance brought in.
Staffing
5.07      BTT employs a staff of approximately 13,000, corresponding to
22.5 staff per 100 DELs after allowing for telegraph operating staff.
(See Annex 15 for category distribution of staff.) This is very high
level., even compared to other developing countries whose figures range
from 2 to 14. In telecoimmunications involving maintenance of sophisti-
cated equipment, overstaffing is counter-productive. BTT appreciates
the problem but are constrained in making reductions by the Goveriment's
policy of maximizing employment in a situation of severe unemployment.
It is proposed to increase productivity and to limit increases in staff
to 6% below the rate of DEL growth; this would reduce the staff to about
17 per 100 DELs by the end of F7 1978 (see Annex 15). The total number
of staff is estimated to increase from current 13,000 to about 22,000
by the end of 1978. The matter was discussed during negotiation8 and
the Association's position set out in a letter to the Government.
Traning
5.08      There are two Telecommnication Training Centers (TTCs) for
officers and middle grade staff and six Divisional Training Centers (DTCs)
for lower grade staff. To meet the demand for additional technical staff,
the existing TTCs are being enlarged and new TTCs and DTCs opened. UIDP
assistance has been requested for setting-up of a telecommunication staff
college whose curriculum will also inelude courses in finance.
5.09      The Secretary PTT is well aware of the need for training programs
in finance as well as the need to recruit suitable finance staff, and has
taken action in this regard (see paragraph 5.14).  Also, one of the prin-
cipal tasks of the consultants and experts will be to assist in setting up
and carrying out training programs for Junior as well as serior finance
staff consisting of on-the-job training as well as outside study.



- 13 -
5.10      Details of BTT's training program are given in Annex 15.  The
program provides training for the lower grade craftsmen as well as tech-
nicians and engineering supervisors. This program, together with a pro-
posed UNDP-sponsored telecommnications staff college to train officers
and higher categories of staff, will provide BTT with a satisfactory
training program.
Accounting System
5.11      As a Government department, BTT's finances form part of the
national budget and are subject to control of the parliamentary grant
system. All cash collections are paid into the national consolidated
fund and expenditures within the budget allocations are charged against
this fLid. Traditionally, this system of accounting is designed for
government departments financed out of a general pool of government
revenue. The main purpose is to ensure that no money is spent contrary
to the intention of the legislature, which places the emphasis on the
control of cash without adequate emphasis on operating results.
5.12      BTT's accounting functi~on rests with an outside body, the
Comptroller and Auditor General, who also has responsibility for the
annmal audit of BTT accounts. But since a G&AG has only recently been
appointed and is still in the process of staffing and organizing his
department in order to begin carrying out his responsibilities, even
the parliamentary grant system of accounts has not been functioning.
The accounts have not been compiled, the value of assets is not known,
and there is a complete absence of organized accounting data. This
situation stems from the dislocations caused by the war and the separa-
tion from Pakistan.
5.13      With the exception of a few individuals supervising billing,
payroll and stores accounting, BTT's own financial staff consists of
clerks, many of whom are assigned to field engineering divisions.
5.14      Anticipating the creation of a Board (see paragraph 5.05) and
BTT taking over its accounting function, the Secretary, PTT, is taking
action that will help create a financial staff within BTT able to carry
out the accounting function. He is actively seeking an individual with
suitable qualifications to fill the post of chief financial officer. He
has taken up with the Government's Establishment Division the matter of
early recruitment of staff who can be trained in finance work and the
transferring to BTT of those C&AG staff now working on BTT accounts. He
has requested the Public Service Coumission to recruit 15 accounting
graduates to be trained to take over key financial posts. One accounts
officer is in the United States under a USAID-sponsored training program
and a request has been made to the Planning Commission to train two more
accounts officers abroad. During negotiations it was agreed that BTT
would obtain to the extent possible the necessary financial staff in time
to begin carrying out the financial function once it is transferred.



- 14 -
5.15      The consultants and expsrts referred to in paragraph 5.06,
together with the timely acquisition of staff, will provide the expertise
and manpower necessary for BTT to begin to establish an accounting systea
and build its financial organization.
Audit
5.16      Under the constitution, the C&AG is responsible for audit:uLng
goverment accounts. He is appointed by the President and is independent
of any other person or authority. He will for the time being discharge
his BTT audit responsibilities through one of his senior officers, who is
also responsible for maintaining BTT's accounts.  The CkAG will prescribe
the form of the accounts which are to be submitted to the President and
subsequently laid before Parliament.  No timetable for coupleting the
audit is specified. Until the assets have been valued and the accounts
compiled, an audit will not be possible (see paragraph 5.12). Under these
circumstances the Association's customary requirement of audited accounts
before presentation to the Board should be waived until an accounting
system has been established and the accounts compiled.
5.17      The question of an independent outside audit was discussed with
the Secretary, PTT, and the C&AG. The Secretary stated that, when the
Board is formed, he would have no objection to recommending an outside
independent auditor to perform BTT's annual audit.  fThe G&AG also ex-
pressed no objection to such an arrangement and indicated that an outside
audit would be of help to him. Agreement was reached during negotiations
that auditors satisfactory to the Association would be engaged to conmence
their work beginning with the accounts for fiscal year 1976, and that the
Association's standard audit covenant will be adopted so as to provide
for (i) the audit each fiscal year of BTT's accounts and financial state-
ments in accordance with sound auditing principles, consistently applied;
and (ii) sending to the Bank, no later than six months after the end of
the fiscal year, certified copies of the year's financial statements and
an audit report of appropriate scope and detail.
Supervision
5.18      The present status of the accounts, the large amount of work
associated with establishing BTT as an effective telecommunications
organization, the fact that this work is to be undertaken by consultants
not yet selected, and the general conditions in Bangladesh, al1 suggest
strongly that a more than normal amount of supervision will be required
to assure that the project and the institution building progress
according to schedule. Present estimates are that two supervision
missions per year by an engineer/financial analyst will be required.

6. FINANCES
6.01      BTT, as a new organization created under abnormal circumstances,
suffers from a number of organizational and operational weaknesses. However,
the important steps to be taken along the lines recomended by the Arthur D.
Little consultants will help correct many of the weaknesses, form the basis
for BTT to begin operating along commercial lines and contribute to its
becoming a financially viable enterprise. The financial forecasts, which
are more tentative than is usually the case (see paragraph 6.04), show that
in carrying out a substantial expansion program, BTT should be able to main-
tain a satisfactory financial position and achieve sufficient earnings to
finance a reasonable portion of its expansion program from internally
generated funds.
Tariffs
6.02      There are no regulations establishing a specific tariff policy.
Changes in tariffs are formulated within BTT and then reviewed and approved
by the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone, and the Ministry of
Fizance before being sent to the Cabinet for final approval. The present
tariffs, summarized in Annex 16, have been in force since July 1, 1973
when an increase for all main services of about 50% became effective.
6.03      The overall tariff structure is satisfactory.  The level of
tariffs is on the high side in comparison to other developing countries,
but this is desirable under present conditions as it will;help the entity
to finance its expansion programs from internally generated funds. There
is a telephone connection fee of Tk 400 (US$53); the average annual
rental charge is Tk 450 (US$60) and call charges are Tk 0.30 (us04).
Past Operations and Present Financial Position
6.o4      In the absence of any accounts, the following data were estab-
lished as a basis for analyzing fiscal year 1973 operations and for making
forecasts. The revenue position for fiscal year 1973 was ascertained and
serves as a basis for the forecasts. Operating expenses were estimated
from data obtained from various sources and by using reasonable assumptions.
Estimates of plant value as of June 30, 1973 are based on the known age,
type and observed condition of a representative cross-section. Detailed
notes and assumptions used in constructing these notional figures are in
Annex 17. Estimates based on the assumptions are considered to be
sufficiently reliable to form a basis for analyzing BTT's operations.
6.o5      In order to give a picture of the financial operations, this
report includes an estimated pro forma commercial presentation for fiscal
year ending June 30, 1973, the only full fiscal year of BTT's operations,
and a tentative seven-year forecast (two years beyond the project period)
of financial operations and position, including balance sheets, statements
of income and statements of sources and applications of funds (Annexes 18,
19 and 20, respectively).



- 16 -
6.06      Estimated operating results for 1973 show an operating loss of
1ik 7.6 million before notional interest payments of Tk 3.8 million and
after notional depreciation charges of Tk 30.8 million. Forecasts achow
that BTT emerges from this loss position to a positive earnings position
in fiscal year 1974 when a substantial increase in tariffs became effec-
tive (see paragraph 6.02).
6.07      The estimated amount of accounts receivable is high, amounting
to 30% of total revenues. About half of the receivables are more than
three months old. This situation is partly due to the difficult condi-
tions in Bangladesh in the last two years, and partly to delays in
billing and lack of follow-up action for collecting arrears. With a more
normal situation now prevailing in Bangladesh and with the assistance of
an expert to review and help implement recommendations for improving the
billing and collection system and procedares, the amount of receivables
is expected to be brought down to a more normal level over the next few
years. This is reflected in the forecasts. The position will be kept
under close review during supervision and BRT will be asked to report on
the situation periodically.
6.08      Following is a suwmary of the estimated pro forma balance
sheet as of June 30, 1973:

6.09      The valuation of plant in service and the depreciation reserve
is necessarily tentative and will be reviewed by the consultants and
formally established. With the introduction of commercial accounting
concepts, the value of plant will become important because it will serve
as a basis for establishing depreciation rates, tariffs and a rate base
and therefore should be kept under review to determine whether adjust-
ments should be made on account of variationLs in the applicable price
levels in the economy. During negotiations agreement was reached that
BTT will keep under review the value of its net fixed assets in operation
to determine whether adjustments are required, and appropriate adjustments
to the value of net fixed assets would be made in a manner satisfactory
to the Association.
6.10      In establishing the pro forma capital structure as of June 30,
1973, all identifiable long-term borrowings in connection with BTT's
operations since the formation of Bangladesh are shown as long-term debt.
The amount of equity is shown as Government investment and is assumed to
be the balancing figure between the amount of total assets (net of
current liabilities) and the amount of existing determinable long-term
debt as above. It is not possible at this time to ascertain how the
debt liability that was incurred by the Pakistan Government to finance
assets in former East Pakistan may be resolved between the Governments
of Pakistan and Bangladesh, nor was the amount of debt ascertainable.
For this report it is assumed that if art of this debt is eventually
transferred to the Bangladesh Government, it will be serviced by
Government.
Financing Plan
6.11      The forecast of Sources and Applications of Funds for the seven-
year period 1974-1980 (Annex 20) is based on BTT's total five-year develop-
ment program given in Annex 5, which includes the project, assumed future
works beyond the program, forecast earnings given in Annex 19, borrowings
given in Annex 17, and estimated increases in working capital. Following
is a summary of the financing plan for the five-year program period
1974-1978.

6.12      The foregoing financing plan is shown as if BTT had full use of
its funds. Some of the financial data are necessarily tentative; never-
theless, the financing plan sufficiently presents BTT's position on a
pro forma basis to permit conclusions to be drawn.
6.13      During this five-year period, net internal sources of funds
after covering debt service on a commercial basis would be equivalent
to 35% of the construction costs and working capital increase; borrowings
would amount to 65%, of which 13% would be the proposed IDA credit and
4% the remaining funds to be disbursed under IDA Credits 343-BD and
345-BD. The internal financing of some 35% of total requirements is
satisfactory, considering that BTT's value of plant in service (net of
the cyclone assets) is expected to increase by Tk 922 million (US$123
million) - an increase of 1.5 times.
I/
-Includes assumed future works in 1978 amounting to Tk 82 million.



- 19 -
6.14      All references to debt apply only after the creation of the
Board, or reflect pro forma figures of what the situation would be if
BTT were an autonomous entity at present.  All foreign exchange debt
will be incurred by Government on behalf of BTT and will consist of
grants and credits on soft terms. Government is responsible for ser-
vicing the debt, but for purposes of this report the debt is shown as
that of BTT and as being serviced by BTT on a commercial basis, i.e.,
a term of 25 years, including a five-year grace period and an annual
interest rate of 6-1/4%, which is the Government lending rate. These
tems are also assumed to be the relending terms for the present and
proposed IDA credits. It is further assumed that upon its creation the
Board would bear the exchange risk for the repayment of foreign currency
loans. These financial arrangements were agreed during negotiations.
6.15      Shown under borrowings are bilateral credits/grants of US$22.5
million equivalent and Government loans of Tk 360.5 million. Government
has already made arrangements for US$11.8 million of bilateral credits.
It is reasonable to expect that the balance of US$10,7 million would be
covered from additional bilateral credits as well as possible allocations
under future Bank Group program credits to Bangladesh. The need for
Government loans of Tk 360.5 million to cover a shortage of local funds
was discussed with appropriate Government officials who advised that
Government would stand ready to cover this shortfall by a loan, an equity
contribution or a combination of the two. This was confirmed during
negotiations. For purposes of this report, this shortfall is shown to be
covered by a Government loan on terms assumed at 15 years, including a
3-year grace period and an interest rate of 6-1/4%. With the total
borrowings indicated the financing plan is complete. Nevertheless,
agreement was reached during negotiations that Government would be pre-
pared to cover any financing gap in the project.
6.16      The financing plan does not provide for any payments to
Government in the form of income tax or a distribution of profits. BTT,
in an early stage of development, already has heavy requirements for
carrying out its expansion program and servicing the substantial debt
to be incurred, including the Government loans necessary to cover the
shortfall of funds. During negotiations it was agreed that before making
a distribution of the entity's profits during the period of the project,
it would be demonstrated that it would have available the necessary funds
each year to carry out its capital program, adequately operate and main-
tain its facilities and service its debt on a commercial basis. It is
likely that BTT will continue to be exempt from incame tax during the
period of the project, and in any event any income tax levied would be
recovered through tariffs in accordance with the tariff covenant. Fore-
castsshow that, notwithstanding the omission of payments to Government
and the assumed loans from Government, the entity's operations over the
five-year period will have a positive net fiscal impact on Government
(see paragraph 6.22).



- 20 -
Future Finances
6.17      Forecast balance sheets and income statements for 1974-1980
are shown in Annexes 18 and 19. Existing tariffs are assumed for the
forecasts.  Operating revenues are estimated to increase by 46% in fiscal
year 1974 as a result of the 50% increase in tariffs at the beginning of
that year.  Revenues over the next six years are estimated to increase
at an average annual rate of 20% due to the new facilities being provided
under the expansion program, much of which is for long-distance services
that generate high revenues. Operating expenses, estimated to increase
at an average annual rate of 18%, provide for additional staff, wage and
allowance increases as well as other expenses arising from the larger
network. The rate of return on average net plant in service is estimated
at 5% in 1974, the first year reflecting the tariff increase, and rises
to about 12% by 1980. These estimated operating results are satisfactory.
Performance indicators showing the expected operating revenue and expense
per DEL and the expected rates of return during the period 1974-1980 are
given in Annex 10.
6.18      The forecast financial position is also satisfactory.  During
the seven-year period 1974-1980, when some 60% of BTT's capital require-
ments would be financed with long-term debt, equity would increase by
almost Tk 450 million, mainly from retained earnings. This combination
of financing results in a debt equity ratio in 1980 of the order of
54/6, after assumed future borrowings, which would leave BTT in a
position for still further borrowings to carry out future expansion
programs. The current position (ratio of current assets to current
liabilities) would be satisfactory as would the coverage of debt service
by internal cash generation which declines from a high of 4.5 times in
1974 to a low of 2.7 times in 1980.
6.19      The forecasts assume that the Cyclone Project assets valued at
Tk 104.7 million are transferred to BTT in 1976 as Government equity and
that Goverment would pay annual charges for this public service of
cyclone warning (see paragraph 3.Dh).
Tariff Covenant
6.20      In proposing a tariff covenant, consideration was given to BTT '
situation as a newly formed entity undertaking a five-year expansion pro-
gram and whose estimated annual earnings performance over the next five
years is necessarily approximate. Accordingly, a tariff covenant along
the following lines is appropriate and was agreed during negotiations:
(i) during fiscal years 1976, 1977 and 1978, tariffs will be maintained
at a level to produce revenues sufficient to earn a rate of return on
properly valued average net plant in service of no less than 8% and
beginning with fiscal year 1979 no less than 10% (see paragraph 6.09);
(ii) during the construction period of the project, BTT will review in
March of each year the adequacy of its tariffs on the basis of a care-
fully prepared forecast of the following fiscal year's operations, taking
into account the expected reaults of the current year, anr expected



- 21 -
changes in the rate of inflation, cost increases and fund requirements,
and if necessary and with approval of Governments adjust tariffs to
achieve the minimum 8% rate of return cited in (i) above. BTT will
promptly inform the Association of the results of the annual review
and of any tariff adjustments.
Debt Limitation Covenant
6.21      The appraisal report assumes that all borrowings by and on
behalf of the Board will be the Board's debt; on this basis forecasts
show that debt service will be adsquately covered by net revenues (before
charging depreciation). Nevertheless, it was agreed during negptiations
that the Board will not incur any debt, other than the proposed credit,
and other bilateral credits/grants, most of which has already been
obtained, unless historic 12 months' net revenues (before charging depre-
ciation) would cover maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times,
including debt service on the proposed credit and the other bilateral
credits/grants already obtained.
Fiscal Impact
6.22      The fiscal impact of the entity's operations on Government
over the five-year period 1974-1978 is favorable. During this period,
it is estimated that there will accrue to Government Tk 366 million
from the entity's operations compared to Tk 360 million accruing to it
from Government (see Annex 21).

BANGLADESH
BANGLADESH TELEGRAPH AN) TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT (BTT)
Domestic Production of Telecommunication Equipment
1,        There are three units manufacturing telecommunication equipment
in Bangladesh, namely:
(a)  Telegra  Workshop, established in 1950, manufacturing poles,
brackets and other accessories for openwire lines, and cabinets
for interconnection of underground telephone cables;
(b)  Telephone Shilpa Sangstha Ltd., established in 1970, manufac-
turing local telephone switching equipment;
(c)  Bangladesh Cable Shilpa Ltd., established in 1971, manufacturing
telephone cables.
TeLegraph Workshop
2.        The Telegraph Workshop is a departmental organization under a
Superintendent who reports to the Director General, BTT. The Telegraph
Workshop is an obsolete factory; neither its plant and equipment nor its
m.rnufacturing techniques have been modernized largely due to the tendency
to continue with labor intensive methods to maximize employment.
3.        With a staff of 730  the total annual production in prehostilities
period was about Tk 10 million (US$1.33 million). The production in 1972-73
was just Tk 5.24 million (US$0.70 million) anticipated to increase to
Tk 6.00 million (US$0.80 million) in 1973-74. Its main line of production
is itemnq of materials for openwire lines but it also manufactures plumbers
metal, solder sticks as also cabinets of sizes 700-pair and 1,400-pair for
interconnection of local telephone cables. The quantities of major items
produced in 1972-73 were as follows:
Tubes for poles                            34,600
Brackets                                   30,00o
Castings for soleplates, sockets,
saddles, etc.                               625
Plumbers metal and solder sticks           12,000 pounds
Cabinets for telephone cables                  33
Teiephone Shilpa Sangstha Ltd.
1U.       The Telephone Shilpa Sangstha Ltd. was established in 1970 under
Vechnical collaboration with Messrs. Siemens A.G. of Federal Republic of
*em-any for manufacturing telephone switching equipment. The then
Government of Pakistan as the major stockholder (82%) contributed Tk 25.5
T-lITion equivalent (US$3.40 million) with Messrs. Siemens,the only other



ANNEX 1
Page 2 or 4 pagas
stockholder (18%) providing Tk 6.7 million equivalent (US$0.9 million)
foreign exchange in form of plant and machinery. The balance contribu-
tions outstanding from the Government and Siemens are Tk 4.65 million
(US$0.62 million) and Tk 0.3 million (US$0.04 million) respectively.  The
factory was started under Siemens management but by December 16, 1971, all
the German staff had been withdrawn due to disturbed conditions in the
country. The factory is now under the direction of a General Manager
(appointed by the Government) who reports to the Secretary, Ministry of
Post, Telegraph and Telephone. The factory is governed by a Board of
Directors of which the Secretary, PTT, is the Chairman. Other Directors
are the General Manager, the Director-General and Deputy Director-General
(Plannirg) of BTT, Financial Adviser representing Ministry of Finance and
two representatives of Messrs. Siemens.
6.        The design capacity of the factory is 20,000 lines of EMD-F6a
local telephone exchange switching equipment of Si-emens design. Its pro-
ductior. in 1972-73 was only 3,000 lines at a total ex-factory cost of
Tk 8.C million (US$1.07 million) as follows:
Tk Million
Raw materials and components                      1.74
Wages                                             0.21
Power                                             0.07
Overheads                                         5.58
Siemens dividend and royalty                      0.44
8.04
7.        Several factors contributed to low production and high costs.
The fact3ry in Dacca was designed as complementary to another factory in
Haripur in West Pakistan from which the Dacca factory was to receive cer-
tain manufactured components essential to assembly of the final product.
Due to strained relations, the supply of these components was interrupted.
Also due to disturbed conditions in the country prior to hostilities, the
factory's production never got fully established.
8.        Under a new agreement signed between the Government of Bangladesh
and Siemens in February 1973 (effective retroactively from December 16,
1971), seven Siemens engineers are assisting the factory's local staff of
700 in key positions of tool-making, production, assembly, quality control
and testing. Under a bilateral credit from Federal Republic of Germany,
the factory is receiving from Germany raw materials for local manufacture,
and components essential to its final product from Messrs. Siemens. The
factory expects to produce 8,000 lines of equipment in 1973-74 and raise
the production to the full 20,000 lines by 1976-77.
1/    Siemens receive 5% dividend on their equity of Tk 6.7 million,and
royalty at 2-1/2% of ex-factory selling price less on-site costs
of imported items.



ANNEX t
Page 3 of 4 pages
9.        Due to low level of production, insufficiently trained staff and
high overheads, the cost to BTT in 1972-73 per line of exchange equipment,
including power plant and installation, was Tk 2,400 (US$320) of which
foreign component was 43%. With full production at planned capacity,
increased productivity, and local manufacture of simpler components now
imported, the price per line in 1977-78 is expected to drop to Tk 1,920
(US$256) per line with foreign component of 45%.
Bangladesh Cable Shilpa Ltd.
10.       The Bangladesh Cable Shilpa Ltd. was established in 1971, also
under technical collaboration with Messrs. Siemens of Federal Republic of
Germany for production of local telephone cables. The then Government of
Pakistan was the major stockholder (82%) and Messrs. Siemens the only
other stockholder (18%). For the first phase of the factory, the Government
contributed Tk 17.8 million equivalent (US$2.38 million) and Siemens the
foreign exchange component of Tk 7.15 million equivalent (US$0.95 million)
by way of equipment and machinery. The balance contributions from the
Government and Siemens for the second phase axe Tk 0.51 million (US$0.07
million) and Tk 0.29 million (US$0.04 million) respectively.
11.       The factory was initially under Siemens management but the
German staff were gradually withdrawn due to disturbed conditions
in the country. The factory is now under the direction of a General
Manager appointed by the Government and who reports to the Secretary,
Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone. The factory is governed by
a Board of Directors of which the Secretary, Ministry of Post, Telegraph
and Telephone, is the Chairman. Other Directors are the General Manager,
Director General and Deputy Director General (Planning) of BTT, Financial
Adviser representing Ministry of Finance,and two representatives of Siemens.
12.       The factory is at present producing primary and secondary tele-
phone cables and wires for subscriber distribution but will shortly under-
taike production of inter-exchange junction cables also. Its present
production is only about 40% of its total capacity. In 1972-73, its
production was Tk 9.2 million (US$1.23 million) of cables as followys:
Cables
T0-pair                             695 pair-miles

ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 4 pages
13.       The factory production is at present inhibited by both the local
demands from BTT and lack of export markets. In 1973-74, the factory ex-
pects to produce Tk 15 million (US$2 million) worth of cables. Its prices
after adjustments for local taxes, etc. are comparable to those recently
quoted internationally in other Bank projects. The foreign exchange
component based on present-day copper prices is about 45% of the selling
price to BTT.
14.       Under a new agreement signed between the Government of Bangladesh
and Messrs. Siemens in February 1973 (effective retroactively from
December 16, 1971), four Siemens engineers are assisting the local staff

Rate of Return on Investnent
Project Period
1.        In calculating the financial rate of return, a study period has
been taken corresponding to the mean life of the various items of plant
making up the project, which is assumed to have a life time of 22 years.
Costs
2.        The estimated project costs include provisions for contingencies
but exclude the amount of related customs duties. The average rate of
customs duties on direct imports is 50% and on raw materials 25%.
3.        The life of telecommunications equipment varies.  Some equip-
ment will have longer lives than the project period of 22 years, while
others will be shorter and will need replacing in the project project.
Therefore, a residual value as.well as additional values have been esti-
mated and included in the construction cost stream, based on the following
assumed average lives of plant items:
Buildings                       hO years
Cable                           30 years
Exchanges                       25 years
Transmission equipment          15 years
Subscriber equipment            10 years
Vehicles                         5 years
4.        Operating costs were estimated from the income statement by
assuming that operating expenses, excluding depreciation, per exchange
line added under the project are attributable to the project.
Revenues
5.        Estimates of security deposits are based on the assumption that
the exchange fill relating to the subscribers connected in message rate
areas under the project will go up to 90%.
6.        Local service revenues were estimated from the  nber of DELs
cormected due to the project.  It is assumed that the exchange fill
relating to the lines connected under the project will reach 90%.
7.        Toll revenueswere estimated on the basis of the number of DELs
and long distance circuits installed under the project taking into account
additional traffic growth because of STD stimulus.
8.        Miscellaneous revenue due to the project is assumed at
Tk 300,000 annually from 1975-1978.

Rate of Return
9.        The financial rate of return on the project investment is 21%,
based on this study which equates the present worth of the project's
construction costs (excluding customs duties) and operating costs
(excluding depreciation) to the present worth of the attributable
revenues, including security deposits.
Sensitivity Analysis
10.       If the foreign exchange component of the investment is priced
at a value 87% (Tk 1 = US$1) above the estimated cost and labor is valued
at 50% of- actual disbursements, the rate of return would be 22%. When a
sensitivity analysis is applied to this estimate the following results are
obtained:
Rate of Return
10% increase in construction costs               20%
10% increase in operating costs                  21%
10% decrease in operating revenues               19%
10% increase in construction costs
with a 10% increase in operating costs
and a 10% decrease in operating revenue          16%

Major Steps With Timetables Necessary For Developing
An Effective Accounting System Within BTT
1.        With the creation of a Board to give BTT more autonomy to begin
operating according to sound financial and management principles with its
own modern accounting system, there is a great amount of work to be done
in the financial/accounting area if the proper basis is to be formed to
permit the desired type of operation. Without attempting at this time
to address each step that will eventually need to be taken, the following
steps are considered to be of high priority for BTT to make a start in
establishing a modern accounting system.
Transfer of the Accounting Function from the C&AG to BTT
2         In order for BTT to operate on sound financial and management
principles, it is, of course, basic that it have its own accounting
function. This is Government's plan and the transfer would take place
so as to coordinate as closely as possible with the creation of the Board.
Physical Inventory and Val-uation of Fixed Assets and Fixed Asset Register
3.        A physical inventory and valuation of fixed assets should be
carried out by a team of engineers and accountants and the valuation of
the fixed assets formally established. Considering that part of the
existing equipment is old and obsolete and that as the development program
proceeds, new equipment will represent a rapidly increasing proportion of
total fixed assets, it is reasonable that the work on the valuation should
be restricted to the minimum required to establish the current value of
existing assets within reasonable limits.
4.        An asset register should be established and maintained giving
for each asset its description, location, original cost, depreciation rate
and current value. This would provide a factala. basis on which to assess
at any time the current value of assets, which is necessary for any
detailed assessment for depreciation, analyzing costs and tariff making.
A reasonable time for completing the physical inventory and valuation of
assets in order to formally establish their value and for establishing a
fixed asset register would be no later than one year from the date that
the new consultants are engaged.
Establish an Accounts Code
5.        An accounts code suitable for a modern telecommunications account-
ing system should be drawn up and a manual prepared showing the accounts
code and describing each item. A proper accounts code is an important part



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 2 pages
of the accounting system, providing the basis for quick definition, classi-
fication, collection and reporting of financial data. A reasonable time
for establishing an accounts code and preparing the manual would be within
one year from the date the new consultants are engaged.
Establish a System of Work Orders for Recording Capital and Non-Capital Costs
6.        A system should be designed for the costing of engineering and
other related operations for the purpose of analyzing these costs between
capital and non-capital works whose cost is written off in the accounting
period in which it is incurred. This costing system should be integrated
with the financial accounts. This system should be established by no later
than six months from the time the new consultants are engaged.
Develop a System of Internal Audit
7.        Experience has shown that the existence of an effective internal
audit function can be an important factor in the successful operation of a
modern accounting system. The internal audit is normally designed to ensure
that, so far as possible, accounting transactions are regularly verified,
the assets are properly safeguarded and the accounting procedures are being
properly followed. BTT should take steps to recruit as early as possible
at least the key internal audit staff in order to give them the benefit of
participating in the initial stages of setting up BTT's accounting system;
also, this is a time when they can be especially useful by helping to ensure
that the new procedures are being followed.
Establish a Budgeting System
8.        For purposes of planning, control of operations and tariff review.
BTT will need to prepare on a regular basis operational and development
plans and financial forecasts for the near term as well as long term.
Budgets would line up with the financial accounts and be based on areas of
responsibility and would permit comparison of budgeted performance against
actual performance also by area of responsibility. It is expected that a
budgeting system as envisaged would take a few years to develop since the
input derives from the new accounting system to be established. Iut since
it will in time become the center of the management information and control
system, BTT should recognize its importance and make a start beginning with
fiscal year 1975 by drawing up budgets to the extent possible by area of
responsibility; this will have the benefit of involving the staff and of
providing them with practical experience in this important function.

Telecommunication Staff and Their Training
Staff
1.        At end of June 30, 1973, BTT had 13,007 employees.  Their present
dispersion between various categories and anticipated numbers during the
program period are as follows:
Categories                    1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78
Officers                         405      460     520      600     700     BOO
Engineering Supervisors          725      850   1,000   1,300   1,650   2,000
Technicians                    1,h51   1,650   1,900   2,200   2,500   2,900
Other Maintenance Staff        3,069   3,500   3,850   4,o5o   4,250   4,600
Telephone Operators            1,767   2,000   2,250   2,500   2,750   3,000
Telegraphists                  1,081   1,150   1,200   1,300   1,450   1,630
AdIn-nistrative                2,h40   2,730   3,000   3,300   3,600   4,000
Accounts                          69       80      90      100     110      120
Semi-skilled and laborers      2,000   2,100   2,300   2,500   2,650   2,800
TOTAL         13,007  14,520  16,110  17,850  19,660  21,850
Staff per 100 DELs            22.5    22.0    20.7    19.4    18.1    17.1
2.        Against the anticipated growth in exchange lines at an annual
rate of 17%, the staff growth has been forecast at a lower rate of 11%.
The staff level (excluding telegraphists) will reduce from the present
22.5% per 100 DELs to 17.1% at the end of the project period. This level
will still be very high but BTT is constrained from making any drastic
reductions in its intake proportionate to system expansion by the Government
directive to maximize employment to overcome the present critical unemploy-
ment situation in the country.
3.        With automatic exchanges and sophisticated transmission equipment
as are proposed under the project, employmient of a large number of personnel
is counter-productive to the maintenance effort. Even in the external plant,



AMNEX 15
Page 2 of 2 pages
installation and repairs by higher grade technicians pay dividends by way
of less faults and consequently less maintenance, and greater customer
satisfaction. BTT management is aware of this aspect and therefore proposes
to gradually change the pattern of staff dispersion by recruiting more
trained engineers to fill the supervisory and technician cadres as required
by the sophisticated nature of the iew equipment to be installed under the
project. While the increase in the lower grade technical staff will be 50%
over the program period, the increase in officer and middle grade staff will
be 97%, increase for total staff being 68%.
Training
4.        BTT has at present two Telecommunication Training Centers (TTC)
at Dacca and [hulna, and six Divisional Traming Centers (DTC) at Dacca,
Chittagong, Comilla, Khulna, Kushtia and Rajshahi.
5.        The TTCs train officers, engineering supervisors and technicians.
While Dacca TTC concentrates on training for transmission equipment and of
telegraphists and teleprinter operators, the recently commissioned Khulna
TTC concentrates on switching equipment. Their present training capacities
are 1,800 and 1,,440 man-months per year; at a time some 270 staff can be
trained. This capacity would be insufficient to meet the increased demands
of training new recruits as also imparting refresher training to existing
staff on new equipment and techniques to be introduced under the project.
To meet the additional training requirements, the capacities of each of the
two TTCs are to be increased by about 480 man-months every year till the
combined total capacity of 7,500 man-months is reached. In addition, three
more TTCs each with an initial annual capacity of ,1,140 man-months are
proposed at Chittagong, Bogra and one more regional center. Three German
experts are working in the Khllna TTC. For Dacca TTC, UNDP has promised
assistance of seven experts.
6.        A Teleconmmunication Staff College is to be established in Bangladesh
with UNDP assistance. ITU will provide the necessary technical expertise.
The staff college will train officers and some higher categories of junior
staff. The staff college curriculum will include a course on financial
management in a telecommunication entity. The Government is also making
arrangements to obtain three experts in the specific fields of stores manage-
ment, billing and collection, and comercial management of the telecommani-
cation entity. These experts will set up the required organisation in BTT
and also impart training to junior staff in the respective fields.
7.        For the lower grade staff, there are six Divisional training
Centers (DTC).  These train telephone operators, mechanics, 3inemen and
cable jointers. Each has a training capacity of 240 man-months per year.
Daring the program period, it is proposed to equip each of the eighteen
engineering divisions with its own DTC and make them self-sufficient in
training requirements for lower grade staff.

BANGLADESH
BANGLADESH TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT (BTT)
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
Balance Sheet - Annex 18
Plant in Service and Depreciation
1.        BTT does not presently maintain a fixed asset register and does
not know the value of its fixed assets, nor are there records available to
allow the value to be ascertained. The value of gross plant in service as
of June 30, 1973 is estimated at Tk 630 million (US$84 million) and the
depreciation reserve at Tk 250 million (US$33.3 million), taking into
account the number of exchange lines, the major categories of plant and
the age, type and condition of the plant. This estimated valuation is
necessarily tentative and will be reviewed by the consultants and formally
established. Any difference between the estimated value and the actual
value will become relatively insignificant in the course of the expansion
program, as total net fixed assets are expected to triple by 1978. The
estimated depreciation reserve in 1973 is higher than normal - about 40%
of gross plant in service - and is due to the age of much of the plant
and the fact that relatively little plant has been added over the last
six years. The value of depreciation reserve beginning with 1974 is based
on depreciation computed on a straight-line basis using a composite rate
of 5% on average gross plant in service. This estimate is considered
realistic; the rate of 5% is approximately that which is found to be the
composite rate by other telephone operating entities based on the service
life of the various categories of plant in service.
Plant Under Construction
2.        Plant under construction as of June 30, 1973 is the value of
those works undertaken during the 18 months between January 1972 and
June 1973. It is assumed for the forecasts that the value of plant under
construction each year will be the sum of 50% of the construction program
of the previous year plus 100% of the construction program of the current
year.
Cash
3.        Cash balances are not shown until 1975 when it is assumed that
BTT will be converted from a Government department to a Board and will
maintain its own cash balances. Forecasts assume that cash will amount
to between four and six weeks' cash operating expenses.



ANNEX 17
Page 2 of 4 pages
Survscriber Accoumts Receivable
4    ~    The estimated amount of subscriber accounts receivable at the end
of :Lscal year 1973 was high, amounting to 30% of total revenue.  With a
more normal situation now prevailing in Bangladesh where action is better
arie to he taken against slow payers and also with outside assistance being
rrought in to review and make recommendations to improve the billing and
collection procedures, the amount of receivablesis expected to be  brought
down to a more normal level. Forecasts assume that receivables will
gradually decrease over the next four years until they reach a point in
1977 when they will be about 12% of total revenue.
Inventories
5.        BTT's estimate of inventories in stock at the stores and workshops
comprise the total amount of inventories. The amount of stores inventories
at the end of fiscal year 1973 is lower than would normally be the case due
to the lack of replenishment during and after hostilities. Forecasts assume
tha4 stores inventories will gradually build up to a more normal level during
the next four years and would amount to Tk 75 per DEL beginning in 1978.
The amoumt of inventories at the workshops, consisting of raw materials, is
on the high side as a result of deliveries made just prior to hostilities
whien producion was interrupted. Forecasts assume that these inventories will
increase annuallv at 10%.
Equity
o.        In establishing BTT's pro forma capital structure as of June 30,
1973, it is assumed that the amount of equity in the form of Government
investment is the balancing figure between the amount of total assets (net
of current liabilities) and the amount of long-term debt. Beginning with
1974, equity includes the annual net income transferred to retained earnings.
The transfer of the Cyclone Project assets to BTT in 1976 (see paragraph
3.0)l), is also reflected as equity in the form of Government investment.
Long-Term Debt
7 ~    Long-term debt as of June 30, 1973, totaling Tk 93.8 million,
consists of bilateral credits and grants in foreign exchange, mainly from
the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden and the UK, and from IDA Credit
303-BD. This long-term debt has been made available and serviced by
Government, but for this report it is assumed that BTT will service this
deit on a commercial basis (see paragraph 6.14).
ti.       Borrowings during the period of the program are as follows:
(a)   ilatberal credits and grants in foreign exchange, already
arranged, amounting to US$11.8 milLion equivalent, mainly
from Canada, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden
and UK;



ANNEX 17
Page 3 of 4 pages
(b)  bilateral credits and grants in foreign exchange amounting to
US$10.7 million equivalent, the sources of which are not
presently known (see below);
(c)  the remaining draw-down of IDA Credits 343-BD and 345-BD
amounting to US$5.6 million equivalent;
(d) Government loans in local currency amounting to T.c 360 million
(US$48 million) at 6-1/4% annual interest and a term of
15 years, including a 3-year grace period;
(e)  the proposed IDA credit of US$20 million equivalent; and
(f)  future borrowings of US$4.7 million equivalent.
9.        Similar to the long-term debt as of June 30, 1973, these foreign
exchange borrowings are assumed to be servicei by BTT on a commercial
basis, i.e., annual interest rate of 6-1/4% aid a tern of 25 years, includ-
ing a 5-year grace period. The local currency Government loans are shown
to be serviced on a shorter term than the foreign exchange credits in
order to repay Government as quickly as possible (see (d) above).
10.       With a total foreign exchange requirement of US$48 million
during the five-year period 1974-1978 for both the  ongoing works and
the four-year project, bilateral credits and grants of US$11.8 million
have alreacdy been arranged and together with borrowings under IDA Credits
343-BD and 345-BD amounting to US$5.6 million will cover all but about
Us$0.6 million of the foreign exchange requirement of US$18 million for
the ongoing works.  The project's foreign exchange requirement of US$30
million would be covered by the proposed US$20 million IDA credit, leaving
US$10 million yet to be covered. It is reasonable to expect that, as in
the past, bilateral credits would be available from such sources as the
Federal Republic of Germany in the case of materials and components for
the Siemens switching factory as well as allocations under future Bank
Group program credits to Bangladesh.
Current Liabilities
11.       Current liabilities include accounts payable, revenue received
in advance and current maturities. Accounts payable are forecast based
on one month's stores and worskhops inventories.  Reveime received in
advance consists of a two-month advance DEL rental payment in message
rate areas; forecasts are directly related to the nmber of DELs connected
in these areas.
Security Deposits
12.       Security deposits of Tk 250 are made in message rate areas for
each DEL connection. No interest is paid on these deposits and they are
refunded when service is discontinued.



ANNEX 17
Page 4 of 4 pages
Statements of Income - Annex 19
Telephone Revenue
Rental is in respect of DELs and extensions and has been
forecast on the basis of the planned average increase in connections.
Local call charges (including STD) have been forecast on the
basis of planned average increase in connections and traffic forecasts,
taking into account STD traffic stimulation.
Trunk - national and international - has been forecast on the
average increase in DELs and the increase in international circuits.
Installation fees have been forecast on the basis of the planned
number of DELs and extensions to be installed during the year.
Telegraph Revenue
Telegraph revenue is forecast to increase at 2% annually,
reflecting the expected diversion of telegraph traffic to Telex and STD.
Telex Revenue
Telex revenue forecasts are based on the plarned number of
telex connections to be working each year.
Miscellaneous Revenue
Revenue from miscellaneous sources includes annual charges paid
by Government for maintaining and operating the cyclone warning assets
and amounts to Tk 9.5 million in 1976 and Tk 19 million thereafter (see
paragraph 6.19). Other sources of miscellaneous revenue include directory
advertising, circuit rental and sale of scrap; this revenue is estimated
to increase 10% annually.
Expenses
Staff expenses are forecast to increase on the basis of planned
increase in DELs, but taking into account increased system automation as
well as increases in wages and cost of living allowances.
Maintenance is assumed to increase in proportion tc increase in
gross plant.
Other costs of operation consisting mainly of overheads and minor
works are forecast to increase In proportion to number of DELs.
Depreciation has been assumed at a composite rate of 5% on
average gross plant in service; this is a normal composite rate of
depreciation for teleccmmunications assets.
