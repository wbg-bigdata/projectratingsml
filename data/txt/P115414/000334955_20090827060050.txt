                   PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
                               FOR PROJECT PREPARATION AND IMPLEMENTATION


A) Background to the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)
1. The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) has applied for funds from the World Bank Nile Basin Trust Fund towards
   preparation of projects under the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action program (NELSAP). NELSAP
   prepares investment projects and builds sub regional capacity of the riparian countries to undertake downstream
   implementation of transboundary projects. NELSAP investments focus on two broad areas viz: power
   development and trade and natural resources management and development. Projects presently under
   implementation include fisheries management and development, hydropower generation, transmission
   interconnections, river basin management and development, and regional agricultural trade and productivity.
   The progress made in developing the first set of inter-country NELSAP projects has created increasing trust and
   a cooperative spirit amongst the member countries and the NELCOM (March 15, 2005), endorsed a strategy to
   scale-up current project activities and to identify new cooperative and consultative investments in new
   geographical areas and sectors. This Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) lays down the
   guiding principles and procedures for addressing environment and social concerns during the preparation and
   the implementation of NELSAP investment projects. It provides an outline of ESMF procedures which are
   operational within the NELSAP. The current document is preliminary as a detailed ESMF will be prepared
   during the second half of 2009 with a specific timeframe and budget.

B) Rationale and objectives for the ESMF
2. The ESMF seeks to (i) enhance positive and sustainable environmental and social outcomes associated with
   Project preparation and implementation; integration of environmental and social aspects associated with the
   numerous projects into the decision making process; (ii) minimize environmental degradation as a result of
   either proposed individual projects or their cumulative effects and (iii)minimize impacts on ecosystems.

3.   The objectives of the ESMF therefore include the following: (i) to establish clear procedures and methodologies
     for the environmental and social planning, review and approval of the projects to be prepared under
     NELSAP;(ii) specify roles and responsibilities, and outline the necessary reporting procedures, for managing
     and monitoring environmental and social concerns related to projects;(iii) determine the training, capacity
     building needed to successfully implement the provisions of the ESMF and (iv) establish the project financing
     required to implement the ESMF.

C) NELSAP experience with Environmental Assessments
4. The NELSAP experience in the use of ESMFs has been two fold. (i) In 2005, the Power sub program developed
   a Strategic Sectoral Social and Environmental Assessment for Power Development Options. The study provided
   an overview of the environmental and social challenges related to power development in the region and
   recommendations based on several criteria which included environmental and social impacts as well. (ii) Under
   the NEL coordinated WRD program, NELSAP has identified the need and plans to develop a framework for
   Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) to guide future project identification and preparation activities. The
   SEA will aid in the evaluation of environmental consequences of proposed projects as well as cumulative
   effects thereby ensuring that Environmental and Social issues at the macro level are appropriately addressed at
   the earliest appropriate stage of decision-making in concert with economic and social considerations.

D) National Policy frameworks for Environmental and Social Aspects
5. NELSAP operates within the confines of National Environmental legislation. This ESMF therefore recognizes
   the laws, regulations as well as national policies on environment and social issues and relevant World Bank
   safeguards. It supports due diligence to ensure consistent treatment of social and environmental issues for
   interventions to be prepared under the NELSAP projects. The ESMF includes procedures for screening all the
   projects to be prepared for environmental issues and impacts using national as well as International frameworks.
   A summary of the status of National Environmental Policy frameworks which have bearing on the project
   preparation are outlined in Appendix 1.

E) World Bank Operational Safeguards and implications for the projects
6. The World Bank's Operational Policies (OP) give guidance on Environmental Assessment (EA) requirements
   and ensure that operations of Bank financed projects do not lead to adverse impacts or cause any harm. The
   Environmental Assessment process includes the process of mitigating and managing environmental and social
   impacts throughout project implementation. The Environmental Assessment Sourcebook (1993) and its updates
   (1996, 1997) provide technical guidance on these issues. A synopsis of operational safeguards that have a
   particular bearing on project preparation under this ESMF include:(i) OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), (ii)
   OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats), (iii) OP 4.09 (Pest Management), (iv) OP 4.11 (Cultural Property), (v) OP 4.12
   (Involuntary Resettlement), (vi) OP 4.20 Indigenous People (vii) OP 4.36 (Forests), (viii) OP 4.37 (Safety of
   Dams), (ix) OP 7.50 (Projects in International Waterways) and (x) OP.760 (Disputed Areas). Details of the
   safeguards and their particular implication are outlined in Appendix 2.

F) Project Identification, Preparation and Approval procedures
7. Environmental Assessment procedure. Environmental Assessment (EA) is carried out to identify and predict
   impacts of proposals, policies, projects and operational procedures on the biophysical and social environment.
   For NELSAP projects, the EA process is carried out in five steps, which include 1) impact screening, 2)
   scoping, 3) prediction and mitigation, 4) management and monitoring and finally 5) auditing (monitoring and
   evaluation). A scheme showing the detailed EA procedure as applied to the NELSAP is shown as Appendix 3.

8.    Social Assessment Procedure. Social Assessment (SA) which is linked to the social and economic objectives of
      the NELSAP projects is conducted together with the Environmental Assessment. This ensures that the projects
      accomplish their social objectives (e.g. poverty reduction; reduction of environmental degradation;
      enhancement of the role of women in development; avoiding or mitigating negative effects on stakeholders and
      local populations, particularly vulnerable groups). The SA determines the social costs of the project and the
      degree to which the benefits are distributed in an equitable manner across affected populations. Aspects
      considered in the SA include: (i) social analysis; (ii) gender analysis; (iii) indigenous peoples; (iv) involuntary
      resettlement (including temporary or permanent compensation for loss of livelihood where actual resettlement is
      not required); (v) cooperation with non-governmental organizations; (vi) use of participatory development
      processes; and (vii) benefits monitoring and evaluation. As with the EA, analysis of social factors which
      influence (and are influenced by) a project continues throughout the entire life of the project. A table showing
      how the social dimensions are incorporated at various stages of the project cycle is attached as Appendix 4.

9.    Screening procedure. Screening is the first step in the ESMF process and involves identification of projects
      with little or no environmental or social issues so that they can move to detailed preparation in line with pre-
      approved standards or guidelines for environmental and social management. It determines whether or not an
      individual proposal requires detailed EA and the level of assessment that should occur. In determining whether
      a proposal requires further EA, should be rejected, or exempted, screening considers the alignment of the
      proposal with existing policies and plans, scale of the proposed development, intensity and significance of
      potential impacts. Other aspects include presence of natural habitats, cultural properties, environmentally
      sensitive areas, involuntary land acquisition, etc. Checklists (Appendices 5 and 6), together with information on
      typical project impacts and mitigation measures are used to categorize the projects as well as screen them. The
      checklist is used to identify potential impacts, and describe mitigation measures. The Initial Environmental
      Examination (IEE) report1 is the principle output from the screening process. The report classifies the project
      according to its likely environmental and social sensitivity, which determines whether an Environmental and
      Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) is needed and the required detail.

10. Project categorization. Projects are categorized according to the World Bank, screening procedure (World Bank
    Operational Policy (OP 4.01). The procedure classifies projects into one of three environmental assessment
    categories A, B and C, depending on the type, location, sensitivity and scale of the project and the nature and
    the magnitude of its potential environmental and social impact. (i) Category "A" projects potentially cause
    significant and irremediable environmental impacts; the projects require a full, detailed EIA, which needs to be
    approved before the Bank can give its support. (ii) Category "B" projects cause lesser impacts, which are often
    essentially remediable or can be mitigated; the projects require the implementation of an Environmental Impact

1
  The World Bank recommends that screening results should be recorded and explained in a Project Concept Document and Environmental Data Sheet including the
appropriate screening decision. Results are reviewed with specific regard to the type of EA instruments required, the general scope, public disclosure and consultation
requirements, schedule, and implementation arrangements. After screening, ToR for the proposed EIA type are prepared by the project proponent or financier.


                                                                                                                                                                     2

    Evaluation (EIE), which requires far less details than an EIA. And (iii) Category "C" projects have little or no
    environmental impact; the projects do not require an EIE or EIA.

11. Appraisal and Approval. The first step in an appraisal is to determine if all the relevant information has been
    provided, and if this information is adequate. If the appraisal indicates that the proposed project may have
    environmental concerns that are not adequately addressed in the proposal, the review authority may conduct a
    field appraisal before the application can be considered further. Based on the appraisal and, if needed, the field
    appraisal, the review authority may approve the projects with recommended conditions and implementation
    supervision. The procedure in the table below is used for appraisal and approval of projects.

12. Information disclosure. The ESMF and subsequent implementation plans as well as studies for investments are
    disclosed on the NBI website, riparian government websites (where applicable) and other public places
    accessible to the local people and NGOs in English and/French. The ESMF is also forwarded to the
    Bank/development partners sites for disclosure at the Public Information Centre/info shop of the country offices
    within the NELSAP countries.

G) Project Environmental and Social Management
13. Environmental Impact Assessment reports. For Projects listed in Category A or B, the Project preparation
    includes a Comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Report with an Environmental and
    Social Management Plan and a Monitoring Plan. The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is developed based on
    the level of social impacts of the project. A sample table of contents of a typical RAP is attached as Appendix 7.

14. Environmental Management and Resettlement Management Plans. For projects where explicit impact
    mitigations measures are required, an Environmental Management Plan (ESMP) is required. This Plan is part of
    the EIA report which is developed following the EA category. The ESMP is implemented by the PMU which
    also has the responsibility of monitoring and reporting. Community participation is required in the
    implementation and in the monitoring of the ESMP. Resettlement Management Plans if required are developed
    and their implementation ensured by the PMU in close partnership with the communities and local authorities
    for full compliance to national and international regulations.

15. Annual Reports. The PMUs through the NELSAP CU report bi-annually on project activities2. The reports
    capture experiences with implementation of the ESMF procedures (reporting format to be included in detailed
    ESMF) and guide on issues relevant for improving application and performance of the ESMF. The reports also
    inform the Nile Basin State of Environment.

16. Environmental and Social Reviews. While most Project activities have generic environmental and social issues
    that are manageable through guidelines, some could carry a higher risk of environmental and social disruptions
    and/or impacts. These projects are subjected to reviews to identify lower cost/impact options and mitigation
    measures in line with the prevailing legal framework and the Bank's safeguard policies. The ToR for such
    reviews are developed by the NELSAP CU in collaboration with the RPSCs. The reviews focus on the
    Environmental and Social Management Plans, resettlement Action Plans as well as implementation of the
    ESMF. An outcome of the reviews are approved project specific ESMPs.

17. Monitoring. The Environmental advisor is designated as the Environment & Social Safeguards officer to ensure
    compliance of the project activities with the World Bank safeguards as well as oversee implementation of
    environment and social provisions as per the ESMF, ESMP and RAP where applicable

18. Evaluation/Environmental Audit. Environmental audits are carried out to assess the extent of compliance of
    implementation to the ESMF. For the Projects in Category A or B, Environment Evaluation/Audit are carried
    out by independent consultants to assess the full compliance of the ESMP and RAP implementations with
    country's regulations as well as World Bank safeguards.

H) Participation and consultation
19. This ESMF is based on a strong participatory approach. Participation is undertaken following the NBI public
    participation and consultation model developed by the NBI Confidence building and stakeholder involvement
    project (attached as appendix 8). The model is formulated based on best practices in stakeholder participation
    and consultations through informing, consulting, engaging, collaborating and empowering stakeholders. The
    PMUs together with the implementing agencies, consult relevant stakeholders (including the affected
    communities and NGOs).

I) Roles, Responsibilities and Management Framework
20. Management Framework. The overall management framework, including roles and responsibilities for all
    parties in preparing, reviewing, approving and implementing the ESMF are given in detail in this section. This
    includes institutional arrangements for managing various aspects of the project cycle. The role of the key actors
    in implementing the ESMF are outlined below.

21. Regional Project Steering Committees (RPSCs). The riparian governments have constituted multi-sector core
    groups of riparian personnel called the RPSCs to provide strategic guidance and oversee the preparation of the
    projects on behalf of the riparian governments. The project areas for which preparation is done are identified by
    the countries through the RPSCs. The RPSCs work as an inter-governmental coordination mechanism convened
    on a regular basis for planning and monitoring the entire preparatory phase of the three projects including
    outputs of the ESMFs.

22. NELSAP CU. The primary responsibility for compliance with the ESMF rests with the Environmental Advisor
    and Social development officer supported by other staff under the Water Resources Development as well as
    Power Development programs. Overall quality assurance lies with the program officer responsible for WRD at
    the NELSAP CU. Short term consultants are however contracted when the need arises to prepare the mitigation
    plans, project-specific environmental management plans and/or resettlement action plans, quality assurance of
    reports or any other specific studies required. NELSAP ensures that service providers, tasked with preparation
    of the feasibility studies or development of specifications for products are given clear, focused terms of
    reference and specific guidance on how to carry out the necessary analyses to ensure that environmental and

                                                                                                                                  5

23. Project Management Units. Each of the RPSCs is supported by a secretariat (Project Management Unit (PMU))
    comprising technical personnel who oversee the implementation of project preparatory activities on a day to day
    basis. Consultants during project preparation are supervised by the three PMUs. Each of the PMUs with
    guidance from the Environmental Advisor and Social Development Officer are responsible for implementing
    the ESMF for projects agreed to be prepared. The PMU staff work closely with the consultants to determine the
    appropriate level of inputs on environment and social issues and support the development of standard
    guidelines, codes of practice, environmental and social review frameworks, as appropriate.

24. Development partners. During Project supervision, the World Bank/development partners assess the
    implementation of the ESMF and recommend additional measures for strengthening the management
    framework and implementation performance. The reporting framework, screening procedures and preparation
    of management and mitigation plans are discussed and agreed by the Bank team and implementing agencies
    during the early part of project preparation.

J) Capacity development
25. The environmental sustainability of the proposed projects to be prepared is highly dependent on the capacity of
    the implementing agencies to supervise the planning and supervision of service providers. The RPSC members
    for the three projects together with staff of the NELSAP CU and the PMUs have been trained in the use of SEA
    and EIA tools (courses organized by the NTEAP project). More training workshops are planned with financing
    from the NELSAP CU Institutional Strengthening Project. The NBI is also in the process of preparing
    Transboundary EIA Guidelines. These guidelines once adopted will unify EA procedures for effective
    implementation of projects.

26. In the recent past, capacity building needs assessments were undertaken by the various NELSAP projects in
    areas related to IWRM. The assessment considered (i) the adequacy of the institutional structure to address
    environmental management issues; (ii) the presence of qualified staff to carry out their responsibilities; (iii)
    resources to support staff in their work; and (iv) knowledge and experience relevant to carrying out IWRM
    analyses for water resources infrastructure. A synthesis for the environmental dimension resulted in the
    following areas (table below) as requirements for training to enable riparian countries to implement
    environmental procedures. The NELSAP Environmental and Social experts assisted by short term consultants
    will provide the training required. Specific customized modules will be devised after assessing the capabilities
    of the participants and the requirements of the projects. A costed plan complete with a schedule for
    implementing the capacity development plan will be developed in the detailed ESMF.

K) Implementation Time Frame and Budget for the ESMF
27. Implementation time frames as well as budgets for implementing the ESMF are project specific and include (i)
    training workshops (ii) Technical assistance to riparian staff from provisions under the NELSAP-ISP and (iii)
    costs related to short term consultancy for review of Environmental and Social Management as well as
    Resettlement Action Plans. The budgetary provisions for EA specific assessments are accommodated within the
    projects to be prepared. The budget for Environmental and Social assessments for projects under preparation
    will be disaggregated and presented in the detailed ESMF to be prepared in the second half of 2009.

L) Modification of the ESMF
28. Modification to the Framework. This is an interim ESMF and a detailed ESMF will be prepared in the second
    half of 2009. However an ESMF is a living document and based on the experience of its application and
    implementation, the provisions and procedures of this framework will be updated and modified from time to
    suit to the project activities.

Appendix 1             National Environmental Policy Frameworks

     a)    Uganda, National Environnent Management Policy, 19943. The National Environment Management Policy was
           adopted in 1994 as the overall government policy framework for the protection and conservation of the environment.
           The overall goal is "Sustainable socio-economic development which enhances environmental quality and resource
           productivity on a long term basis that meets the needs of the present generations without compromising the ability of
           future generations to meet their own needs." The policy seeks, to: (i) Set overall goals and key principles for
           environment management, and (ii) Provide a broad policy framework for harmonization of sectoral and cross-sectoral
           policy objectives, principles and strategies. Section 3.5, recognizes water as a major factor in the social-economic
           development of Uganda, and sets the policy objective as," To sustainably manage and develop the water resources in a
           coordinated and integrated manner so as to provide water of acceptable quality for all social and economic needs". The
           policy provides Guiding Principles and Strategies for implementation. of water resources projects.

     b)    Kenya, National Environment Management Policy [Ibid]. Kenya's efforts to develop a policy paper on environmental
           and natural resources management have not yet reached fruition. In 1999, the then Kenyan Ministry in charge of
           environmental management developed a Sessional Paper on Environment and Sustainable Development which has not
           progressed to date. The paper emphasizes the need for effective management of Kenya's resources and the
           conservation of the environment. The following strategic objectives are defined: (i) To create an enabling environment
           through policy, legal and regulatory reforms for environmental and natural resources management (ii) To protect,
           conserve, and sustainably manage the environment and natural resources. (iii) To generate knowledge and technologies
           and strengthen capacity towards sustainable management of the environment and natural resources (iv) To mainstream
           environmental concerns into overall planning and implementation of programmes and projects. The government
           Emphasizes sustainable and environmentally friendly development and as a deliberate and conscious policy, promotes
           sound environmental management for sustainable development.

     c)    Tanzania-National Environmental Policy (1997)4. The overall objectives of the Tanzania National Environmental
           Policy are: (i) To ensure sustainability, security and equitable use of resources for meeting the basic need of the present
           and future generations without degrading the environment or risking health or safety; (ii) To prevent and control
           degradation of land, water, vegetation, and air which constitute our life support systems; (iii) To conserve and enhance
           natural, including the biological diversity of unique ecosystems; (iv) To improve the condition and productivity of
           degraded areas including urban and rural settlements in order that all Tanzanians may live in safe, healthful, productive
           and aesthetically pleasing surroundings; (v) To raise awareness and understanding of the essential linkages between
           environment and development, and promote individual and community participation in environmental action; and (vi)
           To promote international co-operation on the environmental agenda, and to expand participation and contribution to
           relevant bilateral, sub-regional, regional programs, including implementation of treaties.

     d)    Burundi, Environment Regulation, 2000[Ibid]. In 2000 Burundi enacted an Environmental Code. Chapter III of the
           Environmental Code provides for the EIA process for projects or activities likely to effect the environment. Under the
           Environmental Code, environmental impact studies in respect of such projects or activities must be carried out. Article
           23 sets out the mandatory content of the environmental impact study and Article 34 specifically identifies dams as
           works that are subject to this procedure. The Environmental Code sets out the principles of enhancement of natural
           resources. Under Article 27, the Ministry of Land-use Management, Tourism and the Environment is given the power
           of enforcement of the Environmental Code in respect of the protection and enhancement of natural resources.

     e)    Rwanda Organic Law No. 04/20055. The Organic Law Determining the Modalities of Protection, Conservation and
           Promotion of the Environment in Rwanda ("the Environment Act") is the principal law on protection of the
           environment. It was passed in April 2005 to provide guidelines of protecting, conserving and promoting the
           environment in Rwanda. Its regulatory aims include conserving the environment, ensuring sustainable development
           that does not harm the environment as well as setting up strategies for protection of the environment. The Environment
           Act establishes the Rwanda Environment Management Authority as a body responsible for implementing government
           policy on environment, carrying out environmental monitoring on all development programmes and taking part in
           establishing procedures and safeguards to prevent damage to the environment.

     f)    D R Congo. The DRC does not have a central environmental law as environmental management laws are scattered
           within various instruments within several government ministries and agencies with many isolated legal text. Among the
           environmental management laws can be found the code the Mining Code No 007/2002 and the Forestry Code No
           012/2002 which clearly mention the need for EIA and ESMP to be implemented. Fishery policies and basic legislation
           for fishery institutions are also in place6.

-        Category A: Projects with potential for significant adverse environmental impacts. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) is required to address
      significant impacts.
-     Category B: Projects judged to have some adverse environmental impacts, but of lesser degree and/or significance than those for category A projects. An initial
      environmental examination (IEE) is required to determine whether or not significant environmental impacts warranting an EIA are likely. If an EIA is not
      needed, the IEE is regarded as the final environmental assessment report.
-     Category C: Projects unlikely to have adverse environmental impacts. No EIA or IEE is required, although environmental implications are still reviewed.
