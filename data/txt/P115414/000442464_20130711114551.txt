0.1. Introduction

1.      The project evaluated in this Implementation Completion and Results report (ICR) is one of
twenty-nine projects funded by the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), which are all part of a much larger
programmatic approach to support Nile cooperation. Because of the complementary and strategic nature
of the projects, it would be incomplete to either evaluate the individual projects in isolation of the overall
programmatic framework or fail to look at the role each NBTF project played in building Nile
cooperation. This preface provides an overview of the coordinated partner support to the Nile countries
through and in coordination with the NBTF, to provide background and context for the individual project
ICR that follows.

2.       The NBTF was created to support a trend of increasing cooperation in the Nile region. In 1995,
the Nile governments established the Nile Council of Ministers of Water Resources (Nile-COM) and
designed the Nile River Basin Action Plan, identifying 22 technical assistance projects which aimed to
address economic development and equitable use of the Nile waters. In 1999, the Nile-COM adopted a
long-term Shared Vision: to achieve sustainable socio-economic development through equitable
utilization of and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources. More specifically, Nile Ministers
adopted policy guidelines, “to develop the water resources of the Nile Basin in a sustainable and equitable
way to ensure prosperity, security and peace for all its people; to ensure efficient water management and
the optimal use of the resources; to ensure cooperation and joint action between the Nile Basin countries;
to target poverty eradication and promote economic integration; and to ensure that the program results in
a move from planning to action.?

                                     3.      In order to advance these policy guidelines, the Nile-COM
         Shared Vision               endorsed cooperation built around a Strategic Action Program with
                                     two complementary concepts: the need to enable a common basis to
        Shared
         Vision                      achieve the Shared Vision for the Nile Basin and the need to advance
       Program                       projects that benefited “the people and particularly the poor and
                                     disadvantaged in the Nile Basin.? As a result, Nile-COM endorsed
                    Subsidiary
                                     two programs: the Shared Vision Program (SVP) and the Subsidiary
                      Action
                     Program         Action Program (see Figure 1). First, the Shared Vision Program
                                     was designed to build trust, confidence, and an enabling environment
    Action on the Ground             for the sustainable and equitable use of the Nile resources among

                                     water professionals and the public. Second, as articulated by Nile-
         Early Nile Programs         COM, “a shared vision can only be legitimized by action on the
                                     ground,? the Subsidiary Action Program (SAP), one for the Eastern
Nile and one for the Equatorial Lakes, which focused on investment projects that addressed agricultural
needs, environmental risks, energy, and river management. To implement these programs, the following
year the Nile-COM ministers agreed to establish the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) as a transitional
institutional arrangement. At establishment, NBI’s member states were Burundi, Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda with Eritrea holding observer
status. Membership is now ten countries with South Sudan joining in July 2012.

4.       In 2001, the Nile Basin governments and international development partners convened for the
International Consortium for Cooperation on the Nile (ICCON) in Geneva to discuss the Nile Shared
Vision and the proposed programs, pledging US$140 million for their implementation. Based on the
interest expressed by the Nile-COM and partners at ICCON, a multi-donor funding mechanism, the Nile
Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), was established at the World Bank in 2003 with a consortium of ten
international donors3 to support the countries in their pursuit of the Shared Vision. Several donors also
supported the NBI directly in coordination with the NBTF. With this considerable partnership, overall
financial support to NBI has far exceeded the ICCON pledges.

                                                                        5.       Over the ten years, the NBTF supported
                                                                        twenty-eight completed NBI projects as part of the
                                                                        Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs, and
                                                                        an Institutional Strengthening Project. The last set of

                                                     establish the NBI as a transitional institutional

operate as a catalyst for integrated growth, investment and risk management to achieve the Shared Vision.
To carry out the Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs, the three NBI Centers were formed; the
NBI Secretariat in Entebbe, Uganda and two Subsidiary Action Program offices, the Eastern Nile
Technical Regional Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action
Program – Coordination Unit in Kigali, Rwanda (Figure 2).

Committee (NEL-TAC) provide governance services.

8.      Through the ten projects under the Shared Vision Program (SVP), the NBI has improved
collaboration within the Basin. The US$87 million Shared Vision Program was designed to build trust,
strengthen capacity, and advance the enabling environment for investment in the Nile Basin. The
program created networks and partnerships that brought people together across the Basin countries in
various water-related sectors. According to a 2008 opinion poll, 4the program created measurably greater
levels of trust among such stakeholder categories as lawyers, media professionals and women leaders.
Through work on joint projects on a range of critical issues, the SVP advanced a shared understanding of
the need for regional engagement between the countries, including in water resource management,
environment, wetlands, and regional power trade. The projects yielded a more organized knowledge
base, a Decision Support System (DSS) and other tools to better understand, model and analyze the basin,
an inventory of wetlands, plans for watershed management and regional power generation and
transmission, studies of agricultural productivity and opportunities for water savings, and trained over
2,000 professionals.

9.       The Shared Vision Program provided platforms to bring country officials together at the policy
and the technical level. Based on these platforms, technical cooperation was strengthened thereby helping
basin-wide processes and practices to be shared and consolidated. By establishing and managing a shared
institution, and by collaborating on development projects and risk-management strategies, the Nile Basin
countries established common principles, without which long-term cooperation would be difficult.
Various project teams are in continuing contact across countries, through other NBI projects, or other
initiatives. The NBI is also establishing an integrated policy environment, including a suite of policies
called the Nile Basin Sustainability Framework.

10.     The NBI centers have improved the collation, analysis, and access to information relating to the
Nile basin, including a procedures and norms for date and information sharing and exchange. The NBI
has helped foster greater exchange not only on the river itself but on energy, agriculture and trade
opportunities. NBI is a platform that can be used as a mechanism to notify each other of certain planned
development projects using Nile waters.

11.    Given its programmatic nature, the Shared Vision Program was reviewed by the World Bank in a
Programmatic Implementation Completion and Results Report in June 20105. The report reviewed the
achievements of the seven thematic projects as well as the umbrella coordination project (Table 1). The
Programmatic ICR found that the Outcomes, Bank performance and Grantee Performance were all
moderately satisfactory, with the risk to development outcomes being rated as substantial.

12.    While the outputs of many of the SVP projects were mainstreamed into other on-going initiatives,
two SVP projects implemented second phases; the Regional Power Trade Project which produced a
Comprehensive Basin-wide Study of Power Development Options and Trade Opportunities: Proposed
Development Options, Strategies and Investment Arrangements; and the Water Resources Planning and
Management Project extended the closing date until December 31, 2012 to complete the Nile Basin
Decision Support System - this second phase of support has been reviewed in a new ICR.6

13.      The Subsidiary Action Program helped identify and prepare investments of transboundary
significance to improve the livelihoods of the basin’s neediest populations and promote sustainable
growth through improved watershed management, flood preparedness, agricultural improvement, power
generation, and transmission. It also helped facilitate agreement among countries to move some
investments forward – such as the regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project that is expected to make a
significant contribution to access to power in Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania. The NBI facilitated
US$919 million of investment projects currently under implementation, with a further US$1.584 billion
under preparation (Table 2).

14.     In addition, Subsidiary Action Program has helped the countries to consolidate their knowledge
of the sub-basins and develop new tools and applications to help better identify and plan investments of
regional significance. The Eastern Nile Regional Technical Office (ENTRO) and NELSAP-CU have
provided studies and analysis to their member governments to improve planning and implementation of
regional sustainable development projects. The NBI issues regional flood bulletins with hydrological
forecasts for the Eastern Nile to assist national, regional and community authorities in predicting floods.
University networks, especially in the Eastern Nile, have been strengthened through collaborative studies,
internship programs, and workshops.

15.     Implementation Completion and Results reports have been prepared for two Subsidiary Action
Program Projects that closed in December, 2012, including the Regional Agricultural Trade and
Productivity Project Phase II7, and the Eastern Nile Planning Model Project8. The results of these
individual projects can be found in the individual ICRs.

            Figure 4. NBI Strategic Plan 2013-2017                  governments          committed          to
                                                                    incrementally increase their direct
financial contributions to the NBI to cover the core costs of the institution by 2017 (FY2018).

17.     The NBI has also developed a suite of Strategic Plans for each Center and a consolidated concept
note of projects for 2013 – 2017 which was presented to development partners in November 2011. The
overarching Strategic Plan, (Figure 4) shows how the NBI’s current work expands its original
programmatic structure including the Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs.

18.     As part of implementing the new Strategic Plan and building on other projects, the NBI prepared
the Nile Cooperation for Results (NCORE) Project. This project is supporting NBI activities in its three
core functions of facilitating cooperation, water resource management, and water resource development.

19.     The support provided through the ISP enabled results to be achieved across the NBI, including
the twenty-one other SVP and SAP projects that were undertaken by the NBI during ISP implementation,
as well as the subsequent work that was enabled by the ISP project. While a stand-alone ICR for the ISP
project has been produced9, the breadth of the ISP results can only truly be assessed when looking at the
successes and lessons of the other NBI efforts as well.

0.3. Other Programmatic Evaluations

20.     Given the historic nature of the approach of the Nile Ministers, as well as the lessons that can be
learned for future transboundary efforts, the World Bank and the Development Partners have recently
commissioned an Independent Evaluation of the Nile Basin Trust Fund. While the Independent
Evaluation is still being finalized, it assessed that the NBTF was a highly appropriate mechanism for
funding the NBI’s Strategic Action Program, and that the portfolio of projects was relevant to the
objectives of the NBI. It also highlighted areas needing further strengthening including sustainability and

communications. The lessons learned from the Independent Evaluation will provide a valuable
complement to the project level findings and lessons of the individual project ICRs.

0.4. Political track of activity

21.      In parallel to the technical activities being undertaken through the NBI, and outside the support
provided by the Nile Basin Trust Fund, the Nile governments undertook negotiations on the text of a
water agreement on the Nile, the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA). This was opened for
signature, with six Nile countries signing the agreement, although two opposed certain provisions. One
country to date has ratified. Disagreements over the text of the document and process by which the
document was opened for signature have affected the work of the NBI, with two countries freezing
participation in NBI regional activities pending the clarification of aspects of the disagreement. While the
political situation has lessened the impact of some of the technical activities undertaken by the NBI, the
NBI has found ways to continue to advance cooperation and to provide technical assistance to continue to
assist the Nile countries to assess transboundary issues associated with Nile water management and
development.

0.5. Conclusion

22.      International experience has demonstrated that building cooperation in large international river
basins requires sustained engagement over many decades. For Nile Basin governments, shifting from a
national orientation with limited collaboration to a regional approach was, and continues to be, a
significant challenge. The Nile Basin countries with NBI support have made strides in sharing
information, planning development programs and collaborating on investments. Today, the NBI has
strengthened its institutional capacity, partnerships, and regional processes as well as its tools and
procedures for cooperative water resources planning, development, and management in the Nile Basin –
these will further evolve as institutional structures evolve over time. This ICR is an evaluation of one
particular project as part of these overall inter-linked efforts to foster Nile cooperation and should be
viewed in this context.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1       Context at Appraisal

23.     Regional and Sector Context: The second phase of the Regional Agricultural Trade and
Productivity Project (RATP II) was prepared in 2009 under the Nile Basin Initiative’s (NBI)11 Nile
Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program (NELSAP). The project was conceived at a time when the
NBI was expanding several programs and activities to achieve its shared vision to “achieve sustainable
socio-economic development through the equitable utilization of and benefit from the common Nile Basin
water resources?.

24.    Several interconnected issues in the Nile Basin confronted by NBI member countries led to the
conceptualization, design and implementation of the project:

         A number of Nile Basin countries were characterized by extreme poverty and consequently, food
          insecurity in the Basin continued to remain a widespread and pervasive issue;

         In the Nile Bain, agriculture was (and continues to be) a major production sector with enormous
          potential for growth that remains a primary source of income for a majority of the poor - as a
          result, the Basin countries anticipated the launching of major investments aimed at irrigation and
          agricultural development as a means to ensure food security;

         Given that agriculture is a major water user, the Basin countries had correctly realized that the
          efficient use and management of agricultural water would greatly influence their long term
          success in food and water security at both the national and Basin levels;

         The NBI and its member countries were aware and concerned about possible serious water
          resources challenges in the future as a result of rising populations, improving standards of living,
          and potential negative effects of climate change;

         The demand for water was gradually increasing due to interventions that included: (i) ambitious
          national agriculture investment plans called for under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture
          Development Programme (CAADP); (ii) concurrent and increasing investments by the World
          Bank in irrigation development in the Basin countries – ongoing in Egypt, Ethiopia, Tanzania,
          Rwanda, Kenya, and planned in Uganda and Burundi; and (iii) several other initiatives being
          undertaken by the Regional Economic Communities (REC) and Regional Community Groups
          (RCG)12 to expand commercially oriented crops and livestock products in the Basin; and

         The integration of agricultural water demand and use into overall integrated water resources
          planning and management at the Basin level was an emerging need.


11
   The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) is a transitional inter-governmental organization dedicated to equitable and sustainable management and
development of the shared water resources of the Nile Basin. NBI Member States include Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. Eritrea participates as an observer.
12
   The Regional Economic Communities (RECs) are East African Community (EAC), Common Market for East and South Africa (COMESA),
African Union - Inter-African Bureau of Animal Resources (AU-IBAR) and the RCGs are East African Grain Council (EAGC), and Horticultural
Council of Africa (HCA).


                                                                    9
25.      At the operational level, these issues highlighted the need for the NBI to develop capacity in
information and knowledge systems on rainfed and irrigated agriculture, and decision support analytical
tools (called Decision Support Systems – DSS) to guide decisions on basin water resources use and
management. A DSS is a customized computer model that is designed with the ability to analyze data
and present the outcomes of the analysis both in qualitative and quantitative forms. DSS outputs provide
user friendly layouts to guide and support policy and operational decisions around competing water uses
and priorities in a particular basin or sub-basin. A DSS can provide valuable input for both long-term
multi-sectoral planning and immediate development of specific infrastructure (i.e. irrigation, hydropower,
water supply and sanitation).

26.     Building an irrigation and agricultural trade knowledge base and developing a DSS that
incorporates agriculture water were necessary to be able to:

                a. Anticipate and weigh the emerging water demand and use for different subsectors in the
                   basin;

                b. Understand strategic and technical options for promoting more efficient and sustainable
                   use of water resources and economically viable investments in agriculture;

                c. Analyze and understand issues of resources and economic trade-offs between different
                   uses of water (e.g. hydropower and irrigation);

                d. Guide the Basin countries in their investment decisions by taking into account early the
                   increasing opportunity cost of basin water as early as possible at appraisal stages of
                   agriculture investment projects that would demand increasing use of the basin water
                   resources;

                e. Minimize the risk of economic benefits forgone and maximize shared benefits at basin
                   level relative to possible expansion of irrigated agriculture and agriculture trade; and

                f.   Promote and ensure efficient water management practices and monitor the water use.

27.      Additionally, NBI was keen to explore the potential role of agriculture trade as a trigger to
enhance agriculture production and agricultural productivity while ensuring efficient use of the basin’s
water resources. As agricultural trade expands in the Nile Basin, there is a need to identify issues and
constraints related to it, understand different agricultural commodities and their trade potential (including
high value crops grown under irrigated conditions), and explore opportunities and options for promotion
and investment. Addressing these strategic concerns leads to the continuing need for adequate data,
establishing a solid knowledge base on agriculture trade, and decision support tools to assist in the
analysis of both water resources management and economic implications of trade in the basin.

28.     At the time of project design and appraisal, a draft Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA)13
for the Nile Basin envisioned the establishment of a permanent basin institution to succeed the NBI.


13
 The CFA was in draft form at project appraisal. It was signed in 2010 by six countries – Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and
Uganda. To date, it has only been ratified by Ethiopia.


                                                                    10
While the mandate of the NBI in basin water resources management was clear, there was a growing call
to clarify and define the role of the NBI or its successor institution on agriculture development and trade.

29.     The approach taken by RATP II included a certain amount of risk for the NBI as agriculture was
arguably not the highest priority at the time for an emerging regional organization. In developing and
seeking finance for the project, the NBI countries demonstrated a foresighted approach to providing
regional technical assistance in emerging areas with significant growth potential.

30.      Rationale for Bank Involvement: It was in this context that the Basin countries, through the
NBI, requested the World Bank in 2007 to help integrate irrigated agriculture production and agricultural
trade into the basin water management agenda. It was agreed that the NELSAP would prepare a Technical
Assistance (TA) Project to be financed with Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF) Resources – RATP II. The
Bank’s rationale for engagement in this project was strong and justifiable: the Bank had pioneered
cooperation and integrated water resources planning and management in several international river basins;
since 1999, it had been actively engaged in the facilitation of regional cooperation in the management of
water resources of the Nile; as trustee to the NBTF14, the Bank was one of the NBI’s largest development
partners and had been financing both technical assistance and investment preparation as well as
supporting the Nile Basin institutions through advocacy, supervision and technical assistance; the Bank
has an active lending and AAA program in related sectors in most NBI countries; and the Bank was also
well-positioned technically to support water resources management and agricultural development in the
riparian countries with its long experience in dealing with agriculture, water resources and trade.

31.     The project was a result of the long standing strategic dialogue between the Bank, the NBTF
Development Partners, and the NBI in order to promote regional cooperation in water resources
management. The Bank’s dialogue and technical inputs facilitated and shaped the thinking of the NBI to
design and implement the project in order to address the strategic and operational issues.

32.     RATP Phase I (RATP I) was implemented over a one year period from April 2008 to April 2009
to carry out background analysis, identify the scope of the larger project, carry out stakeholder
consultations, and design the project. RATP II, which is the focus of this ICR, was implemented over
three years from November 2009 to December 2012. The Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA), on behalf of the NBTF Development Partners, took on the role of lead partner for project
preparation and implementation. CIDA also provided a consultant who participated in preparation and
supervision missions with the World Bank Task Team.

1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

33.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to “increase knowledge of Basin agriculture in Nile
Basin institutions, to promote more efficient and sustainable use of water resources and economically
viable investment in agriculture.?


14
 Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), was established in 2003 at the request of the Nile Basin Council of Ministers of Water Resources (NILE-
COM). The NBTF is a funding mechanism that helps administer and harmonize donor partner support pledged to the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI).
Donors that contribute through the NBTF include: Canada, Denmark, European Commission, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
United Kingdom and the World Bank.



                                                                    11
34.        The Project Outcome Indicators are:

          Options for NBI agricultural agenda presented to the NBI governing bodies;

          Analytical tools developed and information disseminated to increase water use productivity in
           Basin agriculture; and

          Analytical tools developed and information disseminated to promote agricultural trade in the Nile
           Basin.

35.    The linkage of the project outcome indicators with the project components and their intermediate
outcomes and indicators are shown in section 3.2 and in Annex 6.

1.3        Key Indicators and reasons/justifications

36.        The PDO remained unchanged throughout project implementation.

37.     Three intermediate outcome indicators related to Component 2 of the project were modified at the
Mid-Term Review (MTR), which was carried out in July 2011, as detailed in Table 3, below. In addition
“Direct Project Beneficiaries? as a World Bank core sector indicator was added as a PDO results
indicator. However, no formal restructuring was done to modify the indicators and the Implementation
Status Report (ISR) following the MTR reflected these changes.

1.4     Main beneficiaries

38.     The Project Appraisal Document did not explicitly identify the beneficiaries of the project, but it
was implied in the PDO statement that the main targeted beneficiary would be the NBI, its future
successor institution, and the Nile Basin countries. In retrospect, however, it is clear that the outcomes
and the knowledge products generated would benefit stakeholders directly and indirectly at four different
levels:

            a. At the international level: other River Basin Organizations (RBOs) and development
               partners would benefit from the planned dissemination of selected knowledge products -
               these products would provide different options on the role of RBOs in basin-wide
               agricultural development, agriculture trade, and integrated water resources planning and
               management;

            b. At the regional level: all the Nile Basin Institutions (including a future RBO) as well as
               other institutions in the Great Lakes region, would benefit from a DSS model enriched
               with comprehensive data and information on irrigation and agriculture, different options
               for engagement in the agricultural and irrigation sectors; along with various analytical
               tools such as the virtual water/water footprint and commodity corridor studies;

            c. At the national level: concerned sector ministries of all the Basin countries would benefit
               from knowledge on the country’s irrigation potential, agriculture sector, and options for
               regional agriculture trade; and

            d. At the local level: communities, farmers’ cooperatives and water users associations, and
               development partners, including nongovernmental agencies (NGO), would benefit from
               the knowledge of best practices on efficient water management through water harvesting
               and irrigation.

39.      The final ISR reported 350 direct project beneficiaries that included regional project staff, Project
Steering Committee, and other key officials and stakeholders in the NBI Countries. It is difficult to
quantify the number of actual and potential indirect beneficiaries. These include the World Bank and
other international financial institutions engaged the development of national and regional investments in
irrigation and agricultural trade; regional bodies like the East African Community, NBI, and Lake
Victoria Basin Commission; national ministries such as planning, water, irrigation, and trade; local
farming, water user, and trade associations; academic institutions; and the private sector.

1.5     Original Components

40.     The project included four components.

            a. Component 1: Defining NBI’s core agricultural functions (total appraisal budget
               US$0.64 million – actual expenditures US$0.28 million): This component aimed to:
               (a) define agriculture-related core functions for NBI based on a regional public goods
               framework, critical assessment of agricultural functions in other RBOs of interest, and
               lessons and recommendations from first generation NBI projects; (b) consult with
               national and regional stakeholders in order to inform them on the main findings and
                                                   13
                conclusions, to tailor future institutional design to the current institutional settings in NBI
                countries; (c) develop a consensus on study recommendations; and (d) prepare and
                disseminate information materials on NBI functions and related services and
                opportunities.

            b. Component 2: Supporting productive water use in Basin agriculture (total appraisal
               budget US$2.17 million– actual expenditures US$2.50 million): This Component
               aimed to: (a) integrate Basin agriculture into Basin strategic water resource planning and
               management; (b) generate utilizable knowledge on irrigation potential in Nile Equatorial
               Lakes Basin; and (c) generate and dissemination of knowledge of best practices on water
               harvesting.

            c. Component 3: Incorporating agricultural trade into Basin water resources
               management (total appraisal budget US$1.48 million– actual expenditures US$1.56
               million): This Component aimed to: (a) establish and integrate agricultural trade data and
               information in the Basin strategic water resources planning and management; (b)
               facilitate policy and investments indicated along selected transboundary agricultural trade
               corridors; and (c) introduce the concept of virtual water trade as a tool for water resource
               decision making.

            d. Component 4: Project management and Monitoring and Evaluation (total appraisal
               budget US$2.44 million– actual expenditures US$2.32 million): This component
               aimed to support project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and
               dissemination of outputs.

41.     The Intermediate Outcomes and Intermediate Outcome Indicators for the Components are
presented in Section 3.2 and Annex 6.

1.6     Revised Components

42.     None of the project components were restructured during implementation.

1.7     Other significant changes

43.     At the request of the NBI, the Grant closing date was extended by two months from October 30,
2012 to December 31, 2012 to allow sufficient time to complete and disseminate the studies that were
well advanced.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

44.      Soundness of Background Analysis: As mentioned earlier, the NBI and the Bank decided to
have two phases, one for the preparation and design (Phase I) and the other for the implementation of the
project (Phase II). Phase I began in April 2008 as Regional Agricultural Trade and Productivity Project


                                                     14
(RATP I) through a Grant funding (Grant No. TF091609 for US$1 million approved on April 29, 2008
and implemented from April 2008 to September 2009).

45.      It was a sensible decision by the NBI, the NBTF governing committee, and the Bank to have two
distinct phases for the project as opposed to the conventional approach of having a single phased project.
As a result, the RATP II was prepared and designed with extensive pre-project background analysis and
stakeholder consultations and validations. Project formulation was conducted in a participatory manner
engaging NELSAP-CU staff, high level policy and operational staff from the ministries and departments
of water resources and irrigation, agriculture, and trade and commerce of the NBI member, and several
non-governmental entities (RECs and RCGs) who would later be involved in the project implementation
on agricultural trade related aspects. The background studies conducted were: (a) a literature review of
“Needs and Opportunities for Agricultural Trade and Productivity in the Nile Basin Region?; (b) a
scoping study on “Agriculture Cross Border Trade Corridors in the Nile Basin?; (c) a literature review on
“Defining NBI Core Agricultural Agenda for the Future Nile Basin Organization?; and (d) scoping study
on “Needs and Opportunity Assessment on the National and Regional Commodity Groups?. These pre -
project background studies combined with extensive stakeholder consultations formed the basis and
direction for scoping and defining the objectives, components, project development outcomes and outputs
in the final project design.

46.     The preparatory phase was highly beneficial strategically, institutionally and technically for both
the quality at entry and the implementation of the project. At the time, many Basin countries were
anticipating large investments in irrigation and agriculture development in their individual countries.

47.      Phase I provided resources and time to the NBI and NELSAP-CU to manage the expectations of
the Basin countries and convince and build consensus among the country stakeholders that sound
preparatory and analytical work would be necessary before the NBI and the countries could properly
embark upon the preparation of such large investment operations. Phase I also provided space and
resources to: (a) carry out basin wide consultations and create awareness on the sector and basin wide
issues among the riparian countries as well with the stakeholders such as RECs; (b) identify the scope of
and build ownership and commitment for the RATP II; (c) design RATP II based on background
analytical work and consultations; and (d) set up organizational and institutional structures for its
oversight, coordination, and implementation.

48.      Strategic Relevance: The project’s strategic relevance to the major sector issues identified at
appraisal was appropriate as outlined in Section 1.1. The PAD articulated these sector issues clearly thus
providing a firm foundation for the design of the project’s scope and its desired outcomes. Additionally,
RATP II was designed as an instrument to fill the knowledge gaps by building, complementing and
supplementing knowledge that had already been generated by past projects or knowledge or that would be
generated by other NBI projects that were being implemented at the time of appraisal. Those projects
included: (i) Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP); (ii) Water Resources Planning and Management
Project (WRPMP); (iii) Efficient Water Use for Agricultural Production Project (EWUAP); (iv) The Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Nile Project; and (v) Socio-economic Development and Benefits
Sharing Project (SDBS). Strategic and technical linkages of RATP II’s design with other completed and
ongoing projects are detailed in Annex 3.


                                                    15
49.      Overall Project Design: Although the project appeared to be a small TA study of US$7 million,
it was a complex operation that involved decision makers and other stakeholders at policy making and
operational levels as well as a large number of organizations and institutions including multi-sectoral
ministries of the ten NBI member countries, the NBI Secretariat, NELSAP-CU, Nile Equatorial Lakes
Technical Advisory Committee (NELTAC), the Regional Project Steering Committee (RPSC), and
private sector agriculture trade organizations to produce a number of knowledge products in a
participatory, consultative and consensus building manner. Therefore, while the design of the project and
its implementation arrangements were demanding and complex, they were also reasonable and
appropriate. However, implementation of RATP II was limited to three years because all NBTF financed
activities were required to close by December 2012 due to the original NBTF closure date of June 201315.
Therefore the project was designed to produce selected knowledge products and tools but not to make
changes in the existing policies, institutions and decision making processes in the water resources
management in the basin using that knowledge and tools. The knowledge products planned under the
project components (See Annexes 6, 7, and 8) were well aligned to address the sectoral issues highlighted
in the PAD as outlined above. The inputs and outputs of the four project components appropriately
supported the overall development outcomes of the project.

50.      Project Implementation Arrangements Design: The project implementation structure included
the division of implementation, coordination and oversight responsibilities among a large number of
entities: (i) the Project Management Unit (PMU) at Bujumbura, Burundi was in-charge of day-to-day
management of the project; (ii) NELSAP-CU at Kigali, Rwanda was responsible for facilitation and
supervision of the project implementation, quality control of the studies, ensuring compliance with NBI
operational rules and procedures, and facilitation of linkages with NBI governing bodies, and other
ongoing and planned projects and programs in the Nile Basin countries; (iii) National Liaison Officers
(NLOs), who were technical experts appointed by each basin country from the ministries of agriculture or
irrigation and water resources management, were responsible for facilitation of data collection,
consultation and dissemination of study findings and results in the countries; (iv) RPSC, consisting of two
representatives from the ministries of irrigation and water resources, and agriculture and trade, was
responsible for overall strategic and technical guidance to the PMU; and (v) NELTAC, consisting of
designated senior officials of the Ministries of Irrigation and/or agriculture of each basin country, was
responsible for project oversight and technical guidance to the project and advise NEL Council of
Ministers (NELCOM) on project implementation. Additionally, three RECs namely Eastern Africa Grain
Council (EAGC), Horticultural Council of Africa (HCA), and The African Union-Inter-Africa Bureau of
Animal Resources (AU-IBAR) participated in the implementation of Component 3.

51.      This project was a multi-sectoral, multi-country and multi-partner TA operation aimed to
generate several crucial knowledge products. The knowledge base was to be developed with inputs from
expert international consultants and from agencies such as RECs and RCGs. It was then to be validated
through consultation among ministries of irrigation/water resources, agriculture, trade and finance and
planning from NBI countries. It should be noted that at the time of design and appraisal, Ethiopia was
fully included in the project, though they had not yet joined NELSAP. While the design of organizational

15
   In 2011, the Bank and the NBTF Donor Partners extended the NBTF through June 2015; however, at the time of the extension, the Partners
stipulated that all on-going NBTF Projects would be closed, as planned, by December 31, 2012. After that date, only one NBTF financed project,
the new Nile Cooperation for Results Project (NCORE), which became effective in February 2013, would be under implementation.


                                                                     16
structure and arrangement for the project implementation, coordination and oversight appears complex at
a glance, given the unique nature of the project and its implementation challenges, the design was
appropriate. In retrospect, the design worked effectively and proved complementary for the satisfactory
implementation and delivery of its planned outputs. This fact confirms that, by and large, the design of
the project content, the planned deliverables, and the implementation arrangement and mechanism is
compatible with the capacity of the project implementation entities.

52.      While the PMU of Phase 1 was located in Kigali, Rwanda, one of the important project design
considerations was the choice of location for the PMU of the RATP II between Nairobi, Kenya; Kigali
Rwanda; and Bujumbura, Burundi. Because the location of the PMU was considered important for
efficient project implementation, the NBI conducted an independent study to decide the best location for
the PMU. The study weighed several important strategic, operational and cost factors which were critical
for RATP’s successful implementation and achievement of the development objectives. Bujumbura was
chosen because the study indicated that it was the least cost location and the Government of Burundi
made a strong request to host, as Burundi had yet to host a regional NBI activity16. The NBI adhered to
the recommendation to locate the PMU at Bujumbura despite concerns of the Bank that the Nairobi
location would be more favorable in terms of better facilities, regular air flights, speedy air and internet
connectivity, and the presence of the headquarters of some implementing partners. The Government of
Burundi remained strongly committed for and engaged in the project activities throughout its
implementation. At completion there is a general consensus among the implementing partners that the
Nairobi location would not have made a significant difference in the quality and timeliness of the outputs,
operational costs, and visibility of the project. The decision to locate the PMU at Bujumbura was in the
right direction as it provided a sense of recognition and inclusiveness of Burundi as an important member
of the NBI.

53.      Incorporation of Lessons Learned in the Design: The project design and preparation also
benefitted from an assessment of lessons learned from other regional NBI projects. The lessons
incorporated included the need to: (i) produce guidance for NBI’s future institutional direction; (ii)
understand the African agriculture development potentials and trends in the context of regional and basin
water use and management; (iii) contribute to NBI-wide policies, procedures and information; (iv)
continue to generate and disseminate information, technologies and best practices building on the
initiatives of Shared Vision Program (SVP) projects already closed; (v) foster strong collaboration with
and support from other regional institutions of the Nile basin; and (vi) integrate stakeholder engagement
and communication throughout implementation.

54.      Implementation Readiness: Several key critical implementation arrangements were established
under the Phase I and were ready before the commencement of the project: the PMU had been established
with a full time Project Manager but it still required full staffing and facilities; awareness creation
activities among potential stakeholders were ongoing; collaborating institutions were identified; the RPSC
was established and functional; a detailed project implementation manual was prepared; and a
comprehensive financial management capacity assessment was completed. Therefore, the Phase II started
as a natural continuation of Phase 1.

16
  At this point, all NBI member countries except Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo had hosted either an SVP Project and/or one of
the SAPs.


                                                                    17
55.     Shortcomings of the Project design: There were several shortcomings of the project design,
which contributed to the implementation delays in the first year, particularly in the period immediately
following effectiveness:

            a. The original results framework did not include indicators to measure the number of
               project beneficiaries and the level of building capacity and/or level of uptake of the
               knowledge generated by the project.

            b. The scope of the largest study of the project (the basin wide agriculture model under
               Component 2) was not fully clear and consequently the PMU had to carry out an
               additional “Gap Analysis Study? before it could finalize the terms of reference (TOR) for
               that study.

            c. The proposed scope for establishing the agriculture data base was found to be too
               ambitious and had to be significantly scaled down during the implementation.

            d. There was lack of clarity on the roles and responsibilities of some project implementation
               partners (See section 2.2) which resulted in initial implementation delays.

            e. Assessment of the core technical staffing requirements was deficient.

            f.   The Bank’s team did not carry out a project specific procurement assessment of the PMU
                 because the Bank was engaged with multiple on-going projects with NELSAP-CU.
                 Procurement administration was delayed in the first 9-10 months of implementation
                 primarily due to poor supervision on the part of the Bank and the technical capacity of the
                 PMU. Consequently, the Bank carried out a project-specific procurement capacity and
                 procurement training needs assessment in June 2010, resulting in training for the PMU
                 that proved helpful in improving the capacity issues and accelerating the procurement
                 processing thereafter.

            g. The project budget was dictated by the NBTF funds available rather than by an actual
               costing of the demand.

56.     A new Task Team Leader (TTL) was assigned for the project immediately after approval. This
change coincided with the timing of the project’s transition from the preparation phase to the
implementation phase and resulted in a breakdown of institutional memory, working relationships and
networks built and established by the outgoing TTL between the Bank and the Client during the
preparatory phase. This change affected the Client’s readiness for project implementation

57.      Risk Assessment and Mitigation Measures: Annex 5 provides a reassessment of the project’s
risks at completion. The overall project risk was rated as “Low? and in retrospect, the rating was realistic.
Most of the risks identified at appraisal carried “Low? risk ratings provided the proposed risk mitigation
measures were applied. The proposed risk mitigation measures were adopted and were effective in
maintaining a Low risk rating throughout its implementation until the project closure. The procurement
capacity was rated “High? at appraisal and unfortunately a project specific procurement assessment was
not conducted at that time (see paragraph 31.f, above). But the Bank’s team recommended and then
provided intensive procurement training to project staff and that intervention was helpful to overcome
                                                     18
capacity issues and speed up the procurement administration and deliver the contracts later. As a result,
the procurement risk rating remained “Moderate? during the implementation.

58.     Project Duration and Exit Strategy: Most of the project outputs were delivered around the time
the project was scheduled to close, leaving insufficient time to consolidate and further refine the quality
of the outputs. It would have been beneficial if the project had had at least another 6 months available to
refine and consolidate the outputs, and initiate post completion action to provide hands on training to the
staff on the application of the analytical models and ensure uptake and sustainable use of the project
outputs. However, the decision to limit the project life to three years was understandable at the design
stage, because of the scheduled closing of the NBTF. Also, it would have been beneficial if the project
design had included an exit strategy to ensure sustainable use of the project outcomes, provide further
dissemination and hands on training on the tools, and integrate the knowledge and the recommendations
systematically into concurrent and upcoming programs and projects. Lack of an exit strategy is a one
major shortcoming that makes the quality of project design moderately satisfactory.

2.2     Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory

59.      Project Start up: The project had a slow start up and the implementation progress was poor in
the first year for several reasons, some of these issues affected the implementation in the second year as
well, but the project implementation picked up at the end of the first year and maintained at satisfactory
levels thereafter until closure.

60.      Implementation Delays in the First Year: The project faced significant implementation delays
in the first year due to a number of reasons. The Bank’s TTL who was actively engaged and responsible
for the preparation of Phase II was changed immediately after the Approval in October 2009. The quality
of project supervision by the second TTL was unsatisfactory. Consequently, the quality and timeliness of
the project implementation supervision in the first year of its implementation was deficient and this status
has been recorded in the Aide-memoire of the first implementation supervision mission. The loss of the
institutional memory and the working relationship established during preparation resulted in weakened
communication between the Bank and the project team during the first year. Also, the new TTL and
project team failed to recognize the implementation issues in a timely manner or take adequate measures
to overcome those issues. The Bank’s guidance and inputs to the PMU for the finalization of the T ORs,
review inputs and no objection clearances for procurements were inadequate and significantly delayed.

61.      Once Bank management became aware of the delays and poor performance, a new TTL was
appointed. Unfortunately, it took almost one year for this to happen and by then one third of the
implementation period had elapsed. The quality and timeliness of the project implementation supervision
improved significantly in the second and third year under the third TTL. Additionally, the full
establishment of the PMU at Bujumbura took a few months after approval in October 2009 and the key
PMU staff was not on board until March 2010. Weak communication links between the Bujumbura-
based PMU, the Kigali-based NELSAP-CU and Bank/NBI procurement staff based in Kampala also
affected early project implementation.

62.       Implementation Issues in the Last two Years: Several other factors affected implementation in
the last two years too, but the Bank’s Task team and the project implementing partners (NELSAP-CU and
                                                    19
the PMU) were able to overcome most of those issues successfully. Those include: (a) weak technical
linkages between the project and the Institutional Design Study (IDS), that was being prepared by the
NBI under the Nile Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP); (b) lack of clarity and understanding among
the NBI institutions on the agricultural role of the NBI made it initially difficult to engage, or keep
informed, all the Nile countries in the project activities; (c) poor coordination between the NBI Secretariat
and NELSAP-CU weakened the efforts to ensure stronger linkages between the project’s work on the
NBI’s core agriculture functions and role and the ISP; (d) responsibilities of the RCGs and the definition
of their role with respect to the consultancy for the Cross Border Trade Study were not fully clear; (e) the
procurement for the largest study under the grant, the basin-wide agricultural model (Component 2), was
put on hold pending a Gap Analysis study that would lay the groundwork for the model, because the need
for additional gap analysis was not identified during the preparation; and (f) several additional individual
technical consultants were needed by the PMU to guide and oversee the consultancies, and these staffing
requirements were identified only half way through the implementation, resulting in their delayed
recruitment.

63.      Factors Contributed to Satisfactory and Timely Completion of the Project: Several factors
contributed to the satisfactory overall implementation of the project: (i) most of the project oversight and
coordination bodies such as RPSC and NELSAP-CU were in place and functional at the inception of the
project; (ii) starting from the end of the first year, the Bank’s inputs were intensified and maintained at
satisfactory level; (iii) the Bank conducted implementation support and review missions regularly (six
altogether including the MTR); (iv) the last four Bank implementation review missions and their
recommendations focused explicitly on results and outputs and on resolving major implementation issues;
(v) the Bank’s team and the PMU reviewed and adjusted project budgets among the components
periodically during the last four missions as the project commitments and budget requirements became
clearer with the awarding of the major contracts; (vi) NELSAP-CU and RPSC were actively engaged in
project oversight and quality assurance of the TORs and interim reports at every stage of consultancy
studies; (vii) the PMU closely attended to the actions recommended by the Bank’s implementation review
missions to overcome implementation bottlenecks; (viii) the Bank’s team and NELSAP-CU closely
monitored the timely compliance of the recommended agreed actions; (ix) the PMU conducted national
consultations (covering Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, DR Congo, Ethiopia and Tanzania) to improve the
output of the major consultancy studies timely; (x) The Bank’s team provided timely review comments
and no objection clearances on the TORs, miscellaneous procurement administration matters, and interim
reports at various stages of the consultancies; and (xi) the NELSAP-CU coordinated the project activities
effectively with the partnering countries that helped the facilitation of data collection and consultations
for and dissemination of the knowledge products.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), Design, Implementation and Utilization
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.      M&E Design and Implementation: M&E design and implementation was moderately
satisfactory. The technical assistance nature of the project did not demand an intensive M&E design,
instead a simple and straightforward results monitoring framework was developed. While the PDO was
straightforward, the results indicators were phrased as output indicators since, as a TA project, RATP II
was targeted to produce well defined and stand-alone knowledge products. In hindsight, there were
several major shortcoming in the M&E design including: (a) the original results framework did not
                                                     20
include additional indicators to measure the number of beneficiaries; (b) there was not at least one proxy
indicator to gauge the level of capacity building and/or level of utilization of the knowledge to be
generated by this project; and (c) the PAD did not include specific indicators for Component 4 (Project
Management) given the estimated cost of this Component was US$2.44 million (36 percent of total cost).

65.    The intermediate outcomes and indicators of the three components were articulated reasonably
well. Those intermediate outcomes and outputs were closely linked to the knowledge products that were
produced by the project through a series of consultancy studies.

66.     Based on the results framework of the PAD, the PMU developed a performance management
framework showing how RATP II outcomes are linked to and contribute to the achievement of the
NELSAP and NBI vision, and it provided the basis for NELSAP-CU to keep track of the project results in
the overall context of that vision.

67.     M&E Utilization: M&E utilization was satisfactory. M&E was carried out using the results
framework and by the project technical staff as well as M&E specialist attached to the NELSAP-CU. The
project also included two specialists to oversee and assure the quality of the project activities related to
agricultural trade and modeling/data collection. The regular M&E reports prepared by the PMU were
reviewed by the NELSAP-CU before they were disseminated to the Bank.

68.     During the MTR, a core PDO indicator was added (Direct Project Beneficiaries) and several
intermediate results were revised taking in to account the implementation delays and what could be
accomplished by the closing of the project (Section 1.7). The Bank’s supervision missions as well as the
ISRs after the first year monitored and recorded both the progress in sufficient coverage and details and
the results and intermediate outcomes in line with the results framework.

69.     The PMU monitored the progress of the major contracts and their deliverables closely and
submitted project progress reports and annual work plans periodically and on time to the Bank. The
monitoring of financial management aspects was also satisfactory.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Rating: Satisfactory

70.     Social and Environmental Safeguard compliance: The project did not trigger any safeguard
policies and there were no safeguard issues. However, an Environmental and Social Management
Framework was prepared and approved at appraisal to ensure that the project would be carried out in
accordance with the Bank’s safeguard policies. On positive side, the knowledge generated by the project,
especially on best practices on water harvesting and agriculture knowledge base, would contribute to
good practices on water resources development and use in the basin in the short- and long-run.

71.      Financial Management: Throughout the life of the project, a good financial management system
was maintained. The project financial management unit was staffed with skilled personnel. Quarterly
Interim Financial Reports (IFR) and annual audits were done in a timely manner. All the external audit
reports were unqualified. The ratings of ISRs for financial management (FM) has been satisfactory from
the beginning until the closure, except around March 2012, when the FM rating was downgraded from
satisfactory to moderately satisfactory for a short period when there was a delay in filling in the vacant
position of FM officer of the PMU. However, this was a minor issue in the overall financial management.
                                                     21
The Bank conducted post-reviews of the financial management aspects periodically and reported
satisfactory compliance with minor observations. The overall planning and budgeting, financial
accounting system, financial reporting, preparation and submission of Interim Financial Reports, internal
and external audit arrangements were found satisfactory.

72.     Procurement Administration: The bulk of the project procurements were related to the selection
of international consultants to carry out the various studies. The PMU reviewed and updated the
procurement plans periodically. The procurement administration was delayed in the first year but
subsequently picked up and maintained at satisfactory level in the last two years. Contract management
and planned deliverables of the studies were closely monitored by the NELSAP-CU and the PMU. The
Bank carried out a post-procurement review and no major issues were reported. Compliance with the
procurement procedures and norms was satisfactory.

2.5     Post Completion Operation and Transition to Next Phase

73.    There are encouraging developments as well as challenges for sustaining and utilizing the
development outcomes during the post completion phase.

74.      Current Progress on Post Completion Operation and for Transition: NELSAP-CU has
submitted a proposal to the Bank in May 2013 seeking funds, possibly under NCORE, for the
consolidation of the outputs of the RATP II and to be able to provide hands on training to the technical
staff on the application and use of the knowledge bases and analytical tools developed by the project.

75.      Irrigation potential studies are likely to be transitioned to the next phase of pre-feasibility level
studies and there are plans to follow on the knowledge generated on irrigation potential, agriculture trade,
and best practices. There are already regional and national plans to utilize this work and advance the pre-
feasibility studies to feasibility level studies through the newly approved Nile Cooperation for Results
Project (NCORE) of the NBTF, with the long term aim of preparing future investments. At the time of
preparing this ICR, the NELSAP had secured funds to undertake pre-feasibility studies to further develop
irrigation sites in four countries (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda). In Tanzania, the Ministry of
Agriculture has incorporated some of the potential irrigation schemes identified by the irrigation potential
study into its Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor. And in South Sudan, the Japanese International
Cooperation Agency is using the Irrigation Potential Study prepared by RATP II as the basis for an
Irrigation Master Plan.

76.     This progression demonstrates a good case example of how RATP II fits into the continuity of the
previous NBTF/Bank development interventions, as it goes from irrigation development concept
development under EWUAP to detailed irrigation potential reconnaissance level studies under RATP II,
and from potential studies to pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for investment preparation under the
new NCORE Project.

77.     Challenges and Issues: However, there are several challenges that are likely to undermine the
continued utilization of some of the development outcomes of this project.

78.      The issues surrounding the CFA remain unresolved and consequently there is uncertainty of the
transition of the NBI into a RBO or any other institutional structure in the immediate future. Although

                                                     22
the options for core agricultural functions and mandate of the NBI or its successor institutions have been
presented to NBI Governance in July 2012, it is uncertain how and when those options might be adopted
by the NBI and/or a future RBO would be useful in the immediate future. Nevertheless, the study
recommendations undoubtedly would serve useful directions and guidance to the NBI and its member
countries in planning and executing irrigation and agriculture activities within the basins.

79.      Further funding support and additional agricultural professionals are required to calibrate and
refine the agricultural model by applying it real world situations in the Basin. Additionally, the full and
sustainable application and use of the agriculture model would require a maintenance contract, for which
there are currently no funds available. This is one activity included in the recent NCORE restructuring
proposal request from the NBI to the Bank. The NBI does not have agriculture specialists in its current
staff cadre and this might be a constraint for the full application and use of the model. Possible reluctance
of some countries to share new and updated data beyond the project would also be an issue.

80.     The closure of the project on December 31, 2012 and absence of an exit strategy in the design has
posed challenges in the post completion operation. Most of the project outputs were completed at the
same time of the closing of the project. Unfortunately, the PMU did not have an additional few months
beyond December 2012 to further refine and consolidate its outputs, ensure uptake and further
dissemination of the knowledge products and provide hands-on training on the application of the
analytical tools. The project design did not include an exit strategy to ensure the sustainable utilization of
the project’s development outcomes.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory

81.     The strategic issues, the objectives and expected development outcomes of the project continue to
remain relevant to the NBI’s vision, NBTF objectives, sectoral priorities of the NELSAP, growth and
development vision and agendas of the governments and all concerned development partners of the Nile
Basin countries, and the World Bank’s new Great Lakes Initiative. Regional cooperation and integration,
integrated and efficient water resources management, agriculture expansion, and regional trade are
increasing priorities for the World Bank, particularly in the Africa region to ensure food and water
security, alleviate poverty and promote growth.

82.     The project outcomes and outputs are also relevant to the vision and strategic objectives of the
Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA), a new development initiative in Africa established
in 2011 and administered by the World Bank as a multi-donor trust fund. The CIWA aims, inter-alia, to
building the evidence base, awareness, and understanding of the financial, social, environmental, and
economic benefits of cooperation over water resources and support investments in water resources
development to address food security issues. The knowledge generated by the project is also relevant in
making strategic choices in the design of the future organizational arrangements of the NBI and/or its
successor organizations. Therefore, the project objectives and development outcomes remain relevant to
World Bank’s development priorities for the region.



                                                     23
83.     Project design and implementation were consistent with the project’s stated objectives. The
design of project components and the expected results and outputs of the components were well aligned
with the stated development objectives and the sector issues. It was not necessary to change the project
design during the implementation as the circumstances did not change and the operation remained
important to achieving Bank, NBI and country development objectives.

84.     However, there are a few generic strategic management issues recognized by the Bank and the
Client during the planning, implementation and post completion operation of this project: (i) regional
projects such as RATP II that engage several countries are not always recognized in the Country
Partnership Strategies and their integration with the Bank’s individual country programs is poor; (ii)
arrangements for providing cross support from different sector management units of the Bank to the
Client for multi-sectoral projects such as RATP II is weak; and (iii) arrangements within the Bank to
adopt the knowledge produced by regional projects such as RATP II in the design and implementation of
country specific, Bank funded investment operations are weak. Nevertheless, some recent Bank Country
Partnership Strategies of the Basin countries have been highlighting in varying degrees, the importance of
NBI and agriculture development and water resources planning, management and development to the
long term socio-economic development of the riparian countries.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objective
Rating: Satisfactory

85.     On the whole, the project has achieved its main development objectives satisfactorily, based on
the achievement of the results and intermediate outcomes as summarized in the Table 4 below. Annex 6
provides details of the achievement of the intermediate outcomes under each of the three components and
eventually the achievement of the three project PDO outcomes as a justification for the satisfactory rating
for achievement of the PDO. Annex 7 provides a complete list of the project’s final knowledge products
(Outputs) that contributed to the satisfactory achievement of the PDO.

86.      Given the limited project duration, RATP II was designed to increase the knowledge base adding
new knowledge and tools, but was not designed to use those knowledge/tools to influence policies,
decisions making processes, and activities of the Basin. However, given the short duration the project
made significant contribution to disseminate the knowledge which would have influence in the policies
and operational decision in the future. For example, 350 staff were trained directly by the project, 48
experts were trained as “Trainers? to continue further training to the country staff, a large number of
seminars were held to disseminate the knowledge products and tools among key decision making and
operational levels staff of the ministries of finance, trade, agriculture of and irrigation/water resources in
the ten countries, and significant knowledge has been disseminated among the private trade organizations.

87.     The utilization of the development outcomes in the post-project period is promising:

            a. The Nile DSS has been augmented with an agricultural model and significant database
               that will prove useful to the NBI and its member countries as they begin to further
               develop the basin’s agricultural potential.

            b. The studies on irrigation potential are already being used to plan concrete investments in
               at least four of the seven countries.

                                                     24
                  c. The studies on virtual water and trade in agricultural commodities have been widely
                     disseminated and well received in all ten countries. They are already discussions, beyond
                     the NBI, of how to expand the scope of these studies to other commodities for future
                     planning and development.

                  d. The knowledge of best practices is highly likely to be utilized for water resources
                     planning and development. The study on best practices in water harvesting and small-
                     scale irrigation produced ten (10) user friendly training manuals on water harvesting and
                     small-scale irrigation. These manuals were further translated into French for
                     dissemination in French speaking countries. The manuals serve as useful reference
                     guides to any organization interested and engaged in the water harvesting and small-scale
                     irrigation in the riparian countries. There are plans with the NELSAP-CU to deploy the
                     48 Trainers to train technicians in their respective countries using the manuals.

 88.      There is evidence of the utility and adoption of the increased knowledge products of project: The
 improved DSS is being used by the NBI to support water resources management decisions. A series of
 potential investments have been identified by some countries as a result to the agriculture trade study,
 which analyzed three commodity categories in five trade corridors in detail. This study has engaged non-
 water decision makers (Ministries of Finance, Planning, Trade, etc., and private sector) in the water
 agenda of the Basin and consequently the gradual integration of these development partners in agriculture
 trade is already taking place.

 89.      The formation of the North Eastern Africa Livestock Council (NEALCO) is an encouraging
 unintended development of the project. It was established through support from AU-IBAR which
 collaborated with the Project through a working Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NELSAP-
 CU. AU-IBAR also hosts the Council as one of the five pillars under the Pan African Forum for
 Livestock Exporting & Importing Countries (PAFLEC). This council now plans to articulate the interests
 of livestock traders and exporters in the region. The RATP II has also proposed a strategy for Nile Basin
 countries to tap the potential for livestock exports to the Gulf countries.

    ‘Virtual water’ is an estimate of the amount of water involved in the production of a particular product. For example, virtual water import and
 export is the volume of water associated with producing goods which are traded.
 18
    “Water footprint? of an individual, community or business is defined as the total volume of water used to produce the goods and services
 consumed by the individual or community or produced by the business.


                                                                        26
90.     Further, the Intergovernmental Agency for Development (IGAD) has already started investments
in small scale water dams for livestock in one of the livestock corridors.

91.     Additionally, the East African Grain Council (EAGC) has pursued the adoption of 22 commodity
standards by the East African Community (EAC) Standards Council. The idea of “open borders? in
agricultural trade is also being pursued by the EAGC. This is evident from the statement made by the
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of EAGC during the last PRSC meeting in Bujumbura: “now that we
have evidence-based analysis results of constraints to cross border trade, we can confront our policy
makers to ensure open borders on agriculture trade?. Meanwhile the Horticultural Council of Africa
(HCA) has undertaken to uptake investment opportunities in the horticulture sector identified in the study.

92.     The virtual water concept is likely to be a major strategic tool for guiding the planning of water
resources investment decisions. The study on virtual water/water footprint has generated wide interest
among the stakeholders including RECs, regional commodity groups and ministries of water, agriculture
and trade. With the outputs generated (See Annexes 6 and 7), there is a high likelihood that the concept
of virtual water and water foot analysis would become an integral part in guiding strategic choices and
decisions in agriculture and agriculture trade.

3.3     Efficiency
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

93.      As a TA project, the project did not easily lend to conventional economic and financial analysis at
appraisal. The nature and extent for the longer term benefits of the projects are difficult to quantify. But
the economic justification of the project lies in its role facilitating the generation and sharing of
knowledge that would contribute to longer term economic and environmental benefits in addressing basin
wide water resources development for sustained poverty reduction and growth. Economic benefits would
result from clearly determined functions of the NBI vis-à-vis riparians in identifying and preparing
agricultural investments and also more strategic investments in efficient use of water for agricultural
production at the basin level. Economic benefits would also accrue from progressive regional integration,
which would result in increased transboundary agricultural trade and increased productivity.
Environmental benefits stem from improved management of environmental goods resulting from
cooperative Nile water management and development with good practices such as water harvesting and
watershed management.

94.     The implementation of the project has been cost effective and efficient. The project cost at
appraisal was US$7.12 million of which a Grant provided by the NBTF (US$7.0 million) and the
Recipient contribution (US$0.12 million). At project disbursement closure on April 30, 2013, the total
Grant disbursements were US$6.72 million, which was only US$0.28 million less than the anticipated
estimated project cost at appraisal, but the project delivered all of its expected outputs satisfactorily. This
includes the actual cost of miscellaneous consultancy studies and publication costs to produce the
knowledge products under the first three project components (US$3.6 million); training and consultative

19
  Commodities studied are maize, wheat, rice, sugar, tea, coffee, flowers, mangoes, beans, bananas, and beef.
20
  Eritrea, while a riparian, is an observer member to the NBI and Eritrea was not included in the study. Former Sudan separated into two
countries as Sudan and South Sudan during the implementation of the study. Therefore separate water footprint analyses for these two countries
are not available, although the analysis treated Sudan and South Sudan as a single unit, namely Sudan.


                                                                      27
and dissemination workshops related to the first three components (US$1.9 million); procurement of
miscellaneous goods (U$0.097 million); and project operating costs (US$0.94 million). At this cost, the
project produced very useful knowledge products including agriculture and agriculture trade data in the
Basin, analytical studies, best practice manuals, operational guidelines, policy briefs and study reports and
recommendations for agriculture commodities, trade and potential irrigation schemes in the Basin (See
Annex 7). In addition, the project funded two additional studies21 that were not planned at appraisal.
Although the project’s direct beneficiaries included 350 staff from the NBI member countries, a large
number of institutions and people benefitted as outlined in sections 1.4 and 3.2, and it is difficult to
quantify these indirect benefits and beneficiaries. The actual project operational cost was US$0.94
million at closure, which is 14 percent of the actual expenditure (US$6.72 million). This is reasonable for
a regional project which involved the management of project across ten countries with a PMU based in
Burundi, NELSAP-CU based in Rwanda, RPSC members based in the ten countries and NELTAC and
NBI Secretariat based in and Uganda.

4.      Assessment of Risks to Development Outcomes
Rating: Substantial

95.      There are substantial risks to sustaining and utilizing the development outcomes some of which
are highlighted above in paragraphs 51-54. The current hydro-political environment in the Nile basin
may not allow a speedy progression of the NBI to a more effective governance structure such as RBO in
the foreseeable future. Thus, it is unlikely that a basin organization with a clear and shared mandate and
responsibility for basin water management would be in place soon. Also, it is not clear if future RBO
would have a main responsibility for dealing with basin wide agriculture trade and development, because
globally basin wide agriculture development and trade does not seem to be a core function of other
established RBOs. However, the agriculture functions developed and presented to NBI includes a menu
of several options ranging from “minimal? to “full? engagement of RBO in basin agricu lture and trade
and this option menu would provide flexibility to future RBO to pick up one option or hybrid of the two
options. It is encouraging to note that the recently approved NCORE project plans to carry forward some
irrigation potential studies completed under the project to pre-feasibility/feasibility level studies.
Carrying forward the recommendations on the three agriculture commodities and five potential
agricultural trade routes requires significant understanding and cooperation among the NELSAP
countries.

96.     The knowledge generated by the projects covering viable agriculture, water foot prints of several
agriculture commodities, agriculture trade, and best practices on water management and harvesting would
be very useful in the design and implementation of national development projects of the Basin countries.
However, both the Sector Management Units (SMUs) responsible for the project as well the SMUs who
could potentially benefit from this knowledge lack clear strategies and work arrangements to uptake and
integrate the knowledge into the new upcoming and ongoing projects. Poor linkages of regional projects
with Country Management Units (CMUs) of the related countries both at strategic and operational levels
also would affect the integration of the knowledge.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory:

97.     The Bank’s team played a moderately satisfactory role in improving quality at entry in the overall
project design. The Bank’s team worked actively with the NBI and partnering countries in the Phase I
period and provided intensive technical inputs for the background analysis and project preparation.

98.      The project was prepared within a very short period of six months during the Phase I, building
heavily on the pre-project analysis, consultations and scoping done under the Phase I. However, the fast
track preparation of the project resulted in a few minor shortcomings. the scope of some of the studies
envisaged under the studies were not fully explained or not ready and consequently additional studies
required to be conducted to clarify the scope of those studies (for example, Gap analysis to clarify the
scope of the Agricultural model study); assessment of technical and procurement capacity and technical
staffing needs were deficient; the roles and responsibilities of and effective working and communication
arrangements between different stakeholders engaged in the project implementation were spelt out in the
PAD but were not clear to the project entities at the inception; communication linkages between the other
related NBI projects were not fully addressed in the PAD; underlying concepts and scope of some of the
studies/outputs (e.g., “virtual water? and “water foot print?) envisaged under the project were not
adequately clarified; and strategy and program for dissemination/communication of the project outputs,
such as best practices, were not spelt out. Lack of clarity on some of the underlying concepts and scope
of the planned studies, and deficiencies in the evaluation of procurement and technical staffing capacity
and needs gave rise to implementation delays later.

99.     The Bank’s team ensured that satisfactory arrangements for project execution, coordination, and
oversight as well as financial management arrangements were in place by approval. However, as
mentioned earlier, the Bank’s management assigned a new TTL for the implementation phase of the
project and this change took place immediately after the Approval. The necessity for this change at this
time was not clear but it was possible for the Bank’s sector management unit to allow continuity of the
same TTL for a few more months to support rapid take-off of the implementation. This abrupt change
caused a negative impact on the quality at entry of the project. Given the multi-sectoral, multi-country
and multi-partner nature of this small TA, the change caused a significant loss of institutional memory
and breakdown of working relationships and networks established between the Bank and a large number
of governmental and nongovernmental partners in the Basin countries. The negative effect of this change
contributed largely for the implementation delays of the project in its first year following approval.

(b)    Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

100.    The Bank’s supervision was deficient in the first year of the project after approval in October
2009 as described above. The Bank’s TTL acknowledged responsibility for the deficiencies in
supervision as recorded in the Bank’s aide-memoire of the first implementation review that was
conducted in June 2010, eight months after approval. However, this aide-memoire was conveyed to the

                                                   29
NBI several months after the June 2010 mission. The preparation of the first ISR was significantly
delayed. The communication and interactions between the Bank, NELSAP-CU, and the PMU during this
period was deficient and this lapse largely contributed to the implementation delays. The Bank’s
management noted this status and took action to change the TTL, but it took almost one year from
approval to make the change.

101.     The Bank’s project supervision inputs intensified after September 2010 and sustained at
satisfactory levels until the closure after the change-over of the TTL in October 2010. Quality of
supervision during the last two years of the project was satisfactory. The Bank team was proactive in
several areas of supervision. The Bank’s team reestablished the communication links and networks,
clarified areas of ambiguity on the concepts and scope of the studies, provided useful technical and
operational guidance for shaping the TORs of the studies and speeding up procurement activities. These
inputs were provided on time. A case in point was the intervention of the Bank’s team to guide the PMU
and other implementing agencies to develop several potential institutional options for the future RBO
under the agriculture functions study, rather than having a single agriculture mandate, reflecting the
political climate and risks with the NBI. The Bank’s team also recommended timely action to hire
additional consultants whenever required and reviewed and adjusted the project budgets periodically.

102.     The Bank conducted regular supervision missions, six in total including the MTR, and once every
six months on average. All the missions were scheduled to coincide with timing of the RPSC meetings,
which seem to have been beneficial for both the Bank and high level staff of the client teams to interact
and exchange views on important technical and operational matters. The aide-memoire was succinct;
especially the last four aide-memoires were easily comprehendible, structured to focus on results in line
with the PDO and the intermediate outcome indicators of the project components. The supervision
missions recommended appropriate actions to overcome implementation delays and issues, and tracked
and reported the level of compliance of the actions agreed at the previous review mission with actual
dates of compliance by the Client. The Client’s Project Completion Report recognized the important
guidance and contribution made by the Bank’s team or the project success during the last two years.
Bank’s supervision of the Client’s compliance with legal covenants and fiduciary aspects has been
satisfactory. However, the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of the project steering committees, M&E,
and the interaction between the NBI, ELSAP-CU, the PMU and the related NELSAP countries in the
implementation of the project was not clearly documented in the aide-memoires and the ISRs.

103.    The Grant closing date was extended by two months until December 30, 2012 to allow sufficient
time to complete and disseminate the studies. The decision for limiting the extension to two months is
understandable because NBTF was scheduled to be closed in June 2013 (meaning all NBTF finance
projects should close in December 2012) and it was uncertain if the closing date of the NBTF would be
extended. While the NBTF Committee later decided in October 2012 to extend the closing date of the
NBTF by two years until June 2015, the NBTF Donors stipulated that all on-going projects be closed by
December 2012 and that NCORE be the only recipient executed activity thereafter.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

104.    While the Bank performed satisfactorily in most aspects, it overlooked several important project
design and preparation aspects which affected the project implementation later and affected systematic
                                                  30
uptake and adoption of the knowledge and smooth transition to post completion phase as outlined in the
preceding sections. Absence of an exit strategy to ensure sustainable use of the project outcomes
demands additional efforts for further dissemination and hands on training on the tools, and integrate the
knowledge and the recommendations systematically into concurrent and upcoming programs and projects.
The Bank’s supervision in the last two years (which accounted for two thirds of the project period) was
satisfactory and contributed to satisfactory completion of the project, but the quality of supervision in the
first year (which accounted for one third of the project period) was unsatisfactory. Considering these
positive and negative aspects, the overall Bank’s performance on both the “quality at entry? and the
“quality of supervision? are rated moderately satisfactory, and consequently overall Bank Performance is
rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2       Grantee Performance

(a) Government (NBI) Performance:
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

105.    The project preparation has been guided and benefitted from the active interventions by several
stakeholders and other measures:

         Timely request of the NBI to the Bank for Grant support to carry out scoping studies and
          background work to prepare this project to address its strategic issues and concerns;

         A detailed project implementation manual was prepared and the Regional Project Steering
          Committee (RPSC) and the PMU was established before the project started;

         The RPSC was mandated to meet on a bi-annual basis but by the project ten RPSC meetings were
          held, more than anticipated; the RPSC played an effective and critical role in guiding the project
          implementation, reviewing and approving work plans, budgets and study reports and facilitating
          implementation of project work at the national level;

         Inputs and guidance from NELSAP-CU and NELTAC were satisfactory and these entities played
          a lead role in supervising and guiding the project implementation and maintaining functional
          linkages with the project stakeholders;

         The NELSAP-CU and the RPSC have successfully mobilized and engaged several RECs in the
          project; and

         The PMU implemented the project with sufficient staff and with satisfactory monitoring, work
          planning, monitoring, quality control (including the use of external peer reviewers), and budget
          management.

(b) Implementing Agency (NELSAP/PMU) Performance:
Rating: Satisfactory

106.    Implementation Partnerships: The partnerships established with the RECs (EAC, COMESA,
IGAD, AU-IBAR) and RCGs (such as EAGC, HCA) were beneficial in generating synergy, avoiding
duplication of efforts, advocating the project concepts and facilitating and supporting the implementation

                                                     31
of the project activities, and enhancing post-project sustainability of the project outcomes. Most of the
NLOs were instrumental in supporting study consultant teams and project staff to access relevant
ministries and other organization at country level, organizing meetings, national consultations, providing
guidance and facilitation in data collection and participating in national awareness creating workshops.

107.    Data collection for the Major Studies: The PMU and NELSAP-CU were successful in carrying
out data collection, consultations and dissemination amidst unforeseen developments during the
implementation. For example, in August 2010, Egypt and Sudan froze their official participation
participating in project activities consequent to unforeseen development of tensions surrounding the CFA.
NLOs from Egypt and Sudan participated actively in the Project until August 2010 but ceased official
participation in project activities thereafter. Although this situation was outside the control of NBI and
the project implementation entities, that the freezing of official participation resulted in the final outputs
being largely non-inclusive of those two countries.

108.     This situation resulted in difficulties in collecting data, consultations, conducting workshops and
other project related activities in these two countries, especially in conducting Cross Broader Trade and
Virtual Water/Water Foot Print studies. The project management adopted innovative ways to implement
activities in these countries. In the end, the project collaborated with Nile Basin Discourse (NBD), which
mobilized local civil society to organize local meetings, training, and data collection exercises in Egypt.
However, Sudan was not included during the virtual water study. The formation of South Sudan as a new
country during the project implementation also brought implementation challenges. Eventually the NBI
facilitated formal membership of South Sudan in the NBI and appointment of a NLO to participate in the
project activities.

109.    Financial Management: The financial management has been satisfactory throughout the project
implementation period, except during a short spell, due to delay in filling in vacant position of Financial
Management Specialist, which was overcome soon by the PMU. Additionally, the internal and external
audits were conducted regularly and audits were concluded with unqualified audit opinions; project
fiduciary team has been well experienced; quarterly IFRs as well as external audit reports were produced
on time; satisfactory accounting system had been maintained with regular updating of general ledger,
preparation of bank reconciliation statements on monthly basis, and updating of fixed asset register on
annual basis, and completing Bank’s recommendations at the regular implementation review missions on
time. The PMU prepared and submitted revised budgets to each of the Bank’s supervision missions,
which was a good practice.

110.     Procurement Administration: The procurement administration somewhat suffered in the early
months following the Grant effectiveness in December 2010. The NELSAP-CU was able to overcome
initial procurement capacity deficiencies with the training facilitated by the Bank’s team and accelerate
the procurement processing during the implementation. The PMU updated the Procurement Plan on
annual basis. All procurements were carried out as per the provisions of the Grant Agreement. The ISR
ratings for procurement administration progressively improved from unsatisfactory from the start to
satisfactory and maintained at that level until the closure. Compliance with the procurement norms,
standards and procedures was satisfactory.



                                                     32
111.     Other: The PMU submitted annual work plans and progress/M&E reports regularly and in
sufficient coverage and quality, the M&E provisions of the Grant Agreement were complied with
satisfactorily.

(c) Justification of Overall Grantee Performance:
Rating: Satisfactory

112.     The primary Grantee is the group of NELSAP countries. Overall, all the NELSAP countries were
actively engaged in the project preparation, implementation, coordination and oversight. Overall the
NELSAP-CU, PMU, NELTAC, and NELTAC performed their responsibilities and functions effectively
as outlined above leading to the satisfactory achievement of the development objectives. The collective
effort of these stakeholders contributed strongly to the generation and dissemination of the outputs at
satisfactory level. Despite political issues, Egypt and Sudan showed a considerable interest in technical
work, especially in the discussions and studies related to water foot print and agriculture trade corridors
and the dissemination of the related reports. The NELSAP-CU and NELTAC are actively following up
with the Bank and other stakeholders for integrating and utilizing the knowledge products with regular
development operations of the NBI in the countries.

6.       Lessons Learned

113.    The preparation, design and implementation experience of this project leads to the following
lessons that are useful for the future design and implementation of the projects, especially regional
projects.

        For regional projects that require intensive engagement of the Bank team with a large number of
         diverse stakeholders from different countries, it is crucially important to ensure continuity during
         the transition from preparation to project implementation. Failure to do so might result in
         negative effects on the implementation readiness conditions and rapid project take-off due to
         possible loss of institutional memory and working relationships between the Bank and the Client,
         which are crucial for the efficient implementation of such operations.

        Regional projects with strong technical assistance content and that requires the participation and
         engagement of multi-sectoral, multi-country and multi-partner stakeholders would benefit from a
         three phased approach: Phase I for consensus and awareness building and scoping and design;
         Phase II for project implementation; and Phase III for consolidation of the outcomes, post
         completion operation and transition to next stage. The project design should include a well-
         articulated exit strategy, additional time and resources to ensure uptake and sustainable use of the
         development outcomes. This is particularly important in a project with significant technical
         component like the Agricultural Model and DSS, as these require not only time for design and
         implementation, but also user training and modification based on real-world use.

        Both the Bank and the Client countries would greatly benefit from a clear strategy and firm
         institutional arrangements to: (a) integrate regional projects into country partnership strategies of
         the countries of the region; (b) ensure linkages between the regional projects and country specific
         projects funded by the Bank during planning and implementation; (c) provide cross support from
         Bank’s various sector management units for the design and implementation supervision of multi -
                                                     33
         sectoral TA projects; and (d) ensure uptake and integrate knowledge produced by the regional TA
         projects in the design and implementation supervision of country specific operations, led by the
         same SMU or other SMUs. This is a strategic management issue for the Bank.

        This project has demonstrated the merits and benefits of engaging major private sector
         stakeholders in generating and adopting knowledge and tools that would influence water
         resources planning and management in a river basin context. It also has demonstrated the use of
         the concept of virtual water in understanding social and economic implications of allocation of
         basin water for agriculture and agriculture trade across the basin. It would be useful to deepen this
         line of analysis and to replicate this experience in other major river basins too to better understand
         the role of agriculture and agriculture trade in shaping and influencing the decisions on integrated
         water resources management in basin context.

7.       Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

114. The NBI submitted its own Project Completion Report in December 2012. It was comprehensive
in coverage and quality and candid in its assessments. Based on the Completion Report, it is clear that
RATP II outputs and potential outcomes are valued by the NBI and its member countries. By and large
there are no major deviations of the assessment of progress, outcomes, challenges and ratings between the
Bank ICR and the Client’s project Completion Report. The Executive Summary of the Report is attached
to this ICR as Annex 8. There are no major issues raised in the Project Completion Report that requires a
response from the Bank.

                                           Details of Project Components
Component 1: Defining NBI’s core agricultural functions (total appraisal budget US$0.64 million – actual
expenditures US$0.28 million):
The intermediate outcome: NBI’s (successor RBO’s) agricultural mandate and core agriculture functions are
defined?. The intermediate outcome indicator is:
      One or more options identified for core agricultural functions of NBI and successor River Basin
         Organization and consensus reached on roles and functions.
This component included a detailed stand-alone study to propose an agricultural mandate and core agricultural
functions for NBI (and it’s successor River Basin Organization).

Component 2: Supporting productive water use in Basin agriculture (total appraisal budget US$2.12 million –
actual expenditures US$2.50 million): The Component 2 included three intermediate outcomes and related
intermediate outcome indicators as follows (three stand-alone studies generated the three outcomes):
Intermediate Outcome 1: Agriculture is integrated into Basin strategic water resources planning and management.
Intermediate Outcome Indicators are:
      Model that includes supply and demand blocks for Nile basin agriculture developed and a plan developed
        for integrating it into the Nile Basin DSS model.
      Agricultural database for major crops in ten countries and one information retrieval system established,
        integrated into DSS, and functioning.
Intermediate Outcome 2: Utilizable knowledge on irrigation potential in Nile Equatorial Lakes is generated.
Intermediate Outcome Indicator is:
      One report on water resources for irrigation produced for each of the six specified countries and
        disseminated through at least one workshop per country.

Intermediate Outcome 3: Knowledge on best practices on water use for productive agriculture is documented and
integrated in national agricultural programs.
Intermediate Outcome Indicator is:
      Best practices on water harvesting and irrigation (by past NBI projects and other organizations)
         documented and disseminated in the basin

Component 3: Incorporating agricultural trade into Basin water resources management (total appraisal budget
US$1.48 million – actual expenditures US$1.62 million).
The intermediate outcome: Agricultural trade issues are effectively integrated into the Basin’s strategic water
resource planning and management.
Intermediate Outcome Indicators are:
      Agricultural trade data and information base established and integrated into the NBI-DSS
      Facilitating policy and investments indicated along selected transboundary agricultural trade corridors
      Virtual water for agriculture documented in ten NBI member countries and virtual water trade introduced
         as a tool for water resource decision making

The Component 3 originally included two standalone studies: Analysis of cross-border trade in agricultural products
along selected corridors of the Nile Basin region; and virtual water/ water footprint for comparative advantage,
production and trade in Nile Basin countries. However, a new study was added later during the implementation
consequent to a decision taken by the RPSC in consultation with the project stakeholders, incusing RECs and RCGs,
which is entitled “Export potential and market access opportunities t o the Gulf States for live livestock from the Nile
Basin countries?.

Component 4: Project management and Monitoring and Evaluation (total appraisal budget US$2.44 million –
actual expenditures US$2.32 million): This component supported the overall operation and management of the
project, facilitated the engagement of the Regional Project Steering Committee, and provided for dissemination of
project outputs.

                           RATP II Links to other NBI Projects at Appraisal
1. Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP) approved in 2008, aims to develop a basin-wide institutional
framework for water resources management in the Nile basin, but it does not have explicit focus on water use
for productive agriculture. An important task of the RATP II was to fill this gap by defining potential core
agricultural functions of the NBI and/or its future permanent successor organization, consistent with the
institutional architecture which was emerging from the ISP.
2. Water Resources Planning and Management Project (WRPMP) approved in March 2009, aimed to design,
develop and operationalize a Nile Decision Support System (DSS) – a basin-wide analytical tool to guide
strategic decisions for Nile basin water resources planning and management. While the development of the DSS
was making good progress, several knowledge gaps constrained its full development and effective application.
Firstly, irrigation development potential of the riparian countries was not fully known by the NBI and the
riparian countries. Secondly, the basic data and information on agricultural sector at basin level, both irrigated
and rain-fed, still needed to be collected for strategic choices and investment decisions. It was realized that the
utility of the DSS would be limited without basic agriculture data being incorporated in the model, because the
DSS model would not be able to: (a) represent the agriculture water usage in the Nile Basin fully; (b) estimate
cumulative impact of irrigation investments on water resources at the basin level; (c) assess impact of climate
change on agricultural production and water use in productive agriculture; and (d) iterate impact of water
development costs on the economic viability of emerging investments in the basin. The RATP II was aimed to
fill these knowledge gaps.
3. Efficient Water Use for Agricultural Productivity Project (EWUAP), completed in June 2009, collected the
best practices in water harvesting and on small-scale and large-scale irrigation practices in the Nile Basin
countries. The objective was to apply this knowledge wide the basin for improving water use efficiency. It was
not felt necessary to collect and develop further knowledge on other best practices on land and water resources
management and disseminate in the Basin countries. At the time of the design of RATP II, the EWUAP had
completed two studies identifying and recommending potential for irrigation development in Lake Victoria,
Tanzania. These two studies sparked the interest of the other countries and the NBI to expand similar studies to
explore irrigation potential in the remaining Basin countries. The RATP II picked up this need in its design.
4. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Nile Project, completed in June 2009, began to collect
baseline data of irrigated and rain-fed agriculture and promoted a comprehensive approach to the irrigation
development in the region. It was necessary to carry forward these efforts to prepare investments in new
irrigation developments in the future. The RATP II included provisions to continue the collection of data,
5. Socio-economic Development and Benefits Sharing Project (SDBS), completed in June 2009, supported
the local institutions to undertake research on trans-boundary issues in the basin, where regional agricultural
trade and food security received the large attention. However, the basic data required to evaluate trade-offs in
investing in agriculture versus hydropower and other activities related to water use were not available. The
RATP II had explicit focus on addressing agriculture trade potential and issues.

NELSAP REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL TRADE AND PRODUCTIVITY PROJECT–PHASE II
              Detail Analysis of the Achievement of the Project Development Objective



1.       The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to “increase knowledge of Basin agriculture in Nile
Basin institutions, to promote more efficient and sustainable use of water resources and economically
viable investment in agriculture.? The project outcome indicators are:

       Options for NBI agricultural agenda presented to the NBI governing bodies;
       Analytical tools developed and information disseminated to increase water use productivity in
        Basin agriculture;
       Analytical tools developed and information disseminated to promote agricultural trade in the Nile
        Basin;
       Direct Project Beneficiaries (added at the MTR).

2.        The following analysis presents the details of the achievement of the intermediate outcomes
under each of the three components and eventually the achievement of the three project PDO outcomes as
a justification for the satisfactory rating for achievement of the PDO.

Results indicator 1: Options for NBI agricultural agenda presented to the NBI governing bodies.

3.       Component 1 (Defining NBI’s Core Agriculture Functions) was meant to deliver this result with
the following output indicator. Achievement of this result is satisfactory.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator: Identify one or more options for core agriculture functions of NBI and
successor RBO and reaching consensus on roles and functions.

4.       The achievement of this intermediate outcome is moderately satisfactory. A comprehensive
analysis on agriculture agenda was completed. This analysis was based on a synthesis of core functions of
other functioning river basin organizations, review of national and regional agricultural policies, analyses
of the draft CFA in terms of agriculture functions, stakeholder consultation, and a basin study tour by the
senior NBI staff. This analysis produced a stand-alone report outlining proposed framework, agriculture
functions and implementation options for a future river basin institution have been produced. The study
defined what the core agricultural functions should be and proposed two institutional options and three
operational models for each of institutional options. The two options proposed are: Option 1: to maintain,
strengthen and turn the current NBI to a permanent institution; and Option 2: to establish a Nile River
Basin Commission based on the draft CFA. The three operational models are: (i) Reactive Model: that
focuses on the management of basin water, essentially making sure there is sufficient water in the system
to satisfy the needs and/or rights of various water users and mitigate conflict; (ii) Pro-active model: in
which the future institution plays an explicit role in promoting increased agriculture development in the
basin; and (iii) Development Model: that promotes broad based socio-economic development across the
basin. The recommendations have been reviewed and endorsed by NELSAP-CU and NELTAC, presented
to the NBI governing body, and disseminated among the NBI member countries.


                                                    42
5.       The utility of Core Agriculture Functions (CAF) report extends beyond the NBI as it stands as a
useful guide for River Basin Organizations globally to help understand and integrate agriculture functions
in their overall mandates and responsibilities. This topic was highly relevant to the theme of World Water
Week (WWW) 2011 held in Stockholm in which the link between food security and water resource
management was widely discussed and emphasized. The CAF is being used by the NBI and SAPs as a
guiding document for Agricultural interventions.

6.      However, with the current hydro-political issues with the CFA, the timing for the establishment
of CFA and transition of NBI to a longer term permanent successor institution is uncertain. This situation
has prevented the NBI’s governing bodies in reaching consensus on the core agriculture functions of the
NBI and its successor RBO. In this environment, the actual utilization of some of the development
outcomes at strategic levels, especially the options for core agricultural functions of the NBI or its
successor institutions, would be uncertain in the foreseeable future.

Results indicator 2: Analytical tools developed and information disseminated to increase water use
productivity in basin agriculture.

7.      Component 2 (Supporting Productive Water Use in Basin Agriculture) was meant to deliver this
result with the following four output indicators. Based on the achievement of the four intermediate
outcomes as outlined below, the achievement of this result is satisfactory.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator 1 (Revised at MTR): Model that includes supply and demand blocks
for Nile Basin agriculture developed and a plan developed for integrating into the Nile DSS Model.

8.      The original indicator was to accomplish the full integration of the agriculture model into the
DSS Model. The achievement of the original intermediate outcome is moderately satisfactory, although
the project achieved the revised outcome satisfactorily at the closure.

9.       An agricultural model that includes food supply and demand blocks for Nile Basin agriculture has
been developed, tested by the technical experts of RATP II and DSS projects, and delivered by the
closing of the project in December 2012. At the closing of the project, the model needed to be further
refined and modified. A Plan was prepared and agreed to integrate the model in to the DSS model at the
closing of the Project. During the last few months after the closure of the project, it has been refined,
modified and integrated to the Nile DSS by the DSS team of the NBI Secretariat. The achievement of the
original development outcome is satisfactory at the time of the preparation of the ICR.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator 2 (Revised at MTR): Agricultural database for major crops in ten
countries and one information retrieval system established, and a plan developed for integrating into the
Nile DSS Model.

10.     The original intermediate outcome was to complete the full integration of the agriculture data
base into the DSS model. The achievement of this intermediate outcome is satisfactory.

11.     Agricultural data base for major crops in ten countries as necessary for the integration into DSS
has been established and one information retrieval system has been established. The data base has been
integrated into DSS. However, the coverage of the data base is less than as envisaged in the final TOR
prepared for this task. The preparatory studies conducted during the phase I provided the details of nature

                                                    43
and sources of the required targeted agricultural data for crop production, food demand and trade, and
TOR for the task. But the TOR adopted for the study during the implementation included an expanded
and comprehensive data base, which was found very ambitious and difficult to accomplish. But the
essential data has been collected and the data base has been satisfactorily established.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator 3 (Revised at MTR): One report on water resources for irrigation
produced for each of the seven specified countries and disseminated through at two regional validation
workshops one after each phase.

12.     The original intermediate outcome was to complete the dissemination through at least one
workshop per country. Both the achievement of the original intermediate outcome and the revised
intermediate outcome were satisfactory, because the regional workshops were successful in achieving the
intended dissemination and validation of the products. The achievement of this intermediate outcome is
highly satisfactory.

13.      An assessment of the irrigation potential of seven NBI member countries (Burundi, Kenya, RD
Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda) was completed seven country-specific reports on
“Potential areas for irrigation development? were produced. This study identified areas that have a
potential for irrigated agriculture and completed an in-depth analysis of a maximum of 4 to 5 specific
irrigation schemes in each of the seven target countries. This study was conducted based on preliminary
technical and socio-economic review and first order cost-benefit analysis, and it identified and
recommended 34 potential irrigation schemes to be further studied at pre-feasibility level. Based on this
analysis, reconnaissance level studies were prepared for five sites in each country, and the results were
shared with relevant ministries. The irrigation potential studies have been validated by all the seven
countries.

Output Indicator 4: Best Practices on water harvesting and irrigation (by past NBI projects and other
organizations) documented and disseminated in the Basin.

14.     Achieving this intermediate outcome is highly satisfactory.

15.     The study on best practices in water harvesting and small-scale irrigation produced ten (10) user
friendly training manuals on water harvesting and small-scale irrigation. These best practices on water
harvesting and small scale irrigation conducted by past NBI projects and other organizations have been
disseminated in the basin. Additionally, In addition, a total of 48 experts from the seven countries were
trained as Training of Trainers generating the capacity to train practitioners and technicians in their
respective countries using the manuals as reference guides.

Results Indicator 3: Analytical tools developed and information disseminated to promote agricultural
trade in the Nile Basin.

16.      Component 3 (Incorporating Agriculture Trade into Basin Water Resources Planning) was meant
to deliver this result with the following three intermediate outcome indicators. Based on the achievement
of the three intermediate outcomes, as outlined below, the achievement of this result is satisfactory.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator 1: Agricultural trade data and information base established and
integrated into NBI-DSS.

                                                   44
17.        The achievement of this intermediate outcome is satisfactory.

18.      At the closure of the project, agricultural trade data and information base had been established but
the integration of the data base into NBI-DSS is not complete. However, by the closure of the project, a
plan had been developed for completing this end result. As of the ICR mission in May 2013, the
integration of the trade base has been completed. The analysis of cross-border trade and collection of data
and information focused on five trade corridors of three categories of agricultural commodities namely,
grains and pulses; fruits and vegetables; and trans-boundary livestock (cattle, goats and camels). The
trade data base covers the five trade corridors and the virtual water/water footprints. This study identified
information on production constraints and impediments on cross border trade for those commodities,
recommended three high value agriculture commodities and five potential agricultural trade routes, and
proposed policy measures and investments to improve agricultural cross border trade. It has been widely
disseminated.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator 2: Facilitating policy and investments indicated along selected
transboundary agricultural trade corridors. The achievement of this intermediate outcome is satisfactory.

19.      Eight policy briefs and several investment options have been prepared and successfully
disseminated. An additional output on assessing Trade Potential for Live Livestock Products to the Gulf
States has been completed. The study report elaborated on export potential from the Nile region to Gulf
States, potential investments to address the constraints to trade in the Nile Basin, and outlined a strategy
to for strengthening the capacity of regional commodity groups, notably, EAGC and Horticultural
Council for Africa (HCA). The study also analyzed the involvement of youth and women (gender
dimensions) in agriculture trade. An unintended but a useful outcome under this sub-component was the
formation of the North East Africa Livestock Council (NEALCO) with facilitation of AU-IBAR which
had a working memorandum of understanding with RATP II. AU-IBAR now hosts the NEALCO
secretariat and has seconded a full time staff to manage it.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator 3: Virtual water for agriculture documented in ten NBI member
countries and virtual water trade introduced as a tool for water resource decision making.
20.        The achievement of this intermediate outcome is satisfactory.

21.     Concept of virtual water22 in the context of Nile basin has been elaborated and analyzed, water
foot prints23 for eleven agricultural commodities24 in nine out of the eleven Nile Basin countries25
analyzed, documented and awareness created among riparian countries, and the report has been widely
disseminated in the countries. The report has also been widely disseminated at regional and national
workshops. For example, awareness creating was conducted in eight countries including Egypt.


22
   Virtual water’ is an estimate of the amount of water involved in the production of a particular product. For example, virtual water import and
export is the volume of water associated with producing goods which are traded.
23
   “Water footprint? of an individual, community or business is defined as the total volume of water used to produce the goods and services
consumed by the individual or community or produced by the business.
24
   Commodities studied are maize, wheat, rice, sugar, tea, coffee, flowers, mangoes, beans, bananas, and beef.
25
   When the project began, the NBI had nine member countries – the addition of South Sudan brought that number to ten. Sudan separated to
Sudan and South Sudan during the implementation of the study, and therefore separate water footprint analysis for these two countries are not
available, although the analysis treated Sudan and South Sudan as a single unit, namely Sudan. Eritrea, while a riparian, is an observer to the NBI
and, as such, was not included in the study.



                                                                       45
Regionally, the report was launched in Nairobi, Kampala and Kigali. The report generated a lot of interest
in the region and beyond.

22.     Concrete illustrations of this concept in Nile basin environment developed and virtual water for
agriculture documented in nine Basin countries and virtual water trade introduced as a tool for water
resource decision making. One important output from this study is a training manual that “Virtual
Water/Water Footprint Analysis?. About 268 regional staff, regional organizations (EAGC, HCA, AI-
IBAR COMESA; EAC; etc.) have been on the concept and application of the concept. Additionally, eight
policy briefs for policy advice and strategic action for benefit sharing among the Nile Basin countries
were produced as part of the outputs for the virtual water/water footprint in a number of topics (See
Annex 2).

23.     Additionally, the project has created a wider awareness among the NBI, riparian countries and the
RECs and RCGs on the strategic role of agriculture trade in virtual water and how agriculture trade can be
planned and promoted as a means to improve basin water use efficiency, besides its profitability gains.
The project has established close linkages between the NBI and RECs and RCGs which would be
important for planning and managing basin water resources in the future. Most of the knowledge
products would be highly utilizable in the water resources planning and management and the preparation
and implementation of investment projects both at strategic and technical levels.

Results Indicator 4: Direct Project Beneficiaries

24.     The project’s direct beneficiaries are about 350 staff (against the target of 250) at policy making
and operational levels of the ministries of the agriculture, irrigation/water resources, finance and trade of
the ten NBI member countries.

25.      However, there are a large number of other stakeholders indirectly benefitted by the project and
the number of beneficiaries as well as the nature of the benefits cannot be quantified. Those include: (i) at
the international level: other River Basin Organizations (RBOs) and development partners would benefit
from the planned dissemination of selected knowledge products. These products would provide different
options on the role of RBOs in basin-wide agricultural development, agriculture trade, and integrated
water resources planning and management; (ii) at the regional level: all the Nile Basin Institutions
(including a future RBO), would benefit from a DSS model enriched with comprehensive data and
information on irrigation and agriculture, different options for engagement in the agricultural and
irrigation sectors; along with various analytical tools such as the virtual water/water footprint and
commodity corridor studies; (iii) at the national level: concerned sector ministries of all the NBI member
countries would benefit from knowledge on the country’s irrigation potential, agriculture sector, and
options for regional agriculture trade; and (iv) at the local level: communities, farmers cooperatives and
water users associations, and development partners, including nongovernmental agencies (NGO), would
benefit from the knowledge on best practices on efficient water management through water harvesting
and irrigation.

Executive Summary
In 2007, the Nile riparian countries, through the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), requested
the World Bank to help integrate agricultural production and trade into the regional
water management agenda. The Bank assistance to this project began in April 2008
with initiation of the first phase of the Regional Agricultural Trade and Productivity
Project (RATP). Phase I was to inform project design and set up organizational and
institutional project structures for the implementation phase (II).

RATP is a technical assistance project financed through a recipient-executed trust
fund (Grant No. TF091609 for US$1 million dated April 29 th 2008 and Grant No.
TF09515 for US$ 7 million dated 30th Nov. 2009). The Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) is the main financier of the project. The project was
managed from a PMU based in Kigali during the first phase and in Bujumbura during
the second phase. It was administratively linked to NBI’s Nile Equatorial Lakes
Subsidiary Action Plan (NELSAP). Although the activities of the project focused on the
Nile Equatorial Lakes sub-basin area, it supported generation of agricultural
knowledge that is basin-wide, in line with the aims of the NBI’s Shared Vision Program
and NELSAP’s subsidiary action plan. The project was implemented within the overall
NBI vision which is "to achieve sustainable socio-economic development through the
equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources?. Its
development objective was to increase knowledge of Basin agriculture in NBI
organizations, to promote more efficient and sustainable use of water resources
and economically viable investment in agriculture.

RATP was to contribute to work undertaken under Efficient Water Use for Agricultural
Productivity (EWUAP) project, which recommended development of an agriculture
strategy and to identify holistic solutions to problems associated with agricultural
productivity and efficient use of water. It was also meant to contribute to the NBI
Institutional Design Support (IDS) project by defining the future core agricultural role
of NBI.

RATP I had four main activities: (i) conducting scoping and analytical studies to assess
the constraints to and opportunities for regional agricultural trade and trade
facilitation in the Nile Basin region to inform the design of the implementation phase,
(ii) recruiting a Project Manager and supporting the establishment of a Project
Management Unit, (iii) carrying out of communication activities for Project buy-in with
key stakeholders, including consultative workshops, dissemination of awareness
raising materials and meetings and (iv) preparing the Project Implementation
document for the Project Implementation Phase (RATP II). All the five activities were
successfully implemented.

Project achievements

Under RATP I the project was able to achieve all its objectives, namely setting up a
project management unit, identifying activities for phase II, establishing a project

                                          52
steering committee and developing the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The
activities accomplished included: Conducting scoping studies, recruitment of the
project manager, establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU), awareness
creation among potential stakeholders, identification of collaborating institutions, and
the preparation of the project implementation manual.

The implementation phase had four components based on the Project Implementation
Manual developed in Phase I; (i) Defining NBI’s core agricultural functions, (ii)
Supporting productive water use in Basin agriculture, (iii) Incorporating agricultural
trade into Basin water resource management, and (iv) Project management and M&E.

The project had five outcome indicators: (a) Options for NBI agricultural agenda
presented to the NBI governing bodies – (b)Model that includes supply and demand
blocks for Nile Basin agriculture developed and a plan developed for integrating it into
Nile the DSS model, (c) Agricultural data base for major crops in ten countries and one
information retrieval system established and a plan developed for integrating it into the
DSS, (d) One report on water resources for irrigation produced for each of the seven
specified countries and disseminated through at two regional validation workshops –
one after each phase and (e) Best practices on water harvesting and irrigation (by past
NBI projects and other organizations) documented and disseminated in the basin.

Indicators b, c and d were modified as part of Mid Term Review. Indicators b and c
were modified due to delays in launching agriculture model contract and limited time
left for its full integration into DSS before project completion. Indicators were modified
to include South Sudan into the irrigation potential study based on a request from the
Republic of South Sudan.

The study on agriculture options for NBI concludes that agriculture is important in the
overall water management of a river basin organization. The study recommends that,
NBI’s agriculture development function should take into consideration country
agriculture programs.       The study proposed four possible options for the NBI
Governance to consider including: 1) a Reactive Model with the NBI having a limited
role in the basin’s agricultural sector; 2) a Proactive Model with the NBI playing a more
active role promoting agriculture; 3) a Development Model with the NBI playing an
active role promoting agriculture and food security; and 4) a Development Model with a
future permanent Nile River Basin Commission playing an active role in promoting
agriculture and food security.
The Core Agriculture Functions (CAF) report provides an important reference point for
River Basin Organizations wishing to integrate agriculture in their functions or
implementing agriculture related activities. The topic of food security and water
resource management was widely discussed in the 2011 World Water Week (WWW) in
Stockholm. The Stockholm meeting emphasized the link between agriculture/food
security and water management. The CAF report was of high relevance to World Water
Week theme. The report will complement two studies that have been completed by

                                           53
NBI, namely: The Institutional design study report and the NBI sustainability
framework. The CAF will be used by the Nile Secretariat and the Subsidiary Action
Programs (SAP) as a guiding document for Agricultural interventions.

Under component II, the expected outcome was “an improved regional environment
and knowledge base for higher productivity of water use in the basin?. This component
entailed development of an agriculture model, an assessment of irrigation potential in
seven (7) NEL countries and the documentation of best practices in water harvesting
and small-scale irrigation. The other outcome was the establishment of a database
among ten countries and an information retrieval system integrated into NBI Decision
Support System (NBI_DSS).
The development of the agriculture model was done by ALTERA of Wagengen
University. The Model that comprises three releases; release #1 (Crop Productivity
Model), and release #2 (Commodity Trade Model) ;release#3. Integration of the AM in
the DSS was completed, tested, accepted, and was integrated into the Nile DSS. The
testing was done by an independent tester with support of a testing committee made
up of experts from the Nile Basin Region. It will be used to support decision making by
NBI and member countries. Due to time constraint a maintenance could not be
signed with ALTERRA before the project closure. Dissemination of the model was done
in over five workshops conducted by RATP during its development.
The study on assessment of irrigation potential in seven NEL countries (Burundi, DR
Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda) was conducted by a
consortium Future Water/ Water Watch. It was conducted in two phases; Phase I
focused on all physical components of assessment, while the second phase focused on
two levels of detail: (i) areas that have a potential for irrigated agriculture and; (ii) an
in-depth analysis of a maximum of 4 to 5 specific irrigation schemes in each of the
seven target countries.
Based on this analysis, pre-feasibility studies were prepared for five sites in each
country, and the results were shared with relevant ministries. NELSAP has secured
funds to further develop four of the sites in four countries (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda
and Uganda) for feasibility and design. In Tanzania, the Ministry of Agriculture has
incorporated some of the proposed schemes into its Southern Agricultural Growth
Corridor. The assessment reports provide useful information for the development of
irrigation in a given country, at the sub basin and basin level.
The study on best practices in water harvesting and small-scale irrigation produced
ten (10) user friendly training manuals on water harvesting and small-scale irrigation.
The manuals can be used by organizations such as NGOs promoting water harvesting
and small-scale irrigation. These manuals were further translated into French for
dissemination in French speaking countries In addition, 48 experts from the seven
countries were trained as ToTs, and it is expected that they will train technicians in
their respective countries using the manuals. Members of the Regional Project



                                            54
Steering Committee (RPSC) committed themselves to ensuring that the results of these
studies were widely disseminated and implemented in their respective countries.
Under component three (3) two main studies were undertaken (i) Analysis of Cross-
border Trade in Agricultural Products along Selected Corridors of the Nile Basin Region,
(ii) Virtual water/ water footprint for comparative advantage, production and trade in
Nile Basin countries, and (iii) a study on export potential and market access
opportunities to the Gulf States for live livestock from the Nile Basin Countries .

The analysis of cross-border trade focused on five corridors of three categories of
agricultural commodities, grains and pulses, fruits and vegetables and trans-boundary
live livestock (cattle, goats and camels in the Kenya – Ethiopia – Sudan – Egypt trade
corridor). The study revealed that trade among Nile Basin countries is constrained by
several impediments such as infrastructure, inadequate policies, non-tariff barriers,
multiple taxation, and lack of grades and standards among others. For the livestock
corridors, lack of holding grounds, poor transport systems, diseases, long distances to
the markets and lack of watering points along the corridors were identified as the
major impediments.

Important outcomes of these studies have been the formation of the North Eastern
Africa Livestock Council (NEALCO) through support from AU-IBAR which collaborated
with the Project through a working MoU with NELSAP-CU. AU-IBAR has also agreed
to host the Council as one of the five pillars under the Pan African Forum for Livestock
Exporting & Importing Countries (PAFLEC). This council is expected to articulate the
interests of livestock traders and exporters in the region. Further, IGAD has already
undertaken to invest in water dams for livestock in one of the livestock corridors. On
the potential for livestock exports to the Gulf countries, the project has proposed a
strategy for NB countries to tap this potential. Its sustainability is ensured by its
integration into activities of NEALCO.

Additionally, EAGC has pushed for adoption of 22 commodity standards by the EAC
Standards Council. Some of these standards were identified as impediments to trade.
On policy related issues, commitment has been expressed on pushing for “open
borders? in agricultural trade, as captured in the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of
EAGC words during the last PRSC meeting in Bujumbura, “now that we have
evidence-based analysis results of constraints to cross border trade, we can confront our
policy makers to ensure open borders on agriculture trade?. Meanwhile Horticultural
Council of Africa (HCA) has undertaken to uptake investment opportunities in the
horticulture sector identified in the study.

The study on virtual water/water footprint has elicited a lot of excitement among
stakeholders including RECs, regional commodity groups and ministries of water,
agriculture and trade. One important output from this study is a training manual on
the concept and how to conduct virtual water/water footprint analysis including the
required data and how to collect it.Virtual water /water footprint was alien to the

                                           55
region, and now 268 regional staff, regional organizations (EAGC, HCA, AI-IBAR
COMESA; EAC; etc) have been trained and understand the concept well. Eight policy
briefs were produced, including one that explains how to calculate water footprint for
annual, perennial crops and beef, and another on how to engage with corporates on
water footprints. The training material developed will be widely disseminated through
NBI, NELSAP, Universities and other organizations. EAGC has requested to post the
materials on its website and to offer further training through its Grain Training
Institute. The study reports will also be shared through the water footprint network.

On the dissemination, the Water Foot Print report was launched in Stockholm in
August 2011, during the world water week by the Rwanda Minister of Natural
Resources and NELCOM Chairperson. The report has also been widely disseminated
at regional and national workshops. For example awareness creating was conducted in
8 countries including Egypt. Regionally, the report was launched in Nairobi, Kampala
and Kigali. The report generated a lot of interest in the region and beyond.

Challenges
A number of challenges were encountered during the implementation of the project;
these include managing country expectations, procurement delays, managing
consultants especially in cases of consortiums, and the availability of data at country
level. These challenges are discussed in more detail in the text. Official participation of
Egypt and Sudan in the project activities ended during the implementation of the
project. Most of the studies ended towards the closure of the project leaving limited
time for appreciation and uptake of the outputs by the stakeholders.
Recommendations, Way forward and Lessons Learnt

Several training manuals, methodologies and policy briefs have been developed. It is
imperative that NELSAP/NBI and the national sector ministries take leadership in
wide dissemination of these findings. RATP has already disseminated these materials
in form of hard copies, CDs and uploading to NBI Information System (IS). Some of
the Regional Commodity Groups (RCGs) have indicated willingness to upload some of
the information on their websites (EAGC for example). Other institutions such as
Universities and development agencies in the region are encouraged to do so.
Some of the studies, such as the irrigation potential study and the cross border trade
corridor analysis have made key investment recommendations that could be
implemented on a pilot basis. Again this needs to be followed up at Basin as well as at
National level to ensure the benefits accrue to the farming community and contribute
to higher level goals of the Basin and national governments.
EAGC and HCA have prepared uptake strategies in collaboration with NELSAP, for
some of the recommendations on cross-border study. Capacity and resources will be
required to move these strategies forward.

NEALCO, which was formed to champion cross border trade in livestock sector at the
request of stakeholders, is in formative stage. The advantage is that it is housed at
the AU-IBAR, however, support to build its capacity and help it define its key mandate
and strategy will be required. Championing livestock export strategy can be a good
entry point for NEALCO.
On the NBI core Agricultural functions, NBI needs to make a conscious decision on
how to actualise the recommendations. Since NBI is already engaged in agriculture
activities, the CAF should guide future NBI engagements in agriculture.
Finally, we recommend NBI DSS to ensure the agriculture model hosted under DSS is
widely applied in agriculture development decisions and upgraded regularly. For
effective use of the agriculture model, countries will need to be supported to collect
credible data.
Some lesson learnt:
Slow and sometimes late procurement and lengthy approval processes, led to some of
the outputs being realised too late for dissemination, appreciation and uptake. In
future early procurement for similar projects and plans to ensure ample time is
allocated for dissemination will be desirable.
Working with regional commodity groups made the work efficient and contributed to
uptake of most of the recommendations of the studies. The Nile basin discourse
played an important role in mobilising civil societies to work in Egypt and should be
used to champion the project results.
Careful selection of RPSC members and National Liaison Officers (NLOs) from relevant
ministries to work with project made implementation of the project activities and
uptake of results at the national level efficient.
The need for some piloting of the project outputs became apparent during the
preparation of RATPII activities. Stakeholders insisted on physical investments
beyond the studies. It may be desirable to inbuilt piloting of prioritised activities in
the future project designs to increase by-in from stakeholders.
Most of the project outputs were produced towards the closure of the Project and the
PMU had hard time to disseminate the Project results. Better timing of project
implementation is key for the sustainability of the Project results.
