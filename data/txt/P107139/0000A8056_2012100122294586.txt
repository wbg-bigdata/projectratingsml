                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The performance of the project has improved significantly. Impressive outputs and outcomes have been achieved throughimplementation of several parts of the project during FY12.
                         The projects records show that to date over168,000haofdegradedcommunal, farmlands and homesteads have been successfully treated and managed using physical and
                         biologicalmeasures. It was reported during the June22, 2012mission that over 380,000m3 of cut-off drains and waterways have been constructedto reduce run-off on individual
                         farmlands and communal lands. The project has financed the production and planting of over 26million slips of predominantly vetiver and desho grasses on communal and farmlands
                         to stabilize bunds, gullies, and in somecases,use as fodder for livestock. To date,over900,000m3 of compost have been produced and applied on farmlands and homesteads, andthe
                         area covered with animal manure isabout53,000ha. Rural land administration and certification that lagged in implementation ispicking up speed fast. Cadastral surveying and
                         registration have been undertaken covering 199,551 land parcels using low costground surveying methodology mainly in five of the project regions. Second level certificates have
                         been issued with Geo-referencedmaps to a total of 6,750households (of which28% are female headed HHs). The breakdown for Tigray, Oromia and SNNPR is
                         2,320HHS,1,532and3,505HHS,respectively. Major procurements have been completed and disbursement is at nearly 70 percent.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Proposed Project Restructuring: The restructuring will involve mainly a reallocation of IDA and GEF grant funds across components and expenditure categories and a waiver for
                         duties and taxes.
                         2. Preparation of SLMP II and other complementary projects: It is planned that full design and preparation of an IDA financed SLMP II will start during the second quarter of FY13.
                         Also, the Bank Task Team has started preparatory work to design the “Climate-smart Land and Water Management Project? to be financed over a 5-year period with financial
                         contribution from The Royal Government of Norway.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
