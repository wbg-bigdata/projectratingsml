Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To assist Nigeria to reduce the spread, and mitigate the impact, of HIV infection by
strengthening its multi-sectoral response to the epidemic through the implementation of a
comprehensive program that includes the creation of an enabling environment for a large
scale response, and laying the foundation for scaling up HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and
treatment services at the federal, state, and local levels.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Reducing the risk of HIV infections through behavior change. Improving access to
HIV/AIDS counseling, testing and care services.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
     1. Country and Sector Background: Nigeria is the most populous country in Sub-
Saharan Africa. At the time of project appraisal it had a population of around 102
million. Since the country's first AIDS case was diagnosed in 1986, the epidemic had
killed 1.7 million people and orphaned 1.5 million children. By 2001, 2.7 million
Nigerians (including 120,000 children) were living with HIV/AIDS, the fourth largest
total of any country. There was a growing realization that the epidemic posed a
significant threat to Nigeria's development. AIDS was already eroding the country's
modest health gains of the past generation. From 1980-1995, life expectancy at birth had
risen from 47 to 53 years. AIDS reversed that trend and it was estimated that life
expectancy would return to 47 years by 2004, erasing 25 years of progress1.
     2. Economic and country context: AIDS was also seen as a threat to the future by
impacts on economic growth and poverty. At the macro level, the epidemic was costing
as much as 0.5% of annual growth. At the micro level, the vast majority of the infected
were in their most productive years as workers and parents, jeopardizing the welfare of
households and communities. The 972,000 AIDS orphans in Nigeria in 2001 were far
less likely than other children to stay in school and far more likely to suffer from
malnutrition, ill health, and social marginalization. Nigeria had only recently returned to
democratic government, re-engaging with the bank in 1999. Institutional experience of
working with the bank was seriously lacking, leading to a fragile operating environment.
      3. Rationale for Bank assistance: In its 2001 Interim Country Strategy Update2, the
Bank confirmed support to Nigeria in its fight against HIV/AIDS. This demonstrated
strong and early leadership, and a willingness to take risks in a climate of considerable
uncertainty: the Multi-country AIDS Program (MAP), launched in 2000, was the first
major donor initiative in Africa to focus on HIV/AIDS. It responded to a perceived need
for urgent action, in a context of weak policy development and management, pervasive
gender imbalances and widespread poverty, but also an open and forward-looking
government response. Following the return to civilian administration in 1999, President
Obasanjo made HIV/AIDS one of the country’s primary concerns and the Government of
Nigeria committed substantial resources of its own. It agreed a sensible and serious
strategy, the HIV-AIDS Emergency Action Plan (HEAP). The Bank aimed to add value
through: (i) significant additional funds for a wide scale response; (ii) a multi-sectoral
response, drawing on wide experience of work with all development sectors in Nigeria;
(iii) cross-country learning from other countries pursuing similar approaches with MAP
support; and (iv) support to community-based activities, building on experience of social
funds and targeted cash transfers.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO)
     4. The original development objective was to assist Nigeria to reduce the spread,
and mitigate the impact, of HIV infection by strengthening its multi-sectoral response to
the epidemic through the implementation of a comprehensive program that included the
creation of an enabling environment for a large scale response, and laying the
foundation for scaling up HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment services at the
federal, state, and local levels.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by the Board)
     5. The PDO was revised at the time of additional financing (AF) May 2007, in line
with the recommendations made under the umbrella restructuring of projects under the
Africa Region MAP, specifically: removal of overall HIV prevalence rate as a measure of
project performance, reflecting increased understanding of the limitations of this measure,
replaced by prevalence rate in the 15-24 year age group as a proxy for incidence of
infection; and revision of key performance indicators to be realigned to the national
strategy). The revised objectives were to: (i) reduce the risk of HIV infections through
behavior change; and (ii) improve access to HIV/AIDS counseling, testing and care
services.

1.5 Main Beneficiaries
    6. Specific groups were identified as needing special focus, and as such were the
direct beneficiaries of the project: Sexually active population (reduced rate of new
infections through behavior change, increased condom access, and reduced Sexually
Transmitted Infection (STI) rate); New-born children (reducing mother to child
transmission); People living with HIV/AIDS (extending their productive life through
prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections, improved care and support, reduced
stigma and enhanced legal and human rights); Orphans and affected households (support
for health, education and social needs). It was noted that coverage was limited especially
for those at higher risk (including commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men,
and out of school youth), but the neglect of epidemiologic surveillance and lack of
behavioral surveillance made it difficult to estimate levels of coverage and need. The
project included the whole population as indirect beneficiaries: the epidemic was defined
as generalized (prevalence over 1% in the general population) and there was widespread
concern at the potential impact on economic growth, poverty, and health.
1.6 Original Components
    7. Component 1: Capacity Development. (Appraisal estimate US$30.56 million
/32% of estimated cost; actual cost US$70.30 million). With the return to democracy, the
Government prioritized HIV and AIDS, establishing the multi-sectoral National Action
Committee on AIDS 4 (NACA) to develop and coordinate implementation of a
comprehensive HIV/AIDS strategy. State Action Committees on AIDS (SACAs) were
also established. The project supported these bodies to carry out their responsibilities,
inter alia by financing establishment and activities of National and State Program Teams
(NPT/SPTs)5, which were later subsumed in NACA and SACAs. The project provided
technical staff and support to NPT and SPTs; training and financial support to NACA and
SACAs to develop and review policy, prepare and implement strategic plans, carry out
coordination, and strengthen program management capacity; and consultancy support for
the monitoring and evaluation program and knowledge management activities. The
significant increase in cost over the appraisal estimate was the result of an increase in the
number of eligible states from 14 to 35 and the need for a high level of capacity building
support throughout the project.
    8. Component 2: Expanding the Public Sector Response (Appraisal estimate
US$31.25 million/33% of estimated cost; actual cost US$11.45 million). It was
recognized that public sector agencies beyond the MoH needed to be involved, but few
sectors had prepared integrated HIV/AIDS strategies. Support was provided to activities
in the HEAP to be carried out by line Ministries to meet the needs of their own staff and
their client groups by (i) financing plans approved by NACA and SACAs; and (ii)
assisting with preparation of plans and programs of action. Resources were directed to
the functional HIV/AIDS units established in target ministries to build high level

 NACA became the National Agency for Control of AIDS in 2007 – the same acronym is used throughout this report
5
 The PAD states that “The State Program Teams will be full-time units composed of contractual or seconded staff.
They will include …: a Manager, a Procurement Specialist, an Accountant, an Internal Auditor, a Community
Development Specialist, and a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist. The National Program Team will also include .. a
Partnership Coordinator and two additional financial management staff?.


                                                         3
commitment, disseminate prevention messages to staff, formulate HIV/AIDS workplace
policies, and oversee sector-specific initiatives for client groups. However, with the
exception of a few key ministries, line ministries focused on activities to meet the needs
of their own staff line rather than on activities directed to their client groups; as a result,
disbursements under this component were significantly lower than the appraisal estimate.
     9. Component 3: The HIV/AIDS Fund (HAF) (Appraisal estimate US$33.87
million/35% of estimated cost; actual cost US$30.35 million).              This component
                                    6
encouraged Civil Society groups to focus on programs which public services could not
easily deliver, targeting specific groups considered at higher risk (such as commercial sex
workers, truck drivers, and youth) as well as strengthening care for the sick and orphans.
HAF’s contribution was to provide funds for technical assistance, training and
implementation support to Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), the private sector and
communities to prepare and implement projects of their choosing, especially for targeted
programs and providing care and support for the sick and orphans, areas which public
services cannot easily or effectively reach. The fund financed: (i) proposals from civil
society organizations (including Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Community-
Based Organizations (CBOs), trade and professional associations, and private companies)
(ii) activities conducted by very small CBOs and communities (for a maximum of
US$2,500 per proposal, with a community contribution in cash or in kind).

1.7 Revised Components
    10. The components were not revised. Allocations to the individual components were
increased through Additional Financing.

1.8 Other significant changes
     11. Project restructuring (1). The project was first restructured in October 20047. It
had been listed as a problem project for almost two years, and disbursement levels were
low. State level activities had taken longer to start than expected, and roles and
responsibilities between national and state levels were poorly understood. The main
features of the restructuring were to: (i) clarify roles and responsibilities between federal
and state teams, and between SACAs and State Program Teams; (ii) open the project to
all states that met agreed financial management selection criteria (in response to demands
from non-project states to be included)8; (iii) add Antiretrovirals (ARV) as an eligible
expenditure9; and (iv) provide additional funds for high performing states and activities.
    12. Additional Financing and project restructuring (2). Following the first project
restructuring the number of participating states dramatically increased (from 14 to 35)
and implementation in many states accelerated. As a result, the federal level and many
states had insufficient funds to finance their 2007 workplans. This particularly affected
the HAF component where NACA and states could not fund all eligible proposals. There
was also a significant increase in capacity building needs as a result of the inclusion of

  The government subsequently obtained funds for ARVs from elsewhere; the project did not fund ARV procurement.

many new states. An additional credit of $50 million was thus made available in May
2007 for two years. This aimed to ensure: (i) continuity until the follow-on project was
operational (noting that the extensive consultation process to prepare the follow-on
project would require longer than anticipated, and the need to ensure that the institutional
structures built-up under the current project would be sustained) ; (ii) maximal
achievement of the development objective and outcomes; (iii) a strengthened national
monitoring and evaluation system; (iv) more targeted civil society actions to be supported
by the HAF (though the nature of this targeting was not specified reflecting the lack of
consensus on the need to focus on specific groups); and (v) continued complementary
support to treatment (the Global Fund was financing ARVs, the project was financing the
necessary infrastructure and training). Project design and implementation modalities
were unchanged. However, the PDO was modified in line with MAP recommendations
(see above, #1.3) and key Performance Indicators were modified to reflect the increased
geographic scope of the project and to align with Bank wide good practice related to
HIV/AIDS monitoring frameworks.
   13. Revised Financing Percentages and Cost Sharing. The ability of the Nigerian
Government to provide counterpart funding, as required under the original Development
Credit Agreement, had been a problem from the start. In response to a government
request, this was reviewed in accordance with the Nigeria Country Financing Parameters.
As a result it was agreed that all expenditure categories would be 100% project financed
with effect from May 2005.
     14. Project Schedule. The project closing date was extended three times.
    (i) for one year June 30, 2006 to June 30, 2007: to ensure completion of project
activities (given the slow take off but rapid increase in disbursement following
restructuring in October 2004). (ii) for two years June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2009: agreed
at the time of AF to fund completion of additional project activities including support to
scaled up project activities and financing of NGO activities underway and pending. (iii)
for nine months to March 31, 2010, to allow additional time to implement ongoing
activities and to prevent a funding gap between project closure and effectiveness of a
follow-up project. The case for each extension was fully justified, building upon good
project performance and contributing to sustainable project benefits.
     15. Funding allocations.
    (i) In March 2006, unallocated funds of US$ 11.75 million were reallocated to 6
states, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and NACA all of which were recipients at
project start up, and were demonstrating good implementation progress. (ii) In May 2007,
US$ 32.5 million AF was allocated as supplementary amounts to participating states
based on their needs, and US$17.5 million AF was allocated to NACA. (iii) In December
2009, at the request of the borrower, funds were reallocated within the 3 disbursement
           10
categories of each State and Federal entity with each maintaining its current overall
allocation. (iv) In May 2010 an amount equal to SDR 3,940,000 was cancelled from the
Original Credit and returned to the Nigeria IDA pool for recommitment to support other

Operating Costs

activities that were consistent with the World Bank Nigeria Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 11 . The three funding reallocations were fully justified as building upon good
performance and ensuring maximal achievement of the project objectives.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
   16. Detailed project preparation took place over a period of 15 months 12 . HIV
prevalence had trebled over the previous 6 years (from 1.8% in 1993 to 5.4% in 1999)
and all parties were agreed that a broad and ambitious emergency response was called for.
There was a high level of political commitment to address the issue as seen by the
constitution of a Presidential Council on AIDS and a multi-sectoral National Action
Committee on AIDS. In view of the urgency of the need to respond, an interim plan (the
HEAP) was developed by NACA with Technical Assistance provided by USAID, and
NACA was preparing a longer term Strategic Plan.
     17. A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was carried out in January 2001 13. The
review endorsed the overall approach and the (government) program content, stating that
it “focused on all the critical factors for addressing the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic?,
but expressed concern that the program was too ambitious. It was recognized that the
planning context was weak: there was little epidemiological information, institutions had
only just been established and had limited capacity, and there were no policies or national
strategic plans to guide project preparation. Of particular note was a lack of information
to inform and guide interventions targeted to the specific groups most at risk as the
source of new infections. The need for prioritization and sequencing of actions according
to currently available epidemiological indicators was noted at the time of concept review.
The QER stated that the Bank’s most significant contribution would be to build the
capacity of implementing agencies to plan, deliver and evaluate specific services.
    18. Lessons learnt and reflected in the project design. The project design reflected
some key generic lessons learned from international experience with HIV/AIDS, and
from implementation of other Bank-financed projects in Nigeria including the need to:
maintain political commitment; promote advocacy and coordination across sectors;
support capacity development (including for civil society) and community empowerment;
develop an integrated approach to prevention and care (particularly for TB); target the
highest risk most vulnerable groups; implement on a large and sustainable scale; carry
out effective monitoring of the epidemic and risk behaviors and disseminate findings.
    19. More specifically, the design: (i) responded to the need to develop an appropriate
model of financing for the project: in developing the HAF, the project team drew on
existing experience in Nigeria, including the Community-Based Poverty Reduction
project; (ii) recognized the need to balance interventions such as mass communications
aimed at the general population with targeting of interventions to so-called "high-risk"


11
   This was in line with the Investment Lending Reform approved by the WB Board in February 2009
12
   Identification mission March 2000, Project approval June 2001
13
   This was an “abbreviated? review; there was no formal scoring of Quality at Entry.


                                                       6
groups – and the importance of sentinel surveillance (sero- and behavioral surveillance)
as the basis for choosing priority groups and interventions (but also noted the major lack
of information to guide such targeting); and (iii) because of implementation problems
with previous Bank-financed projects in Nigeria, planned an extensive supervision
program for the project.
    20. Risks and their mitigation The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified
important risks14, many of which materialized during implementation. While the risk
mitigation measures were generally appropriate, some underestimated the level of inputs
to meet the scale of the risk (eg advocacy and awareness-building campaigns to increase
understanding and support among policy makers and the general public; information on
country experiences and networking to maintain prevention emphasis) or overestimated
capacity of key partners (eg supporting NGOs, private sector and line Ministries to
specifically highest risk target groups; working through NGOs to build acceptance of
controversial interventions). Project funds enabled NACA to devote considerable effort
to increase SACA capacity to plan interventions; less support was given to other agencies,
or to building consensus on more controversial interventions. NACA also used resources
to ensure that procurement and financial management systems were developed and well
managed. The PAD rated overall risk of the project as Substantial. The Implementation
CR team agrees with this assessment.
    21. Adequacy of government’s commitment, stakeholder involvement and/or
participatory processes. The government had demonstrated a high level of commitment
to the project objectives at the time of project preparation: it accorded HIV/AIDS the
highest priority and moved quickly to establish NACA, raise the profile of the epidemic,
ensure a multi-sectoral response, and harness the energies of civil society and the private
sector. Government stakeholders participated actively in HEAP development and many
were already implementing HEAP activities. Government had committed $40 million
over three years to NACA for HEAP implementation. There was broad stakeholder
consultation on project design, including UN and bilateral donors, NGOs and CSOs, who
also participated in consultations on the HEAP.

2.2 Implementation
     22. The return of democratic rule in 1999 brought a major change in government
attitude to the epidemic. In 2000 a Presidential Advisory Committee on AIDS was
established to oversee HEAP development, which adopted a multisectoral approach.
NACA was established the same year to oversee HEAP implementation. This high level
commitment was sustained with adoption of a revised HIV policy in 2003. Despite this
high level commitment, the project was launched and implemented in a context of severe
capacity constraints, low levels of understanding of the nature of the epidemic, and



14
  The risks were: Output to Objective (i) Political commitment deteriorates; (ii) Preventive activities do not get scaled
up rapidly; (iii) Coherent action plans (federal or state) are not developed; (iv) Financial mechanisms prove too
complex and confusing to borrower; Component to Output (v) Pressure to shift emphasis to high-cost treatment; (vi)
Rate of HIV transmission does not decrease rapidly; (vii) Inadequate management/implementation capacity
(procurement and financial; all levels); (viii) Lack of acceptance of controversial interventions; (ix) Inability to ensure
timely conracting and flow of funds to line ministries and NGOs.


                                                             7
variable, but often inadequate, state level support. The presence of multiple project
implementation entities across the various levels of government added to the challenges.
Project Development Objectives
    23. The original development objective was broad and ambitious, addressing
strengthening of the multi-sectoral response, and creation of an enabling environment. At
the start of implementation there was little understanding of the need for, or nature of, a
multisectoral response, and how to create such an enabling environment. The revised
objective (May 2007, in line with umbrella MAP recommendations) was more realistic,
focusing on reduced risk of infection through behavior change, and improved access to
counseling, testing and care.
Building institutions and developing capacity
    24. Developing federal and state level capacity Capacity constraints were well
recognized at the start of implementation, including: lack of robust institutions and
structures; limited human resource capacity at both federal and (particularly) state levels;
high rates of staff turnover; and limited understanding of the project. As a result
disbursement was very slow and implementation was haphazard in the first two years.
    25. Establishment of Project Teams. At the time of project design in-country
capacity to respond to the epidemic was limited to the MoH. A major project
achievement was to encourage government to address this by developing the necessary
institutions and capacity. This presented further challenges including: Unclear roles and
responsibilities (of all project stakeholders, but particularly new institutions - NACA,
SACAs and their project teams); limited leadership and coordination; duplication of
roles and role conflicts (the NPT Project Manager was also NACA Chair; NPT and
NACA had overlapping roles resolved by the far-seeing decision to merge the two);
implementation of multiple donor funded activities, with separate personnel in NACA
(NACA addressed this by assigning cross-cutting roles to staff); and poor NACA and
MoH coordination (resulting from institutional competition and high staff turnover).
    26. Financing        Counterpart funding.    Weak federal government and state
governments systems to allocate and disburse timely counterpart funding was an issue for
the whole Nigeria country portfolio until this requirement was waived in May 2005 as
part of revision of the Country Financing Parameters.
Fostering a multisectoral response
    27. At the time of project design HIV and AIDS was seen as a health issue: there was
limited understanding in the country of the wide range and significance of structural,
socioeconomic, cultural and behavioral issues driving the epidemic. The HIV/AIDS
Program Development Project (HPDP) was an innovative project: Nigeria had not
borrowed for a multisectoral project before. The project helped government to realize the
need for a multisectoral response. The result was the creation of NACA, broadening of
the government response beyond the MoH (initially to the full range of line ministries),
and government acceptance of the importance of civil society and community
involvement.
    28. Operationalizing the multisectoral concept raised additional challenges. FMoH
officials seconded to the project unit saw HPDP as a health sector project, and were


                                             8
reluctant to work with other sectors. Most line ministries focused efforts on their staff
rather than on the needs of their client groups (the health, education and women’s affairs
ministries, and the Nigeria Prison Service were notable exceptions). All federal line
ministries were included, but NACA did not have capacity to coordinate their inputs or
supervise implementation. This was addressed as part of AF: the number of participating
ministries was reduced, (with selection of those ministries most critical to an effective
response); and they were asked to develop more client-centered interventions. NACA’s
capacity was significantly increased with establishment of program and partnership units.
Strengthened Civil Society involvement
     29. The PAD noted that “[p]ublic services rarely reach socially marginalized groups,
such as commercial sex workers. … who are among the most important groups to protect in
addressing the epidemic?. It also recognized the central role of communities in setting
behavioral norms for their members, and the burden of care and support faced by
households and surrounding communities. Their active involvement was pivotal to both
prevention and care. Although civil society had begun to fill these gaps they needed
greater financial and technical support to increase their scale and effectiveness. It was
also anticipated that hundreds of new NGOs and community organizations might arise as
the epidemic and the response grew, and that these would need similar support. Civil
society involvement remains pivotal to an effective response: recent studies concluded
that “community-based approaches are particularly relevant for interventions which
involve behavior change at the household level? 15 and to promote access to and
utilization of services16.
    30. There were no available mechanisms to encourage non-public sector responses,
channel funds to CSOs or encourage collective learning among them. The project
established the HAF to disburse funds using competitive mechanisms. It also recognized
the need to provide small scale support for activities conducted by very small CBOs and
communities and developed a new community driven mechanism, the Rapid Response
Fund, as part of the HAF.
Other factors under government control
    31. Bureaucratic delays. Procedures for approving community-based programmes
involved rigorous vetting and approval of applicants, and extensive documentation. There
were often delays of six to nine months as a result. There were also long delays in
transferring funds to NGOs.
Other factors outside government control
    32. The epidemic raised issues that were difficult to discuss in a conservative society;
as a result, it was difficult to deliver clear prevention messages, and to address issues of
stigma and discrimination, and to get people to understand how infection is transmitted.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design.
    33. A full set of performance indicators was included in the PAD. It was noted that it
would be difficult to detect significant changes in impact on prevalence during the project
implementation period, and intermediate outcome measures and proxy indicators were
also included. At the time of Additional Financing the prevalence indicator was changed
to “decrease in the percentage of young people aged 15 - 24 who are HIV infected?, as a
proxy for incidence and recognizing the limitations of overall prevalence as a measure of
impact. The QER undertaken shortly before project approval stressed the importance of
monitoring indicators to highlight institutional outcomes. A broad and reasonable range
of indicators was developed, to monitor changes in knowledge and behavior, capacity to
plan and manage the national response, and support to civil society in addition to HIV
prevalence 17 . However, in-country M&E capacity was very limited and the systems
available for collecting data were uncoordinated and unsystematic. It was stated that
baseline data for the chosen indicators would be collected during the first year of the
project, following which more specific quantitative targets would be set. This did not
happen. The Nigeria National Response Information Management System (NNRIMS)
Operational Plan (see below, #36) set highly ambitious targets in 2007. These were
based on overly optimistic assumptions, particularly for changes in sexual behavior
relating to increases in knowledge and condom use.
M&E implementation and utilization.
    34. M&E implementation. The limited M&E capacity at project start up reflected
the previous low priority given to addressing the epidemic, and the health sector focus of
the response. The PAD emphasized the need for urgent initiation of prevention and care
activities. Implementation of a strong M&E system was seen as part of longer-term
institutional development. NACA, as implementing agency, did not have control over
data collection by states and line ministries, who had, in turn, limited incentives to share
the data they were collecting with NACA. Baseline data was lacking. Different
development partners had different data needs, linked to indicators which were not
aligned with the emerging national system.
    35. Steps were taken to address these shortcomings during the first year of
implementation, including recruitment of an M&E consultant to help the NPT design a
comprehensive framework, support from GAMET18, and addition of an M&E specialist
in the NPT. Baseline data was available by the end of 2003. NACA initiated
development of a National multisectoral HIV/AIDS M&E framework in 2002, resulting
in the launch of the NNRIMS in April 2004, and roll out of the NNRIMS Operational
Plan 2007-2010 in June 2007. This system combines routine service information,
periodic population based and sentinel surveys, and program and project reports.
    36. The situation had improved somewhat by 2005, and the system was further
improved following restructuring in 2007. There was increasing rationalization and

  It should be noted that standard indicators were not widely available at the time of project design
18
  The Global AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Team, set up as part of the Bank’s Global HIV/AIDS Program to
improve the quality of HIV/AIDS M&E and build national capacity to develop country-led and owned M&E systems.


                                                     10
alignment of the indicators used by development partners. Routine monitoring tools were
developed at state level and M&E Technical Working Groups, which included
development partners, formed in many of the states, further strengthening SACA M&E
capacity. NACA increased its capacity to collect and synthesize data provided by the
states, and national sentinel site and behavioral surveys were underway. However,
despite considerable system strengthening inputs from the Bank, progress on
implementation (depending on the consistent availability and performance of skilled staff,
and was thus outside the Bank’s control) remained slow – the Mid-term Review of the
National Strategic Framework (NSF), 2005-09 in December 2007 identified a wide range
of shortcomings, including limited state level NNRIMS coverage, inadequate skills in
NACA and SACAs, and lack of gender disaggregated information. A notable finding
was the poor funding of M&E, with most government coordinating bodies allocating less
than 3% of their budgets, despite a 10% NSF stipulation.
    37. Given the above, it is not surprising that M&E utilization was limited in the early
stages of project implementation, though this improved significantly later on. At federal
level, national data was used to monitor HIV/AIDS trends, and justify funding ministries,
NGOs and public sector components. M&E data was extensively used to develop the
most recent National Strategic Framework (NSF 2010-15) and plans. However, the need
for geographically and behaviorally disaggregated data remains including information on
outputs and outcomes, to guide resource allocation and track the effectiveness of
interventions, particularly at state and local government level. Lack of such data has
limited the extent to which project inputs can be directly shown to have contributed to
increases in HIV service delivery and thus to outcomes and impacts (see Section 3.2).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
    38. Environment. The project did not trigger any concerns related to the Bank’s
safeguards policy. No major wider social issues or negative impacts were identified by
an initial social assessment, nor in the course of project implementation. Project activities
were carried out at existing sites and structures and there was no land acquisition or
resettlement. ISRs consistently rated the project as satisfactory for overall safeguards
compliance and in respect of operational policy OP4.01 (Environmental Assessment).
There were no significant deviations or waivers from Bank safeguards and fiduciary
policies and procedures during the implementation of the project.
    39. Financial management and procurement. Acceptable financial management
arrangements were maintained during project implementation. However, a 2009 external
audit report noted some internal control lapses resulting from inadequate internal audit
functions. There were also some delays in delivery of quarterly Financial Monitoring
Reports and retirement of advances, and cases of inadequate documentation for incurred
eligible expenditures. Some Project Implementation Units failed to fully maintain fixed
assets registers. All annual financial statements were submitted on time and received
unqualified opinions, and there were no outstanding financial reports.

    40. Although the initial Procurement Capacity Assessment rating was “high risk?
procurement performance was satisfactory throughout implementation. There was
effective dialogue with the implementing institution to address procurement issues


                                             11
candidly. Involvement of country office procurement staff allowed for close monitoring
and guidance. Thorough training of the NPT and SPTs contributed significantly to good
procurement management. The same qualified and experienced procurement specialist in
NACA was responsible for procurement for the duration of the project. This continuity
contributed to sound performance, and procurement was rated “satisfactory? in all ISRs.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
   41. The Board approved a follow-on project, HPDP2, on June 16, 2009. Transition
arrangements incorporated into this US$ 225 million credit include:
Technical. HPDP2 design draws on lessons learnt from both country experience and
international best practice including the need for interventions to be more strategic and
selective (with focus on areas with the greatest potential impact), and for a stronger local
evidence base for decision-making. An external evaluation of the HAF and Public Sector
components gave guidance on modifying their design19. A DFID-financed overall review
of the HPDP made recommendations on institutional and capacity issues. State and
National level Modes of Transmission studies and work to increase knowledge of Most
At Risk Populations (MARPs) will guide implementation of the new project, which will
also develop new approaches to contracting of Civil Society Organizations.
Institutional. The institutional architecture of the next project will be largely unchanged:
NACA will be the implementing agency and will coordinate federal level operations.
SACAs will coordinate at state level. NACA will have greater say in approving requests
for state level implementation, strengthening their authority and ownership of the project.
The project will be implemented within the parameters of the NSF 2010-15, and the
national and state-level strategic and operational plans derived from this framework.
    42. Despite the best efforts of the Bank Task Team to ensure a seamless transition,
there has been a delay in finalization of government approval for HPDP2, and a gap
between the two projects. A major reason for this delay was the uncertain political
environment caused by the illness and subsequent death of the Nigerian President.
    43. Partnership arrangements. A wide range of technical and financial support is
currently provided by the United States Government (particularly focused on expanding
treatment provision), the Global Fund (scaled up treatment care and support), DFID
(capacity building for NACA and selected states; condom social marketing), UNAIDS
and the UN family co-sponsors (multisectoral interventions through the Joint UN
Programme). A Joint Financing Arrangement is being developed to ensure greater
harmonization and alignment of partner support. The project supported preparation of a
National AIDS Spending Assessment, 2007-08, which has provided government with
information on who is working where, coverage of end beneficiaries, types of programs
and the strength and impact of support. The close working relationship with DFID,
developed during HPDP1, will be maintained, including through continued secondment
of a senior DFID adviser to the Task Team and collaboration based on complementary

    44. Monitoring and evaluation. HPDP2 will build upon existing support to scale up
M&E systems at state level and in line ministries. Systems established by NACA and
SACAs during HPDP1 implementation will be strengthened to monitor performance and
project achievements. The Bank will use a subset of data from this system to track
progress of the program. The Bank will also work with NACA and other partners to
develop and implement a framework for impact assessment throughout the project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
    45. Relevance of Objectives The initial PDO was developed in the context of a
renewed priority given to HIV and AIDS as shown by the establishment of NACA and
development of the HEAP. The focus on a multi-sectoral response, creation of an
enabling environment and laying the foundation for scaling up was wholly consistent
with these national actions. The revised PDO reflected the need for effective prevention
through behavior change. It remains highly appropriate to Nigeria’s social and economic
development and is in line with the CPS Results Framework, which identifies behavioral
change, reduction in risky sexual practices and increased access to prevention, testing and
care and support services as key results areas for DFID and the World Bank. On this
basis relevance of objectives is rated high.
    46. Relevance of Design and Implementation. Design incorporated current
international experience on HIV and AIDS. It followed the MAP framework which the
Board had earlier approved as a model for replication, and remains consistent with the
Bank’s approach of support to national programs in line with national development
priorities and circumstances. Project components and organization matched what the
project set out to achieve. It was recognized that there were significant gaps in
understanding of the drivers of the epidemic at state level, which the project aimed to
address through high levels of capacity building support to SACAs (eg by strengthening
their planning and M&E skills). The MAP design as an Adaptable Program Loan was
appropriate as a flexible lending instrument able to support policy reform and
institutional strengthening. Two alternative project designs were rejected as having more
limited relevance (design exclusively targeting MARPs rejected since the epidemic was
already generalized; design solely addressing the health sector rejected since it would be
unable to deliver a multi-sectoral multi-partner response). On this basis he relevance of
design and implementation would have been rated high. However, the project depended
for its success on other agencies (Line Ministries and SACAs) whose capacity was very
limited: the time needed to strengthen these agencies was underestimated, as were the
time and levels of input needed to establish a robust M&E system. For this reason the
relevance of design and implementation is rated substantial.
    47. Based on high relevance of objectives and substantial relevance of design overall
relevance is rated substantial.

3.2 Efficacy/Achievement of Project Development Objectives
    48. The original development objective was to assist Nigeria to reduce the spread,
and mitigate the impact, of HIV infection by strengthening its multi-sectoral response to
the epidemic through the implementation of a comprehensive program that included the
creation of an enabling environment for a large scale response, and laying the
foundation for scaling up HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment services at the
federal, state, and local levels [section 1.2]. The revised PDO at the time of Additional
Financing) involved two principal sub-objectives: (i) reducing infection risk; (ii) expanding
access to counseling, testing and care services. While the revised PDO was a shorter and
sharper statement the intent of both the original and revised PDO was the same: to reduce the
infection rate by strengthening the multisectoral response and scaling up prevention, care and
treatment services. This PDO is evaluated below. A reduction in the risk of HIV infections
through prevention (primarily through increased awareness and behavior change,
achieved through a multisectoral approach involving a broad range of line ministries and
civil society organizations), reflected the shared understanding that this will have the
greatest long-term impact on the epidemic. Public sector and civil society outputs
delivered within a context of increasing national capacity worked synergistically to
deliver a multisectoral response and achieve this objective.
    49. Two things were noted in assessing project achievements:
    - End-of-project targets, particularly those set at the time of Additional Financing,
were highly over-optimistic by epidemiological and operational standards. The task team
discussed these aspirational targets extensively with government. Government set these
in the context of an anticipated large and coordinated increase in donor support, and an
expectation of pooled funding which did not materialize. The task team drew attention to
the underlying programmatic and capacity constraints which made these targets
unrealistic. Despite their best endeavors they were unable to influence the final choice of
targets.
    - A comparison with the “no project intervention? can not be evaluated because of
lack of knowledge of the natural history of individual HIV epidemics and the absence of
any reasonable counterfactual.
   Reducing infection risk
    50. The most significant outcome has been a “decrease in the percentage of young
people aged 15 - 24 who are HIV infected? [Fig 1] since it provides a proxy measure of
incidence of new infections (and was revised from the original indicator “HIV prevalence
rate as measured among pregnant women by the sentinel surveillance system? for this reason) .
By 2010 the prevalence in this group had fallen to 4.1% from a baseline of 5.8%. (It
should be noted that this evidence of a fall in incidence occurred during a period of rapid
expansion of access to treatment, increasing the duration of disease, which would be
expected to have the effect of increasing prevalence overall. This strengthens the
conclusion that the observed decrease in prevalence in young people must have been
related to a significant decrease in incidence.) Supporting evidence of change in key
risky behaviors is presented below (increase in condom use in casual and commercial
sex; reduction in rates of casual sex; and delay in intiation of sexual activity by young
people).

    51. Additional evidence to support progress on reduction in infection risk is provided
by Indicators 1 and 2 “Percentages of women and men reporting the use of a condom the
last time they had sex with a non-marital, non-cohabiting sexual partner? [Fig 2].
Original targets for this indicator were exceeded. Good progress towards achievement of
the highly ambitious revised target was observed for men (70% achieved). Amongst
women (who find it much harder to negotiate condom use) progress was more limited
(43% achieved) but it is noted that this is progress from a very low base (33.4% use in
2008 against 6.4% in 1999). It is also encouraging to see a higher level of use amongst
young women, who might be expected to be most vulnerable to unprotected sex.

    52. Delaying in reducing initiation of sexual activity is recognized as an important
factor in reducing infection risk in young adults. The target for Indicator 6: “Median age
at first sex? was met for females (a rise from 17.3 to 18.1) and almost met for males.
There was also a fall of nearly 10%, from 5.5% to 5.1%, in the numbers of younger (15-
24 year old) adults reporting a sexually transmitted infection or symptoms suggestive of
an infection between 2003 and 2008 (NDHS 2003, NDHS 2008); and a 10% drop in the
percentage of women aged 15-19 having sex with men more than ten years older than
them (from 11.6% to 10.5%), providing further evidence of a reduction in risky sexual
behavior in this key group. In the light of this, the findings for Indicator 10: “Percentage
of young people aged 15- 24 who both can correctly identify ways of preventing the sexual
transmission of HIV and who reject major misconceptions about HIV transmission? are
puzzling. The baseline of 84% (NARHS 2005) is surprisingly high, and might account for
the unrealistic formally revised project target of 94%. The recent UNAIDS Report on the
global AIDS epidemic reported that less than half of young people living in 15 of the 25
countries with the highest HIV prevalence (which includes Nigeria) can correctly answer
five basic questions about HIV and its transmission, and the NDHS 2003 figure of 21% is
likely to be a more accurate baseline for the country. The NDHS 2008 measure of 25%
can therefore be taken as indicative of modest progress.
     53. High rates of casual sex are associated with higher infection risk. There was
significant progress on Indicator 4: “Percentage of women and men aged 15-49 who have
had sex with a non-marital, non co-habiting sexual partner in the last 12 months? (revised
from initial indicator “Proportion of men and women who have reduced the number of
sexual partners in response to perceived risk? in line with global best practice). The
numbers of men reporting such high risk sex dropped 25% (39.1% to 29.5%) whilst the
rate amongst women fell less markedly from 14.2% to 13.1%. During this period Nigeria
felt the effects of the global economic crisis, with increased levels of poverty, and a likely
increase in rates of transactional sex (an increase in risky sex related to economic shocks
has been observed in Kenya20; a similar response in Nigeria could explain this finding).
Messages on the importance of partner reduction were a core element of a wide range of
public sector and civil society interventions supported by the project, and 63% of
respondents were aware of this (NARHS 2007). However, the revised target for this
indicator (3.6%) is considered unrealistically ambitious.
    54. Promoting high rates and consistent use of condoms in commercial sex is an
important prevention intervention. Trend data on Indicator 5: “Percentage of sex workers
who in the past 12 months did not use a condom consistently during sexual intercourse
with a client? (Fig 3) is only available for Lagos State, which showed an impressive fall
from 10.7% to 1% (IBBSS 2003, 2007). However, this is a significant finding: Lagos is
the largest state in Nigeria (approximately 10% of the population) and as the capital with
a large mobile population it is also a major centre for sex work. The same surveys also
recorded an overall fall in inconsistent condom use by sex workers, from 19.4% to 8%
(but different states were used in the two surveys). This is the only indicator to measure
risk related behavior in a high risk group: it is estimated that 11.5% of new infections are

       Expanding access to counseling, testing and care services
    55. A wide range of CSOs were awarded grants under the project at the Federal and
State levels in order to support strong civil society platforms able to address
vulnerabilities surrounding HIV/AIDS in their communities. Recipient organizations and
networks included those focused on people living with HIV/AIDS, youth, women and
faith-based organizations providing high level advocacy and community-based services
in hard-to-reach areas. Inputs accounted for more than 30% of all funds disbursed.
Services were provided to both the general population and high risk groups, and included
promotion of HIV testing and counseling; treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections;
and care for People living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) and Orphans and Vulnerable
Children (OVCs). Initial household survey findings from an evaluation of community
responses to the epidemic22 provide an indication of the extent to which HAF outputs
contributed to improved intermediate outcomes at the community level: communities
with high levels of CBO activity (“Study? communities) were much more likely to be
aware of the availability of services to prevent HIV transmission, and much more likely
to make use of such services than matched (“Comparison?) communities with lower CBO
activity levels (Figs 4 and 5). [See Annex 2: Outputs by Component, for further
information on the HIV/AIDS Fund].

    56. Given the limited support to the public sector from other sources, and noting the
fall in prevalence in the 15-24 year age group (taken as a proxy for incidence of new
infections), it seems reasonable to attribute much of the success presented above to
project inputs: the IDA sector credit was a major source of funding for prevention
activities (approximately 1/3rd of all prevention funding was provided by the project), and
for the associated institutional strengthening needed for a sustained response, across the
country. The most recent UNAIDS Report on the global AIDS epidemic23 noted that the
epidemic in Nigeria stabilized between 2001 to 2009 (the lifetime of the project). The
other major financers of HIV and AIDS during this period were the Global Fund, the US
Government and DFID. The contribution from public sources was minimal24. The US
Government provided significant funding for prevention ($315 million) through PEPFAR
(the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief). Global Fund support for
prevention was $6.8m for Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) under
Round 1 (2003). DFID provided £21 million (approx $35 million) of which less than £3
million ($5 million) was for prevention activities in 6 focal states.
    57. A notable result was the development of a multisectoral institutional framework
(skilled staff working within established institutions and supported by well designed
policies, plans, systems and operational guidelines) which contributed to the effective use
of resources provided by government and other partners, particularly from the US
government (through PEPFAR, USAID and Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
programs) and the Global Fund. Operational tools and guidelines were developed
addressing state level planning (frameworks covering strategic and operational plans),
M&E (particularly the NNRIMS), Behavior Change Communication and Prevention
interventions. NACA provided ongoing support to states throughout the project. It might
have been expected that capacity building needs would reduce as the project matured, but
the expansion in the number of states and the need for continued inputs to maintain
quality resulted in a high level of inputs throughout the project life (the reason for the
increased allocation to the Capacity Building component over the appraisal estimate).
Outcomes included establishment of functional NACA and SACAs in all states,
production of state-level operational plans to guide the use of all available resources, and
use of an agreed M&E framework to track achievement of program objectives (though
implementation of this remained a challenge).
    58. The project made a significant contribution to institutional development and
strengthening and has substantially strengthened national and state-level capacity to
deliver a strong response to the epidemic:
 Fully functional and staffed NACA and SACAs were established with project support;
    National and State Strategic Plans have been agreed for 2010 to 2015 and are the
    basis for annual work plans to guide the response in the coming years. NACAs and
    SACAs played an important role in coordinating the activities of other agencies (Line
    Ministries, Civil Society Organizations, Local Government bodies). It should be
    noted that these institutions remain fragile, and continuing support will be needed to
    ensure that progress is sustained and built upon.

      Public Sector: The Public Sector component of the project helped line ministries at
       federal and state level to engage on HIV/AIDS activities related to their specific
       mandates and competencies, providing catalytic seed money for the creation of
       financing mechanisms and development of operational guides and procedures.
      HAF: The HAF process, by funding a wide range of CSOs, was able to leverage
       existing capacity and create additional capacity for the multisectoral response to reach
       a wide range of target populations both at the national and state level. These
       organizations strengthened their skills in strategic and operational planning, proposal
       development, M&E and reporting as a result. There remains, however, a major need
       to further strengthen capacity in these areas.
    59. Nearly 50% of project inputs to federal and state level line ministries went to a
few key ministries who focused on activities to meet the needs of their client groups:
Health (including extension of HIV counseling and Testing, PMTCT and STI Treatment
Services); Education (design and implementation of the Family Life and HIV/AIDS
Education Curriculum); and Women’s Affairs and Social Development (establishment of
a National OVC Steering committee; development and dissemination of National
guidelines and standards of practice on OVCs). The other line ministries focused on
activities to meet the needs of their own staff, including establishment of functional
HIV/AIDS units to build high level commitment, formulate HIV/AIDS workplace
policies and deliver prevention messages to staff. This explains the lack of demand for
project funds under this component (40% of the appraisal estimate). A key outcome was
the implementation of HIV/AIDS workplace policy and programs by most line ministries,
(28 of 33 (85%) federal level Ministries, Departments and Agencies and 231 of 352 at
state level (66%) are now implementing such policies. An external assessment of project
achievements concluded that “the HIV/AIDS response in the agenda of the public sector
at all levels in the country is remarkable?25.
       Project achievements and attribution under the original objectives
    60. Project achievements under the original sub-objectives (to reduce the spread of
the HIV/AIDS infection; to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS on those infected and their
families) are rated Satisfactory. It facilitated a broad multisectoral response through
engagement of a wide range of partners (including people living with HIV and AIDS,
federal and state governments and MDAs, national and international NGOs, CBOs, UN
and donor organizations). Institutional structures were established and strengthened to
support the response: NACA was successfully transformed from a committee to an
agency, led a coordinated multisectoral response, and developed and operationalized the
national strategy, plan and M&E framework. It facilitated establishment of SACAs in all
states, and their transformation into agencies; SACAs received direct project support and
disbursed funding to both private and public institutions and organizations further
expanding the response at state level; and standard procedures and manuals supported
implementation across the country, allowing a wide range of stakeholders to contribute to
the response within the framework of a single strategic plan.

    61. Federal line ministries contributed to expansion of the response according to their
mandates, creating “critical mass? teams and developing workplans. They coordinated
with state line ministries to implement these plans, with project support. 28 federal
government ministries and agencies developed and implemented HIV/AIDS action plans
targeting staff (through HIV Workplace Policies). Key ministries (Health, Education,
Women’s Affairs) supported interventions to their target clients. In each State, 7-8
ministries also developed and implemented action plans. In 2008 the National Executive
Council mandated state governments to provide at least 1% of Ministries of Health,
Agriculture, Education, Youth and Women’s Affairs budgets to HIV.
    Project achievements and attribution under the revised objectives/additional
    financing
    62. Existing indicators were aligned to similar indicators in the NSF, which included
some highly ambitious aspirational targets set by the government. While the most up to
date evidence available suggests that some progress has been made in achieving the AF
targets, most have not been fully met. Achievements under the revised objectives
included strengthening of the M&E system, expansion of the HAF (with increased focus
on higher risk groups), and continued support to capacity building (including the
additional needs in more recently recruited states). The design did not change, and
progress continued to be made on the project objectives. However, on the basis of the
failure to meet targets, the achievements must be rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
Overview of Project Achievements
    63. The project was substantially successful in achieving its original objectives.
However, as the original objective was formally revised at the time of additional
financing in May 2007, the project outcome has been assessed against both the original
and revised project objectives. To assist in arriving at an overall outcome rating, separate
outcome ratings (against original and revised project objectives) were weighted in
proportion to the share of actual credit disbursements made in the periods before and after
approval of the revision. Based on the two ratings as shown below (#63), the overall
achievement of the project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

and after Additional Financing

3.3 Efficiency
    64. The project recognized the scarce capacity which existed at start up, and took
steps to expand this. Following implementation delays during the early phase of the
project considerable support was provided to strengthen the implementation capacity of
existing fiduciary institutions such as Project Support Teams and by outsourcing
implementation to civil society organizations under the HAF. The project management
team ensured recipients of project funds submitted physical progress reports and financial
statements on a regular basis. This was facilitated by NACA and participating SACAs.
    65. Highly cost-effective interventions were selected for implementation using
project funds26, and were delivered as population-based programs to prevent HIV/AIDS
in the highest-prevalence and most affected states (though it is noted that information is
lacking on the extent to which these interventions reached specific groups responsible for
the largest number of new infections in those states). Several key interventions had a
cost-effectiveness of US$100 per HIV infection averted or less (a commonly-used
threshold for cost-effectiveness), and addressed more than 3% of all deaths and
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost. Interventions included: voluntary testing and
counseling (US$34 to US$161 per DALY averted); peer-based programs to educate
higher-risk groups, including truck drivers, commercial sex workers, and youth (US$11
to US$74 per DALY averted); and social marketing, promotion, and distribution of
condoms (US$39 to US$305 per DALY averted).
    66. Allocative efficiency increased over time. During the initial years of the project
there was limited epidemiological information available to participating states, and as a
result no stated consensus on how resources should have been most efficiently allocated
to maximize the number of infections averted. On the basis of the information available
(showing a generalized epidemic) the government decided to direct resources to the
general population. At that time, resource allocation between interventions could not be
clearly related to the epidemic profiles because of the lack of availability of this data. As
a result, the initial advertisements seeking proposals for HAF funding from CSOs were
broad and open ended (reflecting this lack of detailed understanding of the epidemic) but
they became more narrowly focused over time (i.e. for the second and third funding
rounds) with increasing prioritization of interventions considered to be of higher
effectiveness as the data became available and knowledge of the drivers of the epidemic
increased.
     67. Based on the emphasis placed on capacity-building, the choice of interventions of
high cost-effectiveness, and increasing allocative efficiency (see Operations Evaluation
Department 's analysis regarding the principal elements contributing to the efficiency of
the MAPs27) project efficiency is rated as Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
   68. Based on the above, the overall rating for the project is Moderately Satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
    69. Poverty Impacts. The project was a major contributor to efforts to prevent the
spread of the epidemic and to reduction in the number of new infections. This can be
expected to have led to a reduced burden of AIDS-related illnesses, particularly in adults
of working age. Although there is no socio-economic impact data currently available, it
can be expected that this will have had a positive aspects on earning capacity and
household wealth.
    70. Gender Aspects. NGOs and CSOs financed under the project worked with
targeted women’s groups such as commercial sex workers. There is no information on
reduction of gender stereotyping as a result of the project, but some of the gender
disparities in project indicators would suggest that there continues to be a major need for
work to address this.
   71. Social Development. The project impacted significantly on social development
both through activities to address stigma and discrimination and through sensitization on
HIV/AIDS issues. Support to civil society through the HAF also had broader impacts on
Social Development.
(b) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
    72. A significant unintended positive outcome has been the strengthening of donor
collaboration. The World Bank country office played an active part in the HIV/AIDS
Development Partners Group, which provided a useful forum to discuss and develop
policy and coordinate activities. DFID health advisers were seconded to the Task Team,
and were based in the Country Office: the resulting close collaboration between the two
agencies provided valuable synergies in the use of technical and financial resources and
strengthened the quality of policy dialogue with the borrower..
    73. An important unexpected positive outcome followed the establishment of the
private sector response through the formation of the Nigeria Business Coalition against
AIDS (NIBUCAA), as a result of which the majority of major multinational companies
are now providing significant support to HIV programs for their employees and host
communities.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
    74. The project made considerable efforts to mitigate risks. Management and
implementation capacity received particular attention (details above, #3.5). Federal and
state action plans have been developed, and have emphasized prevention. NACA and
SACAs are allocated budgets, and project teams have emphasized the importance of
ensuring adequate financial allocations and budget releases at every possible opportunity.
   75. Despite these risk mitigation measures, several of the risks identified at appraisal
remain significant, in large part because of the scale of the challenge, including:



                                            23
      Failure to sustain initial high levels of political commitment, as shown by failure to
       provide adequate resources (the public sector share of funding declined from 14.6%
       in 2007 to 7.6% in 2008; SACA budget and fund releases are often low and late).
       There is also limited understanding amongst politicians of the need to direct resources
       to communities and NGOs.
      Continued pressure to fund treatment rather than prevention. There has been a rapid
       expansion of treatment access in recent years, with USG and Global Fund support,
       but coverage remains less than 50%, resulting in major political pressure to further
       increase treatment spending. Approximately 50% of total resources were spent on
       Treatment and Care in 2007/08, whilst less than 15% was spent on prevention28.
      Allocative inefficiencies: there is still lack of acceptance of controversial
       interventions (eg condom provision) and of effective interventions for key risk
       populations (eg sex workers, men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users).
      Insufficient capacity remains a major risk, particularly at the most decentralized
       levels of the system (local governments and ward councils).
       76. Overall, the risk to development outcome remains substantial.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
    77. The project identification process focused on critical gaps and opportunities for
interventions to address the epidemic. It was consistent with the CPS and government
sectoral priorities. The Bank had a consistently good working relationship with the
Borrower during preparation and appraisal. Project preparation and appraisal was
supported by a broad mix of specialists who provided a full and appropriate range of
skills and considered all major relevant aspects of the design (including technical,
financial, economic, institutional, and procurement and financial management). Major
risk factors and lessons learned from other earlier social sector projects were incorporated
into the design. The Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff time and dollar
amount to ensure quality preparation and appraisal work. The ICR team views the above
aspects as satisfactory.
    78. Project design was guided by the MAP Template, developed to respond to a
perceived emergency. Alternative designs were considered, and rejected for valid reasons
(See #47). Epidemiological information was limited, and capacity constraints were
widely recognized. In view of this the project objective was over ambitious. M&E design
was one of the weaker aspects of the project, and the Bank team could have done more to
ensure the timely availability of baseline data and a robust M&E framework.
    79. The many positive project design features are noted. The project was
overambitious (given the capacity constraints) and there were weaknesses in M&E,
including the setting of unrealistic targets for Additional Financing. Quality at entry is

                                                     24
therefore rated Moderately Satisfactory for both the Original Project and Additional
Financing.
(b) Quality of Supervision
    80. A Quality of Supervision Assessment in October 2006 noted that the Task Team:
(i) was right to start by addressing institutional impediments to implementation while
adopting a more deliberate approach to the scaling up of service delivery aspects; (ii) was
proactive in recognizing and solving problems; and (iii) had experienced members and
gained a solid knowledge of contextual issues. The main weakness identified was in the
adequacy and operation of M&E framework. The Task Team rose to the challenge,
supporting roll out of the NNRIMS Operational Plan 2007-2010, implementation and use
of key national surveys (IBBSS, 2007; NARHS, 2007; Antenatal clinic sentinel
surveillance, 2008; Nigerian DHS, 2008), and development of state level M&E Technical
Working Groups and routine monitoring tools in order to strengthen their capacity to
provide effective supervision.
    81. The Bank’s country office had an expanded team (including a secondee from
DFID, a dedicated M&E adviser and several Short-Term Consultants), and was well
supported by other Bank departments (particularly GAMET), reflecting the challenges of
supervising such a large project, which covered the national program, and (eventually) 34
out of 36 states plus the Federal Capital Territory. The task team undertook regular
supervision missions, prepared and agreed Aides-Memoire, alerted government and
NACA to problems with project execution, and facilitated remedies in a timely manner,
in conformity with Bank procedures. The Implementation Status and Results reports
(ISRs) realistically rated project performance both in terms of achievement of
development objectives and project implementation. The task team also monitored
safeguard and fiduciary compliance. They identified a considerable number of minor
Financial Management issues, which did not lead to major compliance concerns and were
resolved in discussion with the client. Audit reports were reviewed by the task team
who notified the client of any issues raised by the auditors and ensured that these were
resolved.
   82. Rating: Satisfactory
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    83. Based on the moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry and satisfactory
rating for quality of supervision, overall Bank Performance is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    84. Government showed strong commitment to the project at the time of preparation.
In 2002, President Obasanjo declared HIV and AIDS a national emergency, established a
Presidential Advisory Council, and demanded a national emergency response plan.
Government also supported project implementation, establishing institutions, and
providing adequate staff. Government officials collaborated and cooperated fully with
the task team. Appropriate levels of review and approval were generally in place;



                                            25
financial accountability and follow-up was observed; expenditures were duly authorized
before they were incurred; and documentation was well maintained for periodic review.
    85. There were, however, delays from federal government in contribution of
counterpart funding and appropriate budget provisions, until this requirement was waived
in May 2005. The reduction in the government budget allocation to HIV and AIDS (eg a
19% reduction in the budget allocation to HIV and AIDS between 2006 and 2007)
occurred in the context of rapid increases in levels of external funding, particularly from
the Global Fund and PEPFAR. Many of the challenges faced during implementation
were due to bureaucratic bottlenecks that could have been resolved faster with a more
proactive approach from the government, though this was balanced by the sustained
commitment to the development of institutions in the form of NACA and the SACAs.
   86. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
(b) Implementing Agency Performance
     87. NACA was generally proactive and strong in implementation. In the initial stages,
it faced some leadership challenges. Once these were resolved it was well managed, and
provided the needed support to all states, especially on policy guidelines and technical
support. NACA also did some impressive work in development of NNRIMS as the basis
for M&E, though implementation remained a constant challenge, and in strengthening
planning with development of national strategic framework and national strategic plan.
The performance of SACAs was more variable, but was moderately satisfactory overall.
   88. Financial Management. NACA complied with Financial Management covenant
on submission of periodic reports (Interim Financial Reports, Annual Audit reports).
There were no outstanding reports. NACA provided timely, accurate, reliable financial
management. Instances of unretired advances, inadequate documentation for incurred
expenditures and ineligible expenditures were observed, but were subsequently resolved.
    89. Procurement Arrangements. Procurement of all works, goods and technical
services under the project followed the Procurement Guidelines “Procurement under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits?. NACA had well trained procurement personnel. Overall,
fiduciary performance was satisfactory.
   90. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
   91. In light of the Moderately Satisfactory Government performance and NACA’s
Moderately Satisfactory performance as discussed above, the overall performance of the
Borrower is rated Moderately Satisfactory

6. Lessons Learned
   92. Institutional capacity development is the most critical component of an effective
and sustained response. Training and skills upgrading alone will not be sufficient in the
absence of such capacity strengthening, which must include clearly defined and well
understood roles, responsibilities and management structures. These need to be kept
under regular review to ensure that timely support can be provided whenever new
capacity needs arise.


                                            26
    93. Development of a comprehensive M&E framework should be one of the first
project interventions. This is important both to demonstrate progress against well
defined baselines, and also to inform program development in order to choose the most
effective interventions and target these to the areas where they would have greatest
impact. It is critical to know where the next infections are likely to come from and to
adjust the project accordingly. The framework should set out arrangements of impact
evaluation, and lay the basis for reviews of efficiency of project implementation. The
implementing agency (NACA) has an important role to play in ensuring that M&E
implementation is well managed to ensure that key data is available and well used.
    94. Civil Society organizations can be important agents of change, but their
contributions must be well managed if they are to be maximally effective. Components of
effective management include: selection of CSOs with capacity and skills to develop well
targeted and effective interventions; agreement on the outputs to be delivered by funded
organizations, and monitoring of performance to ensure delivery of these; and negotiation
of longer, larger scale contracts to ensure coverage and impact on beneficiary
populations.
    95. Principles for maximizing the effectiveness of community mobilization should be
implemented with project support. These should include: total community coverage
through a cascading training model utilizing the skills of local volunteers; communities to
take the lead in designing their own interventions; approval for funding based on very
simple instruments; and building upon existing systems (including chiefs and traditional
leaders) to mobilize communities.
    96. Maximizing outcomes and impact depends on clear focus and prioritization,
including selection of a limited number of key ministries and agencies, increased focus
on those states which are experiencing the greatest number of new infections, and
delivery of services at scale to the most at-risk and vulnerable groups and populations
within those states. Regularly updated estimates of the size of vulnerable groups is
essential to ensure that high coverage levels are reached and maintained, supported by
specific service delivery targets for proven priority interventions set at state level.
   97. There is a need for more targeted communication on the part of the Bank and
NACA with other parts of government (at Federal and state level) and with beneficiaries.
Well designed briefs should be prepared for advocacy, communication to mobilize support,
and sensitization to ensure that successes are built upon.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower and Implementing Agency
   98. The Borrower and Implementing Agency did not have any major issues with the
content of this report, and have indicated that they are in agreement with the conclusions.
The Borrower has prepared its own evaluation report of the project, a summary of which
can be found in Annex 5.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1. Capacity Development
The project contributed to the institutional strengthening of NACA through procurement
of office equipment and vehicles, funding of coordination activities, meetings, workshops
and trainings. The number of staff members in NACA increased from four at baseline to
109 people at project closing, resulting in a major increase in capacity to develop policy,
carry out operational research, monitor the national response, and provide technical
assistance and policy advice to the states.
NACA capacity was further strengthened following transition to agency status in 2007.
The project supported an institutional assessment in collaboration with DFID. This
resulted in a restructuring of the agency, with designated Directors appointed to supervise
individual departments. The Federal Government took over all staff funding in 2009.
The project provided office equipment and funded technical staff for each participating
SACA. State project teams were set up with a project manager, accountant, procurement
officer, community development specialist and monitoring and evaluation officer.
A broad range of training and TA was provided to NACA and SACAs to build capacity
in: project management, planning and budgeting; procurement management; and IDA
Credit disbursement and financial management, including auditing. Technical skills were
strengthened in: Gender Mainstreaming; Behavior Change Communication and other
aspects of Prevention, PMTCT, Care and Support; and Information Technology,
knowledge management, and monitoring and evaluation.
The project helped to build capacity for strategic planning at national and state levels. A
National HIV Policy and National HIV/AIDS Strategic Frameworks and Plans (2005-
2009; 2010-2014) were developed following which all states prepared State Strategic
Plans (2010-2014). A project-funded Planning Adviser was embedded in NACA and
played a key part in providing technical assistance to all SACAs and Federal Ministries,
Departments and A MDAs in the preparation of annual action plans. NACA took over
funding of this position in 2009.
Project funds were used to support preparation and dissemination of a wide range of
policy and operational guidelines, including the NNRIMS Operational plan (2007 –
2010); NNRIMS Facilitators and Participants manual; National HIV/AIDS Policy (2003;
2009); The National HIV/AIDS Behavior Change Communication Strategy 2009-2014;
the National Prevention Plan (2007); and Guidelines for mainstreaming HIV & AIDS and
Gender into Poverty reduction Programs. A framework to guide implementation of the
BCC intervention program was developed and launched in 2004 targeting the general
populace and vulnerable groups. Funds were also used to develop a Workplace Policy on
HIV/AIDS for NACA.
NACA focused considerable attention on development of research capacity, and used
project resources to conduct Epidemiology and Policy Response and Synthesis studies in
18 States, to carry out a National AIDS spending assessment (2010 – covering 2007-08),
and to undertake a baseline survey of Orphans, Vulnerable Children and in and out of
school Youths.



                                            29
The issue of transportation was a key constraint impeding coordination, monitoring and
evaluation at the local government levels by the SACAs. HPDP1 provided vehicles to
states as requested. Computers and supporting hardware (printers, monitors and
universal power supplies) were procured, as were standby generators to ensure that the
frequent power cuts did not disrupt work.
Component II. Expanding the Public Sector Response
Line Ministries carried out activities to meet the needs of their own staff and their client
groups by (i) financing plans approved by NACA and SACAs; and (ii) supporting
preparation of plans and programs of action. Functional HIV/AIDS units were set up in
target ministries to build high level commitment, deliver prevention messages to staff,
formulate HIV/AIDS workplace policies, and oversee sector-specific initiatives for client
groups.
A total of 27 Ministries, Departments and Agencies were funded at Federal level, of
which the largest recipients of project funds (receiving 41% of total) were the Ministries
of Health, Education, Women’s Affairs and Social Development, Transport, Information
and Communications, and Labour and Productivity, and the Nigeria Prisons Service.

Each line ministry established a fully functional unit with full time staff to coordinate
HIV/AIDS Program activities. They engaged their management and workforce to
mobilized a critical mass of focal officials who promoted implementation of the program,
advocated for high level commitment; disseminated prevention messages among
personnel; and developed Workplace policy. Prevention programs were also developed
for the client base of each ministry. This was significant in the case of Health (addressing


                                               30
PMTCT, PLWHA and extension of HIV counseling and Testing), Education (school-
goers) and Women’s Affairs and Social Development (on gender issues and OVC). For
other ministries the focus was mainly on their own staff.

The Federal Ministry of Health – National AIDS-STI Control Program

Throughout the period covered by the project, the National AIDS-STI Control Program
(NASCP), a Division of the Department of Public Health of the FMoH, was responsible
for the national HIV/AIDS program of the Ministry. A similar arrangement existed at
state level with State AIDS-STI Control Programs (SASCPs) in each State MoH.
Key outputs were:
- Formulation of the National and State Strategic Frameworks and implementation
   plans: NASCP facilitated annual meetings to develop NASCP and SASCP’s Annual
   Implementation Plans for the health sector response to HIV/AIDS.
- Training of Trainers (TOTs) on Monitoring and Evaluation (use of PMTCT
   Management Information System tools and other aspects of M&E).
- NASCP sensitized and increased awareness among FMoH staff (including Medical
   Practitioners, Matrons, Nurses, Lab Scientists and M&E officers).
- SACA and SASCP advocacy visits to the political and Executive leadership of LGAs
   and held meetings with LGA Health Departments.
- Support to development and coordination of systems for Anti-Retroviral delivery
   (including development of guidelines for adult and pediatric ARV treatment).
- TOTs for logistics management, Procurement Management and Distribution of
   Essential Supplies.
- Assessment of sites for Global Fund activities.
- Blood Safety policy review was undertaken.
- Support to strengthening the HIV/AIDS Sero- surveillance system, and conduct of
   national surveys (NARHS, IBBSS).
- NASCP and SASCPs hosted coordination meetings and quarterly task team meetings
   on PMTCT.
- Support to scale up of Voluntary Counseling and Testing: needs assessment surveys;
   equipment and furniture for over 50% of VCT sites
- Supervisory visits of NASCP and SASCPs to ARV treatment sites.
NASCP and SASCPs also convened meetings of implementing partners working on
HIV/AIDS in the sector, including (among others) divisions responsible for TB control,
Malaria and Vector Control, Epidemiology, Blood Transfusion services, and the National
Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA). Regular coordinating meetings
were held with divisions to expand STI Treatment Services. STI syndromic management
guidelines were financed by the Project. Particular attention was given to provision of
strengthened integrated TB Services. A monthly coordinating Committee, headed by the
Minister for Health, met from 2006.
The project financed the operational costs of program monitoring at all levels of the
health sector response. M&E data on health sector HIV activities in the states and FCT
were collected by SASCPs and transmitted to NASCP and NACA in collaboration with
SACAs. The list of sites/facilities where services were provided was regularly updated.


                                          31
Ministry of Education
The major output of the Ministry of Education was the design and implementation of the
Family Life and HIV/AIDS Education (FLHE) Curriculum. At close of the project:
- 10 states were teaching an adapted FLHE Curriculum
- over 1,000 teachers had been trained in FLHE Curriculum implementation
- over 500 students had been enlisted and trained as Peer Educators.
The project supported development of a National Policy on HIV/AIDS for the Education
Sector, and an accompanying National Guideline for the Policy. These were prepared in
2004/05 to ensure equal assess to education of Children with HIV and to protect the
rights of HIV-positive teachers. The policy also committed to delivery of education to
OVCs, including provision of scholarships A support group was established in Benue
state for positive teachers.
HIV and AIDS desks were established at the Nigeria University Commission and the
National Commission on Colleges of Education to increase knowledge and understanding
of the epidemic at the tertiary education level. By project closing, many Higher
Institutions had established youth friendly HIV centers.
Ministry of Women’s Affairs and Social Development
The Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development (MoWASD established a
federal level HIV/AIDS Coordinating Unit in 2002. This unit led government initiatives
on gender mainstreaming, ensuring that gender. gender equity issues and HIV/AIDS
mainstreaming were established in the MoWASDs of all participating states (33 by
project close). Advocacy visits were paid to community leaders in the most affected
states (eg Benue and Kogi).
A bill was prepared on legislation on the rights of Orphans, Widows and PLWHAs in
2006, in order to avoid Disinheritance and Discrimination, and to promote women’s
HIV/AIDS Initiatives. Following this a national level workshop was conducted to train
women leaders as HIV/AIDS Counselors in 2008; and a similar workshop was held for
Female sex Workers in the Federal Capital Territory.
The project supported the ministry to establish and run a National OVC Steering
committee and HIV Steering Committees in 33 states, including: training for capacity
building on management of OVC issues for committee members and OVC Desk Officers;
steering committee meetings; and zonal meetings for OVC Desk Officers. National
guidelines and standards of practice on OVCs were developed and disseminated to States
and NGOs working with MoWASD.
Ministry of Information and Communications
The Ministry only undertook HIV/AIDS activities in 2007 and 2010. Trainings were
conducted for top level management and staff on sensitization and awareness generation,
and to mobilize commitment to implementation. The Ministry trained staff to develop
Information, Education and Communication/Behavior Change Communication materials,
and in monitoring and evaluation. BCC materials were disseminated, including jingles
targeted to the general population. These provided information on prevention of
transmission and on access to VCT Centers. Information on access to ARV sites was
also targeted to people living with HIV and AIDS.

The Nigerian Prisons Service

Project-supported HIV/AIDS interventions began in 2002, with formation of a Critical
Mass Committee. Following this critical mass committees were formed in all 36 states
and FCT; 8 were established in the 9 prison zonal commands and one in the Prisons
Headquarters, Abuja. A NPS HIV/AIDS Steering committee was formed in 2005.

The main outputs were:
- Preparation of policy and operational documents (eg HIV/AIDS workplace policy,
   HIV/AIDS Technical Guidelines, HIV/AIDS manual for prison health workers)
- IEC/BCC materials for sensitization and education of inmates and staff, used to guide
   regular sensitization and awareness campaigns on knowledge of major routes of HIV
   transmission, prevention and control.
- Capacity enhancement programs: BCC workshops for health workers and inmates (75
   prison officers were trained to deliver BCC); HIV Counseling & Testing (130 prison
   officers trained on counseling; 90 staff trained to carry out tests; test kits provided);
   20 peer educators trained at Kaduna Borstal Institution. State HIV desk officers were
   trained to use NNRIMS and complete the Quarterly Report format
- Treatment, Care and Support for 346 prisoners and staff living with HIV and AIDS.
   As of 2010, 4 prison support groups were registered with NEPHWAN (the Network
   of People Living with HIV and AIDS in Nigeria).

Component III. The HIV/AIDS Fund
The HIV/AIDS Fund (and Rapid Response Fund) supported over 1000 civil society-
based projects at national and sub-national levels. A review of this support29 noted that
whilst the results and impact of these projects have not yet been systematically tracked,
the interventions have almost certainly made a substantial positive to Nigeria’s response
to HIV/AIDS. In particular, HAF-supported projects appear to have contributed
significantly to efforts at sensitization and prevention as well as care and support of
persons affected by the epidemic. This conclusion is supported by the preliminary
findings of an evaluation of the community response to HIV and AIDS in Nigeria 30
suggesting that CBO engagement is associated with higher service availability and
awareness of HIV/AIDS-related prevention, treatment and care and support services and
with higher utilization of these services.

The HAF sub-projects were facilitated by some exemplary practices in implementation
(Box 1). But the review also found mixed implementation performance: selection of
thematic objectives and funding priorities was rarely guided by epidemiological data on

        BOX 1. SELECTED EXAMPLES OF GOOD PRACTICE IN HAF
        IMPLEMENTATION

             1.   Cross River State demonstrated exemplary standards and openness and
                  transparency in its HAF administration. Proposals from NGOs promoted by
                  politically powerful persons (e.g. First Lady) were not considered because they
                  were submitted late. The procurement specialist and the community mobilization
                  officer ensured the faithful application of the guidelines, no doubt helped along by
                  the Executive Secretary’s personal reputation for probity.
             2.   Cross River used LACAs to augment a monitoring system that would otherwise
                  depend on one M&E officer and one clapped-out car.
             3.   Lagos set the pace in evidence-led HAF implementation, using the epidemiological
                  response and policy synthesis to set objectives and targets for its RRF call. The
                  state also commissioned an AIDS Spending Analysis which was used to set HAF
                  thematic and spending priorities.
             4.   Kaduna SACA supervision of the grants was diligent, with each grantee receiving
                  more than two SACA supervisory and monitoring missions and the SACA chair
                  (the Deputy Governor now Governor) himself calling to check on progress.
                  External auditing was also rigorous, with grantees required to pass the audits
                  before accessing their succeeding tranches.
             5.   Disbursement of grants was timely and consistent in Benue State and, with the
                  RRF, in Lagos State.
             6.   Lagos explored the use of intermediaries for capacity building and monitoring of
                  CSOs. In 2005 the state contracted a well established NGO to reach 900
                  organisations. Lagos SACA noted the challenge of ensuring the neutrality of such
                  contracted intermediaries, and used its M&E Technical Working Group
                  (comprising technical experts and stakeholder representatives) to supervise these
                  intermediaries.
             7.   Lagos also developed a directory of CSOs and used it to target calls to cover
                  underserved geographical and thematic areas and population groups (for example,
                  persons with disability) without the need for the application of less objective
                  secondary criteria in selection of proposals.
         8. Implementation of the Rapid Response Fund was widely hailed as well
             conceived and smoothly implemented. Acclaimed features included: well
HIV/AIDS; the proposal review process was not always fully insulated from subjective
             chosen thematic areas; provision for hard-to-reach constituencies (e.g. rural
interpretations and political interference and proposal review results were not widely
             areas, persons with disability); prompt and adequate funding (although
publicized; and SACAs lacked the requisite M&E capacity to monitor projects.
              on thematic areas funded was low and project from NACA (three rounds of

3. Universal Precaution & Medical Waste Management (Capacity Building)
4. Syndromic Management of Sexually Transmitted Infections (Capacity Building).
SACAs requests for proposals for funding used similar breakdowns of thematic areas.

BCC included: basic prevention messages related to safe sex and partner reduction;
advocacy directed to policy makers and politicians; and messages related to reduction in
stigma and discrimination. Care and support included: Home Based Care; income
generation; nutrition; material and psychosocial care and education for OVCs. Universal
Precautions included safe disposal of wastes, and information on how to avoid
nosocomial transmission of infection.

The community response evaluation provides an indication of the extent to which HAF
outputs contributed to improved intermediate outcomes at the community level. The
study was carried out in the state which had been identified as having the highest HIV
prevalence rate in each zone. The total survey sample consisted of 5376 individuals.
The study findings are summarized in table 2.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Key components considered in conducting the cost-effectiveness analysis.
General
        • definition of intervention
        • states and time period
        • perspective (provider/societal/patient/client)
        • discount rate for cost/consequences incurred in different time periods

Costs
        • types of costs (capital/recurrent)
        • units and unit costs (including adjustments for non-market items)
        • costing methods (allocation of shared costs, amortization)

Effectiveness
        • outcomes (e.g., disability-adjusted life years, quality-adjusted life years, other)
        • • clear description of assumptions
        • generalizability and replicability

Methodology

The following procedures were used to perform the cost-effectiveness analysis:

   Establish the appropriate level of analysis. For example, establish whether the
    analysis is going to be conducted at a national level, and/or on state and local levels,




                                              37
    explaining the rationale for the chosen design and noting the advantages and
    disadvantages of the rejected and accepted scale of the proposed studies;
   Define and select interventions to be included in the analysis;
   Assess all the interventions included and their combinations assuming that they are
    implemented for a preset number of years, set to a specific start year (base year).
    Include all resources used for each intervention, or a combination of interventions,
    and assign them with values. This assessment is also based on a related assessment of
    the cost for each of the interventions or their combinations;
   Classify and measure costs. Use a standardized approach to measure costs, requiring
    information on the quantities of physical inputs needed per intervention and their unit
    cost. Thereafter, total costs were derived based on the quantities of inputs multiplied
    by their respective unit costs. In addition, we made sure that costs were evaluated by
    assuming a percentage use of capacity for all interventions, which was based on
    epidemiological data. Moreover, standardized approaches for discounting future costs
    to the selected base year value were applied;
   Establish plausible ranges for the epidemiological model parameters by reviewing
    relevant published studies and survey results for the Nigerian context. We use
    baseline prevalence projections from available sources (e.g. UNAIDS and WHO) to
    calibrate key parameter values for Nigeria;
   Undertake a number of epidemiological simulations by sampling values from each of
    the ranges. Thereafter, compare each simulation against the baseline projection of
    prevalence by gender and fit the model accordingly;
   Assess the impact of interventions and their combinations (incrementally) against a
    “no intervention? scenario (defined by considering what would happen to the
    assessed population’s health if they were put to zero today, i.e. setting the impact of
    all the key interventions to zero);
   Subsequently, trace the implications for the population health of adding all possible
    interventions, singly and in various combinations, against the baseline scenario. The
    difference experienced was thereafter be measured as the gain in health due to the
    reduction in disease burden from the interventions (DALY gained);
   Next, the cost of each scenario was compared with the gain to identify the most cost-
    effective set of interventions at different levels of resource availability. Moreover, the
    comparison of the current mix against the optimal set for the resources currently
    available shows areas of inefficiency.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's Report

1.      Preamble, Overview of Methodology / Approach
Partnership between Nigeria and the World Bank to address the unprecedented challenge
posed by HIV/AIDS commenced in the late 1990s culminating in the signing of the first
HIV/AIDS Program Development Project (HPDP 1) in 2001. Project implementation
commenced in 2002 and the project closed on 31 March 2010. This evaluation,
conducted by a Team of Consultants had the following objectives: 1) analyze and present
borrower evaluation of the relevance of the project objective to the HIVAIDS response at
the national state and local levels; 2) indicate the results of each component of the project; 3)
examine implementation issues; 4) provide feedback for knowledge sharing by NACA (who
commissioned the study), and all agencies that were involved in project preparation and
implementation including the funding organization. This summary presents the main
findings, assessment of the roles of key stakeholders, measures for sustainability of
achievements, and lessons learned. The full report details the methodology employed in
conducting the evaluation including the process, database, other inputs; key findings,
challenges and recommended next-steps.

The evaluation focused on Implementation Agencies and stakeholders in the three tiers of
HPDP 1 governance, which corresponded with the nation’s administrative structure: 1)
NACA, MDAs at the Federal level; 2) SACAs of the 34 States, the Federal Capital
Territory (FCT) and MDAs at the States level; and 3) LACAs. NACA, 10 states34 and
their LACAs were selected for close study. The findings are considered adequate for
generalization. Seven of the 27 Federal MDAs supported by NACA were selected for
their strategic importance. The financial performance of all 35 SACAs and 27 Federal
MDAs was assessed.

2.     HPDP 1 Objective, Its Relevance and Achievements
The original project objective was to assist Nigeria to reduce the spread, and mitigate the
impact, of HIV infection by strengthening its multisectoral response to the epidemic
through the implementation of a comprehensive program that includes the creation of an
enabling environment for a large scale response, and laying the foundation for scaling up
HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment services at the federal, state and local levels.
The three components were: 1 Capacity Development; 2 Expanding Public Sector
Response; and 3The HIVAIDS Fund.

Relevance of Project Objective - the project objective and components succinctly
encapsulated the sixteen priority interventions adopted by Nigeria for the HIV/AIDS
National Strategic Framework (NSF) For Action (2005 - 2009). Also reflected were
priorities earlier defined by the HIV Emergency Action Plan, 2001 – 2004. The Project
contributed to achievement of Millennium Development Goal 6 Combating HIV/AIDS

and other communicable diseases by 2015; and is consistent with Nigeria’s commitment
to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS
(scaling up prevention, care and support for universal access).

Key implementers confirmed that the objective was relevant in addressing the epidemic
at national, state and local levels and that the project objective has been largely achieved.
The Project design was also considered appropriate after it was restructured in 2004,
following when the rate of disbursement improved.

3.      Brief on Socio-Economic and Epidemiological Factors
Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa (estimated population 158.3 million)
grapples with a high communicable disease burden. Life expectancy at birth is estimated
at 48.4 in 2010 (UNDP). There has been a declining trend in HIV sero-prevalence across
the country between 2001 and 2008. Prevalence rose from 1.8% in 1991, through 5.8% in
2001, dropping to 4.4% in 2005. It increased slightly to 4.6% in 2008. Wide variations
exist between states (1% - 10.6%) and between urban and rural sites. Over 3 million
people are currently living with HIV/AIDS in the country, with approximately 340,000
new infections a year, of which 55% are in women. There were 180,000 HIVAIDS
related deaths in the same period. There are currently 2.2 million children below 15
years orphaned by AIDS (FMoH, 2008).

4.      Project Financing
HPDP 1 provided predictable and flexible funding for implementation of the national
response. By project close, March 2010, GoN had received US$138 million. NACA
received 63% (US$27 million) of its share of the IDA Credit (US$43 million). All the 34
states and FCT expended US$93 million (96 %. of total allocation to states - US$ 96
million).

Records on expenses incurred on thematic areas by each implementation Agency were
not available for the assessment. Relative percentages expended by the 34 states and
FCT varied significantly. The analysis pointed to the need for further financial capacity
enhancement ahead of and under HPDP 2. Federal Government’s contribution to
financing of the project, through NACA, totaled approximately N 144.00 million
(US$ 0.966). Of the 34 States and FCT, only 12 paid counterpart contributions, totalling
approx US$4 million. The project also leveraged significant financing for the national
response from other Development Partners (see Section 5.11).

5.      Component 1: Capacity Development
The first Component of HPDP 1 had several sub-components including: Policy
Development and Strategic Planning; Coordination of the response at National, State and
Local level; Project Management including staffing and capacity building; Procurement
and Financial management; Behavioral Change communication; Partnership; Gender
Mainstreaming; Monitoring and Evaluation of implementation of the project and of the
entire national response; Research in relation to knowledge generation on HIVAIDS and
Knowledge Sharing.

Project Achievements

5.1. Coordination and Governance Coordination and Governance at National Level:
From the return of democracy in 1999, through creation of NACA in Jan 2000 to date,
the level of Federal level commitment to the multilateral response has been high. NACA
constantly engaged high level policy makers, both executive and legislative arms of
governance to advocate for the response and commitment through financial provision.
Government commitment resulted in the emergence and growth of NACA to lead the
national effort. Government convened and hosted African Heads of States in April 2001,
resulting in the Abuja Declaration and Framework for Action, and the meeting which led
to the African Union Abuja declaration of 2006 for Accelerated Action.

As a direct result of aggressive advocacy and mobilization by NACA, as of 2010 35
SACAs, (in 34 States and FCT) had been established by the end of the project, from a
base line of 6 SACAs and 4 MDAs supporting the response in 2002 (Kano and Niger
States are the exceptions). 27 Federal MDAs have mainstreamed HIVAIDS activities in
their sector programs.

Considerable increase in GoN funding of NACA has enabled it to fund 100% of its wage
bill from the Agency’s line budget, as compared to 2008 when HPDP1 paid 40% of the
wage bill. In May 2007, NACA became the National Agency for the Control of AIDS.

Coordination at the Sub-national Level: SACAs and LACAs: Twenty-two SACAs
have now transformed to Agencies. The rest have Bills on the Agency structure already
presented to their various Houses of Assemblies. However, it is noted that the high level
of commitment at the national level progressively dwindles at the level of states and
LGAs, reflected in correspondingly lower financial inputs by states.

LACAs remain the weakest among the three tiers of coordination of the HIV/AIDS
response. Even in spite of HAF, Component 3 of HPDP 1, (which also ought to have
been administered by SACAs in collaboration with LACAs), the operational and
financial weakness of LACAs has created a gap at the grassroots level, in the
mobilization and coordination of local responses of stakeholders.

5.2. Strategic Development and Project Management The performance of SACAs’
and especially NACA’s has been impressive: the Agencies effectively mobilized
stakeholders in policy reviews, policy formulation and preparation of strategic
frameworks. All States and FCT (with the exception of Kano State) have produced State
Strategic Plans (SSP) 2010 – 2014. Of the SSPs, only 3 were not HPDP1 funded (Taraba,
Niger and Borno SSPs).

5.3. Planning From 2002 to 2009, NACA provided IDA funded Technical Assistance
(TA) for all SACAs, and all Federal MDAs in the preparation of Action plans, at
interactive sessions, during the 3rd to the 4th quarter annually. Similar TA was provided
by NACA for CSOs in 2008 and 2009.




                                           44
5.4. Capacity Enhancement The project provided the following staff for each SACA:
manager, procurement officer, accountant, community development specialist, and M&E
officer. HPDP1 funded training and TA were provided by NACA for NACA officials,
SACAs, Federal MDAs and CSOs. SACAs also utilized project funds for capacity
enhancement for States MDAs. The range of training and TA provided included project
management, planning and budgeting; Gender Mainstreaming; SBCC and other aspects
of Prevention including PMTCT; Care and Support; Information Technology, knowledge
management, M&E with emphasis on utilization of the NNRIMS Guidelines.

5.5. Procurement Management A procurement management system was established
by NACA and SACAs. NACA and the World Bank provided procurement and financial
management TA to States through trainings, seminars, workshops and reviews. Main
themes included procurement planning, documentation, methodology for Procurement of
goods and equipment, and contract monitoring. Procurement management followed the
HPDP1 Procurement Manual, the World Bank Guidelines as stipulated in the
Development Credit Agreement and the Procurement Act, Federal Government, 2007.

5.6. Financial Management Financial Management arrangements in NACA and
participating states followed the HPDP 1 Financial Management manual, agreed with the
Bank. Arrangements were adequate for Federal and State level project implementation.
Computerized accounting systems were introduced and used in NACA and SACAs.

5.7    Communications and Partnership with the Media Following NACA structural
reorganization in 2009, the Communications Dept. was split: the Behavior Change
Communication (BCC) Unit is now part of Prevention Planning and Implementation,
under Program Coordination Department; the Corporate Communication Unit is managed
as a Specialist Unit.

BCC - Key Achievements: NACA and implementation entities (SACAs, MDAs, CSOs
and implementing partners) produced and aired BCC messages all year round to target
audiences. Messages largely focused on HIV prevention including PMTCT, HCT and
Testing and prevention of Stigma and discrimination. Target audiences were the general
population, priority audience especially policy makers, PLWHAs, MARP (FSW, MSM,
Transport Workers, the Uniformed Services). The project contributed to financing of:
National Social and Behavior Change communication training manual, 2010; Review of
National HIV/AIDS BCC Strategy (2004–08); National Prevention plan, 2007 (updated
2010) National HIV&AIDS BCC Strategy (2009 – 2014); and Assessment of HIV/AIDS
communication initiatives in Nigeria (J 2008). As a result of BCC interventions, among
other measures, the percentage of people aged 15 to 49 years knowledgeable about
correct ways pf preventing sexual transmission of HIV increased from 25% in 1999 to
59% in 2003, and 67% in 2008 (NDHS, 2008). The 2008 achievement was 11.5% above
the 2010 target of 55.5%.

Corporate Communications, NACA: Focused on media publicity, campaign rallies,
awareness creation, advocacy visits, workshops and conferences. The Unit provided
capacity building for the media and sponsored BCC activities providing the link between



                                          45
the BCC Unit and the media. A Media advisory committee was established in 2004 and
reconstituted in 2010. The Corporate Communication Unit has produced 3 editions of a
NACA quarterly news magazine in 2010.

5.8. Mainstreaming Gender Into HIV/AIDS Response The National Gender
Technical Committee (GTC) was set up as a NACA standing Committee. Several States
also set up GTCs.        NACA in collaboration with UNIFEM organized gender
mainstreaming training programs for key program implementors: NACA directors and
deputy directors, program officers, managers,; Federal MDA officials; SACAs; State
level MDAs; some LACAs; and CSOs. A Gender Division was created in NACA in
2009, as one of three Divisions of the Program Coordination Department. The National
Women’s Coalition on AIDS (NAWOCA) was inaugurated in 2007, as an advocacy
platform to address the disproportionate vulnerability of women and girls to HIV
infection in Nigeria, and to protect the rights of women and girls living with HIV and
AIDS. State chapters were launched in Nasarawa and Katsina States. A national work-
plan had been formulated and agreed but yet to be implemented due to the need for
NACA and SACAs to provide financial resources and engage gender experts.

5.9. Partnership With Stakeholders NACA mobilized and coordinated key Civil
Society stakeholder groups including: Network for People living with HIV/AIDS in
Nigeria (NEPWHAN); Civil Society for HIV/AIDS in Nigeria (CiSHAN); Society on
Women and AIDS in Africa, Nigeria (SWAAN); National Youth Network in HIV/AIDS
(NYNETHA); National Faith-based Advisory Committee on AIDS (NFACA); the
National AIDS Research Network (NARN); the Nigerian Business Coalition Against
AIDS (NiBUCAA); and The National Association of Nigerian Traders (NANT).

5.10. Promoting Private Sector Participation NACA engaged with the private sector
through NiBUCAA, established in 2003 and including mainly multinational and large
national companies. Private sector expenditure on HIVAIDS program totaled over NGN
3 billion (US$ 20 million) from inception of the multilateral response to 2010.

5.11. Knowledge Management, Monitoring and Evaluation NACA developed the
Nigerian National Response Information Management System (NNRIMS), a
comprehensive M&E framework, including process, outcome, and impact indicators; and
produced NNRIMS Participant’s Manual and NNRIMS Operational Plan (2007 – 2010).
These are used by all implementing partners, donors and the research community. M&E
system development efforts received substantial project support and direct TA. NACA
provided technical and administrative coordination for six major implementation reviews
between 2005 and 2009, including National HIVAIDS Response Review (2005 – 2009)
(Dec 2009), and Assessment of Effectiveness of HIV/AIDS Fund (HAF) and Evaluation
of the Support for the Public Sector (MAP) on the National Response to HIV/AIDS in
Nigeria, 2002 – June 2007 (Oct 2008). Other key studies supported by the project
included: Measurement of HIV/AIDS Service delivery resource gaps, for the period
2010 to 2015 (jointly conducted by NACA and Health System 20/20 Project); National
AIDS Spending Assessment. 2007 and 2008 (NACA/ UNAIDS, 2010); and HIV/STI
Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance Survey (IBBSS) 2007.

6.      Component 2: Expanding Public Sector Response
From a baseline of 3 MDAs at project inception, NACA posted a very impressive
performance, recruiting 27 MDAs by project closure. The MDAs actively mobilized
their personnel, the executive / political leadership and their clients bases.

6.1.    MDA Financing NACA disbursed approximately US$4 million to 27 MDAs, for
execution of planned activities. FMoH received the main share (16% of the total). The
Ministries of Education, Women’s Affairs and Social Development and the Nigerian
Prison Service (NPS) received 6%, 4.5% and 4.0% respectively; 2.0 % was disbursed to
the Ministry of Information and Communications. Implementation was considerably
lower than targets, largely due to constraints with plan approval and delayed
disbursement. Of 7 Federal MDAs studied, only two (Ministry of Transport and NPS)
reported having received subventions from their line budgets. Evaluation data from
States did not include records of SACA MDAs financing; and only one state, Lagos out
of the 35 SACAs reported on financial support to LGAs.

6.2. Brief on Performance of sample MDAs HIV/AIDS program was mainstreamed
into the sectoral investments of 6 of 7 MDAs assessed. Each MDA had a functional unit
coordinating Program activities. A two-pronged approach was adopted: i) focusing on
management and workforce (to mobilize a critical mass of officials to implement the
program; launch advocacy campaigns for high level commitment; and disseminate
prevention messages to staff); and ii) delivering awareness generation, BCC and sector
specific initiatives to the sectors for which each MDA had responsibilities. All seven
MDAs formulated HIV/AIDS Workplace Policy to guide its HIV plans and activities.

6.2.1. The Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH): AIDS-STI Control Programs.
The FMoH NASCP and State MoHs SASCPs played primary and central roles by
strengthening elements of health system for HIV/AIDS service delivery nation wide
including health sector strategy development, development of guidelines, capacity
building, annual planning, monitoring and evaluation. With funding from HPDP1, key
accomplishments of NASCP included: TA to develop NASCP and SASCPs Annual
implementation Plans; Training of Trainers for Health Workers on PMTCT M&E; ARV
administration (systems development support, financed        NASCP coordination ;
Development of adult and paediatric ARV guidelines; Essential Supplies Logistics,
Procurement Management and Distribution ToT; Assessment of sites for Global Fund
activities (2007); NASCP and SASCPs-convened meetings of implementing partners
includin divisions responsible for Tuberculosis control, Malaria and Vector Control,
Epidemiology, Blood services Division of the Hospital Services Dept., and the National
Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA); STI Treatment Services
expansion coordinating meetings; Guidelines for standard operation procedure for STI
Syndromic management. The project financed the program monitoring operational costs
at all levels of the health sector.

6.2.2 Ministry of Education (MoE) The main thrust of the Federal FMoE was the
Family Life HIV&AIDS Education (FLHE) Curriculum, developed for primary and



                                         47
secondary levels for use in all states. Ten states are delivering the adapted Curriculum,
over 1,000 teachers have been trained in curriculum implementation and over 500
students as Peer Educators. Many Higher Institutions have established youth friendly
Centers eg University of Nigeria, Nsukka and the University of Ibadan. Education policy
documents, guidelines and strategic documents were developed including: National
Policy on HIV/AIDS for the Education Sector; National Guideline for the Policy;
National Education Sector Strategic Plan (NESP); National Monitoring and Evaluation
Plan / Indicators; National Family Life and HIV/AIDS Education Curriculum;
Instructional Materials Development Guideline; and Printed and Produced Reports on
FLHE & peer Education Trainings.

6.2.3. Ministry of Womens’ Affairs and Social Development The project supported
the Federal MoWASD to ensure that Gender and equity issues and HIV/AIDS
mainstreaming were established for 33 State ministries. A Bill has been presented to the
National Assembly, to make provision for the prevention of HIV and AIDS based
Stigmatization, Discrimination and to protect the human rights and Dignity of People
Living With and People Affected by HIV and AIDS.

6.2.4. The Federal Ministry of Transport The Ministry’s main clientele include
important risk populations. In the provision of prevention services to its main clientele,
FMoT mounted BCC messages. In 2005 and 2006, eight Bill Boards with HIV/AIDS
Messages were constructed and erected at Strategic Places at Seaports, Jetty, and Rail
Stations in order to disseminate information to transporters and their passengers. Fliers,
posters, hand bills were also printed and distributed.

6.2.5. The Nigerian Prisons Service (NPS) Capacity enhancement was provided to
health workers and inmates on HIV Counseling & Testing, BCC, and M&E. Test kits
were supplied. NPS also provided Treatment, Care and Support for 346 PLWHA in the
prison (inmates & staff).

7. Component 3:- The HIVAIDS Fund (HAF)
The main objective of the third component of HPDP 1 was to expand investment in the
HIV/AIDS national response to the non-public sector, consisting of: CSOs, Private Sector
Organizations (PSOs), NGOs and Community Based Organizations. That had been
largely achieved, as civil society organizations have become more active in the response
to HIV/AIDS. The mechanism established for assistance by the Public Sector to the Civil
Society covered all the states of the country, through NACA HAF and the 35 SACAs.




                                           48
Project Achievements

7.1. Sub-Project Financing: Out of a total allocation of US$13 million for the National
HAF only 67% (US$ 8.7 million) was expended. For the 35 SACAs, 122% was utilized
(US$ 38.6 of a total allocation of US$ 31.6 million). Expenditure ranged from a low of
1% (Ebonyi State) to a high of 149% (Oyo State). (It is noted that project level
documentation is incomplete.

7.2. HAF End-beneficiaries In line with targeting of MARP, the review found that the
population cluster groups that benefited directly from the sub-projects included: Youth
(in-school and out-of-school; Students in tertiary institutions; Women; People Living
With HIV/AIDS; Orphans and vulnerable children; Sex Workers and clients; Hotel and
pub house managers; Long distance drivers and passengers; Network groups and
associations, including workplace groups; Faith based groups and religious adherents;
Health workers etc.; Motor vehicle mechanics, Hair dressers and barbers. 165 grantees
were funded by the National HAF covering all thematic areas. Of these 26 CSOs
addressed prevention; 34 focused on care and support; 57 BCC; 19 impact mitigation; 15
advocacy; 27 capacity building; 26 HCT/VCCT; 4 condom social marketing; 5 OVC; and
6 universal precautions and medical waste. Similar enumeration in regard to State HAF
would require more complete records, but it appears that state level administered HAFs
addressed similar thematic areas.

7.3. HAF in general supported Capacity Enhancement and Institutional development
of grantees’ organizations in: Proposal Development; workplan formulation; improved
knowledge of transmission, prevention, care and support for PLWHA; how to address
stigma and prevent discrimination; home based care for PLHIV; other forms of technical
assistance, training on implementation of a wide range of HIV/AIDS services; and
project monitoring. VCT services were increased leading to increase in VCT uptake
including by MARPs. Through HAF, the project succeeded in increasing support from
community leaders, religious leaders and political leaders. An innovation under HAF3
was support for the emerging trend of ICT based social networking for psychosocial
support to vulnerable populations (text messaging, phone-in/Q & A sessions on toll free
hotlines). Organizations that focused on HIV and persons with disabilities formed a
network for better synergy and effective resource mobilization. Key challenges included
the need for better targeting of OVCs and MARPs; weak technical skills in financial and
procurement management; delayed releases of funds; the need for good documentation
and for regular quarterly monitoring.

8. Prospects for sustainability of activities after project closure
The study reviewed measures instituted by Implementation Agencies and stakeholders to
ensure sustainability of project achievements, including: i) governance and institutional
factors; ii) further technical skills development in program, project and procurement
management and monitoring; iii) further financial management and audit system building.
Implementation Agencies are also seeking resource mobilization from endogenous
sources through: advocacy for political commitment targeted at he Federal and State level
policy makers; and LGA political leadership; increased annual budgetary process



                                           49
efficiency; increased allocation by the three tiers of Government; more active
engagement with the Private Sector, through NIBICAA, to widen and deepen the scope
for Public Private Partnership; and proposals for increase in Value Added Tax.

9.            Assessment of Performance of Key Stakeholders

9.1. Performance of Government: Federal Government of Nigeria performance to
present has been quite satisfactory. The country has demonstrated leadership in
mobilizing governments’ commitments to the response in Africa. FGN commitment
resulted in establishment of NACA to lead the national level efforts. In April 2001, the
FGN convened and hosted African Heads of States, which forum produced the Abuja
Declaration and Framework for Action, for the fight against HIV, TB and related
Diseases in Africa. Also relevant in terms of continental appeal, is the African Union
Abuja declaration of 2006 for Accelerated Action.

Regarding total spending on HIV/AIDS in Nigeria, GoN (Federal and States) contributed
14.65% and 7.6% in 2007 and 2008 respectively (Nigeria National AIDS Spending
Assessment, March 2010).

9.2. Performance of The National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA)
NACA enacted its roles satisfactorily. Assessment of NACA’s coordination role in the
context of higher level FGN commitment revealed that country ownership has been high.
The Agency played significant role in mobilizing MDAs to mainstream HIVAIDS
program and for states to establish SACAs and move from a health-centered to a
multisectoral response. Stakeholders were mobilized; training and TA were provided for
NACA, SACAs, MDAs and CSOs in all technical aspects of the response, in
collaboration with Development Partners. NACA mobilized stakeholders in policy
formulation and review, and preparation of strategic framework. However, NACA noted
the unclear roles and relationships between NACA, SACAs and the Bank in regard to
oversight of SACAs; clarification would enhance effectiveness of future implementation.

NACA has had a functional Board since it transformed to an Agency in May 2007. Its
staff strength has considerably increased (4 in 2001 to 109 by 2010). NACA now
finances 100% of its wage bill from its line budget (up to 2008 HPDP 1 financed 40%).

9.3. Performance of States’ Agencies for the Control of AIDS (SACAs)
Performance of SACAs is estimated as moderately satisfactory. SACAs effectively
mobilized state level stakeholders in state policy reviews and formulation and preparation
of State Strategic Plans. By 2010, twenty-two SACAs had transformed to Agencies.
SACAs provided Technical Support to state level MDAs and LACAs but the rate of
success was mixed. The transition period between closure of HPDP 1 and start of
HPDP2 should allow for reflection on measures for strengthening SACA’s technical
capacity for monitoring and reporting; mobilization and coordination roles in regard to
states MDAs, LACA, CSOs, CBOs; and productive engagement with the private sector.
(See more recommendations in the full report). The project was restructured at mid-term

review in 2004, removing the counterpart fund requirement, following which Credit
disbursement rate progressively rose
.
9.4. Performance of Local Agencies for the Control of AIDS (LACAs)
LACAs remained the weakest among the three tiers of coordination of the Nigeria
HIV/AIDS response. Little has been reported on their performance. In terms of inputs,
only one out of the 35 SACAs (Lagos) reported providing financial support to LGAs
using the IDA Credit. For LGAs to be empowered to meet their role will urgently
require: planned and consistent attention advocacy to mobilize LGA Political Leadership;
training and TA for capacity building; provision of funds through LGA budget line;
participation in National Council on AIDS and other relevant fora; regular reporting;
close and joint monitoring of implementation (LGAs / SACAs /NACA).

9.5. Performance of The World Bank In addition to the flexible financial investment,
through HPDP 1, the country benefited from high quality TA, which has been the
hallmark of the World Bank. Commitment to meeting client needs and responsiveness to
changing requirements facilitated: HPDP1 adjustment at a midterm review in 2004;
additional financing in 2007; and preparation and Board Approval of HPDP2 in 2009.
Implementation Agencies reported periods of implementation delays as a result of
delayed communication of “no objection? and disbursement of IDA Credit from the Bank.
With increase in Bank Country Office Staff the flow of communication improved. On
the whole, aggregate performance of the World Bank was quite satisfactory.

10     Key Lessons Learned

Continuing political commitment at the highest level of all tiers of Government is critical
for an effective national response. With the general election scheduled for 2011, a
comprehensive advocacy program will be required to ensure renewed commitment to the
response, especially at LGA and State levels.

Commitment at the highest level of private sector corporate governance is fundamental to
responsive Public Private Partnership (PPP) in combating the epidemic, both at work and
in the community at large. The response should not be allowed to remain largely public
sector centered. If henceforth, the public sector could engage more proactively with
Captains of Industries (for-profit private sector) that would actively mobilize more of the
latter’s contributions. Otherwise, the response would continue to be external dependent.

Given the vastness of micro and small enterprises in Africa and in Nigeria in particular,
engagement with the recently established National Association of Nigerian Traders
(NANT) has the potential of extending community responses to more rural areas, hard to
reach areas and MARPs, since NANT members constantly commute and transact
businesses between and in major urban and rural markets.

With well targeted capacity building, technical support and regular monitoring, Civil
Society (i.e. NGOs, FBOs, CSOs) should remain one of the most vibrant sectors of the
response.



                                            51
Formation and nurturing of a CSO network focused on HIV and persons with disabilities
will increase synergy and effective resource mobilization from other investors.
Strategic and sustained capacity enhancement, financial investment and active monitoring
of SACAs, LACAs and CBOs are fundamental for effective decentralization; this
depends on skilled and empowered sub-national governments,.

An innovation under Component 3, which has a ready appeal to the youths-in-school and
youths out-of-school is support towards the emerging trend of ICT based social
networking, for psychosocial support to vulnerable populations (young person) e.g. text
messaging, phone-in/Q & A sessions on toll free hotlines.

Subsequent funding cycles should consider the integration of poverty reduction sub-
components into HIV/AIDS programming. That is given the recognition that poverty has
been one of the main driving forces for the spread of the epidemic; and that most of those
that are infected and affected, even if they were economically comfortable before, ended
up being pauperized by the scourge.

For categories of ss such as prisoners, male and female sex workers, youths in correction
homes, etc the possibility of project success is higher when provisions are made (linkage
to BCC) for re-orientation of the end beneficiaries towards acquisition of sustainable
alternative skills e.g. in areas such as hairdressing, weaving, tie-and-dye, barbing,
carpentry. Alternatively, end-beneficiaries that required skills in such income generating
activities should be formally and simultaneously (during implementation of BCC
activities), linked to vocational institutions offering economic empowerment programs in
the area.

Active and effective monitoring of the epidemic in Nigeria, through various surveys,
studies and reviews; including Advocacy, BCC/IEC which placed the subject upfront
constantly have contributed to awareness generation.
