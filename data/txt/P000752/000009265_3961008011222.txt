MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA FOR A
SEED SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) for SDR 15.2 million
(US$22.0 million equivalent) on standard terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a Seed
Systems Development Project (SSDP).
Country and Sector Background
2.    Ethiopia, with a population of 54.8 million, is Sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous
country. Its social indicators are amongst the lowest in the world. The 1994 per capita GDP is
US$ 125, and the infant mortality rates are higher than the regional and global average; there is a
growing chronic protein energy malnutrition, and some 60 percent of the urban population lives in
absolute poverty.
3.    Ethiopia's political and economic structures have been subject to repeated and profound
changes in the past decades. In 1974, a revolution put an end to monarchy and feudalism and
introduced state control over investment, production and trade. In the following years, a continuing
civil war further crippled the economy. The socialist regime was replaced in 1991 by the
Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) which announced a new economic policy, signaling a
move towards a market-oriented, decentralized economic system in which private sector initiatives
would dominate. The bold economic reforms implemented since mid-1991 include a major
devaluation of the Ethiopian Birr, deregulation of the transport sector, initiatives towards
parastatal reform and deregulation of most prices, including food grain prices.
4.    The ongoing Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction Project (ERRP), Credit 2351-ET,
represents TGE's first major step to support economic recovery in the short term. The beneficial
impact of ERRP is already evident in several sectors. For instance, in the agriculture sector,
import assistance by IDA and some donors resulted in an increase in fertilizer consumption of
some 40 percent which became a major factor, combined with good weather, in contributing to the
record cereal production in 1992. TGE is also being assisted by IDA, and other donors, through a
Structural Adjustment Credit (CR. 2526-ET). TGE has also reached agreement with IDA and the
IMF on the subsequent phase of reform presented in the Third Policy Framework Paper, negotiated
in September, 1994 for the period 1994-95 to 1996-97. The bi-weekly auction of foreign exchange
by the National Bank of Ethiopia has been working satisfactorily since May 1993.
5.    The TGE is of the view that because of the dominant role of the agricultural sector in the
economy, accounting for about 55 percent of GDP at factor cost, 60 percent of commodity exports,
and 80 percent of employment, this sector is and would remain the engine of growth in the
economy for some time to come. About 6 million smallholders with holdings averaging at about
one hectare, produce 90 percent of food grains, pulses and oilseeds, as well as 98 percent of the
coffee--the principal foreign exchange earner. The state farms contribute the rest, while large,
privately operated, farms were until very recently non-existent.



- 2 -
6.     Crop yields are low to very low (about 1.2 tons per hectare for main cereals, 0.6 tons for
pulses and 0.5 tons for oilseeds) because of the poor quality of seed, inadequate fertilizer
application rate, poor extension of technology, infrastructural deficiencies, recurrent droughts,
declining soil fertility and, until recently, lack of incentives for farmers due to government control
over the input and output markets and prices. There is good potential to raise the yields of food
grains and other crops by 50 to 100 percent by the use of high quality seed of improved varieties,
particularly when such seeds are used with other inputs and proper cropping practices. However,
access of farmers to commercial seed of genetically superior varieties remains very poor in spite of
the useful work done by the Ethiopian agricultural research system in the development and release
of such varieties.
7.     TGE recognizes that the need to increase food production, both in the immediate future
and in the medium term, is of paramount impoitance not only for food security and poverty
alleviation, but also to expand agricultural exports and stimulate overall growth in the economy.
The country's foodgrain requirements estimated at around 8.4 million tons in 1994 (including about
0.8 million tons of imports) are estimated to rise to 11.4 million tons by the year 2000-an increase
of about 3 million tons. On the other hand, food imports beyond one million tons would impose an
unsustainable burden on the country's foreign exchange resources, the available port capacity in
Asseb (Eritrea) and Djibouti, as well as on the country's road and rail network, the transportation
fleet and the storage infrastructure.
8.     The strategy to increase food grain production in the short to medium term would havc to
rely primarily on raising the productivity of land, since significant area expansion is not an
effective alternative because of social, economic and environmental costs of opening up new land
and the lengthy lead time required. An appropriate strategy to increase yield would comprise a
widespread use of high quality seeds of improved varieties in conjunction with fertilizer and sound
agronomic practices. Seed is the cheapest input in agriculturc, yet it has the most profound
influence on crop yields. The productivity of a crop is directly lirnked to the genetic potential of the
seed uscd, and varies according to the use of recommended complementary inputs and the
observance of cultural practices. For centuries, the Ethiopian farmers have used their own seed
saved from the previous crop, or obtained from neighboring farmers. These seeds, though well
adapted to local agro-ecological situations, are generally low yielding when compared to modem
high-yiclding varieties bred in agricultural resea;ch stations with relatively wider adaptability in a
range of cnvironments and with a built-in responsiveness to the application of chemical inputs like
fertilizers. Expcriencc shows that a rapid cxpansion in quality seed production and use is possible
only if two conditions are satisfied. One, instead of the seed being produced and marketed through
the formal sector alone, it should simultaneously be produced and exchanged in the informal sector
comprising numerous smallholdcrs. many of whom reside in remote, difficult to reach locations.
Two, the public sector monopoly of the formal seed sector should be replaced by a competitive
environment to improve its efficiency.
9.     In Ethiopia, the Transitional Government (TGE) has already announced a National Seed
Industry Policy fNlSIP) under which domestic private sced enterprises, so far conspicuous by their
absence. Xvould be encouraged to activclv participate in the production and distribution of
improved seeds. According to this policy. seed prices would be determnined by market forces, the
variety releasc mcchanism  would be strcamlincd. participation of farmers in germplasm
conservation and seed production would be cncouraged, linkages between various participants in
the seed industry would bc organizcd, and seed qualitv standards--the most critical ingredient of
any seed program--would bc regulated. TGE has already established (July 1993) a National Seed



- 3 -
Industry Agency (NSIA) to oversee and coordinate the development of the entire seed sector under
the guidance of the National Soedl Industry Council (NSIC). Further, TGE has also taken steps to
restructure the sole seed enterprise in the formal sector, namiely the Ethiopian Seed Enterprise
(ESE), a parastatal set up in 1978. The operations of ESE have so far been characterized by lack
of commercial approach, scant regard to quality standards, recurrent losses, underutilization of
capacity and a neglect of its most important client, namely the farmer. ESE is now an autonomous
public enterprise, with its own board of directors, and with a hard budget constraint. It is currently
engaged in decentralizing its operations, widening its production base by entering into seed
production contracts with the private sector, and developing a marketing infrastructure of private
retailers, instead of depending on governmental and non-governmental institutions for the
marketing of its seeds. ESE also has a standing joint-venture agreement with Pioneer Overseas
Corporation, Ltd. of USA since 1991 for the production of hybrid seeds. Thus, ESE is in the
process of changing from a supply oriented parastatal to a market oriented commercial enterprise.
The Ethiopian seed sector scenario is changing for the better.
Project Gbjectives
10.    The main objective of the project is to contribute to the national goal of increased
agricultural production and productivity by laying the foundation for the development of a broad-
based and competitive seed industry which draws its strength both from the formnal and the
informal seed systems. This project has been designed as the first phase of a longer term seed
industry development program to establish the basis for and direction of change. It is recognized
that, given the nature of the seed industry, where biological processes strongly influence the pace of
growth, and given the evolutionary nature of institutions and the currently weak status of the
private sector, which had been emasculated during the two decades of the previous regime, the seed
industry development would require phased implementation over a decade or so.
Project Description
11.    Policy Environment: The realization of the project objectives would critically depend
upon the existence of a conducive policy environment. The project would build on the initiatives
already taken by TGE and would require adequate implementation progress in four specific areas,
namely, seed pricing, seed marketing, private sector development and quality control. In the areas
of seed pricing, TGE needs to harmonize the institutional, regional and national seed pricing
policies and bring them in line with its Seed Industry Policy, so that seed prices are determined by
the free play of market forces. In the area of seed marketing, which is the weakest link in the seed
production-marketing chain, development of an efficient and well-articulated private seed
marketing system, which can reach out to the peasants in all parts of the country, is a critical
building block for an effective seed system. In the area of private sector development, IDA has
been assured that the private sector would be encouraged to (a) produce and distribute improved
seed; (b) engage in plant breeding; and (c) start seed enterprises. Towards this end, TGE would
ensure that the private sector would have equal access to the breeder seeds and at the same prices
as the public sector. In the area of quality control, IDA has been assured that immediate emphasis
would be placed on quality control and "truthful labeling" of seeds; simultaneously, steps would be
taken to put in place a legal framework and establish appropriate enforcement procedures and
systems.
12.    Project Components:  The project would support seed policy reform, and has two
components of which one focuses on Seed Enterprise Development ($17.2 million), and the other



-4-
on Capacity Building ($13.8 million). Seed enterprise development would focus on (a) the
informal seed sector; (b) technical assistance to the private sector in entering the seed business; and
(c) restructuring of ESE from a centrally managed parastatal to a decentralized and commercially
oriented enterprise.
13.    In the informal sector, the project would, in the form of the Secondary Seed Multiplication
Scheme (SSMS), build on the available tradition of seed preservation and farmer-to-farmer
exchange through a limited intervention to train selected farm families (including women, as they
play an important role in seed cleaning and preservation), at specific locations, in the modem seed
production, cleaning and storage technology, and assist them with improved planting materials,
which would gradually become part of the informal seed exchange system. The project would also
provide these participating farmers with simple tools, like hand sieves for seed cleaning and family
size storage bins, to make the program attractive, yet sustainable with minimum governmental
intervention. SSMS would be backstopped by extension staff, trained in simple seed technology
and provided with bicycles and mules to improve mobility. NSIA would oversee and coordinate
SSMS, to be implemented by the Regional Agricultural Bureaus.
14.    In addition, the project would provide assistanec to private seed producer-sellers who are
expected to emerge from the aforementioned farmer-to-farmer exchange system and become thus
part of the formal sector. The project would therefore assist entrepreneurs interested in setting up
small-to-medium scale seed enterprises. Since role models do not exist for such private sector
initiatives, the project would arrange (a) convenient access to technical know-how; (b) availability
of breeder and basic seed material at prices similar to those for the public sector; and (c) technical
guidance and support in preparing feasibility studies and business plans for bankable projects.
Assistance would in these cases be provided by the business development unit in NSIA. The
criteria of selection of small-to-medium scale seed producers and certain ceiling costs of assistance
in each case would be agreed between IDA and TGE. Finally, the project would assist ESE in
diversifying its foundation seed production base, rehabilitating its seed processing infrastructure,
acquiring one mobile seed cleaner to eater to the location specific needs of drought prone areas in
the northern and north-eastern part of Ethiopia, and strengthening its quality control infrastructure.
The restructured ESE is expected to act as an agent of change, as it would progressively contract
seed production with commercial farmers and peasants, whereby it would increasingly market its
seeds through a network of private and cooperative sector retailers.
15.    The capacity building component of the project would strengthen seed-related institutions
(the National Seed Industry Agency, the National Variety Release Committee, the Plant Quarantine
Service, the Plant Genetic Resourec Center (PGRC) and the seven agricultural research
institutes/university engaged in brceder seed production) by providing office equipment, machinery,
air-conditioned seed stores, laboratory equipmcnt, and esscntially needed vehicles. The project
would also finanec incremental recurrent costs on a declining basis. The project would finance a
study to determine the feasibility of a reservc stock of seeds for chronically drought pronc areas;
funds are set aside for eventually establishing such a reserve based on the recommendation of this
study. Under the capacity building component, the project would also provide technical assistance
to NSIA and other institutions to help them develop and upgrade their systems and procedurcs.
Similarly, local training would be provided to the staff of implementing agencies as wcll as
farmers, particularly in the informal sector. Finally, givcn the acute shortage of seed technologists
in the country, the project would finance a limited number of foreign fellowships in seed
technology.



-5 -
16.   Financing: The project would be financed from three sources. IDA would contribute
US$22.0 million (including a PPF of US$0.8 million), TGE would contribute US$4.1 million, and
ESE would finance US$5.7 million. TGE would on-lend US$5.6 million of IDA funds to ESE. The
onlending terms would be identical to those applied by the commercial banks in Ethiopia, and
would include an interest rate of 14 percent, repayment in 10 years, without grace period; ESE
would bear the foreign exchange risk. Procurement would be done by NSIA and ESE; the NSIA
would handle all procurement for the government entities, while ESE would procure for itself
exclusively. A separate special account would be established for NSIA and ESE, in order to
facilitate disbursements. Project costs, and financing, procurement and disbursement arrangements
are summarized in Schedules A and B. The time-table of key processing events is given in
Schedule C, and the status of Bank Group Operations in Ethiopia is given in Schedule D, and a
map is also attached.
Project Implementation
17.   The Project does not propose any new institutions or agencies to be created for project
implementation. The overall responsibility for project implementation and its monitoring would
rest with NSIA, which is designated to provide effective guidance and institutional linkages for the
coordinated development of the seed sector. The Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit
(PCMU) in NSIA would have a monitoring, reporting and facilitating role, such as ensuring
maintenance of proper project accounts by each implementing agency, orderly and timely
submission of withdrawal application through the SSDP office, and finalization of periodic reports
and other information needed by IDA. NSIA would have direct responsibility for designing and
implementing two important sub-components, namely the Secondary Seed Multiplication Scheme
in the informal sector, and private sector development in the seed industry. NSIA would develop a
strong database, organize training and awareness programs as well as an annual workshop on
seeds, and would be the focal point for coordinating all technical assistance and training prograns
as well as foreign fellowships funded under the Project.
18.   NSIA would be IDA's counterpart agency for the Project. The Ministry of Agriculture
would play a critical role in efficient implementation of the secondary seed multiplication scheme
and in creating mass awareness about improved seeds. It would collaborate closely with NSIA and
provide effective guidance to the regional agricultural bureaus. The Ethiopian Seed Enterprise
would implement its restructuring plan, which would be overseen by NSIA and reviewed on a
quarterly basis by the National Seed Industry Council; the enterprise would further, based on its
medium term objectives, prepare each year an annual plan of operations and submit it for IDA
review. The Institute of Agricultural Research and the Alemaya University of Agriculture, being
responsible for the breeder seed production program, would upgrade their infrastructure and
facilities under the Project. The private sector would be represented on various implementation
committees for SSDP. In addition, both the public and private sectors would be invited to attend
meetings of the National Seed Industry Council (NSIC), when SSDP's progress reports would be
reviewed. The Ethiopian Standards Authority would update or set-up, as appropriate, seed
standards, and the NSIA would process the creation of a legal framework. The enforcement of the
law would be the responsibility of the Seed Quality Control and Seed Certification Service. The
Regional Agricultural Bureaus would be responsible for agricultural extension to support SSMS
and quality seed awareness programs.

Project Sustainability
19.    The Project has been designed to minimize Government's budgetary burden. The
participatory approach to the development of the informal sector is a one-time assistance to
farmers, including distribution of small seed packets and some hand and other tools. Similarly, the
one-time technical assistance, granted to new entrepreneurs in the formal sector by way of
feasibility studies, has been designed to minimize the burden of recurrent expenditures. Further,
with the free market pricing for seeds, consistent with NSIP, no price subsidies would be involved.
Also, as the restructured ESE is expected to operate commercially with a hard budget constraint,
its financial accountability is expected to improve and the C overnment to be relieved of its
budgetary responsibility towards this parastatal. The breeders would develop an appropriate
pricing policy for cost recovery from sales of breeder/basic seeds to ESE and the private sector.
NSIA, which is to have a critical and catalytic rolc for the development of the seed sector, would
need regular budgetary support for about 20 professionals and support staff. In terms of annual
budgetary outlay, this would be a very small amount, and not exceed the sum of $250,000. The
Project's sustainability is thus well assured.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement
20.   In the case of the formal seed sector, the 12-year long (1979-91) Ethiopian experience with
full state controls is an example of how a seed system should not be run. The
improvements/reforms initiated by TGE since 1991 are already beginning to show results. ESE
has turned the corner and started showing some profits. The basic message of IDA's experience in
other countries is that disproportionate placement of seed investments in the public sector and
relative neglect of the private sector, absence of a conducive policy environment which would
encourage private sector involvement in the technological functions of the seed sector (including
plant breeding, product development, import of better tecinologies and their subsequent
dissemination), reliance upon a single institution and ad hoc inter entions by the Government, have
generally met with poor success. On the other hand, examples of relative success have included
investments in institutional development, technical assistance and training. These lessons have
largely guided the design of the project.
21.    With rcgard to the informal sector, there are some useful lessons from secondary seed
multiplication schemes which have becn tried in a number of countries. T hese are not necessarily
Bank-financed. A major conclusion is that Farmer-Managed Seed Systems (FMSS) are not a
substitute for the conventional seed system-they are complementary to each other, and as both
systems evolve, the distinction between the two would fade. In the most successful systems in the
informal sector, the emphasis has been on farmers' training and extension advice. In Malawi, the
Secondary Seed Multiplication Scheme did not succeed because farmers could not freely sell the
seed; they were required to deliver it to the Government, as seed prices are controlled and
subsidized. In Senegal and Gambia, communally managed seed plots were not nearly as well
maintained as secd plots managed by individual farmers. In Senegal, the system has worked well,
but being heavilk donor and NGO dependent, sustainability is the issue. In Nepal, the system has
been in placc for over 10 years. A lesson from the Nepal experience is that the more decentralized
a system, the mc;c efficicntly it worked. For instance, working with farm families was better than
working with groups; storage bins for individual farmers proved more attractive than mini-seed
houses. These lessons have been incorporated in the SSMS component of the project, which
focuses on the training of farm families, and is fully decentralized.

Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement
22.    The project is an integral part of IDA's Country Assistance Strategy which is designed
to respond directly to a key concern of the Ethiopian authorities--reducing the vulnerability of the
rural population to famine. Food security would be pursued through a concentrated effort to
increase productivity of smallholder agriculture. One of the major objectives of IDA's country
assistance strategy is to improve food security on a sustainable basis. Economic growth is the
essential basis of a long-term strategy to reduce poverty through increased employment and food
production. The aim of the Bank's program is to support this growth strategy through a series of
important measures, which include: (a) a policy framework to stimulate production, exports, and
private sector growth; (b) a reliable flow of inputs for the productive sectors; essential
improvement and expansion of infrastructure; (c) environmental rehabilitation and conservation;
and (d) institutional capacity essential for economic growth. The proposed project would help
ensure the supply of a key input for the main productive sector. In fact, high quality seeds
constitute the basic first step in any agricultural yield enhancing program. The project would
therefore support TGE's strategic goal to keep national food deficit at a level which can be met
with imports. It would also be a natural complement to the on-going IDA support to the
agricultural sector through the proposed National Fertilizer Sector Project. Further, it would help
ensure that the Ethiopian rainfed agricultural system develops resilience and capacity to cope with
erratic rainfall patterns and drought by widening farmers varietal options in terms of planting time,
maturity period, and capacity to cope with moisture stress. Also given the small average size of
holdings in Ethiopia, and the fact that some 60 percent of the farmers are below the poverty line,
the project would contribute to sustained enhanced yields and higher incomes, and thereby help
alleviate rural poverty.
Agreed Actions
23.    During negotiations, detailed agreements were reached in order to ensure satisfactory and
timely project implementation. In summary, it has been agreed that NSIC would (a) regularly
revicw the project implementation progress, including that of ESE; (b) ensure that both the public
and the private sectors are invited to the NSIC meetings which periodically review SSDP
implementation progress, and are represented in all implementation committees at various levels.
Further, it has been agreed that NSIA would (a) assist ESE in implementing its new marketing
strategy; (b) encourage the private sector to produce and distribute improved seed, engage in plant
brecding and start secd enterprises; (c) develop selection criteria for small and medium-scale
private cnterprises to be assisted under the project; (d) ensure that the private sector has access to
the breeder seed of publicly bred varieties, to ESE's basic seed, and that the private sector would be
frce to import sced for use in the development of new varieties or for seed production; (e) get the
seed rcscrvc study completed as per the agreed timetable, with the terms of reference satisfactory to
IDA for a joint TGE/NSIA/IDA review for further action; (f) organize and coordinate all technical
assistance, training and foreign fellowship programs under the project; (g) give high priority to the
crcation of a legal framework to ensure that all seed marketed by governmental agencies, including
ESE, is truthfully labeled and that seed certification remains voluntary; (h) put in place appropriate
institutional mechanisms, as agreed, for project implementation, including the organization of a
projcct launch workshop, development of a detailed operational manual in project year one,
preparation of annual work and procurement plans, compliance with IDA procurement guidelines,
systematic and regular reviews of implementation progress, a mid-term review at the end of project
year two, a workshop on seeds every year, annual audit of accounts by auditors acceptable to IDA,
and closc working relationship with the regional bureaus of agriculture. In addition, it was agreed



- 8 -
during negotiations that TGE would (a) enter into a subsidiary loan agreed with ESE on terms
acceptable to IDA; (b) provide the needed facilities, support and budget for timely and efficient
implementation of the project; (c) ensure that seed prices are market determined; (d) attach high
priority to the creation of a legal framework for the control of seed quality; (e) license private
foreign firns which show interest to undertake crop research activities on non-restricted crops; and
(f) ensure that the Plant Quarantine Service would establish uniform and effective detection
procedures before June 30, 1996. Finally, assurances were obtained that ESE would (i) submit its
detailed restructuring plan, annual business plans, annual audit reports, and periodical reports on
implementation progress in agreed formats and as per agreed time schedules; (ii) follow strict
financial discipline and reduce inventories and accounts receivables and accounts payable; (iii)
undertake timely steps, acceptable to IDA, to complete the study for a basic seed farm in northern
Ethiopia; and (iv) ensure the timely contribution of its own funds for project implementation.
24.    Conditions of credit Effectiveness: It has been agreed with TGE that the following shall
be the conditions of credit effectiveness: (a) execution of a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory
to IDA, between TGE and ESE; (b) submission by ESE of an acceptable action plan for its
restructuring, and its annual business plan for the first year; (c) submission by NSIA of its annual
work program for the first year and standard bidding documents for procurement under the project,
both satisfactory to IDA; (d) confirmation by NSIA that all the posts listed in para I of Schedule 4
of the Development Credit Agreement have been satisfactorily filled; and (e) submission of
evidence to IDA that a satisfactory accounting system for project expenditures has been put in
place.
Poverty Category
25.    Even though SSDP is not a poverty-targeted intervention, the project would directly help
smallholders by raising their incomes through enhanced crop production and productivity levels.
The informal seed sector development program is expectcd to reach out to smallholders with farm
holdings of less than one hectare and particularly those located in remote, inaccessible areas, and
help them increase their incomcs.
Environmental Aspects
26.    The project is rated category B for environmental assessment, as cnvironmental issucs are
limited and narrow in scope. Currently, the use of seed dressings and pcsticides for sced
production, processing and storage, is negligible and a mitigation plan is not warranted. TGE will
shortly issue a pesticide registration scheme, which would set standards for pcsticide importation
and use in Ethiopia. In addition to a negative list of pesticides for imports, the Project would train
extension agents and farmers in safc handling and use of pcsticides. Risks would be minimized by
financing the import of only those seed protection products which arc rclativcly lcss risky, and
simultaneously developing short-term training programs in integrated pest managcment techniques
and safe pesticidc handling.
Program Objective Categories
27.    The Projcct relates well to Program  Objective Categories.  The project is designed to
contribute to the overall goal of povcrty alleviation. First, SSMS in the informal sector would
improve the crop productivity of smallholders and thus raise their income levels. In addition, the
producer-sellers of seed, generally small farmers again, would cater for localizcd demand, thereby



minimizing the seed processing, transportation and distribution costs, and making seed available to
farmers at lower than formal market prices. Also, expanded use of improved seed would enhance
yields and income of the seed users. Second, the project would improve the management and cost
effectiveness of ESE through restructuring, decentralization and more efficient organization of seed
production and marketing activities through the private sector. Third, by expanding the varietal
choice of seeds, the project would assist the drought-prone areas by offering them a wider choice of
seed varieties (like short duration, late sown varieties) more relevant for their agro-ecological
situations to help sustain their production during times of moisture stress. Fourth, the project, by
involving farm families in the seed production effort, particularly in the informal sector, would
address the gender issue in as much as seed selection, seed cleaning and storage are activities
mostly handled by women in rural households. And, finally, by supporting the Plant Genetics
Resource Center, the project would contribute to the preservation of the existing genetic pool of
land races.
Participatory Approach
28.    The project is based upon detailed and extensive discussions with TGE. The Government,
in turn, has crystallized its thinking based on the findings of several task forces with members
drawn from research, extension, trade and the farming community. IDA missions also had
consultations with the commercial farmers, smallholders and private traders, ESE and ESE-Pioneer
joint venture management, the research and extension agencies in the regions as well as the
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia. As a result, it is expected that, with the launching of the project,
the private farmers and traders would be increasingly drawn into seed production and marketing
activities. In fact, a Project Launch Workshop with the participation of all implementing agencies,
including the private sector, is expected to set the stage for a participatory approach in project
implementation.
Project Benefits
29.    The benefits from the project would be several. First, the increased use of seeds would
enhance crop productivity significantly. Second, to the extent that complementary inputs like
fertilizers are used with seeds of higher genetic potential, the yield increases could be dramatic.
Third, the introduction of the concept of seed quality, proper labeling of seed bags and introduction
of smaller size of bags, to adjust the seed rate for dominant (small) holding size, would lay a firm
foundation for a sustained and rising seed demand by ever increasing number of farmers. These
benefits would increase incomes of improved seed users, provide improved food security and help
alleviate poverty. Fourth, in drought prone areas, a wider varietal choice of seeds to respond to
changing rainfall-drought situation could mitigate the risk and help farmers minimize their crop
losses. Finally, once a sound seed production and marketing system is in place, the time lag
between the release of a variety and its availability to, and use by, the farmers can be considerably
reduced. Both the financial (at the farm and at ESE level) and the economic analysis demonstrate
the profitability of the project. The return on investment for ESE and the profitability of use of
improved seeds for the peasants are satisfactory, as indicated by the (financial) internal rate of
return which would measure 8 percent in real terms, and the Value Cost Ratios which are generally
well in excess of 2.5 for all major food crops. The economic rate of return would be 36 percent and
therefore considerably above the opportunity cost of capital; the switching values of total benefits
and total costs of the project indicate that the probability of not achieving a minimum satisfactory
economic return (10 percent), is minimal. The project is, therefore, anticipated to be sustainable
and would contribute significantly to economic growth.

Project Risks
30.    There are four main risks associated with the project. The first risk relates to the economic
and political environment and the uncertainties caused by the transition period. The risk is real,
but there is no viable alternative for TGE to change the course or speed of economic reform. The
second risk relates to the possible inadequate response by the private sector. This risk is not rated
high in view of the past two to three years of experience relating to private sector's role in entering
the agricultural inputs business. The size of investment required to enter into the seed business is
relatively small. The third risk is that ESE may not quickly and effectively restructure itself into a
slim, viable and efficient organization. While the possibility of this risk materializing cannot be
ruled out, provision has been made for adequate technical assistance to strengthen ESE.
Furthermore, ESE is required to annually submit a business plan to be reviewed by its Board of
Directors, NSIC, as well as IDA. NSIA would have the responsibility to follow-up and assist ESE
to overcome its problems. The fourth risk is that NSIA, which is a nascent institution may not be
able to build up adequate capacity to implement and monitor implementation progress of various
agencies. This risk too is real. The project therefore has appropriate conditionality that NSIA
must appoint all the agreed professional staff before credit effectiveness. It is expected that in view
of TGE's demonstrated commitment to the project, such a contingency may not arise.
Recommendation
31.    1 am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement for the
Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

ETHIOPIA - IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
The performance of the portfolio of ongoing projects has been affected by the complex nature of
the political evolution in Ethiopia. Before the change of government in 1991, the portfolio consisted
largely of projects which included monopoly parastatals and were designed to be implemented through a
centralized system of administration. Large parts of the country were not covered due to lack of access
during the civil strife. Following the change of government, the first priority was to restructure the
existing projects.
Of the five problem projects (all from the previous regime) in the FY94 portfolio, the Forestry
project was closed (June 1994), the Small Scale Irrigation project has been upgraded and the Market
Town project is being upgraded following project restructuring. As a result, only two problem projects
remain, namely Peasant Agricultural Development (PADEP I) and Second Addis Urban Development
(SAUD). A supervision mission of April-May 1995 is reviewing the restructuring plan and will propose
actions for the PADEP I. The SAUD's restructuring is largely complete and the remaining step is
confirmation that water tariff increases will be implemented in May 1995.
The portfolio is leaner, more focused and meets the priorities of the TGE. Disbursements on
investment projects increased from US$91 million in FY93 to US$146 million in FY94 (including the
ERRP). The overall disbursement factor rose from 15.6 percent in FY93 to 24.9 percent in FY94,
attributable to effective implementation of the ERRP, without which there was a slight decline from 15.1
percent to 13.7 percent. The total undisbursed balance for investment projects was reduced from US$589
million in June 1993 to US$412 million as of December 1994.
In addition to difficulties caused by the need to restructure old projects and redefine projects'
ownership and administrative structure, there have been problems in procurement, disbursements and
special accounts. Training workshops on procurement and disbursement issues for senior government
officials, including regional officials, were conducted in 1994 and 1995. A comprehensive Country
Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) was carried out in March 1995. At its conclusion, understandings
were reached to correct the overdue audit situation, progress was made on resolving the problem of
inactive special accounts, and an action plan was designed to improve implementation of problem
projects.
A first adjustment operation, SAC I (US$250 million) was approved by the Board in June 1993
and became effective in July 1993. Disbursement of the first tranche was completed in January 1995, but
there has been some delay in meeting a number of the second tranche conditions, particularly regarding
the privatization process. However, a Bank review mission that visited Ethiopia in March 1995 found that
substantial progress was made since January in putting up for sale state-owned retail shops, hotels and
restaurants. These and other findings of the mission are currently being evaluated prior to the release of
the second tranche.
