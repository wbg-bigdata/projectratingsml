APPRAISAL OF THE MEHARIEH THERMAL PR PROJE CT
(F THE ET&BLISSEMENT PUBLJfl DE L'IIECTRICME
SUMMA  AND 0(ICLUS IONS
i.        This report cowrsthe appraisal of the 1ehardeh Thermal Power
Project of the Etablissement Public de l'Electricite  (EIE), the Govern-
ment owned entity established in 1965 to be responsible for generation,
transmission and distribution of electric power throughout Syria. The
co-lender for the Project would be the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development (Kuwait Fund).
ii.       The Project comprisest the first 125-MW stage of a steam-electric
power station to be constructed on a new site at the Mehardeh reservoir on
the Orontes river, near Hama; 4 new and the expansion of 4 existing 230-kV
substations; management and engineering consulting services and training.
iii.      Total cost of the Project is estimated to be US$62.6 million, with
a foreign exchange component of US$43 million equivalent which would be joint-
l;y financed by the Bank (TUS$25 million) and the Kuwait Fund (TUS$18 m1illio)
The Project forms a part (14%) of EFts exceptionally large (US$460 million)
1973-1979 construction program.
iv.       The recent Middle East war has caused extensive damage to EPE's
steam generating facilities, the technical effects of which, however, are
being rapidly overcome. Lebanon has increased its exports to Syria from
25 MW to 40 mw; some plant has already been returned to service;  and a
number of g&a turhlanes already on order in early 1973 are now being installed.
A further 230 MW in gas turbine capacity, financed by a grant from other Arab
States, will be in operation by mid 1974., and most of the remaining damaged plant _
is expected to return to servceprogressively.  In Ebbruary 1974 about 80% of
power requirements were already being met and by mid 1974 all power restrictions
are expected to be removed. Repair of about 75 MW of steam-driven generating
plant appears uneconomic. This plant constituted about 27% of EPE's total
pre-war capacity.
v.        SyriaLs transmission system consists of about 1480    vig4    ciruit
230-kV lines. EPE's development program is urgently needed to complete and
expand this system, and the steam-electric plant included in the proposed
Pro,,ect should be conatructed as soon as possible in order to reduce the high
cost of operating gas turbine plant. Additional major projectsi already under-
way (in addition to gas turbine plant) are the construction of 800 km of 230-kV
lines, 25 small diesels (20 MW, 1973-1975) and the completion (by the Ministry
for the Buphratea)--in 1974 of the first three units, and in 1965/1966 of a
further two units, of the projected eight 100-MW units in the Thawra (Tibqa)
hydro plant.  This plant is located at the multipurpose Euphrates dam, which
was closed recently and whose prinary objective is irrigation and the control
of the Euphrates waters.



- ii -
vi.       Although the effects of the war are expected to cause sowe
temporary reduction in growth rate, EPE's sales are forecast to increase by
an average of about 22% through 1979. To meet this rapid escalation of
responsibility the company needs to improve its existing structure which is
fragmented into a number of insufficiently coordinated regional offices.
For this purpose EPE proposes to employ consultants under the loan for the
improvement of its operational and accounting methods and organization, and
for assistance in the implementation of on-the-job and other training programs.
EPE also intends to engage experts for the initial operation of the 1Mshardeh
plant and to set up a technical training center for its staff at Damascus.
The loan includes US$1 .1 million to assist in financing part of the cost of
these institutional reforms and training proposals.
vii.      Operation of the Project requires the completion, by 1977, of the
230-kV lines connecting M)hardeh, Hama, Homs, Aleppo and Damascus as well as
the second line from Thawra to Aleppo now under construction, and the line
from Thawra to Hama. All these will be financed from a bilateral credit
already available, and for which a first contract (for 800 km of 230-kV lines)
has already been signed. EPE has undertaken to sign a contract for constructing
the remaining lines (about 300 km) prior to July 1, 1975, and expects to
ccmplete all lines (1,100 km) by mid 1977.
viii.     The Government will transfer to EPE the ownership and management
of the Thawra hydro-station and associated transmission facilities at the
expiry of the suppliers guarantee periods, and  cause EPE to assume a share
of the cost of the Euphrates dam, the amount of which will be agreed between
the Government and the Bank.
ix.       The average level of EPE's tariffs is adequate to provide a reason-
able rate of return once the short-term effects of the war have been over-
come. The Government and EPE agreed to maintain electricity tariffs at no
less than their existing 1973 level through 1977, and from 1978 at levels
sufficient to achieve a rate of return of 9% on the average net assets in
operation. Reduced sales due to damaged generating plant, and the subsequent
high cost of fuel due to the need to employ substitute swans of generation,
are expected to result in net operating losses for 1973 and 1974. The
financial afterveffects are likely to continue through 1977, but EPE's rate
of return is expected to exceed 9% from 1978 onwards without any increase in
the present level of tariffs.
x.        Procurement would be on the basis of International Competitive
Bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines and;no local preference
has been requested, nor would Syrian suppliers be in a position to provide
equipment and materials for the proœect. Bid documents have been issued
for substations and associated facilities and for major items of power station
equipment, including an option for the supply of a second 125-MW generating
unit at I*hardeh within sixteen months of contract signature.
xi.       In view of the agreements reached as set forth in Section 7, and
subject to the signing of a loan agreement between EFE and the Kuwait Fund
for a loan of the equivalent of US$18 million, the Project would be suitable
for a Bank loan to EPE of US$25 million equivalent, repayable over 25 years
including a grace period of 4 years.

APPRAISAL OF THEIMEHARDEH THER$AL PGWER PROJECT
OF THE ETABLISSMNT PUBLIC DE L'BIECTRICITE
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Syria has asked the Bank and the Kuwait Fund
to help finance jointly a Project of the Etablissement Public de L'Electricite
(EPE) comprising the first 125-NW stage of a steam-electric power statiom at
Nehardeh, eight 230-kV substationsj, training, management and engineering consult-
ing services.
1.02      The Project has been delayed due to the recent Middle East war, which
caused extensive damage to EPE's generating facilities. These difficulties are
rapidly being overcome due to financial assistance in grants from various
Arab States, which has enabled the rapid installation of a large number of
gas turbine units. The short term impact on the electricity supply has been
severe. The financial effects will be of a longer duration due to loss of
revenue and the need for gas turbine generation, with its high fuel cost,
which will have to replace about 75 NW of daoaged steam-electric plant either
uneconomic to repair, or for which repairs will take about as long as the
installation of new plant.
1.03      Wien the Project was appraised in May 1973 the proposed powr station
was planned for location near Banias on the Mediterranean coast but, following
the October war, the Government decided to relocate the power station.near the
Mehardeh reservoir on the Orontes river.
1.04      A joint loan of US$25 million from the Bank and US$18 million from
the Kuwait Fund, would finance the foreign exchange cost of the Project, whose
total cost ia estimated to be US$62.6 million. The Bank Group has not previously
lent for power to Syria.
1.05      The Project bas been prepared following reconnaissance and pre-
appraisal missions in September 1970, March 1972 and February 1973, and a
feasibility study by EPE's consultants, S(FREIEC of France. An appraisal
mission comprising Messrs. W.F. K-apper (Engineer), A.J.D. Hutchins (Fin-
ancial Analyst) and F. Dunn (Consultant) visited Syria in May 1973. Sub-
sequent to the war Messrs. G.E* Wyatt and A.S. El Darwish visited Syria in
December 1973 and Messrs. Kiipper and Hutchins in February 1974  for updating
the information on the power sector in general. and EPE and the Project in
particular.
2. POdER SECTOR
General
2.01      The Syrian Arab Re blic, on the east coast of the Mediterranean,
has a land area of 185,000 kmo  (71,400 square miles). Most of its estimated
7.0 million inhabitants are concentrated in the fertile areas on the coast
and along the Euphrates. The former, covering about 25% of the country, is



-2-
separated by mountain ranges from the predominantly desert are&. to the east,
through which the Euphrates valley fonus a relatively narrar  ciltivated strip.
Out of about 6e0 million ha cultivated, 2.4 million ha is located in the Euph-
rates basin., which also accounts for about half of the total irrigated area of
some 0.5 milliom ha.
2.02      The Euphrates is Syria's most important resource for future
agricultural development. This river accounts for about 88% of the
country's water resources. The first phase of a large Euphrates Basin
development scheme is already under way with financial assistance from
the USSR. It comprises a reservoir at Thawra (Tabqa) with a live storage
capacity of about 7,400 million m3, a 60-m high earthfilled dam and a
power station with an initial capacity of 3xlO0 MW and space for 5
additional units.
2.03      The major irrigation developments are scheduled for epletion
in the next 2 decades, A 41,000 ha. irrigation project was appraised
for Bank/IDA financing concurrently with the present power Project* For at
least 10 years, however, the Euphrates reservoir waters will be available
mainly for the generation of power to be used in EPE's network because the
direct diversion of waters and the power requirement for irrigation pumping
will be relatively modest. Since it is the Government's stated intention
that irrigation will take precedence over power system supply the availability
of power is expected to reduce gradually to an average of about 50% of the
estimated 2,000-2,200 GWh average annua energy capability by about 1990. The
dam is scheduled for completion in early 1975 and reservoir filling has started
recently.
2,04      An even larger water storage project on the Euphrates is under con-
struction in Tarey at Keban. This reservoir has a live storage capacity of
16,000 million m , and closing operations at the dam were started in November
1973. Together the Keban and Thawra reservoirs would practically fully reg-
ulate the river and therefore improve the water regime for irrigation along
its whole length.
2.05      Because of downstream water requirements, the time needed for dam
completion and the resettlemat of the population in the reservoir areas, the
possibility of dry years, and since the Thawra and Keban reservoirs may re-
quire a three to four years filling period, limitations on the power avail-
ability at Thawra may arise during the next few years. in this report con-
servative assumptions have been made of the availability of Thawra power for
EE's operations during these years i.e. 200 GWh in 197L4 600 CWh in 1975, and
1,200 GWh in 1976, Full estimated capability of 2,200 (Oh would be reached in
1978,
Energy Resources
2.06      The possibilities of bydro power developments in aGdASion so Thawra
are small. A preliminary irrigation study envisions the constr Ict±on of a dam
and reservoir on the Khabour river, a tributary to the Euphrazese, but no firm
plans have been prepared. Because most of the waters would be xqolzisd for



3 -
irrigation, the power benefits would be small. A thermal station could
conceivably be constructed in the eastern tip of Syria near the Tigris,
using oil field flare gas for firing and the river for cooling water pur-
poses. However, due to the future excess capacity in gas turbine plant
available (see 2.11), the company is considering relocating a number of gas
turbines to Somedie, where oil-gas is available (see 2.07), once the area
has been connected to the main power system (1976/1977), It is estimated
that up to 100 MW in cheap power could be obtained in this way.  Because of
cooling water constraints, development of major thermal plant can only take
place adjacent to the large rivers or on the coast. Power developments
after Thawra are expected to be predominantly thermal.
2.07      Although Syria's indigenous resources of oil and natural gas are
rather limited and of poor quality due to high sulphur content, oil is ex-
pected to remain the main squrce of primary fuel. Annual oil production,
presently about 6 miUion in (37.7 million barrels) is expected to be doubled
by 1976.  Reserves amount to about 1,200 million ml of which about one quarter
would be econemically recoverable with present techniques. Tnferred reserves
may be about equal to the proven reserves. No natural gas field of any size
has been discovered, but potential gas reserves associated with oil production
may amount to 32,000 million m3. This gas is presently flared, but in future
part of it will be used for firing gas turbines in this development area in
the eastern part of the country, which is too remotely located for the con-
struction., in the foreseeable future, of an economically viable gas pipeline
to the industrial centers in the west.
2.08      The national oil company owns and operates two pipelines. The first
(constructed and owned previously by the former Iraq Petroleum Company), orig-
inating in the Mosul area, transports Iraqi oil through Hems to the Banias
terminal on the Syrian coast and to Tripoli in Lebanon. The second, also
passing through Hems, connects the Syrian oil fields in the north-east tip of
the coimtry (near Souedie) with the sea terminal at Tartous (about 40 km south
of Banias). Syria has one refinery, located at Hems, where loeal oil is blended
with Iraq oil, which has a lower sulphur content, and processed. This refinery,
vhich was severely damaged during the recent war, is expected to reach full
production again before the end of 1974. About two-thirds of the crude oil
produced in Syria is exported, A second refinery, either at Banias or at
Tartous, is under consideration to increase Syria's self-sufficiency in oil
products, particularly diesel fuel which, to a major extent, is imported at
relatively high cost.

2.09      EFE, established in 1965, has exclusive rights under its fundamental
lam to generate, transmit and distribute power in the country.  In 1968, the
company completed a 230-kV system linking Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus and
in 1969 Thavra was connected to Aleppo. Also in 1969, three 30-W units were
added to the 2x15-MW thermal station commissioned in 1964 at Kattineh near
Homs. The 15-MW units were practically undamaged during the recent war and
returned to service before the end of 1973 at reduced capacity (due to lack
of transformer capacity).  The first 30-MW unit is expected to return to
service by the middle of this year, and the second about one year later. It

is doubtful whether it would be economically feasible to repair the third unit,
A 25-NW steam-electric station at Aleppo (constructed 1957-1963) is operating
satisfactorily but the 45-MW Hameh steam-electric station at Damascus has been
completely destroyed and repair does not appear econamically justified. Of the
total pre-war installed capacity of 190 NW in steam-electric plant, about 75 SW
may have to be written off.
2.10     Total pre-war capacity in the interconnected system including sone small
diesel and hydro plants, which were not damaged, and incTuding Lebanon supply
(25 MW) amounted to about 215 MW. Additionally a large number of diesel plants
aggregating about 60 MW were operated in isolated centerse BPF. operates about
480 km of 230-kV lines, 615 km of 66-kV lines, 1,850 km of 20-kV lines and
7,045 km of low-voltage distribution lines. Annex 1 gives available data on
power installations in Syria both at the end of 1972 and as forecast for 1975.
The rated distribution voltage throughout the country is 127/220 V three phase,
four wire, 50 Hz._
2.11     Public power supply has lagged behind the demand, particularly in
the industrial sector, and captive generating capacity -- particzllarly
for irrigation pumping -- has proliferated and is now more than double
EPE's installed capacity. In early 1973 the situation becaam critical and
the Government embarked on a crash program for generation, comprising eight
20-MW gas turbines, of which 4 were destined for installation in EPE's
system and which are presently being installed. Tb overcome as rapidly as
possible the serious boxrt term effects of the war on EPE's generating
capacity, various Arab States are financing, as a grant, ten 23-MW
units, which will be installed within the next few months. Thus, by mid
1974 gas turbine capacity available in EPE's interconnected system will
amount to 310 MW (350 MW including the refinery gas turbines at Hors) Which
exceeds the total pre-war installed capacity by some 80 (120) MW. Annex 9
provides inter alia detailed information on capacities available at the end
of 1972 and 1973, and expected capacities at the end of 1974.
2.12     Statistical data on the power sector, particularly EPE, are shown
in Annex 2, covering the period 1963-1972, which can be swumarized as follows
for the last 4 years.

Excluding Thawra's temporary construction requirements, the average growth
rate of sales for the period 1969-1972 has been about 15%. Development in
electrification has primarily been in industry, No historical data is avail-
able on the number and category breakdown of BPE consumers. In 1972 the total
number of consumers amounted to 494,000, including 15,300 industrial consumers.
2.13      Information on generation and sales for 1973 is not yet available,
but it is estimated that production amounted to about lDOO OWh and sales to
800 GWh (see Annex 9).
2.14      Even prior to the war, EMS had a shortfall of power; Lebanon
provided about 25 1W and 100 GWh through a 66-kV interconnection and succeeded
in increasing its supply to about 40 1w (the virtual capacity limit of the line)
during the crucial last months of 1973. The contract terminates in 1974 due to
lack of excess power in Lebanon.
Access to Electricity
2.15      Of the total population of 7.0 million, about 2.6 million (37%) live
in towns and villages supplied from SIP's interconnected system, about 1.1 mil-
lion (16%) in EBE's isolated systems, and 3 million (47%) at present have no
access to electricity, representing about 3,000 villages with 2,000 inhabitants
or less (2/3 of which constitute villages of 500 inhabitants or less). Assum-
ing about 5 persons per household, EPS's 0.5 million connections represent
roughly 2,5 million inhabitants, i.e. connection density in the areas having
access to electricity would be some 65%. Per capita consumption is low, about
150 kWh annually on the basis of the present estimates.

Future Develorments
2.16      In addition to the Bank Project (and the installation of gas turbines,
see 2.11), EF will construct about 1,100 km of 230-kV lines to strengthen and
expand the existing system; financed from a general development credit made
available to the contrzy by the USSR.
2.17      Since 1971 EZI has been Implenting an expansion program financed
by DDR (German Democratic Republic), to be cepleted substantially by 1975/76,
of 66-kV and lower voltage transmission facilities to interconnect scattered
towns and villages, thus reducing the uneconomic operation of small diesel
plant to a minimum Most of these facilities will be slpplied from the 230-kV
network as soon as the new substations are completed under the .Frojecto Never-
theless about 20 NW In new diesel plant, also financed by MDR, is scheduled to
be added to isolated systems up to 1975, after which sufficient relatively new
diesels will be available for those isolated systems too remote or small to be
economically connected to PE' s 230-kV system. By 1980, howevir, isolated
systems are not expected to exceed 20 MW in demand (2.5% of interconnected
demand) and 40 CNh in sales (1% of interconnected sales), compared,with 34 NW
(20%) and 79 LWh (WoC) in 1972.
2.18     EBP  intends to step up its rural electrification program by about
10% annually £rom the present US$2 million equivalent and by- 19?5 3E expects to
start a 10-year program to convert the present 127/220-1V distribution voltage
in the maJor cities to 220/380 V.
2.19      With the completion of Thawra, the Government intends to curb the
replacement and expanBion of captive plant located near EPE facilities and
captive plant would gradually close down in favor of more economic EF2 sup-
plies. By 1976/77 EPE will also aupply from its extended 230-kV systm moost
of tiLe existing loads of the national oil copszy and the oil company gener-
ation plant would constitute a general reserVe to be operated as directed by
SES in accordance with least-cost dispatching. It is likely that EPE wvil
take over most of the oil company plan;r which is expected to exceed a total
of 80 NW in gas turbines.
2.20      Although plans have not yet been completed, Syria and Lebanon intend
to further interconnect their systems by means of a 230-kV tie by 1976/77.
This tie would connect Lebanon to the Tartous substation included in the
Project.
2.21      After making due allowance for the necessary reserves, EFE would
have an excess capacity of about 150 NW in gas turbine plant until the end
of the decade. In view of its long history of capacity shortages, it appears
likely that EPE will retain this safety margin, the mare so because of the
length of its 230-kV system, and because most of the capacity will be
required in Damascus to meet full demand in times of forced total outages.

3. THE B0RRBWER
Historioal Background
3.01      The ttEtablissement Public de l'Electricite" was established in
1965 by Decree Law No. 8 to consolidate and take over full responsibility
for the entire electricity sector of Syria, most of which had been nation-
alized in 1951. This law gives EPE the power to authorize other organiza-
tions to generate electricity in appropriate circumstances. Prior to EPE's
establishment, the power sector was fragmented and comprised a number of
isolated systems (112 systems, 88 municipality operated, and 24 supplied by
private companies). Responsibility was divided between the Ministry of Pub-
lic Works and the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs. With the creation
of the Ministry of Petroleum, Electricity, and Mineral Resources (Ministry of
Petroleum) in 1966, EPE was placed under the authority of this Minister, who
also assumed the functions and responsibilities formerly vested in the Board
of Directors.
Management and Staff
3.02      EPE's day to day management is the responsibility of the Director
General assisted by a Management Cammittee, which meets weekly. This com-
mittee is under the chairmanship of the Director General and is made up of
the four departmental directors, one representative from the Ministry and
two elected members from the Workers Union. The Director General is appointed
by the Prime Minister and the other directors by the Minister of Petroleum.
All appointments are for an unspecified period, i.e. until a new appointment
is made by the Minister.
3.03      The present Director General (who is also the Production Director)
has been in office since April 1972. In 1972 EPE had 6,485 employees, giving
a ratio of 76 consumers per employee, This ratio is not unreasonable in view
of Syria's extended and scattered system.
EPE's Organization
3.04      The power sector organization is still substantially regional and
fragmented. This is because EFE has concentrated on the technical problems
of operating procedures and of integrating the numerous separate systems and
plants into one system, particularly the construction of the first stage of
the 230-kV network.
Organizational Studies
3.05      In order to improve EPE's organization, including administration,
accounting and planning and to achieve an economical and reliable service,
a combination of interrelated actions is required for institutional reforms
and funds have been included in the proposed loan for this purpose. EPE has
agreed to engage management consultants by September 30, 1974 for a two-stage
reorganization study (see Annex 3 for broad outline of the terms of reference
for such a study). Related assistance would include the Project consultants
(see 4.10), the Damascus training center to be instituted (see 3,09), and the
study of EPE's tariffs (see 3.08),



-8-
Operations
3.06      Operation and maintenance of EPE's facilities require substantial
improvement which can only be achieved through a comprehensive training
program. This need is apparent, for instance, in EFE's largest power station,
at Kattineh near Homs, where plant availability of the three largest units
(completed in 1969) had not exceeded 3,000 hours annually. Outage time of
the 230-kV Homs/Aleppo line totalled about 500 hours in 1972 and of the Homs/
Damascus line about 700 hours. This problem was discussed with EPE during
negotiations (see 3.09).
Design and Construction
3.07      For the feasibility study, design and preparation of bid documents
of the Mehardeh Power Station and the substations EFE has engaged the services
of SOFRELEC of France. Much of EFE's past extensions have been financed
through the USSR and DDR credits and, as is customary with such credits,
contracts are signed which include a study for the particular facilities
to be financed. Detailed engineering of all 230-kV lines and 66-kV sub-
stations (including those forming part of the 230-kV stations) is already
underway in the USSR and DDR. EPE intends to expand its planning staff
(presently about 20 people), and improve their training, in connection with
the implementation of the Project.
Electric Power Tariffs
3.08      The average of EPE's tariffs (see Annex 4) is adequate to provide
a reasonable rate of return (see 6.20) once conditions return to normal and
high cost gas turbine generation is reduced to a minor proportion of total
generation. In the interim, two or three more-than-average "wet" years would
cause marked differences in this respect due to increased hydro generation.
However, EFE's tariffs still reflect those inherited from the original companies
presently combined into EFE and they differ widely from one area to another.
They generally comprise flat kWh rates for domestic and general lighting-
connections, block kWh rates for smaller industrial and commercial consumers,
and time of the day kWh rates (whenever metering available) for the larger
industrial connections. EPE wishes to unify and modernize its tariff structure
and funds have been included in the proposed loan for the engagement by not
later than September 30, 197h, of a consulting firm or expert in this field
to study EPE's tariffs under conditions and terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank (see Annex 4 for a broad outline of the terms of reference for
the study).
Training
3.09      Consultants would be employed under the proposed loan to examine
and advise EPE on its organization and accounting and to provide substantial
"on the job" and other appropriate training for the major changes necessary



- 9 -
to improve EPE's management efficiency. EPE has recently received from
Electricite de France (Direction des Affair Exterieures et de la Cooperation)
a comprehensive progrsm and cost estimate for the creation of a training school.
The objective of the school is to train and to provide annually about 64 higher
technicians, including 16 for steam-electric plant. The details, schedule of
completion of the school, which will be constructed at Damascus, and final
agreement with EdF for assistance, are still under discussion, but it is
E'Eas stated intention to set up a training school, substantially in agree-
ment with the recommendations. For this reason the estimated cost of about £S4.5
millimn has been included in EFE's investment program, and its gradually in-
creasing running cost (reaching about £Sl million by the end of the decade)
have been included in EFE's operational cost forecasts. The extent of poss-
ible bilateral assistance is not known, but an amount of US$250,00 has been
included in the proposed loan to meet the cost of the training center, par-
ticularly for steam-electric and gas turbine-electric training, which have
the highest priorities. It is expected that training under the program will
be initiated in early 1975, because adequate technical training of staff is
crucial to the satisfactory operation of the Mehardeh and Kattineh power
stations.
3.10      For the initial operation of the Mehardeh station, EPE will engage 4-5
executives through its consultants, who will carry full responsibility for the
operation of the station for two years.  The cost of this up to the closing
date of the proposed loan would be financed from the loan. The executives
will be assisted by a number of chief operators who will be engaged, under
a separate contract, through the contractor or contractors constructing the
Pehardeh power station. This would assure continued training of EPE staff
responsible for operating the station, which would be of the reheat type.
4. THE PROJECT
Description of Project
4.01      The Project is described in detail in Annex 5.  It consists of:
(a) the first 125-MW stage of a steam electric power station;
(b) the construction of 4 new 230-kV substations and expansion
of 4 existing substations; and
(c) consultants services and training.
An important objective of the Project is to achieve an improved organization,
including administration, accounting and planning, to assure economical and
reliable service.
4.02      The generating station is to be constructed near the M1hardeh
reservoir on the Orontes river. The selection of this site was based on
the availability of sufficient water in the reservoir and an abundance of
subterranean sources; rocky substrata; and a minimum interference with



- 10 -
existing irrigation and cultivated areas. The new substations are to be
located at  Pama, Tartous, Raqqa, and Meskene. The existing substations
of Aleppo, Haos (power station Kettineh), and Damascus (Kaboun II and Midan
II) will be extended.
Construction Program 1972-1979
4.03      The Project represents about 14% of EPE's total expected 1973-1979
investment program (see Annex 12) anoiting to about US $460 million, which would
comprise additionally:
-    some 1,300 km of 230-kV lines and four 230/66-kV substations,
and further expansion in 66-kV and other subtransmission
facilities;
-   a second 125-lw unit at Mehardeh to be campleted by 1979;
-   the installation of four 20-l  gas turbines and additionally
the ten 23-lW gas turbines financed by a grant from Arab
States;
-   the addition to Thawra of two 100-lw units, one in 1975 and one
in 1976;
-    construction of a new headquarter office in Damascus to be com-
pleted by 1976/77;
-    construction of a dispatch center in the new headquarters; and
-    continuation of the normal expansion in distribution in the cities
and a stepped up rural distribution program, and initiation, by
1975, of a distribution voltage conversion program.
Environment
4.04     Although the best technical location of the power station would
probably be inthe GhabPlain near the village of Shezar with its surface
cooling water and flat terrain, this location has been avoided for environ-
mental reasons, which are: (a) the power station would be adjacent to an
historic site, the ancient ridge castle of Shezar; (b) the siting of the
power station in the beautiful plain would be aesthetically out of keeping;
and (c) the possibility of vapour and smog accumulating during atmospheric in-
version. By locating the power station in the hilly and less cultivated
region beyond the gorge of the Orontes, the impact on the environment has
been reduced to a minimum, although this location requires the siting of
the power station on a rather flat hill, which will be visible from the
town of Mehardeh, about 2 km south of the site. The wind is predominantly
in an easterly direction but a 125-m chimney would assure diffusion of
particulates. Nevertheless, sufficient space would be provided on the site
to install exhaust gas cleaning facilities if found to be necessary in the
future. Forced draft cooling water towers, with a low profile, would ensure
miniimun use of cooling water and avoid the heating of the Orontes waters.



- 11 -
Complementary Projects
4.05      About US$18.8 million has been allocated from a USSR general
development credit for the construction of 230-kV lines interconnecting
the substations to be financed from the proposed loan. A study, financed
from the credit, is underway for final design of these lines. EF envisages
the completion by 1978 of an overlying 230-kV grid, having a total length of
about 1,300 km, and it is expected that the USSR credit will cover the for-
eign exchange cost of about 1,100 km of these lines. A contract has already
been signed for 800 km of lines, which would connect Souedie and Hassakeh to
the Thawra substation, connect Thawra directly to Hama and double the lines
Hama-Homs and Hons-Damascus. A second contract is expected to be signed
soon for about 300 km of 230-kV lines. These lines would connect Mebardeh
to the substation at Hama (2 lines of 20 km each), the substation at Tartous
to the main system, Lebanon to the Tartous substation, and connect Latakia
and Banias also to the Tartous substation. The latter line would, however,
be operated at 66 kV until at least the end of the decade. All lines are
expected to be completed by 1977. Under the credit provided for the Euph-
rates dam scheme, a second line connecting Thawra to Aleppo is presently
under construction. Engineering standards for these lines and future lines
to be constructed, which are in accordance with those of the existing EIE
lines, are acceptable.
4.o6      Because the Mahardeh power station will become operational only in
1978, the timing of the signing of the second transmission contract is not
presently critical.    EFE has agreed to sign this contract not later than
July 1, 1975, ensuring completion by January 1, 1977.
4h07      The 300-MW Thawra hydro plant is expected to start operating by
about the middle of 1974 at a reduced head. The Government has decided
to transfer to EPE the ownership and management of each of the generating
units and transmission lines to Aleppo not later than 3 months after the
expiry of the supplier's guarantee period for each of these generating units
and transmission lines, with the exception of the existing Thawra-Aleppo
line, the ownership of which is to be transferred together with the first
generating unit. The Government also will cause EPE to assume, not later
than the date of transfer of the ownership of the third Thawra unit, such
reasonable share of the cost of the Euphrates dam as shall be agreed with
the Bank (see 6.17).
Estimated Cost
4eO8      The estimated cost of the project, excluding interest during
construction, is US$62.6 million, of which US$43 million would be in foreign
exchange, based on the approximate effective parity rate at the time of the
updating of the appraisal of £SlUS$0.26. Annex 6 shows the estimated cost
of the project which is summarized in the following table:

Basis for Estimates
4.09        The above cost is based on the consultants revised estimates
as of December 1973. Physical contingencies of 15% on direct local cost and
7% on direct foreign exchange cost have been added. To allow for future
price rises, contingencies have been added in accordance with the note to
the above table. In view of the relatively stable local cost for labor
and materials, only 10% has been included for local price rises, The con-
tracts for Nehardsh will allow escalation up to a ceiling of 10%; the con-
tracts for the substations will be for firm prices. (n the basis of these
estimates, the Mehardeh power station would cost about US$340 per kW, This
appears high, but taking into account (a) cooling towers will be used and a
20 km long oil pipe line is required; (b) construction will take place on an
as yet undeveloped site; (c) facilities comon to both the first and second
unit are included; and td) import duties are relatively high, the estimate
is considered realistic.

Status on Engineering and Construction
4.10       EPE will continue to employ consultants on conditions anO under
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank for final design, engineering
and supervision of the Project. The contract (or a separate contract, if
EPE so decides) would also provide for consultants to administer the
construction and initial operation of the Project (see 3.10).
Procurement and Disbursements
4.11      All contracts to be financed from the proposed loan (except for
consulting services) would be awarded on the basis of international compet-
itive bidding, consistent with the Bank/IDA Guidelines for Procurement, with
which the Kuwait Fund has concurred. The Government has not requested local
preference for bid comparison, since Syrian industry does not manufacture the
required equipment. Bid documents have been issued for major items of power
station equipment and suppliers additionally have been requested to quote for
an option for the supply within 16 months of contract signature of a second
similar 125-MW generating unit and of the four remaining 230-kV substations
(Souediq, Hassakeh, Detr-es-Zaor, and Kaboun I for Damascus) which are not
includea in tne Project.
4912      The Project would be jointly financed by the Bank and the Kuwait
Fund on the basis of a 25/18 proportion, and all requests for disbursements
together with supporting documents would be sent to both institutions, and
with each authorizing disbursement of its proportionate share. The proceeds
of the proposed loan would finance the CIF cost of imported equipment and
materials, the foreign exchange cost of construction and erection services,
the foreign exchange cost of consultant services and of training (including
equipment for this purpose), and a percentage, agreed upon, of civil work
equivalent to the estimated foreign exchange component of the contractse
The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed loan is shown in Annex 7.
4.13      Should the foreign exchange cost to complete the project be less
than estimated, any undisbursed amount of the proposed loan should be reallo-
cated to consultant services for the next stage of development or, if not re-
quired for that purpose, the undisbursed amount should be cancelled at the
clo3ing date. The Project is expected to be completed by mid-1978 and the
closing date would be June 30, 1979 to allow for final guarantee payments.
5. JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
5.01      At the time of the updating mission (February 1974) reinstitution
of power supply was still in its early stages, It is not likely that normal
levels of sales would be reached until some time after the installation of
the large gas turbine capacity has been completed. Based on experience in
Jordan in similar circumstances, for purposes of this report it has been
assumed that the level of sales and generation originally forecast during
appraisal will be regained in 1977. This assumption is considered conserva-
tive; a period of 2-2.5 years being more likely. For comparison of the
appraisal forecast and the present forecast see Attachment 3 to Annex 8.
In view of the expected return to the forecast level of sales, the general
considerations of Annex 8 with respect to long term growth are still valid.

Forecast Power Requirements
5.02 EPE's growth trend (least squares method) in sales since 1963 has
been high; 17.5% (13.7% excluding Thaura construction requirements, see
Annex 2). Expansion lagged behind requirements, and the capacity of captive
plant increased accordingly. With the completion of the 300-MW Thawra bydro
plant (1974) and the installation of 310 M1  in gas turbine by the middle
of 1974, EIE is expected to overcome the effects of the war and to meet pent-
up demand rapidly. A continued high growth rate is expected for the next 5
years which, however, has been adjusted to reflect the short term effects in
forecasting EFE's sales, revenues and costs (including investments).
5.03      The consultants have made two approaches in forecasting power re-
quirements (see Annex 8). Firstly, correlations were investigated between
the use of power since 1963 and various combinations of population, GNP, and
other indexes. From these, four regressions were retained and compared with
various models for population growth, resulting in six models, which were ex-
trapolated up to 1990. The most likely growth rate for 1972-1980 in accord-
ance with the average forecast would be some 17-18%, about equal to the 10-
year trend since 1963. Secondly, to an assumed "background" growth of 10%
in the present system, they added (i) the estimated expansion of existing
industrial plant and construction of new plant in accordance with the nat-
ional plan; (ii) curtailment in installation of captive plant and gradual
taking over of captive plant supply by EPE as old plant is not replaced;
(iii) continued electrification of new villages and (iv) irrigation. De-
pending on assumptions on firmness of plans to install certain factories,
possible delay, initial and future requirements, this method results in 5
forecasts, ranging from "extremely high" to "extremely low", The average
of these forecasts shows a trend roughly equal to the historic trend and
the trend assessed under the first approach, i.e. about 17.5% for EFE as
a whole, and about 16.5% for the interconnected system alone. Forecasts of
future sales and required capacities are given in Annex 9, adjusted to re-
flect the assumptions made for the period 1973-1976.
Short-Term Growth
5.04      Considerable annual increases would, however, occur in 1976 and
1977 - when the growth rate would be respectively 50% and 38% - due to larger
blocks of existing load (mainly oil company load, factories, and irrigation
pumping) being connected to the EPE system. Annex 8, Attachment 2, provides
the forecast sales in the "original" interconnected systems and the regions
scheduled for interconnection. The growth trend for the forecast period in
the area served by the 230-kY system would be about 13% (about equal to the
1963-1972 trend, excluding Thawra construction requirements, of 13.7%; see
Annex 2), with an annual maximum of 23% in 1975.
5.05      The growth rates in the original interconnected system are quite
normal but the large block of industrial power to be connected creates a
very high short-term growth rate. For this reason, during appraisal care-
ful evaluation of the new loads was made and it was calculated that certain

To test the sensitivity of the selected program to changes in load growth
rates, the comparison between Alternatives  and }A was repeated but a more
gradual growth was assumed.  This reduced growth rate (Aniex 8, Attachments
3 and 4) assumes a further reduction in 1979 generation from 1400 GWh to
1300 CWh; essentially an extension of the historic trend. The reduc-
tion assumes that mst of the large blocks of power to be connected to ElE
would not materialize early in the period. The probability of this reduced
developzent is small. For convenience, the alternative programs under this
condition were designated Alteratives 3 and 3A.  .Alternative 2, studied
in che ealier a~ppraisal, investigated the econaicj t:nŽ:;:. for interconnection
of the system. Subsequent events, including the addition of the gas turbine
capacity, render this study unneoessary).
5.08      The residual gas turbine capacity allows po'stponement of construction
of additional plant by one or more years.  Ehis effect; is independent of the
size of plant to 'o9 ins-Lalled. System effects are sma:Ll and car be neglected
because, for capacity reasons, Mhardeh cannot be postponed by mome than one
year.  It is themefore appropriate first to lecide on the unit size and then
to study the ef'fect of the gas turbine capacity.
5.09      Alternative 1 (125-M  unit size at Mehareh) has been compared with
Alternative 1A (63-Md unit size). The equalizing discount rate up to which
Alternative 1 would be more than economic is aboat 18%, indicating that 125-Bd
units, rather than 63-M  units, should be installed in lAehardeh, There is a
sizable (about £620 million) difference in present value at t-he opportunity
cost of capital (assumed to range from 10-12%), arLd a 10wer investmert (1974
1984) of £S55 million.  An analysis shows this conclu,;ion to be insensitive
to variations in capital cost, thereby sustaining the conclusion.
5010      By assuming a lo-wer growth rate (see 5.07 above), tle f:irst 1Mhardeh
unit (either 63 YW or 125 V. Alternatives 3 ard 3A) could be postponed by
about 2 years. The equalizing discount rate up to whJich 125-V  tsnit would
be more economic is about I5-5%. Although a-, the opportunity cast of capital.
the difference fn oresent value is quite small (S2*. million.  due i. prt to
the postponement) ,,he sensitivity ana].ysis shows that the decs:ion vo use 125-Pi
units is insensitive to variations in cost,
5.11      A one Year delay in completing Mehardeh would require about 700 GWh
(125 MW at an ass-mwed plant factor of 65%) to be generated by gas turbines at
an additional cost; to EPE of about bS6.3 million for f'uel. The present
financiai cost of residua' oil to EPE is about US$2-2-30 per barrel, w.ich
does not reflect -,ne cost to the econo.iy. Because at thi s time no reliable
estimate can be mace wit.h _esoect to the economic costi of £uel. it was deemed
appropria te to calculate trle present worth of a one-year delay in Mehardeh,
and to de.ermine the break-even cos u of fuel . Zi'e present wortuh of' the delay
was calculatec aRS iS11- .mil ;lion, im.plying a break-even f'uel cost of about
$6.30/bblv  T'L.s Is considered to be below -he economic cost, and therefore
Nehardeh should 3e conb-z.- UCted now.

Rate of Return of Pmject
5.12      The rate of return of the Pr,jept is the discount rate which
equalizes the costs a4d benefits attributablv to the Project over its
economic life, which has been talen at 25 years.  Revenues from additional
output have been used as aa approximation of these benefits.  These revenues
understate the benefits consumers receive from the Project, because it is
considered that a tariff increase of reasonable magnitude (say 10-20%) would
not reduce demand significantly. The willingness of consumers to pay more
is also illustrated by the lact that a large capacity in more costly captive
plant has been ijistalled (and would be installed were the Project not ex-
ecuted) to meet the electricity needs.
5.13      If a reasonable portion o; the transmisaion facilities is attributed
to M$hardeh (onmmnsurate with the 125-MW capacity to be financed from the
loan, see Annex 8, Sect.on E) together with a 2-year (1977/78) expansion of
the dist7ibutioA program., the rate of return of the Project is about 17%.
If all cpsts have Deep underestimated by about 10$ (conversely that benefits
have been overestimated by 10%), the rate of return would reduce to about
15 %. On the other hand, assuming that facilities attributable to Mehardeh
have been overestimated by about 20%, the rate of return would increase to
about 18g.  Jr view of the above, the most likely range for Rate of Return
of the Projeect is 15-18%.  The economic return Calc;lation was made using
May 1973 prices. If oil prices are in1r&aOe to some $/bbl (which may
approximate econolic levels) pnd tari{fs are increased commensurately (about
20%), the results vould be 4nchange4 and are considered to be valid.

6. FINNCIAL ASPECTS
Fina-zial Responsibility of EPE
6.00      Although ant autonus goverTmeit enity, BE  has not made the
accounting progress nor reaped the benefits of the financial disipline
inherent in the exreise of financial responsibility. The respective
Ministries of Finance and of Petroleum, Electricity and Mineral Resources
have taken all major decisions on recmendations made by EPS for its ex-
pansiom needs and,  oe included in the official dewelopment planX the
"Caisse de la Dette Pblic" (CDP) has arranged external financing for EPE's
projects and has assumed responsibility for any resulting debt serwice.
CDP also is required to provide any additicnal local funds as may be necess-
ary for the projects.
6002      F oreign long-tem  debts are only shown separately in EFE's balace
sheets if the lerider requires the issuance of promissory notes.  In al other
cases the debts form parto f the o=nibus "CDP Current,Account" which also in-
cludes all current transactions. When the central bank pays against a promis-
sory note on its due date, CDP debits SPEts current account, and CDP also has
the general right yo withdraw funds from EPE's bank account without prior
reference to EIP whenever such funds are considered to be in excess of E1F's
needs. These funds may be used by CDP for any sector of the economy. Such
withdravals have so far been limited to relatively minor amounts. However,
only with prior knowledge of uithdrawals and evaluation of the effects of
such withdrawals can EPE accept full financial and accounting responsibil-
ities. During negotiations the Government agreed that EFE would be permitted
to retain adequate funds for its expansion, operation, and debt service re-
quirements. Funcds are included in the proposed loan for the employment of
consultants to advise SiE on how to improve and modernize its accounting
methods and organization (see 3.05),
Accounting Sysisem
6.03      EFE's accounting system requires major reorganiZation, partly be-
cause of its reliance on the Ministry of Finance (CDM) for all non-routine
financial operations, but also beca-ise the accounting organization is frag-
mented and records are keT i:n a nvuber of centers (Danascus, Hons, Aleppo,
Deir-es-Zor, Latak.a etc.), whose procedures arn accounting principles are
not always consistent &nd whose level of e3pertise varies widely. Annually
the infor=ratica erem all these centers is sent to Head Office in Damascus,
wnaee it is co:n-olidated Into E2E's accounts. The resulting accounts are
tardy and not puYlished, although they are sent to the Ministry of Finance,
SEE has agreed to send audited accounts to the Bank within four manths of
the end of the year in question.
604      Although the routine operations such as billing, stores accounting
etc, seem to be effective, the level of the overall gerneral accounting and



- 19 -
consolidated accounts is less satisfactor7.  Head office staff are ulable to
obtain from the records provided to them the additional explanatiom  or further
details of accomts or statistics that are needed. The consolidated accounts
are therecre not necessarily complete or comparable frm- year to year and in-
deed major assets and the corresponding debt or investment are excluded entirely
from the 1972 aecounts (see 6.08).
Audit
60co,     The    istry of Finance is responsible for auditing  L5:''s accounts,
but in fact no e:ternal annual audit is routinely carried out and the last
auditt 4aken ias in 1969 when Ministry of Finance officials audited the ac-
counts fer 719lU)53 1966 and 1967 and 1268 in one operation.  Accounts for 1969
through 1272 (the latest available accoLmts year) are unaudited. EPE has
agreed to have its accounts for each fiscal year audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Isurance
6o06      LP  M s.tres its major assets against the usual hazards (fire,
explosion, third party etc.) through The Syrian Insurance Company, the sole
Goverument isurarce agency, which in turn reinsures through the western
reinsurance marke"-t. EIE agreed to maintain such insurance coverage with
responsible insurers and against such risk as is consistent with appropriate
practice.
Taxes, Duties., Interest on Loans, etc.
6o07      EFE is liable for all corporate taxe,e (about 52u0 of taxable
profit after various adjustments for investment etc.), customs duties
(varying fr^om about 614 to 27%) and social security for employees (1I% of
total salaries and wages). Government development loans (see 6.25) are
made to ME Efree of interest" in accordance with Decree 3875 of December
153 1968 so no interest has been included in ER 's historical accounts
except as part Or the constraction cost in the case of foreign loans.
Historical Balance Sheets
6.o8      XMIs historical Balance Sheets for 1968 through 1972 are shown
in .Annex 10 even though they are not entirely comparable from year to
year because consistent accounting principles have not always been applied.
Up to 1972 the consolidated balance sheets do not include in the assets the
8-W Rastan hydroelectric generating station nor the supply-area of Latakia's
generating and distribution facilities, with a net value of perhaps some
LS 10-12 mlion.  However, the sales and expenditures have been included
in the income statements from 1971. Latakia is "self accounting", but the
available expertioe -is limited and no annual accounts have been prepared
althov.gh biJlling is carried out and records are kept of debtors and expanseso



- 20 -
E1: has agreed that the Latakia system will be incorporated into EI:'s
assets at a reasonable value acceptable to the Bank, with effect frm
January 1, 1975. The omission from the assets of Rastan, which belongs
to the Ministry of Agriculture, is relatively uiimporbant, since it gen-
erates very little energy (about 20 GWh In 1972) and the main use of the
water is for irrigation.
6.09      The recorded gross fixed assets for the 5 main cities are stated
to be valued at their 1968 book values, the year when these systems were
incorporated into EIE. The other smialler systems were incorporated at
their appraised value at the date of acquisition, New assets (financed
mainly from USSR or DDR credits) have been added at cost but include all
interest for the whole life of any loan or credit used to finance the assets.
EPE has agreed that future interest or other charges on debt will be charged
against revenue of the year concerned, except for interest during construc-
tion borrowed and incurred prior to cwmisioning of the asset, which ra
be charged to capital.
6.10      Despite the excessive interest charges, the overaUl average gross
asset value for the whole system (excluding Rastan and Latakai) is the
equivalent of only about TS$320/kW installed. This is presumably mainly
because of low USSR and DDR prices during the period of EEE's initial
expansion.
6.11      The effect of the initial low gross asset value on future average
net fixed assets in operation will be minimal; 30% of the gross fixed asset
value had been depreciated by 1972 and EIEVs growth is forecast to be so
rapid that by the end of 1979, its gross fixed assets in operation vould be
about six times the 1972 figure (see 6.27).
6.12      Monthly electricity billing to the general consumer in the inter-
connected system is prompt and cut off procedures are rapid, so that aat-
standing receivables for 1972 were the equivalent of orny 10 days average
sales, By contrast the isolated systems and government, which includes
much of industry, show outstanding receivables of about 220 dAys and 250
days respectively. The above figwres are, however, aggravated bacause df
a dispute between ETE and the Beledi.yes (1mnicipaLities) of various villages
and small towns in the isolated system over the valuation of and non-pap?ent
by EF5 for the purchase of their local electricity systems The 'Minister
for Belediyes" had instructed all Belediyes (whether in diapute with EPE or
not) to withhold payment of their municipal electricity bills for street
lighting or workse Since 1968, therefore, municipal bills have not bsee
paid and by December 31, 1972 some £S14 million was due to EPE as against
EPE's dispute purchase price of about £S700 million,  in May 1973 an agree-
ment was reached with the Minister, under which the Belediyes would pay
their entire 1973 budget allocation for electricity imuediately (some
£S2.5 million), They would also include realistic estimates of electricity
expenditures in their requests for the 1974 budget allocation. This agree-
ment, and the intention that from 1974, electricity bils would be paid

incoine 'has been increasing steadily from 1968 to 1972 with its rate of
r2turn rising froma 4.c0% to 8.4%. EPE's average sales price per kwh sold
has fallen from 14.4ps/kwh (USO 3.7) in 1968 -o 92,0 ps/kTh TUS¢ 3.1 ) in
1972.  Thz 1972 rate of return of 8.4% has been calculated after excluding
the operating surplus of Latakia (!SO.5 million) since the Latakia assets
am, -ot includad in the EPE accounts (see 6.00). Eotablisbments for
religious worshp receive free electricity by law, and the sales price of
electricity 7 rovided to mosques and churches has been shown as an operating
expenso., since th: equivalent amounts are included under sales.
6.16      No interest on long-term debt is included in EPE's historical

see 2.03 - an allocation of about 10% of the estimated dam
cost appears reasonable) ----------------------------------------    35
Total cost (equivalent to about US$166 per kW) ------ ---------   220
During negotiations the Government confirmed that the above assets would be
taken over by EPE once construction had been completed so the above estimated
value has been included in EPE!s forecast balance sheet in 1976. Operation
costs have been included from 1975. The financing of the assets will be in
the form of a Government capital contribution (see 6.26).
Forecast Operating Results
6.18     EPE's forecast operating results (Annex 11) are likely to be
satisfactory once the short term effect of the war has been overcome. Annex
13 shows the major assumptions made in both balance sheet and operating state-
ment forecasts. The costs of operating the training school (see 3.09) have
been included progressively from 1975.
Rate Covenants
6.19     EPE's minimum tariffs are regulated by Law 8 Section 28 (see
Annex 4) requiring tariffs to cover in addition to operational cost, a reserve
for construction of 3% of gross revenue, and a return of 4% on invested capital
(i.e. government contributions, CDP account, reserves and undistributed zu_lu&i.
These requirements, however, can be diluted or waived by the Cabinet undez
Section 30. EPE's tariffs have in fact met the requirements of Section 238 &-i
are expected to exceed the minimum requirements by an increasing margin aitas  %974.
However, should tariffs be reduced to the minimum level required by Sec-tion 28,
EPE's cash generation would be greatly reduced by 1978 (the comiplation of h.e-.ot),
-wereby further increasing EPE's initial requirements for substaxntial    iati
U;vernment funds (see 6.26).  The Govexmment and EPE have agreed to xaint:aJn `41e-r-
all alectricity tariff leve4.s at not Less than their 1973 levels threug  th_)
year 1977.
6.20     E?E's forecast operating results (Annex 11) are based en. e:zLsting
tariffs, with the overall average sales price expected to reduce froir, the
12.0 ps/kWh (US03.i) ±n 1972 to 10.2 psAfth (US02.6) by 1976 aue to the s.eep
increase in sales to industry resulting from interconnection.  The ",net fixed
assets in operationn" includes the 1S220 million for initial Thawra install  ti-5ii



- 23 -
as from 1976 (see 6.17), but the missing Rastan and Latakia assets (see
6.08) have not been included because of their still unknown values which,
however, will be relatively small so that the rate of return will be
virtually unaffected.
6.21      EPE's forecast operating results for 1973 through 1975 are
expected to be severely affected by the 1973 war, which resulted in damage
to its major steam generating station at Kattineh (as well as to its
smaller Hameh station) with the resulting requirement to restrict supplies
severely from November 1972 until the lost generating capacity can be
restored. This is expected to be achieved in 1974 by the installation of
gas turbines, but the operating costs for 1974/1975 (when the more expensive
gas turbine fuel will be used) will be more than three times that of the
equivalent steam generation. After 1975 when the reliability of the gas
turbines will be less important, they are expected to operate on cheaper
residual oil, but even then their fuel cost will still be 50% higher than
the steam generation equivalent. The reduced sales volume coupled with the
higher operating cost are expected to result in net operating losses for
1973 and 1974. A positive rate of return can not be foreseen until 1975,
when it is expected to reach about 5.0%. Thereafter the rate of return
should improve and reach 9.4% for 1978 and 1979 without any increase in
tariffs above the present level.
6.22      The Government and EPE have agreed that, unless the 13ank should
otherwise agree, in the year 1978 and thereafter EPE's tariffs should be
maintained at levels high enough to provide a rate of return of not less
than 9% on its average net fixed assets in operation after transferring
to EPE realistically valued Thawra generating assets.  ibr the purpose of
this rate covenant, however, the Thawra assets would be included from the
year in which Thawra first supplied 1,000 Gl4h or more for the EPE system
(expected to occur in 1976).
6.23      The effects of the war on EPE's sales growth are uncertain, and
the forecasts have taken the conservative view that full recovery to the
prewar forecast sales will not be achieved until 1977. At the presently
forecast conservative estimate for availability of Thawra power in 1976
and 1977 (1,200 G.ki and 1,600 GlWh respectively) EPE will still have to
generate substantial amounts of base load by gas turbines, and the rates
of return forecast for 1976 and 1977 are still only expected to reach 6.2%
and 7.4% respectively. It should be observed however that EPE's asset base
is expected to include an excess generating capacity of 180 MW in 1976
(see Annex 9) due to the emergency installation in 1974 of the additional
ten gas turbines to counteract the war damage. This increases EPE's asset
base by some E135 million.

6.25      Although EPE is only expecting to be able to finance 20% of its 1973
through 1979 construction program from its internal resources after debt
service, EPE is not being requested to increase its existing tariff level at
this time in view of the extreme bunching of its investment program (partly due
to the war) and because, at present tariff levels, it would appear that EPE
would be able to meet the rate of return covenant (see 6.21) and to generate
ample funds for its re6uirements from 1978.
6.26      EPE's 1973-1979 financing plan (one year after the construction
period of the Project) relies heavily on government cash support (some
LS 250 million in 1974-1976) to help finance its abnormally bunched
expansion and reconstruction program, of which the Project is only 14%.
The Government capital contributions include Thawra, 10 gas turbines, the
training school and the construction of transmission lines financed under
the U.S.S.R. credit to Syria as well as "liquidity" cash grants to EPE as
necessary to enable EPE to finance its local currency construction, opera-
ting costs and debt service. The Government has agreed to provide EPE with
such liquidity contributions as may be necessary to permit EPE to retain
funds sufficient to provide reasonable working capital to meet its needs
for operating expenses, investment program and debt service. Glovernment
capital contributions are without interest, but are termed "development
loans" under Syrian law since they are considered to be repayable if surplus
funds are available for this purpose. EPE's financing plan includes
1,S 120 million in such repayments in 1977/1979, but since the bulk of the
contributions are unlikely ever to be repaid in view of EPE's continuing need
for expansion, the Government's capital contributions have been included as
grants in the balance sheet and for the purposes of the debt service covenant
(see 6.29). Annex 15 page 1 gives details of the government capital contributions.
Forecast Balance Sheets
6.27      A major feature of EPE's forecast balance sheets 1973 through 1979
(see Annex 10) is the rapid growth in its gross fixed assets in operation,
which are now expected to reach over iS 2.1 billion by the end of 1979
as against the 1972 figure of iS 345 million.  Annex 14 shows the expected
gross fixed assets as at December 31, 1979 including work in progress
which comprises IS 75 million for a third unit at Ybhardeh.
6.28      EPE's equity is similarly expected to increase considerably
to over iS 1.4 billion by 1979 from LS 330 million in 1972, partly because
of the net Government construction contributions (LS 645 million) but also
because of iS 390 million in accrued surpluses retained in reserves by EPE.
6.29      EPE's long-term debt (Annex 15 page 2) is shown as including the
DDR debt for subtransmission construction, since the DDR issues promissory
notes for -which EPE is responsible to the extent that it has available funds.
EPE's debt:equity ratio through 1979 is shown, but is not truly significant
since, apart from the Bank and other similar direct loans to EPE, the
extent to which long-term financing is passed on by the CDP to EPE in the
form of loan or capital contribution (see 6.26), will depend on the
Government's decision at the time. The Government has agreed that all
such financing shall be in the form of equity, grant or loan and to
notify EPE-of the nature and terms of all such financing to be provided to
it by the Government. EPE agreed not to incur future long-term debt unless



- 26 -
its debt service for any succeeding year was covered at least 1.5 times
by its net cash generation.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      EPE has agreed:
(a) to engage consultants acceptable to the Bank by not later
than September 30, 1974, (i) to review EPE's organization,
accounts and procedures, (see 3.05), and (ii) to study and
advise on EPE's tariffs structure (see 3.08), and to discuss
with the Bank the action it proposes to take as a result of
these studies;
(b)  to sign a contract not later than July 1, 1975, for the
construction of 230-kV lines interconnecting Hehardeh with
the system by not later than January 1, 1977 (see 4.06);
(c) to continue to employ consultants acceptable to the Bank for
the further engineering design and supervision of the execution
of the Project including its administration (see 4.10);
(d) to have its annual accounts audited and certified by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank (see 6.05);
(e) to include in its 1975 assets a realistic value for the
electricity system of Latakia (see 6.08);
(f) to maintain adequate records of its operation and financial
condition, in particular in terms of a supplemental letter
referring to Section 5.01 of the draft Loan Agreement, EPE
has agreed to charge all future interest or other charges on
debt against its revenue of the year concerned, except that
such charges on amounts borrowed for the construction of assets
may be charged to capital if incurred prior to the date of com-
mission or coming into operation of such assets (see 6.09);
(g) to maintain its overaU average electricity tariff at least
at its 1973 levels through tte year 1977 (see 6.19);
(h) that, in 1978 and thereafter, electricity tariffs would be
maintained at levels high enough to provide a rate of return of
9% on its average net fixed assets in operation including a real-
istic value for the Thawra generating assets transferred to EPE
froui the year in which Thawra first supplies 1,000 GWh or more
for the EPE system (see. 6.22); and
(i) that EPE shall not incur any further long term debt unless
its internal cash generation, after depreciation and taxes,
but before interest, for the fiscal year before the debt is
to be incurred, shall be at least 1.5 times the maximum debt
service for any succeeding fiscal year on all debt including



- 27 -
the debt to be incurred (see 6.29).
7.02     The Government has agreed:
(a) to transfer to EPE the ownership and management of each of
the electricity generating units and transmission lines of
the Kuphrates Den not later than 3 months after the expiry
of the supplier's guarantee period for each of the said
generating units and transmission lines, with the exception
of the first Thaura-Aleppo transaission line the ownership
of which shall be transferred at the time of transfer of
the ownership of the first generating unit (see 4.07);
(b) to cause the EEE to assume not later than the date of the
transfer of the ownership of the third Thawra generating
unit, a reasonable share of the cost of the Euphrates Dam
as shall be agreed between the Government and the Bank
(see 4.07);
(c) that EPE would be permitted to retain adequate funds for
its expansion, operation, and debt service requirements
(see 6.02); and
(d) to the extent that EFE is unable to finance the local or
other costs of its authorized expansion program in addition
to its operations and debt service, the government will make
available such additional funds as are necessary (see 6.26).
7.03     During negotiations the Government and EPE have informed the Bank
that the question of the pre-1974 accounts outstanding between EFS and the
BeledJyes was under discussion, that a reasonable settlement was expected
shortly, and that in the future both mnicipal and government departments
and agencies would be instructed to include realistic amounts for electricity
in their requests for budget allocations so that future bills for electricity
would be paid promptly in accordance with the supply conditions (see 6.13).
7.04      In view of the above agreements and assurances and subject to the
signing of a loan agreement with the Kuwait Fund for a loan of the equiva-
lent in Kuwait Dinars of US$18 million, the Project provides a suitable
basis for a Bank loan to EPE of UE$25 million equivalent to be repaid over
25 years including a grace period of 4 years.

ANNEX 3
SYRIA
Etablissement Public de l'Electricite
Mehardeh Thermal Power Project
Outline of Terms of Reference for Organizational Study
The study shall be executed in 2 stages, the first a "diagnostic"
stage, the second the "implementation" stage.
Stage 1
(i) EPE's present organization, work methods and procedures shall
be studied with the specific purpose of defining the requirements for improve-
ments in the service to consumers, installing concise and modern utility ac-
counting and administrative methods, improvinig planning and design of facilities,
improving operational and maintenance services, and developing the organization
to achieve these objectives,
(ii) A report shall be prepared on the present conditions within EPE
and retcommendations for action to be taken to achieve the objectives within
a period of 2 years.
(iii) Detailed draft terms of reference for Stage 2 of the study
shall be prepared, based on the recommendations, for the implementation of the
recommendations.
(iv) EPE, in consultation with the Bank, will prepare final terms of
reference (including schedule of actions) for the reorganization and Stage 2
of the study.
Stage 2
EPE will institute any needed improvements in its structure and
methods with the assistance of its consultants, in accordance with the terms
of reference. The consultants shall study the details of the requirements
for changes in the organization, work methods and procedures, and prepare
comprehensive reports and/or guidelines for each specific item for which
work rules are essential. These are to serve as reference guidelines to be
used in actual operations. The consultants shall assist EPE in the implemen-
tation of the reorganization, providing on-the-job and other training to EPE
personnel, and if necessary provide staff for interim heading of a department
while the designated chief is being trained.

Mehardeh TherMal Power Project
Tariffs
1.        Although some efforts have been made to reach consistency in the
calculation and application of tariffs, the present tariffs still reflect
those inherited from the original companies presently forming EPE. They
are widely diverse in the various regions. Discounts have been imposed by
the Government for Government establishments, the army, some industries, and
places of worship have free electricity. The average level, however, appears
adequate to cover all costs, and to ensure a reasonable rate of return, once ths
financial after-effects of the war, and the backlog of construction needed to muet
demand and to restore adequate service quality, has been overcome.
2.        The basic requirements for tariffs are set forth in the 1965 law
No. 8 creating EPE. Under Section 28 EPE is required to charge rates to
cover at least:
(a) operational costs including depreciation;
(b)  a reserve for construction equal to 3% of its total
gross electricity sales and other income; and
(c) a return of 4% on its invested capital (i.e. Goverment
grants, CDP account, reserves and undistributed surplus).
Section 30 of the same law stipulates that EPE cannot waive the requirements
of Section 28 without approval of the Cabinet which, however, can instruct
EPE to waive requirements (b) and (c) above. If, however, EPE is instructed
to waive requirement (a) thereby causing a shortfall in meeting the relevant
cost, the Minister of Finance must arrange such shortfall to be met from
the Government budget.
3.        In 1967 Electricite de France (EdF) completed a tariff study for
EPE outlining the basic principles for calculating tariffs, which since then
have been applied for the setting of major industrial tariffs. Subsequently,
the Minister has issued draft regulations for the setting of tariffs, which,
however, have never been implemented. In the outlying systems these draft
regulations are generally applied, but in the interconnected system no changes
of substance have been made to follow those regulations, primarily because
they are not sufficiently detailed and flexible.
4.        Although there are many digressions from the norm, Attachment 1
to this Annex gives a general impression of the existing tariffs, which have
energy charges only. The general pattern of tariffs comprises:

-    Flat kWh rates for domestic and general lighting
connection
-    Block kWh rates for smaller (say less than 10 kW)
industrial and commercial connections in low tension
networks
-    Time of the day kWh rates for larger industrial and
commercial connection (L.T. and H.T.), whenever meters
are available.
5.        in the last three years revenue per kWh averaged as follows:

1972                  11.9       3.0
A preliminary consultant's estimate indicates that short-term marginal cost
of supply is in the order of 5-6 ps/kWh.l/ Because variable charges are in
the order of 2-2.5 ps/kWh, even the lowest rates (see Attachment) for large
industries appear to be on an acceptable level.
6.        From the above it follows that, although the general level of
tariffs appears appropriate, EPE's tariff structure is far from comprehensive.
Unification, and modernization by the introduction of special industrial and
the possible introduction of a socially oriented and special domestic tariff
for the poor with low consumption, together with concise calculation and
application of tariffs, appears appropriate.
7.        EPE, on behalf of the Government, charges its customers for the
following taxes, which are paid together with the bills:
(a) 10% of bill, for the army;
(b) Tax stamps, graded in accordance with total bill amount;
(c)  0.5 piaster/kWh, for school construction;
(d) 10 piaster/bill, for rural development;
(e)  10% of bill, for municipalities (with exceptions, for
instance Aleppo, and the center of Damascus); and
(f) 1 piaster/kWh, for municipal services.
8.        Attachment 2 to this annex gives broad outlines for terms of
reference for a proposed tariff study.
1/  This does not take into account the effect of gas turbin  4opratioa due
to war damage, which may increase short term marginal coat by aom 2.3 pu/kiih.

Outline Terms of Reference for a Tariff Study
Stage 1
EPE will prepare a plan of action for the necessary measurements,
interviews of consumers, and gathering of statistical data, and shall engage
a consultant to visit EPE 1-2 months after the preparation of the plan of
action has begun, to review the plan and make recommendations for the final
plan. The consultant should also make a preliminary study of EPE's tariffs
and practices and prepare a report on his findings and the proposed plan
of action.
Stage 2
After a suitable period (say 6 months) the consultant shall visit
EPE again to review the results of the action taken during Stage 1, make
recommendations for any further action rnecessary and prepare a report
presenting his findings. His main task shall be to review existing tariffs
to determine whether they adequately reflect the structure of costs in the
present and planned EPE system and to make recommendations on the project
objectives for any changes in tariffs designed to align more closely the
rates charged with the costs of supply. He shall also assist in drafting
terms of reference for the next stage, which shall be a study by a tariff
expert to determine how the proposed changes in tariff structure should be
implemented in practice, and make recommendations regarding the detailed
schedule of rates to be adopted.
Stage 3
The tariff expert would assist EPE in implementing the proposed
changes in tariffs.

Yehardeh Thermal Power Project
Project-Description
1.        The Project comprises a 125 MW Steam-Electric Power Station at the
1ehardh reservoir on the Orontes, about 20 km north of Hama, eight 230-kV
substations, located at Tartous, Aleppo, Hama, Homs, Damascus (two: Kaboun II
and Midan II), Raqqa and Maskene, and consulting services.
Mbhardeh Power Station
2.        The proposed new thermal power  station will be constructed a few
kilometers north of the town of Mbhardeh near the flood control reservoir
(about 60 million m3 storage capacity) of the same name, at an eleva-
tion of about 270 m, 70 m above the Orontes river and the Ghab plain.
The station was originally planned to be constructed at Banias on the coast,
but after the October 1973 war, the Government has decided to relocate the
station inland. The site was chosen because of: (a) the availability of
sufficient water for cooling purposes in the M1hardoh reservoir and abundant
subterranean sources to meet requirements even in extremely dry years, (b) its
location (on a relatively flat plateau) interteres least with the irrigated
and cultivated area in the neighborhood since the site is rocky and not used
for agricultural purposes, and (c) the amount of rock to be removed is minimal.
Although the capacity of the power station is to be 125 MW initially (with an
option on a second unit ol 125 KW to be completed 12-16 monthB later), the
ultimate size of the power station is only limited by the availability of
water. Development up to 500 MW appears possible depending on the availability
of subterranean water sources. The extent of these sources is still to be
investigated, but they are expected to be high.
3.        The generating unit will consist of a semi-outdoor reheat type 125 MW
boiler/turbo alternator set, together with all ancillary equipment, including
those common to the second unit.  The boiler, which will operate at 130/125 bar
abs. (1885/1815 psi) and 545/5450C (10050F), will be designed to burn residual
oil. The fuel will be transported by railway tankers to Hama from the refinery
at Homs.  Between Hama and 1ehardeh a 21 km 150 m  oil pipeline will be constructed,
with railway reception facilities at the dispatching end. Stocking capacity at
Mehardeh will be subterranean, two tanks of 1o,o0o m3 each for the first unit
providing it least 30 days requirements. For starting-up and banking purposes
two 1500-mr tanks will be provided for light industrial oil. Te firing aisle
will be incorporated in the building housing the turbogenerator and auxiliary

equipment. The solid state controlled hydrogen cooled generator will rate
about 150 MVA at a power factor 0.80, and operate at 3000 rpm, 50 Hz, 3 phase
The generator will be connected to a 160-WVi outdoor transformer for step-up
to 230 kV (for the generating voltage the manufacturers approved standard
will be accepted) in unit connection.
4.        For standby purposes, the house service supply (5.5 kV/220/380 V)
will be connected to the second 66-kV line presently under construction between
Hama and I*hardeh and the existing Shezar hydro station nearby (operation of
which normally depends on irrigation requirements). Additionally a standby
diesel plant will be provided. Water for boiler and drinking purposes will be
taken from wells to be constructed and treatment plants will be provided for
both purposes. Except for office space, etc. required for operating the plant,
all other auxiliary service rooms and buildings will be separate from the main
building. A total of about 50 housing units will be provided for senior staff.
Some personnel are expected to obtain housing in the nearby town of I*hardeh
(15,000 inhabitants).
5.        The cooling system will be of the wet type, using forced air cooling
towers, requiring about 0.3 m3/s at full load per 125 MW unit (annual water use
per unit about 5 million m3). The cooling water intake will be at two levels
in the reservoir (and, once wells have been sunk, at the appropriate ground
water level) to allow for minimum cost wet and dry season operation, near the
M1hardeh dam. Two pumps will be provided at each level. Maximum pumping head is
about 60 m.
6.        No means of cleaning exhaust gases would be installed because the wind
is predominantly to the east. A chimney 125 m high will be constructed which
ensures that exhaust gases escape about 200 m above the surrounding cultivated
areas. Sufficient space will be left between boiler and chimney to allow future
installation of exhaust gas facilities, should they be required.
230 kV lines and Substations
7.        Each of the units will be connected to the substation Hama (a distance
of about 20 km) by means of a 230 kV line, i.e. the unit connection comprises
generator, step-up transformer and 230 kV line up to Hama. Each substation will
generally comprise a 230-kV double-bus bar system (part of which may already
exist in some locations), one or two transformers 230/66/15 kV or 230/10 or 6 kV,
70, 50 or 40 MVA, metering transformers, and the necessary line bays. All
equipment, except line isolators, would be operated from a control building.
A detanking building is to be provided in roost cases for maintenance and repair.
The 230-kV neutral will be earthed directly, and the 66-kV neutral 'by means of a
neutral reactance. Line charge compensation reactances will also be connected at
the tertiary of the transformer. Basic provision will be made for communication
facilities and future telemetering and control (the dispatch center will be
constructed in Damascus under the next development phase).

8.        The construction of the 66-kV part of new substations or the
extensions to existing ones are being financed by DDR credits.

Bank Project. Reference is made to the map for the location of the various
substations.

ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 11
A. FORECAST OF SALES AND DEMAND
1.        EPE's consultants have made two approaches in forecasting the
1973-1980 power requirements. The first is based on available statistical
data (which, for electricity, are only reasonably reliable since 1962) and
the second adds to an assumed "background" growth the requirements of new and
expanding industry and villages to be connected. They also assumed that, in
order to meet requirements at least cost to the economy, practically all
electric energy in the sector, whether government (including the oil company)
or private, would be supplied by EPE, once its facilities have been improved
to provide ample and reliable service.
2.        The consultants investigated correlations between the use of power
since 1963 and various combinations of population, GNP, national product in
agriculture, mining and manufacturing, construction, and transport, as tabu-
lated in the "Syrian Statistical Abstract". Four regressions were maintained
showing the highest correlation for both demand and energy and these were
once more compared in various models for population growth. Six growth models
were retained and extrapolated up to 1990. Taking into account (a) the lowest
and the highest of these forecasts, and (b) that in 1972 EPE supplied about
66% of all electricity in the country and by 1980 may supply about 90%, it
appears that EPE's growth trend for the period 1972-1980 would range between
14% and 22%. The most likely rate would be 17-18%.
3.        The consultants next divided the country into six regions and
studied growth in each of the regions separately. A "background" growth
of 10% (the approximate average growth before commissioning of the 230-kV
system) was assumed for these regions. Demand and energy were then forecast
on the basis of:
(a) increase in isolated systems: 10%
(b) electrification of new villages during the period 1971-1975:
110,000 inhabitants annually are expected to gain access to
electricity at an average of 15 W each (demand is presently
about 30 W/inhabitant), 3,000 hour annually (45 kWh), increas-
ing 10% per year;
(c) electrification of new villages during the period 1975-1980:
98,000 inhabitants per year under requirements similar to (b).
(d) linear replacement in the period 1976-1990 of captive plant
generation (including oil company plants) by EPE supply; cap-
tive plant expansion is assumed to be substantially prohibited
by the Government from 1974 onward, in view of the lower eco-
nomic cost of public supply (with its expected fair amount of
hydro generation);

(e)  estimates for expansion of existing industrial plants and con-
struction of new plant in accordance with the national plan,
including oil company facilities (extraction, pumping, process-
ing); expansion schedules and major new factories are showr. in
Attachment 1 to this Annex.
4.        Possible delays in industrial plant completion were discussed by
the mission with EPE and its consultants during appraisal also with a view
not to overestimate EPE's technical capabilities and financial position.
This conservative approach resulted for instance in a reduction of forecast
1974 sales from 1,600 GWh (including isolated systems and oil company) to
1,170 GWh, i.e. by about 30%. The difference between original estimates and
revised estimates would gradually decrease to zero by 1978. Attachment 3 to
this Annex shows historic generation, generation as forecast by the consultants,
the appraisal forecast, and a reduced forecast to be used in one aspect of the
comparison of alternatives (see Section C below). 1/
5.        Annex 9, Page 1, shows inter alia the details for the resulting
forecast 1972-1979 sales - both for the interconnected and isolated systems.
Overall growth tread (by least squares) is expected to be 17.5% (16.5% in the
230-kV interconnected system). This is in reasonable accordance with the
average of the statistical forecast (see 2 above). Considerable annual
increases, however, would occur.  In 1976 and 1977 overall growth rate would
respectively be 46% and 22%, mainly due to connection of oil company facilities,
for which EPE would take over supply, and the connection of new factories in
the same areas.  By separating forecast sales in the present interconnected
system and forecast sales accruing from the 230-kV system additions starting
in 1976, Attachment 2 to this Annex illustrates the importance of those addi-
tions; growth in the present interconnected system would not exceed 23% (1975).
6.        The increase in relative importance of industrial sales is shown
in the following table of consumer categories and their purchases in the
interconnected system:

B. SCHEDULE OF REOUIRED PLANT INSTALLATION AND OF GENERATION
1.        Annex 9 shows the 1974-1979 schedule of main generating plant to be
installed, and likely to be taken over by EPE from the oil company. Also shown
is the assumed generation schedule (Thawra, and Souedie gas turbine plant oper-
ating on flared gas, would operate at the base; other gas turbines at the peak,
steam meeting the remaining requirements).  Up to 1978 a reserve capacity is
assumed equal to the largest unit in the system, and from 1978 onward, when
demand would be some 720 MW, additionally a spinning reserve of 100 MW (one
Thawra unit) is taken into account. It should be noted that up to 1978 one
15-MW steam unit in Kattineh is assumed as a spinning reserve; under contract
with the oil company this unit is exclusively used for direct supply to the
Homs refinery and is not available for general standby purposes. 1/
2.        in view of the high plant margin for 1977, it appears that the sec-
ond additional unit for Thawra (5th unit) could be postponed. F6r appraisal,
however, it was assumed that the Government, having an option to install 5
additional units with Rnssian financial assistance, would exercise its option
for at least 2 additional units. These units are expected to cost about
USS75/kWv if the option is taken soon enough so as to allow manufacturers'
continued production following the first 3 units. The forecast capacity
balance used in the comparison of alternatives (see below) does not show
the need for the 5th and further units at Thawra because additional thermal
plant needed to meet energy requirements would also provide the necessary
capacity. This results from the crash program of installation of 390 MW
of gas turbine plant on which the Government has embarked, and which - in
due time - will constitute a considerable reserve. However, to take up the
option on unit No. 5 may be justified because of the expected low price, and
within 10 years after commissioning it would replace the gas turbine units
which (except for Souedie) operate on crude and residual oil and may have
a restricted life expectancy. Thus it appears likelv that the installation
of more than 5 units at Thawra cannot be justified economically. 2/
C. COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES
1.        Because Syria's hydro potential is limited and no hydro plant can
be developed in time, only steam plant, gas turbine plant and extension of
-hawra can be used for designing medium-term (5-8 years) optimum development.
Diesel generation cannot be considered in view of the required capacities.
The questions to be raised in this respect are therefore simple:
1/ The ample capacity margin shown in Annex 9 is due to the installation of
10 additional gas turbines (totalling 230 MW rated capacity) provided by
various Arab States to alleviate the effects of war damage; part of the
damaged plant is being repaired.
2/   The Government has recently placed the order on the Thawra units 4 and 5.



ANNEX 8
Page 5 of 11
(a) Should the whole country be interconnected as soon as possible,
or would it have been prudent to postpone interconnection?
(b) Is a capacity of 125 MW for the first steam units appropriate,
or would 63 MW be more economic?
(c) Would the selection made under (b) also be appropriate if the
growth rate were more gradual than forecast during appraisal?
2.        In view of the above, five alternatives will be considered:
Alternative 1: The whole countrv would be interconnected by 1976 and
Mehardeh with 125-MW units, would be constructed as soon as possible;
Alternative 2: Interconnection is deferred to 1981 and Mehardeh is postponed
accordingly; four sub-systems are assumed developing independently from the
aain system. 1/
Alternative IA: Assuming that comparison will show Alternative 1 to have
least cost it will be compared with Alternative 1A. In the latter alterna-
tive, upit size would be 63 MW, all other aspects being similar to Alterna-
tive 1.
Alternative 3 and 3A: The comparison between Alternative 1 and Alternative
1A will be repeated; however, a more gradual growth will be assumed and
plant scheduled accordingly.
3.        For comparison of alternatives on a national level, oil company
requirements (prior to interconnection) have to be added to the requirements
to be met in EPE's system after interconnection; EPE would then take over the
oil company gas turbines and meet all company electricity requirements from
its network.  Development of each independent sub-system would therefore
differ only from interconnected development in that no 230-kv connection
would be provided, and that additional gas turbines would be installed in
each area. Sub-transmission and distribution developments would be the same
for all alternatives.
4.        During appraisal the balances of demand versus capacity and of
energy, prepared by the consultants, were amended to reflect the appraisal
forecast for electrical requirements up to 1979 (assumirng an 8% growth rate
beyond 1979) and the revised esti-mates for equipment cost. Attachment 4,
Page 1, to this annex shows for the Alternatives 1, 2 and 1A the sum of fore-
cast maximum demand and generation, as well as generation plant required to
1/   This Alternative is now redundant.  A contract was signed for the con-
struction of 800 km of 230-kV lines, with a second contract to follow
soon for about 300 km of lines. These lines will be financed from a
Russian Credit.

meet both demand and generation. Reserve requirements for the main system
are s.milar to those listed in Annex 9; for the sub-systems the largest unit
is assumed as a necessary reserve.
5.        The reduced growth estimate (See Attachment 3 to this Annex) to be
used in the comparison of Alternatives 3 and 3A, assumes a lower level of
1974 generation 1,300 GWh instead of 1,400 GWh) and a 5-year steady growth
rate of 22%, followed by 5 years of growth at 12%. By 1984 the difference
between the appraisai estimate and the reduced estimate would decrease to
zero. As can be observed in Attachment 3, the reduced graph practically
constitutes an extension of the historic graph, i.e. the reduction in effect
assumes that most of the rather large blocks of then existing (isolated) power
to be connected to the EPE system would not materialize, respectively that
connection would be more gradual. For this reason, the probability of the
reduced forecast appears low. 1/
6.        Attachment 4, Page 2 to this Annex shows for Alternatives 3 and 3A,
the sum of forecast maximum demand and generation, and generating plant to be
installed to meet the reduced power requirements. It should be noted, however,
that - in view of the lead time to complete new plant - the decision to in-
stall either 63-MW or 125-MW units (first 2 units) should be made now. For
this reason, it can be tested only whether the selected unit size would also
appropriate if during appraisal a reduced forecast of demand had been assumed.
7.        Attachment 5 to this Annex, which provides the schedule of commis-
sioning of plant required for each alternative, also shows the estimated con-
struction cost of each item. Annual expenditures for construction were sche-
duled as follows (in percent):
Year                       1     2     3      4     5
Hydro plant                   10   35    45    10
Steam plant                 8.5   25    40    20    6.5
Gas turbine plant             10   80    10

Lines                          7   30    55      8
8.        Assumptions for the basic operational cost are shown in Attachment 6
to this annex. Diesel oil is sold at a price of ES 132/ton (about US$0.83/
106BTU) throughout the country. Residual oil ex-refinery is priced at ES 50/
ton (about US$0.33/106BTU), to which transport cost depending on distance
from the source have to be added. The cost of flare gas in Souedie has been
estimated at zero cost at the well head. The assumed price reflects the con-
sultants cost estimate for the required gas pipe lines. In view of the large
local (Souedie, Hassakeh) requirements for electricity (including forced oil
extraction) it appears that the Government and EPE should study, as soon as
1/   This assumorion is maintained in the long term; short term war effects
on generation are showr. in the graph Attachment 3.

possible, the-feasibility of constructing a thermal plant on the Tigris using
flare gas.  Such plant could constitute an alternative for the 250-1W steam
extention beyond the fourth 125-MW unit, or even earlier depending on oil
developments. 1/
9.        The various capital expenditures and operational cost streams for
Alternatives 1, 2, and 1A are shown in Attachment 7, Page 1 to this Annex.
Page 2 of this attachment provides similar information for Alternatives 3
and 3A. However, in the latter case, only those plants not common to both
alternatives (see Attachment 4 Page 2) have been taken into account in order
to reduce the number of calculations. Netted cost streams are also shown,
i.e. the corresponding columns of respectively Alternative 2 and Alternative
1A were subtracted from those of Alternative 1 (See page 1), and those for
Alternative 3A from Alternative 3 (See page 2). The investments in trans-
mission lines and substations is common to Alternatives 1, 1A, 3 and 3A and,
for this reason, do not appear in the relevant tables of net costs. The
present value of net costs are also shown in Attachment 7.
10.       By positioning one of the alternatives in the horizontal axis of a
graph, the present values of the net costs are shown in Attachment 8, respec-
tively for:
Alternative 1 less Alternative 2; Interconnection
Alternative 1 less Alternative 1A; Unit Size
Alternative 3 less Alternative 3A; Reduced Load Forecast
Sensitivity to variations in the various cost items, which are also shown in
the graphs, will be discussed below.
Conclusions (See Tables Attachments 7 and Graphs Attachment 8)
(a)  Interconnection
11.       The equalizing discount rate, up to which Alternative 1 (inter-
connection as soon as possible) would have less present value than Alternative
2 (interconnection postponed for 5 years), is about 16%. At the opportunity
cost of capital in Syria (estimated to range from 10%-12%), the present value
of Alternative 1 would be about IS 29 million, US$7.5 million) below the present
value of Alternative 2, mainly due to LS171 million higher investments for
Alternative 2 (in gas turbine plant). In view of the large difference in
present value at the opportunity of capital, and the lower financial burden
due to lower investments, the comparison confirms the decision to interconnect
the country as soon as possible.
1/   In view of the high availability of gasturbine plant, EPE intends to
re-site several units at Souedie by 1977/78 where up to 100 MW in cheap
power appears to be available in gas from oil fields, now partly being
flared if not used in the oil company gasturbine plant.



ANNEX 8
Page 8 of 11
(b) Unit Size
12.       Given the conclusion to interconnect as soon as possible, Alter-
native 1 (125-MW unit size) is compared with Alternative 1A (63-MW unit size).
The equalizing discount rate up to which Alternative 1 shows less present
value than Alternative 1A, is now 18%, about 2 percentage points above 16%
for Alternatives 1/2. This indicates that installation of 125-MW units would
be more economic than installation of 63-MW units. As the opportunity cost
of capital, the present value of Alternative 1 would be about 6S 20 million
(US$5 million) below the present value of Alternative IA, mainly due to the
higher investments (about LS 55 million) for the 63-MW units. The lower
investment is not highly significant in view of the size of EPE's overall
investment program, but in view of the sizeable difference in present value,
the comparison shows that 125-MW units rather than 63-MW units should be
installed.
(c) Reduced Load Forecast
13.       By assuming a lower growth rate (see C5 above and Attachment 3 to
this annex) the first unit (either 63 MW or 125 MW) could be postponed by
about 2 years, from 1977 to 1979. However, in order to meet power require-
ments, plant construction would be fairly rapid; practically each year, until
1984, a unit would have to be added. It is, therefore, not surprising that
the equalizing discount rate (below which 125-MW units are more economic than
63-MW units, see graph Attachment 8) is about 15.5%. At the opportunity cost
of capital the difference in present value would be in the order of a mere
LS 2.5 million (this low figure, of course, is in part due to the postponements
in installing plant, causing a reduction in present value). However, as long
as the equalizing discount rate would not be sensitive to variation in cost
items (as shown below), the comparison indicates that decision on the 125-MW
unit size is not sensitive to the growth rate of demand.
D. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
1.        Attachment 8 to this Annex shows the net present value graphs of the
Alternatives, one graph each for the three stages of decision-making: (1)
interconnection to be postponed or not; decision: no; (2) whether to install
125-MW or 63-MW units; decision: 125 MW; and (3) can this decision be maintained
if a lower growth rate would be likely; decision: yes. These decisions, how-
ever, should not yet be final, without investigating their sensitivity to the
uncertainties and inaccuracies of the data, i.e. possible variations in costs.
The sensitivity of the equalizing discount rates with respect to cost variations
are also shown in the graphs on Attachment 8.
(a) Interconnection (Graph 1 of Attachment 8)
2.        No sensitivity in any measurable degree is present for the following
cost items:



ANNEX 8
Page 9 of 11
Hydro Capital
Total Capital
Total Fuel
O&M Steam
O&M other than Steam or Gas Turbine
3.        With the range of price variations of plus and minus 30% little
sensitivity is shown at variations in cost of all other items (including
fuel cost for steam or gas turbine, which represent efficiencies) except
for
Gas Turbine Capital
Total Steam or Total Gas Turbine Cost
Gas Turbine Capital Cost:
4.        A reduction of 10% in the estimated cost (of about US$185/kW), would
reduce the equalizing discount rate to about 14%. This still appears quite
adequate for selecting Alternative 1, particularly in view of the fact that
the gas turbine plant cost would have been overestimated, which is doubtful.
Total Steam and Total Gas Turbine Cost:
5.        Sensitivity is presented in one graph because the differences in
net present values are small compared with the overall present values of cost
for either steam plant or gas turbine plant. Assuming that costs (capital,
fuel, O&M) for steam plant have been correctly estimated, but similar costs
for gas turbine plant have all been overestimated by 20%, the equalizing
discount rate would reduce to 10%, On the other hand, if steam costs have
been overestimated by 20%, the equalizing discount rate would shift to 22%
in favor of Alternative 1. Because the probability of the assumption appears
very small indeed, say about 5%, that the equalizing discount rate would be
less than 10% or more than 22%, the mean would be 16%, with a standard devia-
tion of ±2.3%, assuming a normal distribution of errors. Therefore, the like-
ly range of the equalizing discount rate up to which Alternative 1 should be
selected is from 13.7% to 18.3%, i.e. above the opportunity cost of capital
in Syria,.
6.        From the above, it may be concluded that sensitivity considerations
would not change the decision to interconnect the country as soon as possible.
(b) Unit Size (Graph 2 of Attachment 8)
7.        The sensitivity to variations of plus and minus 30% in costs is
small. Although present values of 63-MW and 125-MW plant have not been
calculated, is obvious that no reasonable assumption of a possible error in
cost per kW could reduce the equalizing discount rate to the range of the
opportunity cost of capital.  For this reason sensitivity consideration would
not change the decision to install 125-iw^; units, taking into account the ap-
praisal forecast of demand. Increased fuel cost (i.e. using economic cost
for fuel), would further strengthen the decision to install larger units.



ANNEX 8
Page 10 of 11
(c) Reduced Load Forecast
8.        The equalizing discount rate is even less sensitive to variations
in cost of steam plant (because under Alternttive 3A not more than two 63-Mw
units should be installed before the first 125 MW). Conceivably, hydro plant
increasing by some 75% in price could cause the equalizing discount rate
to drop to the range of opportunity cost of capital. This appears highly
unlikely, and the decision to install 125-MW units is once more sustained,
even if the growth rate would be significantly below the appraisal forecast.
E. RATE OF RETURN OF PROJECT
1.        The rate of return of the Project is the discount rate which equalizes
the costs and benefits attributable to the Project over its economic life, which
has been taken at 25 years.  Willingness to pay, measured mainly through the
revenues, has been used as a first approximation of the attributable benefits.
These revenues understate the benefits consumers receive from the Project be-
cause it is considered that there is increased willingness to pay, i.e. a
tariff increase of reasonable magnitude (say 10-20%) would not reduce demand
significantly. The willingness of consumers to pay more is also illustrated
by the fact that a large capacity in costly captive plant has been installed
(and would be installed were the Project not executed) to meet the electric-
ity needs..
2.        As shown in Attachment 9 to this annex, the substation and the 230-kV
connecting line to the main system, have been fully attributed to the Proj-
ect. Half of the cost of substation at Hama was attributed to the Project
(the remaining 50% is attributable to Thawra). The cost of all other lines
and substations were attributed by 25% to the Project, assuming that the planned
expansion is commensurate with the total in capacity of Tnawra (300 MW) and
steam units 1 and 2 (250 MW) (i.e. unit 1 constitutes about 25% of this
capacity).  An average of about 2 years is required for demand to increase by
100-125 MW and for this reason 2 years of the distribution program (1977, and
1978 the year of commissioning)t were attributed to the Project. Estimated
import duties have been subtracted from the capital cost because this consti-
tutes only an internal transfer to the economy. Attributable operational
costs are based on the appraisal esti.nates and also shown in Attachment 8 to
Lhis annex. On the revenue side, an estimated 15% in taxes, which EPE levies
on each bill on behalf of the Government, have been added to the revenues as
they are a demonstration of increased willingness of the consumers to pay.
The taxes are spread unevenly (see Annex 3) and in many regions exceed 20%
of the bill. An average of 15% therefore, appears acceptable.
3.        The Rate of Return of the Project is about 17%.  Major inaccuracies
in either the cost of capital or operational costs are improbable, but never-
theless ass-uming that al- costs would have been underestimated about 10%
kor conversely that revenue has been over estimated by about 10%), the rate
of return would reduce to about 15%. It appears also unlikely that major



ANNEX 8
Page 11 of 11
inaccuracies have been made in the attribution of other facilities (substations,
lines and distribution). Nevertheless, if 20% of all other facilities should
not have been attributed to the first unit, equal to about 10Z of the overall
capital cost, the rate of return would increase to about 18%. In view of the
above, the most likely range of the Rate of Return of Project is 15-18%, with
an average of 16.5%.

Notes February 1974
i/ Substation Banias has been relocated to Tartous for interconnection with Lebanon at 230 kV, and supply
to the coastal area.
/ As a result of relocating the proposed power station to  Mehardeh, lines have been relocated; overall
length, however, is about equal.

Thermal Power Pro.ject
Rate of Return of Project
Assumptions for Costs and Attribution to Costs to the Project
Capital
Steam thermal plant inclutd7ing substation and connection 230-kV lines
to main system: 100% of capital cost less 6% estimated import duties
Substation Hama: 50% of capital cost less 6% estimated import duties
All other lines and substations: 25% (- approximate ratio of #1 steam
unit capacity to the total of Thawra (300 MW) and #1 and #2 steam units
(250 MW); overall line and substation capacity--except for transformers--
exceeds 550 MW and on this basis the assumed ratio should not exeed 25%
of the cost).
Distribution:  1977, 1978 investment in subtransmission and distribution
expansion; demand would increase by about 100 MW during this period,
somewhat less than #1 steam unit capacity, i.e. the attribution should
not exceed the investments for these years.
Fuel Cost
- Fuel #1 steam unit: Generation as forecast during appraisal rising to
710 GWi (plant factor 65%) by 1980 and remaining level until end of
economic life. Price of fuel iES 50/ton resulting in ZS15,120/GWh
- Savings in fuel cost old plant: Generation 375 GWh for 3 years (1978-
1980) and reducing linearly to zero by 1985.
Operating C0ot
- Personnel #1 steam unit: In accordance with cost forecast during
appraisal for 1976-1979, and kept constant until the end of economic
life
- Maintenance #1 steam unit: 20% of fuel cost (i.e. 1.25 times economic
cost to reflect actual estimated cost)
- Personnel and maintenance of lines and substations: 25% of appraisal
estimate until 1979 and kept constant until end of economic life
Benefits
- Sales (GWh): Generation less 20% to reflect assumed losses
-  evenue: In accordance with appraisal estimate for 1976-1979, increased
by 15% to reflect the mininum average of tax, for which EPE acts as the
Government's withholding agency.

Governxnt Construction Contributions
The Government finances EPE as necessary to meet the cost of its
authorised construction program or working capital. Such contributions are
only repayable when PE has funds surplus to its requirements aa is forecast
in 1978 (B540 million) and 1979 (LS50 million). Contributions for the foreign
exchange requirements of the construction program are often provided by the
Government out of bilateral credits. The largest example of such a bilateral
credit is that from the USSR, which has provided funds for the Euphrates Dam,
Thawra power station (5 units) and 1128 km of 120 kV transmission lines for
interconnection.
Various Arab States have provided 10 gas turbines to Syria
to offset the affects of the war damage to Kattineh and Hameh. These will
be given by the Government to EPE on a grant basis.
A "Liquidity" grant from the Government has been assumed to enable
EPE to pay local costs of the construction program, operating expenses and
maintain a minimal cash balance.
The Government Construction Contributions as at 12/31l1979 and the
original sources and projects are:
