1. OVERVIEW OF THE PRIMARY EDUCATION SYSTEM _
Structure and Distinguishing Characteristics
1.01      The formal education system is comprised of the following levels:
Primary:    Grades 1-5                  Ages 6-10 (nominally)
Secondary:  Lower - Grades 6-8          Ages 11-13
Higher - Grades 9-10       Ages 14-15
College (Intermediate) Grades 11-12  Ages 16-17
Higher:      Grades 12+                 Ages 17-18+
There are about 40,000 primary schools which typically have 200-250 students
and four teachers. Ninety percent of these schools are rural. Access is
unbalanced with significantly lower overall enrollment of girls and of both
sexes in rural areas (Table 1.1). A high proportion (about 30%) of the
primary age group never enter Grade 1. About 10% of primary students attend
private schools, while over 90% of secondary students are enrolled in
private institutions. The primary education system suffers from lack of
adequate administration, supervision and teaching staff as well as
unsuitable buildings, teaching methods and materials.

1.02      Management and Supervision.  The small number of staff and the
inadequate training of supervisory personnel are major constraiLnts to the
/1 Other levels and types of Education are described in the Education
Sector Memorandum, June 1978 (Report 1037-BP).



management and administration of the education system There are less than
100 officials at the national and divisional levels for the planning and
implementation of the primary education system which serves over 8 million
students. Teachers and other educators are frequently ibsent from their
duties and difficulties with assignment of staff are common at all levels.
Management and supervision of primary education is provided by the
Directorate of Public Instruction (DPI) within the Ministry of Education
(MOE). The DPI includes an Assistant Director, Public Instruction respon-
sible for the administration of primary schools. Below the national level,
there are three principal levels for primary school administration:
District: District Education Officer, Primary (DEOP); Thana: Thana Education
Officer (TEO); and school (headmaster). The administrative structure and
staffing is not adequate for the assigned responsibilities, and the
situation is worsened by the practice of determining level of position
solely by qualifications, and a belief that primary school management
requires little specific education or training. At all levels above the
school, the span of control is too large. The greatest weakness in
supervision is at the Thana level. The TEO cannot regularly visit the
approximately 100 schools (400 teachers) for which he is responsible because
of lack of time and transport. In any case, the ratio of 1:400 teachers is
an unmanageable task for any supervisor. No regular system of training and
retraining of supervisors/managers exists. As a result of these
constraints, primary schools remain largely unsupervised.
1.03      Enrollment.  Enrollments are increasing overall slightly faster
than the population growth. Primary enrollment increased from 3.4 million
in 1960 to 8.0 million in 1978, serving about three-quarters of the
relevant age group but with girls accounting for less than 40% of total
enrollment. National enrollment declines from 3.4 million in grade 1 to
0.77 million in grade 5. Enrollment is evenly distributed over the four
divisions of the country (Table 1.2). Madrasah schools, where the Imam
teaches Islamic studies and the holy Quran, is another type of primary
education in which enrollment has grown in recent years. In 1978, these
schools had an enrollment of 1,541,130 students and 35,172 teachers.

1.04      Curriculum.  The primary school curriculum covers seven subjects
in a 6-day, 20-hour school week (grades 1 and 2, 15 hours, grades 3-5,
19.8 hours): language, 7 hours; mathematics, science, religious studies
3 hours each; environment studies; health, physical education, music, arts
and crafts, 2-3 hours each. Education content above the primary levels
still has a strongly academic and theoretical bias even in the technical and
vocational courses, with science and art often neglected or eliminated due
to lack of materials and untrained teachers. The system is based on rigid
memory-based teaching, reinforced by the examination system, and does not
sufficiently emphasize basic language and numeracy skills. Attempts are
being made to alter this system and both the primary school curriculum and
textbooks have recently been revised. In general, the new curriculum is an
improvement but it still does not achieve the necessary relevancy to village
life. The Bengali language, used by over 95% of the population, is the
language of instruction. However, only seven hours per week is allocated
for Bengali while five periods in grades 3-5 (one seventh of the time) is
devoted to learning English. The justification for this is that English is
considered a passport to better jobs and continued school opportunities,
therefore, equity to poor and/or rural families requires the teaching of-
English in grades 3-5 in all schools.

1.05      Textbooks for each grade are developed by the Government Textbook
Board and published by private printers. Prices range from Tk 11.72
(US$0.76) in grade 1 for a set of 4 books to Tk 26.29 (US$1.70) in grade 5
for a set of 8 books. The costs of texts are borne entirely by the parents.
On a given school day, about half of the students are without textbooks,
particularly serious in a system where instruction is based on the textbook
and where there are no other instructional materials.
1.06      Teacher training for primary education is conducted in one-year
courses at 48 Primary Training Institutes (PTIs) which have an average
capacity of 150 students and a combined output of about 7,200 per year, which
is less than 5% of the current stock of 155,000 teachers. About 80% of PTI
spaces are reserved for in-ser-vice training to achieve full training of those
teachers who lack previous training. As a result of this practice, only 20%
of the output (1,440) is a net increase in teacher supply. Facilities of
PTIs are inadequate; there are often no laboratories, workshops or libraries,
and almost no equipment or suitable furniture. The course of study in PTIs
includes preparation in each subject area taught in primary schools and in
educational foundations and teaching methods. Practice teaching is conducted
in both the primary school attached to the PTI and nearby primary schools.
The curriculum has an adequate balance between subject matter theory and
teaching methods; however, effectiveness is marginal due to weaknesses in
staff quality, facilities and equipment. Almost all PTI staff hold BA
degrees and a teaching certificate, but nearly all are male and have never
taught in a primary school. As a result, they are unable to prepare their
students for the physical conditions, pupil needs and behavior to be
expected in primary schools.
1.07      Both pre-service and in-service training need to be expanded and
improved to cover the existing student population and the anticipated
enrollment growth from the introduction of Universal Primary Education (UPE)
in January 1981. Major shortcomings in the pre-service training system
include irrelevant curricula, poor teaching and inadequately motivated
students, many of whom do not enter teaching after training. The Government
plans to increase the participation of women in primary education, and under
the Second Five-Year Plan, 50% of all new primary teaching posts will be
filled by women./I The present annual output of female teachers is about
1,000 and falls so far short of the anticipated demand that Government
intends to hire women as teachers who have had only a grade 10 education,
without benefit of a PTI training course.
1.08      Opportunities for in-service training are high in proportion to
pre-service training (para. 1.06). Over the past five years, the in-service
program has been used to provide initial training to untrained teachers in

coming the major obstacle to female enrollment.



the system instead of the upgrading of already trained teachers. As a
result thie proportion of untrained teachers has been reduced from over 50%
in 1974 to about 33% in 1979 (Table 1.3). The in-service training programs
are, however, too long, lack quality and relevance and are not dissimilar
from the pre-service program offered at the PTIs.
Main Issuies in Primary Education
Problems
1.09       Unequal Opportunity.  During the period 1973-78, primary school
enrollments expanded at an average annual rate of 4.2% to raise the overall
enrollment ratio from 58% to 71%; however, substantial inequities in access
exist by sex, and to a lesser degree by administrative division (Table 1.2).
The lack of educational opportunities for girls is reflected in their low
initial enrollment in primary schools (60% never enroll). The lack of
educational opportunities for rural people is seen in the uneven provision
of facilities to the rural areas, reinforced by the unbalancecd distribution
of teachers, with most trained and female teachers concentrated in the
urban areas and shortages in the rural areas.
1.10       Wastage.  High dropout rates, contributing to overall low enroll-
ment levels, show wide variation by sex. Between 1973 and 1978, more than
half the students who entered grade 1 dropped out before grade 5. The
highest dropout rate occurred before grade 3. However, despilte high dropout
rates between grades 1 and 3, class size in these grades are still large
(50-60) because of high initial enrollments and high rates of repetition.
High dropout rates between lower grades (1-3) means that classes in the
higher grades (4-5) are small (10-20 pupils). This leads to an inefficient
use of teachers. The major part of enrollment growth in the next five years
and the extra students resulting from the anticipated reduced dropout rate
could be covered by the present stock of teachers if they are used more
efficiently.
1.11       Low Quality.  A critical factor causing high dropouts is the poor
quality cf instruction and the resulting low learning achievement.  In many
schools, the physical conditions are oppressive and disciplin,e harsh,
discouraging attendance and encouraging dropouts. High rates of teacher
absenteeism, a reflection of lax supervision, contribute to indifference
among both students and parents. Teachers tend to be ineffective in
covering curriculum because they lack proper training (paras. 1.06-1.08) and
efficient and appropriate instructional materials. A conventional measure
of school quality is the percentage of teachers with less than full
training. In Bangladesh, 33% of the teachers (public and pri-vate) are not
trained (Table 1.3). This is compounded by the fact that the 67% who are
supposed to be trained have received inadequate training.  The consequences
of poor cluality together with low enrollments and high dropout rates mean
that primary education does not adequately provide general literacy for the
coming generation and nearly half of the money is spent on pupils who drop
out before grade 4.

1.12      Financial Constraints.  A program to improve and expand primary
education will clearly cost more. Primary education has been given the
highest priority in the education sector under the Second Plan and
expenditures, particularly at the primary level, will increase its share of
total education development expenditures over the five-year plan period from
13% in the 1973-80 period to around 43% during the 1980-85 plan period./1
1.13      Even if sufficient development funds were provided for primary
education, the Government may not be able to mobilize the recurrent funds
needed to hire and pay additional teachers and to maintain facilities.
Resources available to meet this need will also grow but almost certainly at
a lower rate than enrollment. Thus, without a significant change in the
methods of delivery of primary education, costs would increase directly in
proportion to enrollment, would consume a larger share of GNP, and would
still not produce students with literacy, numeracy, or other attributes
needed for development of the nation.
Causes
1.14      The causes of inequitable access, high dropout, repetition and low
learning achievement are complex. They involve interrelated economic, social
and educational factors.
1.15      Economic.  The opportunity cost of education to the rural family
is a major factor contributing to non-enrollment, repetition and dropout.
Since the child is essential to the family's economic activities, he/she may
never be enrolled. However, when enrolled, the child often falls behind in
his/her classwork during the cropping season. The result is that he/she is
either forced to repeat a grade or he/she drops out of school entirely. The
/1 Second Five-Year Plan: 1980-85. Planning Commission Government of
Bangladesh.

direct cost to the family of primary education is another cause of
non-enrollment and dropout. In addition to the costs of clothing (US$2.50),
exercise books and pencils (US$0.80), parents bear the cost of textbooks
(US$0.36--US$1.70, para. 1.05). This is not only expensive but these texts
are often of poor physical quality and have to be replaced before the school
year is ocrer. These costs outstrip the financial means of most rural
families particularly when more than one child in the family is enrolled in
school.
1.16      Although primary education accounts for over 50% of total recurrent
education expenditures, the allocation is insufficient (98% for teacher
salaries) to provide maintenance for existing physical facilities. Primary
schools normally have three rooms, but rarely have internal walls. They lack
furniture, sanitary and water facilities and are poorly maintained. They are
austere structures, inefficient for teaching and prove unattractive to student
attendance. Schools frequently are not located in relation to demographic
need. In many schools there are more spaces than needed, while in others
spaces for less than 50% of needs are provided.
1.17      Socio-Cultural.  The lack of parental and community support for
primary education is another major reason for the nonenrollment of girls,
and nonattendance in general in rural areas. Traditional parental attitudes
favor protecting girls and educating them at home especially when they cannot
be properly clothed. Also, because of the high incidence of flooding and the
poor network of roads, parents are reluctant to send their younger children
too far from the village. These attitudes have led to the growth of village
or feeder schools (,rades 0-2) and increased enrollments in the religious
schools.
1.18      Low community involvement is also a reaction to the Government's
decision in 1974 to take over the control of primary education and to abolish
the community based school management committees. The school is now viewed as
a centra:L Government institution, hence maintenance and supervision activities
are seen as Government functions. The increased enrollment in the religious
schools i(para. 1.03) is in part, a result of these government actions and
parental attitudes.
1.19      Educational.  Several educational factors contribute to nonenroll-
ment, repetition, dropout and low attainment. Among these are the low
quality of teaching, inappropriate curriculum and inadequate supply of
educational and instructional materials (para. 1.11). Teacher absenteeism
is also a major educational problem. Untrained, predominantly male teachers
(only 8% women) who are relatively low paid and have limited career growth
prospects, turn their attention to farming and shopkeeping to supplement
their income. Absenteeism is facilitated because most teachers are posted
to their own villages, and they can utilize the school hours to pursue their
other economic activities. Posting teachers to villages other than their
own, and increasing primary teacher salaries are possible solutions to the
problem of teacher absenteeism. Under present circumstances these options
are not feasible. However, teacher absenteeism can be reduced by increasing
thana level supervision of the teachers and a greater involvement of parents
in the affairs of the school.

1.20      A strategy is needed for primary education to overcome the causes of
inequitable access, low enrollments, high dropout and repetition, and low
pupil attainment. Since the causes are complex, the strategy to overcome them
is also complex. The Government has outlined such a strategy under its draft
Second Five-Year Plan (para. 1.22).
Government Education Plans and Policies
1.21      Under Bangladesh's two previous development plans (First Five-Year
Plan 1973-78 and the Two-Year Plan 1978-80), education spending was aimed at:
(a) improving the quality of education by increasing the number of trained
teachers at the primary and secondary (mainly science) levels; and (b) the
expansion of facilities to increase enrollments at the primary, vocational
and technical levels. Under both plans, implementation has been generally
unsatisfactory, due to financial constraints and political, social and
economic changes. Important physical targets were not met. Of 20,000
primary schools to be developed, only 10,000 were completed at the end of
the Two-Year Plan period due to resource constraints and the diversion of a
substantial amount of funds from the primary subsector to the universities.
Achievement in two other important areas in primary education were far below
targets (Table 1.4):
(a) Dropouts: the target was to reduce the dropout rate for primary
schools from 63% to 52% but the current figure is now at about 80%.
Differences in definition of terms are possible, but it is clear
that since 1973 no significant improvement was achieved. Only the
number of students was increased while the quality of the program,
facilities, materials, curricula, teaching and supervision remained
unchanged and the many causes of dropouts were not removed; and
(b) Primary Teachers. The First Five-Year Plan (1973-78) called for
a sixfold increase in female teachers but only a doubling was
achieved. Total teacher supply, which fell behind planned levels,
has increased only slightly in the past three years reflecting
budget constraints, and a general shortfall in the means to
increase the supply of new teachers. The 48 PTI were able to
produce only 1,400 new teachers each year although the Plan called
for over 12,000 in each of the five years.
Second Five Year Plan
1.22      The education policy of the Second Five-Year Plan (1980-85) concen-
trates on (a) broadening the base of primary education; (b) linking the
education system to employment; (c) making science and agriculture a basic
component of the education system; (d) accelerating the growth of women's
education; and (e) reducing the rural-urban gap in the provision of educa-
tional services. The plan hopes to reverse the recent trend of progressive
diversion of resources from the lower tiers to socially selective forms of
post-primary education. The share of primary education in education develop-
ment expenditure, which averaged about 13% during the period 1973-80
(Table 1.4), would increase to 43% (US$269.0 million) of the total education

allocation (US$623.0 million) under the Second Five-Year Plan. Hence, the
introduction of Universal Primary Education (UPE) would be afforded the
highest priority among the Plan's educational objectives. The UPE program has
as its major target the enrollment of 12.9 million children in primary grades
1-5 by 1Q85. This would represent 91% of the total 6-11 age group. In
addition to the decentraliztion of the administration and management of
primary education the other areas of emphasis in the Plan are the increased
employment of female teachers, the strengthening of primary school supervision
(2,000 inspectors), the construction of 2,000 new primary schools and the
renovation of 10,000 substandard schools. Finally, recognizing that the
poverty of parents is one of the major causes for nonparticipation and dropout
from primary schools, the Plan provides for the supply of free textbooks to
about 13 million students in five years (US$22.0 million) and free uniforms to
5 million girls in five years (US$6.0 million). Overall, the level of
education spending proposed under the Plan would rise to above 2% of GNP,
which is still below the median for all developing countries (Annex 1).
1.23      These educational objectives and priorities, particularly the
special emphasis on increasing female participation, supervision and teacher
training, are sound but seem ambitious for the next five-year period and also
in the light of past performance. However, the achievement of targets depends
on, inter alia, the Government's ability to resist sociopolitical pressures to
reallocate funds allocated to the primary level to secondary or higher
education or other sectors. Success also depends on finding ways of reducing
capital costs of constructing schools. Without the contribution of the local
communities (labor, material, land), the cost of constructing primary school
facilities alone would take up about 77% of the public sector allocation to
primary education and would therefore prohibit a national program which would
include other components in addition to physical facilities. Low cost
schools, using local materials, and community self-help in planning, con-
struction and maintenance will go a long way in reducing the capital costs to
be borne by the Government. Systematic school mapping could also reduce the
buildings required to cover a given population. The Government should however
be fully cognizant of community and parochial interests when undertaking a
consolidation or abandonment program, for dictation from the center could lead
to a substantial misinvestment in facilities which could be unwanted and
unused by the local communities.
1.24      Since teacher salaries constitute the major part of recurrent
primary education expenditures (98.8%), the financial feasibility of the
national strategy depends mainly on reducing the per student cost of teacher
salaries. Three approaches are possible:
(a) increasing the number of students taught per teacher, by
increasing class sizes or the number of class groups handled by
each teacher;



- 11 -
(b) moving towards larger schools to increase economies of scale and
reduce the need for multiple grade teaching; and
(c) reducing the burden of salaries on the recurrent budget by
recruiting assistant teachers at lower rates of pay.
1.25      Since much of the funds now spent are wasted through dropout before
literacy or numeracy are attained, expenditures to increase ithe quality of
instruction would contribute indirectly to a lower cost per graduate. A
higher quality of instruction and increased local supervision would also lead
to a lower dropout rate, which would result in better utilization of existing
resources and in fewer student-years of instruction per graduate. Expendi-
tures on. management and supervision would also contribute to improved quality
through better teaching.
External Financing in Primary Education
1.26      Since 1970, the Government has received assistance from multi-
lateral and bilateral sources for primary and nonformal education. Both the
Ford Foundation and UNESCO/UNDP have provided assistance for educational
planning and administration. UNESCO has also assisted in Primary Teacher
Training. OXFAM, the USA and Canada have assisted the Bangladesh Rural
Advancement Council in undertaking nonformal programs, a large part of which
went to primary education. The Asian Development Bank is assisting in the
establishment of the Education Equipment Bureau.  Although the Bureau would be
primarily concerned with secondary school equipment, some primary school
science materials would be included. UNICEF has been by far the largest donor
to the primary education subsector. During the period 1970-80, it has
commited over US$23.0 million to Bangladesh. Its major programs have been to
assist primary teacher training, textbook production and distribution, and the
distribution of school supplies. UNICEF's assistance to priimary teacher
training; has been to provide women's hostels at 38 of the 48 PTIs in the
country in addition to the upgrading of the other facilities and providing
teaching materials and aids (US$1.04 million). For textbook production,
UNICEF is providing 400,000 sets of Grade I and II textbooks for girls and
over 1,000 tons of paper per year for printing these books (US$1.2 million).
The third major scheme involves the distribution of 10,000 primary school
education kits /1 (US$2.4 million).
Bank Group's Role in Education and Training
1.27      Previous Bank Group lending in the education sector includes:
(a) Credlit 407-BD (1973) aimed at improving and expanding institutions
providing education and training in technical and agricultural subjects.
/1 Each kit contains I steel cupboard, 920 exercise books, 600 pencils,
1 pencil sharpener, 10 boxes of chalk, 2 blackboards, 1 science
demonstration kit and 1 first aid kit.



- 12 -
total cost of the project was US$36.3 million and the Credit amount,
US$21.0 million; (b) Credit 621-BD (1976) which aimed at expanding and
improving agricultural and rural training. The total cost of the project
was US$16.5 million and the Credit amount, US$12.0 million; and (c) Credit
912-BD (1979) which aimed to expand and improve vocationa' training. The
total cost of the project was US$32.4 million and the Credit amount,
US$25.0 million.
1.28      IDA funds in the Education sector in Bangladesh have been concen-
trated in vocational training (47%) and agriculture (40%). The Vocational
Training Project (CR 912-BD) was declared effective in November 1979, and is
showing steady progress. In agriculture, the major share of IDA funds have
gone to the Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU). BAU has become the
main source of trained agricultural manpower in the country, but its
teaching and research program have tended to be overspecialized in relation
to the present state of agricultural development in Bangladesh which
requires technicians with more generalized training. Recently a number of
new programs have been introduced to improve the practical skills of
students and increase their involvement in research and extension. Progress
in the recruitment of experts (under Credit 621-BD) to assist BAU to define
its role in training, reseach and extension has been slow; however, a list
of candidates proposed by BAU for these appointments is now under
consideration by the National Committee on Rural Training (NCRT). In
addition, Credit 621-BD is expanding the training capacity for middle-level
agricultural manpower through assistance to seven Agricultural Training
Institutes and the Bogra Academy, but training shortages are projected even
with this higher capacity. Credit 621-BD also established a National
Committee on Rural Training (NCRT) to assist in avoiding gaps or
duplications in rural training programs. The NCRT has functioned only
marginally so far, largely because of staff shortages and a lack of
expertise. However, action has been taken to recruit staff for the NCRT
Secretariat and the appointment of Technical Assistance experts. In
technical education five new polytechnics for training technicians have been
established with IDA assistance (under Cr 407-BD) and equipment has been
provided to eight others. All five polytechnics have been completed.
Efforts are under way to revise curricula to give a practical orientation to
technical education and to improve the quality of teaching staff. The eight
IDA-assisted polytechnics are also being used on a second shift basis for
vocational training.
1.29      In addition to project activities, the Bank has completed a major
sector study in education and training; the Education and Training Sector
Memorandum of June 1978 (Report 2037-BD).
1.30      Most IDA funds committed for education and training thus far have
been devoted to the upper and intermediate levels of the system, with little
allocated for basic or nonformal purposes. The proposed fourth project in
primary education would focus on basic education needs. It represents a shift
in the emphasis of Bank Group education lending to Bangladesh from the upper
levels to the lower levels.

2. THE PROJECT
A. Primary Education
Objectives
2.01      The objectives and strategy to be pursued by the project coincide
with those enunciated by the Government (para. 1.22) and constitute a first
phase towards the achievement of universal primary education. An evaluation
of its performance would indicate what interventions could be used most
effectively on a national scale to overcome the major problems in primary
education (paras. 1.09-1.13). The proposed project would have four major
objectives:
(a) increased access to primary schools, especially for girls and for
rural poverty groups (landless): this would be achieved by
providing (i) additional school facilities and materials; (ii)
more female teachers; (iii) enhanced supervision to Lmprove
teacher performance and attendance; and (iv) for increased
community control of schools to overcome parental indifference to
enrollment;
(b) reduced wastage, principally by reducing dropout and repetition,
through improved facilities, materials and instruction, and super-
vision (to reduce teacher absenteeism) and by working with parents
and community leaders (School Management Committees);
(c) improved quality of instruction to attain higher and more lasting
pupil achievement through (i) recurrent in-service teacher training
in methods of teaching and classroom management designed to
make better use of school time; and (ii) local, mote frequent
supervision; and
(d) reduced costs by reducing wastage inherent in dropout, by employing
a higher student-teacher ratio, by moving toward larger class and
school sizes.
The project proposes a limited approach to these objectives. Limited
implementation capacity and financial resources, and need to keep the
project al: a manageable dimension did not permit inclusion of all the
elements of the strategy./1 Coverage is low enough to avoid large-scale
investment: in unproved approaches, yet large enough to provide statistically
significant experimentation and research. Importantly, an objective of
/1 Certain elements of the overall strategy were omitted to avoid undue
risks, limit project dimensions and improve implementation. These
include: providing housing for female teachers, experimentation with the
school calendar, basic health care and school feeding.

the project would be to test whether the provision of free textbooks and
uniforms to disadvantaged students would encourage enrollment and discourage
dropouts.
Content, Scope and Sequence
2.02      To attain its objectives, the proposed project would
(a)  strengthen the teacher service;
(b)  expand supervision;
(c)  improve the training of education administration/management staff;
(d)  increase the supply of instructional materials;
(e)  provide additional primary school classrooms;
(f)  foster the development of local evaluation capability; and
(g)  conduct a limited experiment with Project IMPACT./1
2.03      Project activities would be conducted in 40 thanas located in
8 districts in each of the 4 divisions of the country. The 8 districts were
selected on the basis of criteria developed by the Government. These
criteria were: (a) Educational: (i) literacy rate below the national
average; (ii) enrollment rate of girls below the national average; (iii) drop-
out rate above the national average; (iv) percentage of untrained teachers
above the national average; (b) Development Potential: thanas in which
Integrated Rural Development Programs (IRDP) are in existence or are planned;
and (c) Geophysical: (i) selection of a wide range of physical conditions,
flood prone, cyclone affected, hilly, etc.; (ii) providing as wide a
regional range as possible; and (iii) good accessibility and communications.
These criteria were applied on a country-wide basis and final selection made
on the resulting "order of merit" (Annex 2).
2.04      The project would affect all of the 4,033 government schools in the
40 thanas presently enrolling about 736,000 pupils and employing about 16,800
teachers. During the project, the number of pupils would double as the
Government policy of universal primary education (UPE) is launched.  Most
project beneficiaries would be rural although urban populations would also be
served in and near the subdivision and thana centers. Enrollment projections
for the five year project period are summarized in Table 2.1. Current
Government policy calls for the cohort which starts grade 1 in January 1981 to
be the first UPE cohort.

2.05      1he project would cover six years:  (a) a period extending from
September ].980 to September 1981 in which the initial training, materials
development: and collection of baseline evaluation measurements would be
completed, followed by; (b) four school years, starting in January of 1982,
1983, 1984,, and 1985 in which contruction, materials provision, training and
financing would continue and during which the impact of the project components
would be measured and evaluated; and finally (c) a follow-up period of six to
nine month in which final results would be analyzed and conclusions reached
(September 1986). Evaluation would be an essential element in project design
and measurable targets would be selected to assess achievement of objectives.

PROJECT COMPONENTS
Teacher Service (Proposed Outlay US$2.65 million for physical facilites,
equipment and salaries 11).
2.06      The proposed project would strengthen the teacher service by pro-
viding a new pattern of intensive and recurent in-service teacher training
through the stengthening of Primary Teacher Training Institutes and the
Academy for Fundamental Education, and by adding a new category of assistant
teachers. This is based on the hypothesis that more frequent and more practi-
cal training would improve teaching effectiveness.
2.07      Primary Teacher Training Institutes (PTIs) (Proposed outlay
US$1.04 million for physical facilities, equipment and salaries). In order
to undertake an expanded in-service and recurrent teacher training program,
the 8 PTIs in the project area would be upgraded. The project would finance
the salaries of the required additional PTI instructors, the renovation of
existing academic facilities, the expansion of student hostels and the
provision of equipment. Assistance to teacher training would be the largest
project component in terms of the number of participants (16,640).  Since
the training of all staff is critical to achieving project objectives,
teacher trainers as well as teachers would undergo recurrent training
(paras.  2..19-2.21).
2.08      Academy for Fundamental Education (AFE) (Proposed Outlay US$1.16
million for physical facilities equipment and salaries). The Academy is a
national institution and acts as a forum for the examination and discussion
of all the varied problems of primary education. It also serves as the
center for the development of Fundamental Education (primary education plus
nonformal education). Under the project, it will provide the essential link
between curriculum development and the PTIs, and will offer professional
training for primary education administrators, PTI staff, TEO/ATEOs and all
experimental school teachers/learning coordinators (project impact).
Project assistance is designed to strengthen the institution and will
include (a) salary support for additional staff, (b) improvements to
existing academic buildings, (c) the provision of staff housing and student
hostels, and (d) books, equipment and materials.
2.09      Assistant Teachers (Proposed outlay US$0.45 million i-or salaries.
The project would finance the salaries of 500 Assistant Teachers, recruited
to teach in schools near their homes (often in the same village) to avoid
housing problems. The majority (80%) would be female. They would have
completed Grade 10 or have acquired the equivalent achievement through
independent study or experience. The assistant teacher positions would be a
means of utilizing unemployed rural persons, especially women, who would be
familiar with the community. The experimental use of these assistant

teachers represents a promising cost-reducing factor and a means of
supplying female teachers in rural areas. Special pre-service training and
recurrent in-service training would be provided.
Supervision (Proposed Outlay US$0.62 million for salaries and physical
facilities).
2.10      The present system lacks adequate supervision at all levels but
especially below the district level, resulting in low teacher morale and
performance, and a high level of absenteeeeism (para. 1.02, 1.19). The
project would introduce supervision for primary schools below the district
level by creating 250 Assistant Thana Education officers (ATEOs) to provide
coverage at the rate of one ATEO for about 67 teachers. This approach is
based on the hypothesis that closer and more active supervision would result
in less absenteeism, improved teacher performance and a closer relationship
among schools, parents and community. The project would finance salaries,
transport (bicycles) and office facilities for all ATEOs.
2.11      ATEOs would report to the Thana Education Officer (TEO) in the
regular system, but have special responsibility in the project for:
(a) improving school-community relations;
(b) providing constructive help to teachers and headmasters; and
(c) organizing in-service training with the help of PTI staff.
The new supervisory position, coupled with the position of assistant teachers,
would create a five-step career ladder in primary education: assistant
teacher, teacher, headmaster, ATEO, TEO. During negotiations the Government
provided assurances that the criteria for the selection of ATEO's would
emphasize the following: (a) experience as a primary school teacher and
headmaster; (b) a willingness to work harder than the average teacher; and
(c) evidence of interest in innovation.

Learning Materials (Proposed Outlay US$5.10 million for textbooks, IMPACT
learning modules, and school uniforms for girls).
2.12      The project would support the production and distribution of new
textbooks to about 2.1 million students (50% of the 1981-85 cohort). This
coincides with the Government's policy under the Second Five-'Year Plan of
providing all textbooks to poorer students (para. 1.22). The existing curri-
culum and textbook series are newly adopted and merit a trial period before
revisions are suggested.  However, technical assistance and training to
develop new and additional materials for trial in schools would be supported
by the project. The project would also finance teachers' guides for all
teachers and assistant teachers and special modules for the Project IMPACT
experiment.
2.13      The lack of suitable clothing for school has been identified as a
constraint to the enrollment and attendance of girls, especially from
impoverished families. The Government plans to provide free uniforms for
girls from poorer families (para. 1.22) and to require uniforms for all
children in UPE designated Thanas in order to avoid any stigma attached to the
averaging of uniforms. The project would finance uniforms for approximately
0.5 million girls over the project period. During appraisal, the Government's
plan for the distribution of textbooks and uniforms and the criteria for the
selection of eligible students (i.e. (a) children of landless agricultural
workers, fishermen or other less privileged income groups; (b) income of
parents, and (c) number of children in the family attending school) was
reviewed and found appropriate.



- 20 -
Primary Schools (Proposed Outlay US$19.65 million for physical facilities,
and equipment).
2.14     The project would support construction, furnishing and equipping
of additional classroom facilities at about 1,300 existing and new schools,
(mostly 4-classroom additions) including improvement of existing facilities
and provision of latrines and tube wells. This program would generate about
6,455 classrooms for 322,750 additional student places. An average utili-
zation factor of 88% of available school time (double the present rate) would
permit an additional enrollment of 645,500 students representing about 88% of
the present enrollment and 40% of the expected enrollment growth to 1985.
With improvements to existing schools, and the renovation and improvement
of about 1,800 additional classrooms to be undertaken by GOB, the total
student places created would be about 824,000 with an enrollment capacity at
the 4,033 schools of 1,648,000, in line with the 1985 enrollment projections.
Annex 4 describes the basis for school and classroom needs.
2.15      Mfany of the schools in the project area require only minor improve-
ments and/or expansion. Project assistance would concentrate on additional
classrooms in existing schools where considerable expansion is warranted. The
general impact of this construction program would be assessed by improved
student enrollment, retention and achievement; teacher attendance, performance
and job satisfaction, health and welfare of students and teachers; and on
community pride and participation. A School Management Committee would be
established for each project school. Physical expansion of the school system
in addition to providing badly needed school facilities is also expected to
achieve two other important objectives. Firstly by improving the geographical
distribution of schools to place them within acceptable walking distances; and
secondly by developing minimum standards for construction and school design.
Standards so developed should be affordable and implementable on a national
scale. A school mapping exercise and development of a location planning
system, taking into account population density, and other geographical and
social factors, has been completed by the Ministry of Education with UNESCO
assistance.
2.16      The majority of schools to be assisted under the project would
consist of 5 classrooms, each with capacity for 50 students. In urban areas
where the population can support a larger enrollment, schools would consist of
up to 10 classrooms. Existing primary schools would be upgraded to these
standards. Equipment for the schools would include a small set of library
books, maps and simple science equipment.
Staff Training (Proposed outlay US$3.73 million).
2.17      Training.  Successful implementation of the project would depend
partly on proper selection of personnel, but primarily on the quality and
relevancy of training. A comprehensive training program would be needed to
cover six categories of personnel: Implementation Unit (40), Teacher Trainers



- 21 -
(140); Field Administration (80); Research and Evaluation (110); Supervision
(250) and Teachers and Assistant Teachers (16,500). The project would cover
the cost oiE the training program.
2.18      Training Method and Duration.  The training progr 1 would be
comprised of the following segments: (i) An A Group; consisting of about 70
staff drawn from the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), and including
selected teacher trainers, administrators and researchers. Training of the
A Group would last about four months, and be conducted overseas and in
Bangladesh by a team of local and expatriate trainers. Project: objectives
and plans would be a central topic as well as training, planning and
scheduling, and the preparation of training materials. The selection and
appointment of the A group would be a condition of credit effectiveness;
and (ii) a B Group; (220); including the remaining PIU staff, teacher
trainers, administrators and researchers not included in the A Group. These
staff would receive about 3 months of in-country training organized and
conducted by the A Group; (iii) a C Group; (16,830) consisting of teachers,
assistant teachers, assistant thana education officers (ATEOs) and
evaluation field workers. This staff would receive recurrent :Ln-service
training organized by the A and B Groups throughout the projecit period.
2.19      The general plan for subsequent training of project personnel would
be as follows:
(a)  Implementation staff would have only periodic training after an
initial period of intensive training conducted during the latter
part of 1980. However, implementation staff members included in
the A group would be responsible for managing and performing
training of other groups in conjunction with the remainder of the
A group;
(b)  Teacher Trainers.  The Teacher Trainers who are chosen to be
members of the A group would train the remaining members in the B
group for about two months within one or two months of the
completion of the A group training session. The training could be
done in either one group at a central location or in two groups.
The two groups would be (i) AFE staff; and (ii) the eight PTI
staff brought together. These groups would receive recurrent
training annually throughout the project period;
(c)  Administrators.  This category of trainers is divide!d into two
groups. (i) DPE staff and PEOs, TEO and ATEOs. The more senior
staff would receive short familiarization training to cover
project objectives and procedures, at three two-week: periods early,
midway and near the end of the project;
(d)  Supervision.  The 250 ATEOs would require intensive and recurrent
training in view of their major role in the success of the project
and the fact that their positions are new to the educational



- 22 -
structure. A period of about four weeks of training, at the
Regional Project Unit (RPU) level would be needed before or very
early in the project period and covering the duties and practices
of ATEOs in working with the headmasters, tea-hers, and parents of
their areas. Specific content would include in-service teacher
training, ways to induce enrollment and attendance and improve
school/community relations and reduce teacher absenteeism.
Regular training of ATEO would be on a quarterly basis in about
four-day sessions throughout the project period;
(e)  Evaluation Staff.  The evaluation staff from the A group would
train the approximately 25 remaining professional evaluation staff,
beginning immediately after the A group training period. Training
of field assistants would be conducted by the entire evaluation
staff before field data collection begins. Overseas training of
senior evaluation staff would be needed in such detailed topics as
achievement test construction, sampling, research design and data
processing; and
(f) Teachers and Assistant Teachers. During the project, recurrent
training for teachers would be provided as follows: (a)
Residential: Each teacher and assistant teacher would receive
about two months of intensive training on general topics conducted
by PTI instructors at PTIs; and (b) Bimonthly: Each teacher and
assistant teacher would receive three days of training every other
month on common teaching problems organized by ATEOs but usually
conducted by PTI instructors. The training content would concen-
trate on subjects that are important to learning achievement, but
are neglected in present pre-service and in-service training,
including (a) practical methods of teaching each major subject;
(b) ways to adapt the curriculum to the social and physical
environment of the pupil; (c) understanding the ways children
develop and learn; (d) elementary methods of evaluating teaching
and learning; (e) management of classrooms, especially multigrade
classes, (f) effective methods of parentteacher and community
relations. The training would include ways to instruct without
resorting to harsh discipline and ways to deal effectively with
parents and community leaders.
Project Administration, Evaluation and Experimentation (Proposed outlay
US$1.75 million for physical facilities, equipment and salaries).
2.20      Project Administration.  Under the project a Permanent Project
Implementation Organization would be established within the Directorate of
Primary Education. This Project Implementation Unit together with its



- 23 -
seven regional satelites (Regional Project Units) would manage the
implementation of all physical components and the evaluation, research and
experimentation aspects of the project. Organization, staffing and func-
tions of the PIU and RPUs are further described in paras. 4.03, 4.04, and
4.05. The project would support the construction furnishing and equipping
of offices for the Regional project units and the IMPACT experiment.
Financing would also include equipment and salaries for the key staff in
the PIU, RPUs and DPE.
2.21      Evaluation.  The evaluation of project activities is essental in
determinirng the achievement of the project objecti-ves.  For th,is purpose and
for developing evaluation and research capability of the primary subsector,
a Project Evaluation Unit (PEU) would be created within the project
implementation unit (PIU). Staff for the PEU would be drawn from the
Institute of Educational Research (IER), Human Resource Foundation (HRF),
the Foundation for Research in Educational Planning and Develc,pment (FREPD)
and the Bangladesh Educational Extension and Research Institute (BEERI).
The staff would be specially trained, and salary support and aLdministrative
costs would be financed under the project.
2.22      Two types of evaluation would be undertaken (a) summative or product
evaluation and (b) formative or process evaluation.  The major type of
evaluation is the end-of-project or summative evaluation. The purpose of this
backward look at the entire life and course of the project is to have a post
hoc overv:iew of the structure, course and achievements of the project.
Aspects of the project which will be studied in the summative evaluation
include overall project implementation, institutionalization, training and
student achievement as compared with nonproject components of the Bangladesh
primary edlucation system. In particular, answers to the following five
questions would be sought.
(a) the extent to which (i) provision of uniforms and (ii) increase in
female teachers aids the enrollment of girls;
(b)  the extent to which increased training of teachers results in
improved pupil achievement;
(c) the extent to which improved supervision reduces teacher
absenteeism;
(d) the extent to which increased contact between parents and teachers
results in greater enrollment and less dropout (especially of
girls); and
(e) the extent to which costs can be reduced through use of assistant
teacher assistants and movement toward larger class and school
sizes.
This evaluation would have implications for educational policy decisions in
Bangladesh .



- 24 -
2.23      Formative evaluation will provide continuous corrective
information during all stages of project development, so that changes in
methods and procedures can take place without undue expenditure of human and
fiscal resources. This evaluation will be decision-oriented and designed to
answer specific questions such as the following:
(a) what elements of the teacher training syllabus need further
emphasis in the materials?
(b) should any administrative procedures be changed in the design of
subsequent training programs?
(c) should additional skills be specified for any part of the syllabus?
(d) are entirely new teaching and supervisory programs required, and
if so, how must they be structured?
2.24      In almost all cases, the school would be the unit of measurement
but data would be aggregated to produce statistical information for thanas
and districts. Control schools (and thanas) outside the project area would
be used for comparative purposes. During negotiations the Government agreed
that it would prepare and send to IDA for comment (a) before the start of
the first school year a report on baseline measurements and results
achieved; (b) detailed annual reports on results of project experimentation
within four months of the end of each school year; and (c) at the end of the
project a draft comprehensive report showing the results of the project.
2.25      Experimentation: Project IMPACT.  One of the major objectives of
the project is the reduction of primary education costs (para. 2.01(d)). In
Bangladesh where the student-teacher ratio is approximately 50:1, teacher
salaries account for over 98% of total primary education recurrent expen-
diture. As enrollment is expected to increase by 35% in the next five
years, measures to reduce the burden of teacher salaries on the budget have
to be tried. Project IMPACT is a radical way of reducing the pressure of
teacher salary costs on primary education recurrent costs. Project IMPACT
differs from conventional systems because it relies on the use of programmed
teaching and programmed learning materials without the direct intervention
of teachers. Teachers (instructional supervisors) act as guides, monitors
and managers and coordinate the work of aides and other community parti-
cipants to achieve a cost effective ratio of student to teachers of up to
100:1. The programmed learning material is also suited for out-of-school
youth and adults who desire a primary school education. Evidence in two
project IMPACT experiments (Philippines, Indonesia) has shown that on the



- 25 -
average pupil achievement surpasses those in the conventional system by
25%-40% and unit costs reduced by as much as 40%./1 The project would
support construction, furniture and equipment for 18 schools (out of a
control ofE group of 34) to undertake an experiment with the IMPACT system.
This would entail conversion of existing facilities at 18 s' ools, building
a community learning center (one large multipurpose room) and covered
classroom kiosks.
Technical Assistance (Proposed Outlay US$1.93 million)
2.26      Technical assistance would be required mainly in three areas:
(a) general project advisement and the planning and organization of training;
(b) evaluation and (c) IMPACT experimentation. Altogether the technical
assistance would include: (a) about 14 man-years of expatriate specialist
services; (b) about 50 man-years of local consultant services.; and (c) about
220 manmonths of fellowships mainly in evaluation. Costing is based on
US$6,250 for one man-month for expert services and US$700 per man month for
local consultant services. Fellowships are costed at US$2,000 per man month
(Annex 5).  Advisors in evaluation, experimentation and training would work
in teams to provide continuing assistance to local staff. The majority of
local technical assistance would be in evaluation and would involve staff of
universities and education research institutes serving as project
researchetrs. Local technical assistance would be made available for
planning and administration of Training. To avoid delays experienced in
earlier education projects, signing of contracts for technical assistance
with acceptable TA agencies/firms would be a condition of credit
efectiveness.
Project-Rtelated Studies (Proposed outly US$0.25 million)
2.27      The project would finance 4 studies which are directly related to
the project and essential to further investments in the Primary Education
subsector. These studies are intended to assist in the development of a
Curriculum Development Center, a National Institute for Education
Administration and Management, and a reorganized system for the production
and distribution of textbooks. The fourth study would examine all aspects
of education costs and financing, and suggest cost reducing measures.
During negotiations the Government agreed that the studies wciuld be carried
out in accordance with Terms of Reference agreed between the Government and
the Association.

3.02      Base Cost Estimates refer to April 1980 prices, and were calculated
on the following basis: Construction costs - on facilities of a similar
nature recently completed in Bangladesh, ranging from US$5.20/sq ft for simple
functional primary schools to about US$12.00 sq ft for teacher training
institutions and multi-story structures. Equipment and Furniture on
preliminary equipment lists of reasonable scope and costs, and minimum
furniture requirements. Textbooks - on the price of school books currently
available in Bangladesh, ranging from 6.00 Taka (US$0.39) for Grade 1 to 28.00
Taka (US$1.80) for Grade 5 books. School Uniforms for Girls - on government
estimates ranging from Taka 55.00 for Grades 1 and 2, to Taka 100.00 for
Grade 5. Staff training - on a detailed breakdown of training requirements
including travelling allowances and stipends. Experts. costs at about
US$6,250/man-month for foreign experts and US$700/man-month for local experts.
International fellowships - at about US$2,000/man-month.  Architectural
Design Services - on acceptable national practices, varying from 3% to 8% of
estimated costs depending on type of building and degree of repetition. It is
assumed that agreements would be negotiated on a fixed fee basis for design
services and on a man-month basis for construction supervision. However, for
simple works, basic design and supervision could be done by in-house PIU
staff.  Salaries - on applicable government scales and allowances (range
US$15-130 monthly).
3.03      Customs Duties and Taxes.  The total amount of local taxes (levied
on imported materials) is estimated at about US$8.00 million. Government
purchases of instructional equipment and training materials are normally
exempt from taxes.
3.04      Contingency Allowances (Annex 8).  Physical contingency of 10% has
been added to the base line cost of civil works, furniture and equipment, and
5% for all other categories of expenditures totalling about US$2.89 to cover
unforeseen factors. A total price contingency of US$13.85 million has been
included to cover expected price escalation in accordance with the
implementation schedule at the following annual percentage rates:

Foreign Exchange Component
3.05      The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$15.79 million, or
about 362% of the total project cost net of customs duties and taxes.
Customs duties and taxes imposed on imported goods would be borne by the
borrower. Based on detailed analysis of expenditures in simiLar projects in
Bangladesh, the foreign exchange component for the main expenditure categories
has been estimated as follows: (a) recurrent expenditures and local staff
training 10%; (b) civil works, furniture, local experts and girls' uniforms
25%; textbooks and charts 60%; equipment 85%; international experts 90%; and
overseas staff training and fellowships 98%.
Financial Plan
3.06      The total net project cost of US$44.42 million equivalent would be
financed as follows:
(a) the proposed IDA credit of US$40.00 million would cover 90% of
total project costs net of taxes and duties (100% of the foreign
exchange costs and 85% of local costs); and
(b) the Government would finance the remaining net costs of US$4.42
million (10% of total project costs), and an estimated US$8.00
million in taxes and duties.

Recurrent Cost Implications
3.07      By 1985, projected annual recurrent costs for primary education in
the 40 thana project area would amount to Tk 176.7 million (US$11.4 million).
Additional annual recurrent costs (salaries, textbooks and uniforms) would
amount to Tk34.6 million (US$2.2 million). The remaining costs (US$9.2
million) would cover the salaries of regular teachers (23,500). In 1979,
recurrent costs for the 40 Thanas represented about 9% of total primary edu-
cation expenditures, and less than 0.5% of total education expenditures.
In 1985, Tk 176.7 million would represent about 13% of total primary education
expenditures and about 2% of total education expenditures, if such expendi-
tures remained at the 1979 levels.



- 31 -
3.08      The almost three-fold increase in annual recurrent costs for the
40 Thanas from Tk 63.5 million in 1979 to Tk 176.7 million in 1985, is
significant and raises the question vhether Bangladesh can afford to
replicate this program in the remainder of the country.  In the project area
recurrent cost per primary student would increase from TK 86.18 (US$5.56) to
TK 107.0 (US$6.90). If the program is replicated country wide, by 1985
recurrent expenditures on primary education would reach TK 1,391.0 million
(US$89.7 million).  Should expenditures in the other education subsectors
(secondary, higher) continue to grow present rates (15% p.a.), then total
education expenditures' share of the recurrent budget would jump from 13.2%
in 1979 to 19% in 1985./i This increase is rapid, but priorities in other
sectors will militate against education increasing its share of recurrent
expenditure to this degree in the 1980-85 period.
3.09      However, since the Government has given the highest priority to
primary education in the education sector, it could be assumedL that the rate
of expenditure in the other subsectors will gradually decline over the
period, to reach about 7% p.a. in 1990.  In this circumstance, recurrent
education expenditure would reach about 15% of the recurrent budget, and
expenditures on primary education would take about 55% of total education
expenditures. These levels are feasible, and would only be slightly lower
than the median for developing countries.
/1  This assumes that Government recurrent expenditures to GP would increase
gradually from 7.8% in 1979 to 10% in 1985 and thereafter; and a CDP
growth rate of 4% p.a. for the 1980-85 period.

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation
4.01      The project would be implemented over a period of about six years
after the date of credit effectiveness including six months for completion
of payments and withdrawals from credit account (Annex 9). This estimate is
based on the MOE's existing capacity to administer civil works of this scale,
and is phased to reduce risks of delay. The School Management Committees, and
field education officers are also expected to undertake responsibility of
implementation at the local level.
4.02      Administration.  The first IDA-financed project in Bangladesh
(Credit 407-BD) suffered implementation delays of about 2-1/2 years. Efforts
in the Second Education Project (Credit 621-BD) to strengthen implementation
capacity and to avoid repetition of earlier experiences have been partially
successful. These included establishment of a revolving fund facility,
specialized training of project staff (Bank sponsored implementation seminar)
and intensified project supervision. In this project further measures would
be introduced and would include appointing higher caliber implementation
staff; maximizing services from architectural consultants, building up the
in-house capabilities of the Project Unit Staff for continuous maintenance and
upgrading of existing facilites; and early signing of contracts with technical
assistance agencies and architectural consultants.
4.03      The project seeks to build a permanent and improved implementation
capacity within the primary education subsector. For this reason, emphasis
has been placed on the organizational structure of the implementation unit and
on its functions in relation to the proposed Directorate of Primary Education
(DPE) and to regional authorities. A central (PIU) and seven regional project
units (RPUs) would be required./l The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would
be formed under the direction of the Director of Primary Education who would
assume overall responsibility for project implementation and would be in full
control of all project activities. Staffing of PIU would include one deputy
and one information officer, three section chiefs in charge of training
programs, evaluation and research, and physical implementation. Each of these
sections would be adequately staffed with qualified personnel: specialists,
engineers, procurement officers, accountants and field staff, and would also
receive technical assistance from a variety of expatriate and local experts
financed under the technical assistance component of the project.
4.04      At the subdivisional level, the RPU would be placed at the PTI
campus and headed by a Regional Project Director. These units would act as an
extension of the central PIU and would function as a coordinating unit for all
project activities at the subdivisional level, including evaluation and
/1 Since two of the project subdivisions are contiguous, one RPU would
suffice.



- 33 -
research, training, as well as physical implementation. In addition, the
RPUs, in collaboration with the TEOs, ATEOs and the School Management
Committees;, would provide feedback through submission of progress reports to
PIU. Key PIU and RPU staff would be appointed by September 1980. Special
training would be initiated before the project becomes effer live so that key
staff would be in position when funds become available familiar with their
specific tasks and understand how they relate with and would be the overall
implementation organization of the PIU. Since this project is covering a
large and noncontinguous geographical area with many minor works at the school
level, the School Management Committees are expected to play an active role in
the implementation of works relating to their respective schools. The
committees would commission local artisans for making school furniture and
construct:ing minor civil works. In addition, the Committees would assist in
the distribution of textbooks and uniforms. Technical supervision would be
provided by the RPUs whenever necessary.  Staffing pattern and organization of
project implementation units is shown in Annex 10.
4.05      Duties and Responsibilities of the PIU.  The duties and responsi-
bilities of the PIU would cover all physical execution and educational
development aspects of the project and would be responsible for coordinating
the activities of all government agencies involved in the projlect. Its
functions would, in particular, include the following:
(a) coordination of all RPU activities;
(b) assisting RPUs in all aspects of implementation;
(c) recruiting specialists;
(d) establishing an intensive information system aimed at dissemi-
nating project accomplishments outside and within the project;
(e) selecting, briefing and entering into agreement witlh consultants
and specialists;
(f) organizing and administering technical assistance, fellowships and
staff training programs;
(g) preparing Project proformae for all components requiring approval
of the Planning Commission and ECNEC;
(h) assisting and supervising in the preparation of architectural
designs, masterlists of equipment and furniture and bidding docu-
ments and submitting them to the Association for review;
(i) experimenting in low cost school construction, and application
of strict cost control in project components;



- 34 -
(j)  planning, programming and monitoring project progress and preparing
implementation schedules;
(k)  reviewing reports, plans, specifications and other material related
to the project;
(1)  calling and evaluating bids and award contracts for civil works,
equipment, furniture and training materials with assistance from
relevant consultants and the school management committees;
(m)  supervising construction of buildings and delivery of installation
of equipment and furniture with assistance from TEOs and school
management committees,
(n)  making payments against project expenditures, operating the
revolving fund and preparing withdrawal applications;
(o)  ensuring timely and adequate flow of funds from the center to
the subdivisions;
(p)  maintaining project accounts;
(q)  communicating with the International Development Association
(IDA); and
(r)  preparing Quarterly Progress Reports.
4.06      Since this would be the first IDA project handled by the new
Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) in the Ministry of Education, it would
be necessary during the initial implementation period to provide training to
project staff, particularly on documentation and procurement, and the planning
and scheduling of critical activities.
4.07      At levels outside the PIU and DPE, the project would seek to
strengthen implementation capacity with particular reference to training,
research and evaluation activities. Generally, the seven RPUs would: (a)
organize selection of field personnel (assistant teachers, teachers, learning
coordinators and supervisors); (b) conduct pre- and in-service training
courses; (c) organize (in collaboration with the central PIU) all activities
related to educational research, evaluation and experimentation; and (d) be
responsible for procurement of civil works, local procurement of furniture and
equipment and provision of supervision services. Improvement of project
implementation capacity is an important objective of the project and RPUs
would therefore be established on a permanent basis so that they could
implement future primary education projects. The regional project director of
each RPU would be a specialist in the field of education, and his deputy in
construction. The seven RPUs would be staffed as shown in Annex 5.



- 35 -
4.08      IDA Review and Approval.  Preliminary designs and cost estimates of
all the buildings under the project, including master lists of- furniture and
equipment and all other items to be procured would be sent to the Association
for review and would take into account the comments of the Association before
proceedir,c with procurement. Review of bid evaluation documents would be
required prior to the award of civil works contracts exceeding US$200,000
equivalent and for any equipment, furniture and learning matereials contracts
exceeding US$50,000 equivalent.
4.09      Revolving Fund.  As a condition of credit effectiveness, the
government would establish and maintain a revolving fund of Tk 500,000 in a
commercial bank to be used exclusively to make prompt payments in Takas for
expenses of items on the project excluding: salaries of additional staff and
import duties and taxes for all imported items. The revolving fund would be
replenished at least once per month to maintain a minimum deposit of Tk
500,000. The project director would be authorized to make withdrawals from
the revolving fund to make such payments.
4.10      Technical Assistance.   The existing in-house technical staff of the
DPE would be unable to cope without the services of private architecture firms
for the iphysical components of the project and local and expatriate experts
for the training and evaluation and research components. Therefore, the
proposed project would include financing of consultants' services for planning
design and general project advisement in both physical and educational aspects
of implementation. The qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment of these consultants and experts would be subject to Bank review.
4.11      Research and Evaluation.  Implementation of research and evaluation
would be the responsibility of a specialized unit located within the PIU.
Project research contracts are expected to be arranged with LER, BEERI, FREPD
and other research agencies. The Government has agreed to prepare a prelimi-
nary plan for evaluation and develop a related plan for technlical assistance
by negotiations. These plans will provide guidance to the uniits responsible
for implementation.
4.12      Building Design.  Most school buildings in rural areas appear simple
and primitive.  However, in many cases despite their superficial simplicity
buildings have been proven to be wasteful and inadequate, perpetuating methods
and teclniques adopted during different economic, social and political condi-
tions. Because present models do not appear to satisfy all aspects of
functional and economic design, the Government provided assurances that the
PIU in consultation with the Association and consultants if necessary would
study various design alternatives, taking into account the implications of
such schtool facilities on a national scale. The main objective would be
strict cost control, simplification of implementation and inLvolvement of the
local community in the management and financing of these operations. The
study would be forwarded to the Association for its comments by December 31,
1980.

4.13      Adaptation of recommendations arising out of the above study and
developing project design would be the responsibility of the engineering
section in the PIU. In order to avoid overburdening PIU staff, it may be
necessary to hire private architectural consultants for the preparation of
working drawings, specifications and bidding documents and for providing some
top supervision and planning of construction activities.
4.14      School Location Planning and Site Selection.  Criteria for selection
of project school sites were developed following the school mapping exercise
which was undertaken by the Ministry. Further refinements primarily aimed at
determining even classroom distribution on the basis of population density
would be carried out before the project becomes effective.  Most project
schools are existing and the sites of these schools are generally considered
suitable. In cases where schools are in a delapidated state they will be
replaced with suitable new buildings. Sites for the RPUs exist at the PTI
campuses. Similarly the office accommodations for the ATEOs would be
constructed at the existing Thana Development Centers. Therefore, at this
stage, it is assumed that very few new sites would be necessary for
acquisition and only in cases where existing school sites are considered too
close to each other, there may be a need to consider acquisition of a new
site.
Procurement
4.15      Construction of several schools would normally be tendered as one
contract, but these contracts are nevertheless not expected to exceed
US$50,000 each. Previous experience with education projects in Bangladesh
indicates that the small size of contracts for civil works and furniture, the
geographic dispersion of sites and the competitiveness of the local construc-
tion industry would preclude any meaningful foreign competition in the bidding
process. Contracts for civil works and furniture (totalling about US$28.0
million including contingencies) would therefore be awarded on the basis of
locally advertised competitive bidding in accordance with government
procurement procedures in which foreign firms would be allowed to participate.
Direct labor ("force account") managed by the School Management Committees and
the RPUs would be used at about 10% of project sites or wherever appropriate
for all minor works and repairs, especially fabrication of furniture, to test
whether such methods would be more economical than contract awards (about
US$3.0 million including contingencies). The success of this test would be
monitored by supervision missions and would be expanded or discontinued
accordingly. Self-help construction would be explored by the PIU wherever
conditions are condusive for such methods. Because of the small size of most
civil works contracts, prior IDA review of contract awards would not be
required.
4.16      Contracts for equipment and vehicles exceeding US$50,000 (in aggre-
gate about US$2.13 million including contingencies) would be awarded on the
basis of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
procurement guidelines. Local manufacturers participating in ICB would be



- 37 -
given a preferential margin of 15% over competing imports, or the existing
rate of import duties, whichever is lower. Contracts for equipment and
vehicles which cannot reasonably be grouped in packages of US$50,000 (in
aggregate about US$0.40 million including contingencies) could be awarded
without prior IDA review on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally in accordance with local bidding procedures. Where competitive
bidding is inappropriate, or is not expected to yield lower prices than local
shopping, sundry equipment could be procured by soliciting at least three
price quotations subject to maximum value of US$15,000 for eac'h such contract
and an aggregate total of US$0.10 million. Textbooks (US$3.72 million
including contingencies) and girls' uniforms (US$3.57 million including
contingencies) would be procured in accordance with standard government
procedures, on the basis of local competitive bidding. The manufacturing
of the girls' uniforms would be contracted to local women through the
School Management Committees after establishing reasonable prices.
Disbursements
4.17      The proposed credit of $40.00 million would cover 90% of total
project costs net of taxes and duties (100% of foreign exchange costs and
85% of local costs). Expenditure and disbursement forecasts is presented
in Annex 11. The Closing Date would be December 1986. Disbursements would
cover the following:
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported building materials,
equipment and furniture;
(b)  100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured building
materials, equipment and furniture;
(c) 100% of the expenditures on expert services and consultants
(local and foreign), overseas fellowships and special studies;
(d)  80% of the cost of building materials, equipment and furniture
procured locally;
(e) 80% of local expenditures on civil works including building
materials procured locally and on related design and
supervision services for civil works;
(f) 80% of expenditures on school textbooks;
(g) 80% of expenditures on school uniforms for girls;
(h) 80% of expenditures on staff training; and
(i) 80% (average) of expenditures on incremental staff salaries on a
declining basis as follows:



- 38 -
100% of total expenditures incurred for operations during CY 1981
90% of total expenditures incurred for operations during CY 1982
80% of total expenditures incurred for operations during CY 1983
70% of total expenditures incurred for operations during CY 1984
60% of total expenditures incurred for operations during CY 1985
4.18      Documentation.  Since construction of a large number of small
schools (about 1,300), salaries of a large number of individuals (880) and
travel and stipends for 17,120 trainees are being financed in this project,
special arrangements would be made for recordkeeping. The PIU would maintain
a file for each project school receiving assistance in development of physical
facilities. The file would be available for inspection by IDA's supervision
missions. Each file would include: (a) the completed educational/architec-
tural brief; (b) the layout plans; (c) bids received; (d) bid analysis and
contract recommendation and award; and (e) details of expenditures. Disburse-
ments for civil works carried out by force account and by contracts of less
than US$5,000 equivalent would be made against statements of expenditures
prepared by PIU and RPU staff (total expenditure about US$3.0 million includ-
ing contingencies). Similarly, disbursements for local training and local
salaries (including honoraria and allowances) would be made against statements
of expenditure prepared by the RPUs (total about US$4.4 million including
contingencies). All statements of expenditures would be certified by PIU; the
documentation for which would be audited and retained for review by IDA
supervision missions. All other disbursements would be made against full
documentation.
4.19      Accounts and Audits.  All agencies involved in project implementa-
tion would prepare and maintain separate project accounts in accordance with
sound accounting practices. Such accounts, together with disbursment docu-
ments, would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.
The PIU would consolidate accounts from the various agencies and submit to IDA
within six months of the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited
accounts together with auditor's reports. The audit report would include,
inter alia, a statement verifying that funds disbursed by IDA against
statements of expenditures had been used for the purpose for which they were
provided.

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Primary Education
Benef its
5.01       The proposed project is expected to lead to improvements in
primary edlucation in terms of access, efficiency, learning achievements and
cost reductions. In the project area (about 10% of the country) access to
primary education would be extended to an additional 75,000 boys and 100,000
girls, most of whom would not have entered Grade 1 without the project.
Moreover, as a result of measures taken under the project the current
dropout rate of over 60%. between Grades 1 and 5 would be expected to fall to
less than 20%. Consequently, an additional 60,000 boys and 80,000 girls
would complete Grade 5 instead of dropping out. In educational terms and
without the project, only about 40% of boys and 20% of girls would achieve
literacy /I; with the project, these figures would more than double, with
gains for girls proportionately greater in keeping with the intent of the
project and government policy.  The project is expected to lead to qualita-
tive gains in pupil achievement, not only in terms of literacy, but also in
respect of numeracy and a greater understanding of science and social studies
relevant to village life. Starting with the achievement test developed and
administered during the first year of the project, the evaluation element of
the project would provide a means to measure these gains periodically during
the project period with a view toward mid-project corrections and additions.
5.02       The project is expected to retard an inevitable trend toward higher
aggregate recurrent costs caused by population increase, greater access and
reduced dropout by use of larger class and school sizes and a limited number
lower-paid assistant teachers. A small experiment with the use of Project
Impact (which has proven effective in reducing unit costs elsewhere) is also
included.. The expanded level of supervision, while it adds slightly to
costs, is expected to contribute to more effective utilization of staff and
facilities, and improve the system as a whole.
5.03       While the above benefits would be realized only in the project
area, the fundamental justification for the project would be the
contribution it would make to making the process of national UPE more
efficienit and economically feasible. Thus, the project would benefit the
entire country by the contributions it makes to institution-building.
Project assistance to the Directorate of Primary Education and the Academy
for Fundamental Education, particularly the recurrent training of
LI  The qualitative estimates given are illustrative only since they
required broad assumptions as proxies for essential data.. The
evaluation component of the project will result in far more accurate
measurement on which to analyze proj ect outcomes.



- 40 -
administrators and managers of the primary subsector would ensure national
coordination thereby enabling a more efficient use of scarce resources. The
assistance to the teacher service and the new system of supervision would
effect the entire nation as these systems are replicated. Finally, the
establishment of a Project Evaluation Unit as a permanent part of the DPE
would develop a national evaluation capability and would enable the
Government to base future investments in the primary subsector on tested
interventions.
5.04      Ultimately, the success of the project must be measured by the
benefits of primary education to the individual and to society. Studies
in other nearby countries have revealed benefits of a more literate and
numerate populace on higher agricultural productivity, greater acceptance of
population control measures, lower fertility rates and a better understanding
of nutrition and health practices.
Risks
5.05      The project faces implementation risks.  The proposed program is
complex.  Although limited in coverage to only 40 thanas, operations will be
difficult because of poor communications in rural areas. Measures have been
taken to minimize this risk including: (a) an organization that includes
regional Project units to cover the seven administrative clusters into which
the 40 thana areas are grouped; (b) delegation of responsibility to School
Management Committee and field officers for the implementation of activities
in their respective schools; (c) provision of special training for implemen-
tation staff before the project becomes effective; and (d) provision of
technical assistance (local and foreign) for general project management and
for training and project evaluation. The high priority which Government
places on its UPE policy should also help lessen implementation problems.
5.06      There is also a risk that the impact of the project could be reduced
because of the traditional reluctance of rural parents to education of their
children, particularly girls.  To lessen this risk, the project's compre-
hensive training program would prepare project personnel, particularly
supervisory staff, for involving parents and the community in the
educational process so as to help change traditional attitudes. In short,
although the risks under the project would be comparatively high, the extent
of the potential benefits are even greater and make the project worth
implementing.

6. AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01      During the negotiations, the Government provided assurances on:
(a) the selection criteria for ATEO's (para. 2.11); (b) the schedule for
the submission of evaluation reports (para. 2.23); (c) the p.eparation of
project-related studies (para. 2.27); and (d) the preparation of a study
examining various alternative methods of primary school construction
(para. 4.1.2).
6.02      In addition to the usual conditions, completion of the following
activities would be conditions of effectiveness of the credit:
(a)  approval of the Project Proforma;
(b)  the selection of A Group Training and evaluation staff
(paras. 2.19 and 2.23);
(c)  the signing of technical assistance contracts with aLcceptable
technical assistance agencies or firms (para. 2.25); and
(d)  the establishment of a revolving fund (para. 4.03).
6.03      With the above assurances and conditions, the project constitutes
a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$40.0 million to the Government of
Bangladesh for a term of 50 years including a 10 year grace period.
