FOURTH (PRIMARY) EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1054-BD1
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth
(Primary) Education Project in the People's Republic of Bangladesh, for
which IDA Credit 1054-BD, approved on June 26, 1980, provided US$40
million. Although the project closed on December 31, 1986, as anticipated,
disbw:sements against the Credit continued until February 17, 1988, at
which time a remaining balance of US$10.82 million was cancelled.
This report was prepared by a Unesco mission for the Government of
Bangladesh under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement concluded between
Unesco and the World Bank.  The PCR is baaed, inter alia, on (i) the
findings of the UWESCO project completion mission to Bangladesh in June
1988; (ii) discussions with people knowledgeable about the project; and
(iii) data from project files at Bank headquarters in Washington.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on October 26, 1989 for comments by
December 22, 1989, but none was received.

FOURTH (PRIMARY) EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1054-BI)
EAUATION SUMARY
Introftgtion
This project, the fourth IDA-financed credit for education, was
designed to assist the Government in implementing its Second Five-Year Plan
(1980-1985) for the development of education, which accorded achievement of
Universal Primary Education highest priority.   The project was initially
formulated based on the findings of a sector study undertaken during
October 1977 and subsequently prepared with UNESCO assistance.   It was
appraised in January/February 1980 and a Credit for US$40.0 million equi-
valent was approved six months later. The Credit was to cover 76% of the
total costs of the project, estimated at US$52.42 million (Taka 812.5
milllon). The project was completed in June 1987, a year later than
expected, and cost US$38.42 million (Taka 945.56 million)--a 27% underrun
in US dollar terms, but a 16% cost overrun in terms of local currency.
Although some categories, such as civil works, experienced cost overruns
because additional items unforeseen at appraisal were financed out of the
credit proceeds, the overall cost underrun was primarily a function of the
gradually declining Taka.  Uhile the Closing Date remained December 31.
1986, as specified in the Credit Agreement, disbursements continued for
work contracted prior to that date, until February 17, 1988, when the
balance of US$10.82 million was cancelled.
Oblectives and Proiect Content
The project's major objectives were to (i} increase educational
opportunities especially for girls and rural poor groups, (ii) reduce drop-
out and repetition rates, (iii) reduce unit costs in the light of financial
constraints, (iv) promote and institutionalize capacity in project
management and evaluation and school administration and management, and
(v) undertake pre-investment studies to answer questions relating to future
investment in the sub-sector.   The Project was designed to finance
(i) construction/rehabilitation of 322,750 primary school places, in
addition to the 500,000 places to be financed by the Government of
Bangladesh, (ii) in-service training for about 17,120 persons--16,890
teachers, teacher trainers and inspectors and 230 staff of the Project
Implementation and Evaluation Units, (iii) uniforms for approximately
500,000 girls, (iv) primary school textbooks for about 2.1 million pupils,
(v) bicycles for the 250 Upazila Education Officers, (vi) renovation of the
Academy for Fundamental Education and eight Primary Teacher Institutions,
(vii) an experiment with an innovative approach to learning--the
Institutional Management by Parents Community and Teachers (IMPACT) program
and (viii) four pre-investment studies.



Impl,ementation Eprec
Despite some weaknesses in project supervision (para. 2.11), proj.
ect management was satisfactory and the physical facilities were provided
as planned. The civil vorks program was extended by 18 months to facili-
tate the completion of the Academy for Fundamental Education and repairs to
some 408 project schools which had been badly damaged by hurricane. The
design for the new classrooms was generally satisfactory; however, the size
of the classrooms actually built was ten percent less than originally
planned (para. 2.12). The hostel accommodation provided for females in the
Primary Teacher Training Institute was less commodious than that provided
for males (para. 2.13). The design work was undertaken by the technical
staff of the PIU with the assistance of the architectural section of the
UNESCO regional office in Bangkok.
Technical Assistance was carried out as planned. The amount of
technical assistance was adequate and by and large the consultants per-
formed satisfactorily.   The use of local consultants provided the in-
country experience needed to complement the work of the foreign specia-
lists.  The technical assistance program gai'ceeded in establishing the
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and Project Evaluation Unit (PEU) with
trained staff and in institutionalizing in-service training programs for
teachers, head teachers and Assistant Upazila Education Officers (paras.
2.23-2.25).
The performance of IDA was satisfactory. A good working relation-
ship exists between the IDA and the Borrower. The clarity of the project
design contributed largely to the smooth implementation of the Project.
The risks were well foreseen and the precautionary measures undertaken
avoided many pitfalls which might have occurred during project implementa-
tion. However, enough attention was not given at the design and implemen-
tation stages to (i) the appropriateness of the textbooks to be distributed
to primary schools (para. 5.03); (ii) the tests being prepared to ensure
that they also functioned as diagnostic tests (para. 5.03), and (iii) the
role of the National Academy for Primary Education (NAPE) in the structure
of the primary education sub-sector (paras. 4.09 and 5.02). In addition,
during implementation more attention was needed to be devoted to the
construction program for classrooms so that the problem of irregular per-
formance of contractors could have been identified and addressed (para.
5.03). The nunber of supervision missions was adequate for the scop3 of
the Project but there was some imbalance since only five of the 13 missions
comprised educators.
Generally, the quantitative objectives of the Project were
achieved; however, its qualitative achievements could not be adequately
assessed as data for 1985 to 1987 were not available at the time of the
mission. In the project schools enrollment increased from '49,545 in 1982
to 810,812 in 1984 and enrollment of females increased at a slightly higher
rate than the national level (paras. 4.02 and 4.03). The ratio of inspec-
tors to schools has improved--from 1:100 to 1:20 because of the appointment
of Assistant Upazila Education Officers (AUEO) (para. 4.06).  The AUROs



- viii -
have been successful in improving some aspects of school supervision (para.
4.07).   Textbooks were distributed free to pupils in all primary grades
(para. 4.13).
Staff training was well planned and executed.   About 21,115
persons were trained--3,995 more than estimated at appraisal (para. 2.26).
This increase in the number was due to the addition of a well-needed train-
ing program for the 4,000 School Management Committees (SMC) chairmen who
were appointed during project implementation.
The IMPACT experiment has not achieved its objective of lowering
the unit cost of primary education; however, it is too early to assess its
effectiveness in this respect (paras. 4.19-4.22). An in-depth study of the
program should be undertaken with a view to making it respond more
effectively to the Bangladesh situation.
The four pre-investment studies were undertaken and have provided
important findings and recommendations (paras. 4.23-4.28) which MOE needs
to review within the framework of its development planning for education,
particularly in respect of its target for universal primary education.
Sustainabilitv
It is somewhat difficult to judge the overall sustainability of
the project and its benefits, given the experimental nature of some of the
measures and the long gestation period of many others. Some aspects are
very favorable, such as social demand for primary education (and therefore
for places in the facilities financed under the Project), which undoubtedly
will remain fairly high until Universal Primary Education is achieved.
Other aspects however, hinging on the Government's ability to rectify deep
seated gender imbalances to access or sustain quality improvements ini-
tiated under the project (in the areas of teacher education and teaching
practice, school supervision and enhanced learning materials) are less
certain given problematic administrative structures, high recurrent costs,
and lack of necessary inputs, such as transportation for supervisors.
Findings and LessonX
The project was a complex first attempt at improving primary
education, and it succeeded in achieving many of its short-term objectives.
Several of the lessons that emerged during the course of implementation
were also incorporated in the Second Primary Education Project (Credit
1574-BD, approved in 1985). The implementation experience of this project
highlights the value of:
(a) institution building in project implementatian and evaluation
(para. 2.04) as was done in this case;
(b) a proper relationship between project implementation capacity and
strategy on the one hand and project size on the other (paras.
1.13, 1.16 and 2.03) as under this project;



- ix -
(c) close attention to the curricular appropriateness of textt<oks
prior to their manufacture and distribution (para. 4.13) as was
not done in this case; and
(d) the teething problems of innovative experiments in education such
as IMPACT (paras. 4.19-4.22).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANMLADESH
FOURTH (PRIMARY) EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 1064-SD)
CHAPTER I
PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.01 In 1979, when the Fourth (Primary) Education Project was being discussed,
Bangladesh had a population of approximately 96 miUlon and a population growth
rate of 2.8 per cent per annum. Its population density averaged 1,675 nhabitants
per square mile, among the highest in the world. Annual per capita income was
approximately US$91 and over 75 per cent of the population lived below the
poverty line In terms of minimum caloric requirement. The national literacy
rate was about 23 per cent and the literacy rate of females was 13 per cent.
1.02 Primary education was provided In about 40,000 primary schools (about
36,000 government schools and 4,000 private schools), of which 90 per cent were
in rural arfs. Access to primary education was generally poor and there was
significantly low enrolment of girls and rural children. Approximately 30 per
cent of the primary age group (6-10 years) never entered Grade 1. High drop-
out rates and the negative attitude of parents to schooling further contributed
to the low enrolment levels. About half the pupils who entered Grade 1 dropped
out of school before reaching Grade 5. Despite the high drop-out rates, class
size in Grades 1-3 was large (about 50-60 pupils) because of the high repetition
rates. Problems of administration and management, school supervision, poor
teaching and inadequate facilities were numerous in the primary education system.
1.03 Supervision of primary education was the responsibility of the Director
of Public Instruction (DPI) in the Ministry of Education (MOE). There were three
principal levels under the DPI. The District, with a District Educational Officer
(DEO), the Thana, with a Thana Education Officer (TEO) and the school
headmaster. The small, inadequately trained supervising personnel of about
100 was expected to manage and administer primary education catering for
approximately eight million pupils. The TEO:teacher ratio was 1:400 and the
TEO school ratio was 1:100. Because of the large spaur of control, school
supervision was ineffective and teacher absenteeism was high.
1.04  mhe primary school curriculum covered seven subjects. Rote learning,
reinforced by the examinationsyi-tem, was popular and there was insufficient
emphasis on learning basic language and numeracy skills. MOE sought to improve
the primary system by revising the school curriculum and the corresponding
textbooks. Although the new curriculum was an improvement on the previous
one, it was not highly relevant to village life.
1.05 The Government Textbook Board prepared textbooks for each Grade,
but publishing was undertaken by private firms. The price of books, ranging
from Tkll.72 (US$0.76) to Tk26.29 (US$1.70), was out of the reach of most parents
and consequently many children were without textbooks.



-2-
1.06 Primary school teachers were trained in 48 Primary Teacher Training
Institutes (PTIs) which had a combined output of about 7,200 teachers per year.
The net increase in trained teacher supply, however, was only about 1,440 becatuse
80 per cent of the PTI spaces were reserved for in-service teacher training.
Although there was an adequate baiance between subject matter theory and
teaching methodology in the training programme, effectiveness was marginal
because of the poor quality of teacher trainers, teaching facilities and equipment.
The PTI staff had first degrees but little teaching experience in the primary
school and were unable to prepare their trainees to cope with the conditions
in the primary schools. Physical facilities at the PTls were inadequate - in many
instances there were no laboratories, workshops or suitable libraries and almost
no equipment and furniture was very limited. Opportunities for in-service training
existed but the training programme had shortcomings similar to those of the
pre-service programme.
1.07 In 1979 there were 186,000 teachers of whom one third were untrained.
Both the pre-service and in-service teacher training programmes therefore needed
to be upgraded and expanded to meet then existing and future demand, especially
in the light of the decision to introduce Universal Primary Education (UPE) in
1981.
1.08 The Academy for Fundamental Education (AFE)1/ was the "apex institution"
in the primary education sub-sector. It acted as a forum for examination and
discussion of the problems of primary education, and was concerned mainly with
primary teacher education, curriculum development and educational research.
Its contribution to the development of primary education was constrained, however,
by the lack of facilities and problems of quality of its staff.
1.09 The opportunity cost of education to the rural family was high because
child labour was needed, particularly during the cropping season. Parents were
reluctant to send their girls to school if they were not properly clothed and to
send younger children to schools far away from the village. Factors such as
these contributed to low enrolment, and high repetition and dropout rates.
1.10 At the time of appraisal, GOB had prepared its Second Five-Year Plan
(1980-1985) for the development of education. The new plan emphasized inter
alia (i) expanding and upgrading primary education, (ii) accelerating the growth
oFfemale education, (iii) reducing the rural-urban inequalities in education
provision, (iv) reversing the trend to divert resources from primary to post-primary
education, and (v) strengthening primary school supervision. The Universal Primary
Education (UPE) programme was accorded the highest priority and it was expected
that by 1985, 12.9 million pupils (about 91 per cent of the age cohort) would
be enrolled in primary schools. In support of UPE, GOB planned to distribute
free textbooks to 13 million pupils and free uniforms to five million girls. Under
the Second Five Year Plan, GOB planned to increase the participation of women
by filling 50 per cent of the primary school teachers posts with females. Since
trained female teachers were not available, GOB planned to employ as teachers
females who had attained only the Grade 10 level.
1/ The name was later changed to the "National Academy for Primary Education
(NAPE)"



-3-
1.11  The primary education share of total education development expenditure
(which had averaged 13 per cent between 1973 and 1980) was expected to increase
to 43 per cent of the total allocation of US$623.0 million under the Second Five
Year Plan and, at the end of the Plan period, GOB spending on education as a
percentage of GDP was expected to increase to about two per cent (from about
1.1 per cent at the start of the period), which would still be low compared with
other developing countries.
Project Pofmufain
1.12 The Project was formulated on the basis of the findings of a Sector Study
which was undertaken during October 1977. The problems identified in the Sector
Report included : low enrolment, particularly among females and rural children,
high drop-out and repeater rates and the weak administration and management
of education. In 1978, the terms of reference for the preparation of a primary
education project were prepared by IDA in conjunction with GOB. The project
preparation was subsequently undertaken by the Government with assistnce
from a Unesco team. The Credit Application was prepared by May 1979 and
a pre-appraisal mission visited Baadesh in July 1979. In order to determine
the location of schools, a school mapping exercise was started in January 1979
and completed in 1980 with funds (Taka 4,000) from the Third Technical Project
(Credit 872-BD).
1.13 GOB originally requested assistance to upgrade schools in 100 Thanas
at an estimated cost of US$100.0 million. IDA staff, however, doubted (i) the
capacity of the Directorate of Primary Education to administer such a large
project and (ii) the capability of MOE to implement relatively new ideas in such
a lrge project. It was also important that the available IDA resources precluded
any possibility of a credit of as much as US$100.0 million. In response to the
issues raised by IDA, the project was scaled down and the subsequent Credit
Application included assistance to primary schools in only 40 Thanas.
1.14 The Project was appraised in January/February 1980. Credit negotiations
took place in June 1980 and Board approval took place on 26 June, 1980. The
Credit Agreement was signed on 27 June and became effective on 1 December
1980.
Project Obiecffves and Descritim
1.15 The Project was designed to assist the Government in implementing its
programme to achieve universal primary education. Its five major objectives
were:
-    to increase educational opportunities, especially for girls and rurl poor
groups;
-    to reduce drop-out and repetition rates;
-    to reduce unit cost in the light of financial constraints
-    to promote and institutionalize capacity in project management and
evaluation and in-school administration and management;
-    to undertake pre-investment studies to answer questions relating to future
investment in the sub-sector.

y Annex 4 of the Appraisal Report states that the Project was expected to finance a
total of 6963 additional classrooms in 4,033 schools. Of this number of schools,
the Govenrment was expected to finance, from its own resources, improvements to 2,742
including the addition of classrooms in 1799 selected schools.  This inconsistency
renders it difficult to detenuine precisely what the Project objectives were in regard
to primary school improvement and expansion. However, the KR uses the wording in
the text of the Ctredit Agreement and of the Appraisal Report as the authortaftive
statement of objectives.

-5-.
1.16 Ihe strategy decided upon for carrying out project training was to
organize traiing in three groups:
(i) the "A" group comprised 70 staff drawn from the PIU and included teacher
trainers, administrators and researchers. This group was scheduled
to be trained abroad and locally, over a period of four months by local
and foreign trainers and was to be trained as trainers;
(ii) the "B" group comprised 220, including the remaining staff from the
PIU, and teacher trainers, administrators and researchers who were
not included in Group "A". These persons were to be trained in Bangladesh
by the "A" Group;
(iii) Group "C" comprised teachers, assistant teachers, ATEOs and evaluation
field workers who were scheduled to receive in-service training from
Groups A and B throughout the project period.
Project Rum and Benefits
1.17 At appraisal, the expected project benefits were identified as follows:
(i) increased access to primary education for about 75,000 boys and 100,000
girls; (ii) reduced drop-out rates from over 60 per cent between Grades 1
and 5 to less than 20 per cent; (iii) 100 per cent increase in the number of
pupils who adcieve literacy - from 40 per cent boys and 20 per cent girls;
(iv) Improved overall achievement and monitoring of the achievement through
preparing and administering achievement tests, (v) reduced unit cost of primary
education by increasing class size and employing a limited number of lower-
paid assistant teachers; (vi) improved educational management and
administration through institution building; and (vii) establshment of a Project
Evaluation Unit to support the development of a national evaluation capability,
which would enable the Government to make decisions for primary education
on the bass of research findings.
1.18 The Appraisal Report envisaged the major risk to be poor communication
in rural areas; consequently, measures taken to minimize this risk included
(i) estabslunent of Regional Project Units (RPUs) to cover seven
admiistrative clusters in which the 40 Thwaas were grouped, (ii) the delegation
of some responsibilities relating to project activities in schools to the School
Management Committees (SMC) and field officers, (iil) the provision of traing
in advance of Credit Effectiveness for the project implementation staff,
and (iv) local and foreign technical assistance expert services provided for
project management, training and project evaluation.

CHAPTER H
PROJECT BMPLEMENTATION
Overiew
2.01 The Project was scheduled for completion in June 1988, but was actually
completed in June 1987 (Annex 1), because of delays in1gompleting construction
work at the Academy for Fundamental Education (AFE)- and the major repairs
made to some project schools which had been badly damaged by hurricane in
1986. All covenants have been fulfilled. Although the standard design prepared
for the primary school classrooms was not closely followed, the Project was
satisfactorily completed. Overall the objectives of the Project were achieved
except for the school uniforms component which was discontinued in 1983. The
performance of the consultants was satisfactory, partiODlorly in the area of staff
trining.
c_anKes In the Project
2.02 The Association, at the request of GOB, agreed to transfer the sum of
US$514,000 from the "Unallocated Category" to the "Technical Assistance
Category" bringing the total Technical Assistance package to US$3.11 million.
Also, at the request of the Government of Bangladesh, the Association agreed
to finance, with Credit proceeds, the cost of civil works of all primary schools
in the Project Thanas, including those to be financed by the Government
(Table 1.1). Financing was available under the Credit because of the devaluation
of the local currency which resulted in about 60 per cent more Taka than was
foreseen at appraisal.
Project d   s        and Ii_ment
PIU staffing and Organization
2.03 According to the Dovelopment Credit Agreement, the PIU shoudd have
been established under the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE), and its Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), responsible for the management and administration
of the primary school system, should have been the Project director. The PIU
was established, but, contrary to the Agreement, the CEO was not made the
Project Director. It soon became evident that this arrangem,ent was unacceptable,
as the poor relationship between the DPE and the Project Director threatened
to retard project implementation. Consequently GOB decided to adhere to the
terms of the Agreement, accepting the original proposal of IDA, and the PIFU
was made an integral part of the DPE with the CEO as its director. Seven Regional
Project Units (RPUs) were established in order to facilitate communication and
supervision over the wide geographical area of the Project during project
implementation.
1/   Now known as the National Academy for Primary Education (NAPE).



-7-
2.04 The PIU was fully staffed by nationals of Bangladesh. The staff comprised
11 at the managerial level and 43 In the technical and professional fields in addition
to support staff (Annex 2). During the project implementation period there were
five consecutive directors with duration of service ranging from six to 24 months.
These changes, however, did not adversely affect project implementation, mainly
because the project activities had been decentralized and some major
responsibilities such as distribution of materials and site supervision had been
delegated to the staff at the district and Upazila levels. The Fourth Education
Project was the first IDA-assisted project to be managed by DPE and the project
design, therefore, provided for project staff training during the initial
implementation period.
2.05 The Project start-up was slow, partly because ti-e staff needed time to
learn and follow IDA procedures - especially those relating to procurement of
materials and equipment - and partly because of the Initial effort needed to
establish coordination of the activities Qf the head office and those of the regional
offices. Despite the difficulties in the initial stages of project implementation,
the PIU performed satisfactorily and successive IDA supervision mission reports
noted the increasing capability of the PIU in project management. Nevertheless,
one element that needs to be strengthened by the PlU is the relationship between
the head office and the field offices especially at the Upazila level. A better
understanding of the project requirements, on the part of the field engineers,
who supervised the construction, could have minimized or eliminated the cases
where the building design was not followed by the contractors.
2.06 The Project Evaluation Unit prepared eight half-yearly evaluation reports.
These formative evaluations were descriptive, providing details as to the status
of each project component. They were lacking, however, in regard to identifying
problems and possible solutions. This limited their usefulness as a basis for re-
orienting or re-organizing aspects of the project. A summative evaluation was
undertaken which covered pupil enrolment and pupiL achievement in depth, but
did not comment on some other areas indicated in the Appraisal Report (para
2.22), namely the extent to which the provision of uniforms, the Increase in the
number of female teachers and increased contact between parents and teachers,
helped to boost pupil enrolment.

Sites
2.07 Except for a few schools located in urban areas where land was scarce,
there were no problems with the selection of sites. In the case of the PTb and
NAPE, each institution had adequate land space to accommodate the new buildings.
The site selected for the IMPACT office in Tangail was sufficient for tne building
but had no room for expansion, mainly because it was shared with the District
Bducation Officers' (DEO's) office. In urban areas, where land was scarce, IMPACT
schools were established in existing primary school compounds. Such siting may
be beneficial, as the proximity of the schools allows for comparison between
the two types of educational programmes. In some instances, a primary, a
secondary and an IMPACT school shared the same site. Appropriate land
development programmes were undertaken, particularly where ground level had
to be raised to improve drainage and avoid flooding during the rainy season.

Design
(a) Primary Schools
2.08  The designs for the new classroom block and for a single classroom, prepared
by the architectural section of the PIU and sent to IDA, were not accepted by
the Association because they had not taken into consideration the various
conditions, including climatic hazards and availability of local building material,
in the various regions of the country. In order to prepare more suitable designs
a study "Alternative Building Designs for Universal Primary Education in
Bangladesh" was undertaken by the executive engineer, DPE, and the assistant
architect, PIU, as an in-service training activity under the supervision of the
principal architect of the Educational Facilities Development Service in the
Unesco Regional Office for Education in Asia and the Pacific. The report,
completed by December 1981 and accepted by both GOB and IDA, recommended
the use of standard designs and two types of construction, the semi-pucca and
the pucca (Table 2.1).

The "pucca" was to be used primarily for schools in urban areas while the
"semi-pucca" was to be utilised for rural schools. The proposal was for one building
block to house four classrooms, each with a capacity of- 50 students, with one
thru-wall in masonry and two movable dividing partitions, sub-dividing the whole
floor space Into four classrooms. Plans showing the dimensions and layout of
the classrooms were provided as well as detail drawings for partitioning, roof
ceiling and latrines. The proposed areas per classroom were as follows:
No of Pupils      Area per Pupil/
Room                Room Size               Per Class             Place

2.09 Traditionally, the minimum area per pupil place for a primary school
classroom  esgned to accommodate 50 students was 1.1 m2. The new design,
however, followed the present t'end which is to provide pupil-places in keeping
with the severely constrained financial situation of the country and at the same
time give consideration to safety and health standards, hence a smaller area
(0.67 m2) per pupil was allowed. A porch-type verandah, which allowed for better
natural lighting, was designed for each classroom.
(b)   NAPE and the PTh
2.10 The heavy workload of the Architectural Section responsible for the design
of all project components resulted in delays in preparing the drawings for the
AFE and PTms. The section was assisted by the Principal Architect In the Unesco
Regional Office In Bangkok, who carried out a physical master plan for the
development of the AVE (later on, NAPE) and the PTI building prcgammes. The
Section also secured the voluntary service of a private architectural office in
Dhaka for the design of the AFE guest house. Since the design phase was
Implemented without incurring expenses for outside professional staff, the Credit
allocation of US$0.6 milion for professional services was not utilized.
civi Wirb
2.11 The PIU supervised the construction sites up to 1984 when an Educational
Facilities Department was established in MOE. This new department, teaded
by an executive engineer (formerly head of the architectural section of the PIU),
prepared educational facilities design and co-ordinated site supervision. Unlike
its predecessor - the architectural facilities section of the PIU - it decentralized
Its operations and assigned assstant engineers at the district level and junior
engineers under the Upazila where each one was expected to supervise between
80 and 100 sites. The large number of sites to be supervised by each engineer
in conjunction with the lack of transportation, resulted In most sites being poorly
slupervised. mhe shortage of vehicles was recognized by IDA as a shortcoming
of the project design and the matter was addressed under the second Primary
Education Project (Credit 1574 BD).
(a)   Primar Schools
2.12  The classoms were not built according to the dimensions of the standard
design (Annex 3). The classrooms were 31.3 m2 or 3.5 m2 (10 per cent) less than
the 34.8 m2 proposed by the design. According to the PIU, this reduction resulted
in a saving; however, it was not possible, at the time of the completion mission,
to ascertain the extent of any resulting saving or its effect on the accommodation
of 50 pupils. Built-in chalkboards and display boards were not provided; and
in many schools small pieces of board or cardboard, being used as chalk boards,
were tied to window frames where they blocked both natural lighting and
ventilation. In many schools the timber shutters were kept partialy closed in
order to prevent draughts, especially during the rainy season, and this reduced
the natural Ughting. Generally, natural lighting in the schools was poor and no
electricity was provided on the school premises. The movable wooden partition
in the design was not provided and instead the claoom partition comprised
a bamboo mat fixed to two steel posts and this provided inadequate sound
insulation. Under the Second Prinary Education Project (Credit 1574-BD),
however, all partitions between classrooms are being constructed with brick.



- 10 -
(b)   The AFE and the PTs
2.13 The "pucca" type construction was utilized for the new buildins because
it allowed for the construction of two or more storeys and reduced maintenance
cost to a minimum. One PT7 buitldng had serious structural defects which needed
immediate attention. The provision of hostel space differs for males and females
with respect to area per trainee; the male hostels provided enough space in
each room for two single beds while the female hostels provided smaller rooms
with double bunks. There was no obvious rational explanation for this.
Furthermore, the females in the PTls are required to wear saris which are not
convenient for climbing ladders, hence the females do not occupy the upper bunks.
(c)  IMPACT Classrooms
2.14 A block of three classrooms was built at each of 18 IMPACT schools.
Although the IMPACT programme required tnat the claooms be larger than
those of the traditional programme to allow for greater flexibility in class
arrangements (such as group work), in reality they were no different from the
other clasrooms in the Project.
2.15 All imported or local building materials were purchased by the PI through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) or Local Competitive Bidding (LCB)
and supplied to the contractors at the district storehouses. Storage and distribution
of materials to the contractors were time consuming for the PIU regional staff
thus reducing the amount of time available for site supervision. Civil works
were contracted through LCB. The tender packages comprised up to four schools
In proximity. Latrines and tube wells were contracted separately. Hence a
construction site had three different contractors. The above arrangements for
construction made supervision and administrative follow-up difficult and, In
1983, the procedure was changed so that the contracts awarded to the contractors
included provision of materials, latrines, tube wells and school building in the
same bid package.
2.16 The large building contracting firms in Bangladesh did not compete for
the contracts because they were not attracted by small packages on sites far
away from their operating base. The contractors who won the bids were, for
the most part, local contractors with limited experience and limited skllled
personnel. The poor level of workmanship along with poor supervison (para 2.11)
accounted for the overall average quality of construction - most of the finishes
being below acceptable standards. The tender packages for the PTI and NAPE
were larger and attracted more experienced contractors. Given the large number
of clasrooms to be constructed and the low levels of skdlls that were available
for project implementation, the Project design was faulty in so far as it lad
not included provision for a sufficiently arge and well-equipped site supervisory
team. Provision of such a team would have avoided many of the deficiencies
evident in the school buldings.
Furnitue and Equipmet
(a)   Fwniture
2.17 A simple design for the desks and benches was prepared by the Education
Facilities Department In the Ministry of Education, with some technical assLtance
from the Unesco Regional Office in Bangkok. This design utilized treated local



-11 -
timber and has resisted the rough treatment by the pupils. The flat top design
of the desks makes it flexible for two to be arranged in table form in order to
facilitate pupils worklng In smaU groups. The teachers' tables and chairs, also
made of wood, are uncomplicated and economical. A steel cupboard was provided
in each school. Although the classroom design provided for shelving between
pillars, shelves were not InstalUed in the schools visited by the mission and
indications are that they were not protmed in the other project schools.
Consequently there was no place to store books, charts and other learning materials
in the classrooms.
2.18 The furniture specifications and quantities were prepared by the PIU and
procurement was done through LCB in accordance with IDA guidelines.
Approximately 167,129 pairs of pupil desks and benches, 8,106 teachers'
tables and chairs and 1,736 steel cupboards were distributed to the project schools.
Furniture was also sent to the PIU, RPUs, AUEOs and to the IMPACT office,
NAPE as well as to the eight PTls and 18 Impact schools.
2.19 The P113 distributed 4,088 sets of teaching aids and first aid kits to project
schools. The PIU and the RPUs together received 193 sets of office equipment.
In addition, 225 bicycles, seven motor-cycles and seven jeeps were procured.
Some 14 motor-cycles had not been ordered up to the time when the Credit
Account was closed.
2.20 The majority of the learning materials, sent to primary schools, have
not been properly utilized and maintained and, in some instances, the materials
were unused, particularly the charts and the globes. Some projectors and retro-
projectors in the PTls are already inoperable and need repair and proper
maintenance. The bicycles provided for the AUEOs were inadequate for the
terrain and MOE did not provide an upkeep allowance: thuL the majority of the
bicycles were shortly out of service.
Textbooks
2.21 Textbooks were purchased by the PIUJ Ltween 1981 and 1986 from the
Bangladesh Schools' Textbooks Board for supply to the pupils free. There were
a few problems with the distribution of books to the schools in the first year
of the programme - supplies were late and in some instances, inadequate. These
problems have been resolved, but there remains a problem of over supply of books
to some Upaziles which lack adequate storage facilities. Consequently the books
are likely to deteriorate rapidly.
GirW Uniforms
2.22 During the period 1981 to 1983, 400,200 sets of uniforms were supplied
free of cost to primary school girls. This practice was discontinued, by GOB,
in 1983 because (i) the manufacturers were unable to meet the quality standards
for production of the uniforms and (ii) some principals distributed uniforms to
pupils who were not eligible for free uniforms.

Tsii iI Assitance
2.23 On 27 November 1980, Unesco signed an Ageement with GOB to provide
technical assistance (TA) in general project management and evaluation, training
and testing and measurement. The signature of an Agreement for this TA was
a condition of Credit Effectiveness - an IDA measure taken in order to avoid
previous experience with delays in recruiting consultants. Nevertheless, there
were delays. Despite this shortcoming, this large technical assistance package
was satisfactorily implemented by Unesco - 84.3 staff-years (SY), comprising
47 SY of locl consultancies (three less than estimated at Appraisal), about 21
SY of expatriate services (seven more than estimated at Appraisal) and 16.0
BY of fellowships and study tours. The increase in the number of SY -t expatriate
services resulted from the extension of contracts for advisors in staff training
and project evaluation. A summary of the technical assistance is given in
Table 2.2.

2.24  The use of local consultants provided both In-country experience (which
was invaluable for project Implementation) and some cost saving (as these
consultants cost about 11 per cent of the cost of expatriate consultants). On
the other hand, the foreign specalist generally brought more varied experience
to the Project.



- 13 -
2.25 The major outcomes of the techndcal assistance programme includedt
(i) the establishment of the PIU with a competent local technical staff and the
PEU with a local professional staff experienced in educational research and project
evaluation, and (ii) the institutionalisation of in-service training programmes
for teachers, head-teachers and AUEOs.
2.26 Trahfing was essential to the achievement of Project objectives because
(i) some project components required changes in the attitudes of parents and
teachers towards primary education, (ii) the PIU and PEU required technical
and professional staff that were not readily available in Bangladesh, (iii) about
S00 assistant female teachers and 225 Assistant Upazila Education Officers who
were to be employed were not trained to undertake their responsibilties and
(iv) the educational innovation - IMPACT - was new to the country. 'Me training
programme was well planmed and well executed. Some 21,115 persons were trained
under the project - 3,995 more than envisaged at appraisal. Training was provided
for 16,500 primary school teachers and 225 AUEOs (recurrent in-service training)
and 90 project staff, 4,000 SMC chairmen and 300 other MOE staff (Annex 4).
The incrase in the number of persons trained resulted from the addition of a
training programme for the 4,000 SMC chairmen. The number of PEU staff to
be trained was reduced, as MOE indicated that suitably qualified persons were
available in Bangladesh. Althouh some members of the P1IJ staff who had
received training under the Project have since been transerred from the PIU
to other areas of the ministry, the experience is not lost to Bangladesh, since
they are still available for consultation and for offering In-service training to
new project staff.

2.27  AU covenants have been fulfilled. There was some delay, however, in
sending to IDA the first report on the results achieved under the Project (Annex 5).

3.01 At appraisal, the estimated project cpyt (including taxes of US$8.00 million)
was US$52.42 million (Taka 812.5 million)-, of which IDA financing of US$40
million was expected to cover 76 per cent. 'me final project cost was US$38.42

in US dollar terms but 16 per cent more above it in local currency terms.

3.03  The differences in cost in US dollar and local currency terms were due
to the devaluation of the Taka during Project implementation. In local currency,
under-expenditure was evident for (i) training, because the in-ervice teacher
training programme was school-based and therefore did not incur the large cost
estimated at Appraisal, and (ii) learning materials and equipment, because many
of the items which were originally expected to be imported were procured locally
and the programme for distribution of free uniforms to girls was prematurely
terminated. Tme over-expenditure in civil works was due to (I) the repair and
replacement of schools which were damaged by hurricane; (ii) the addition of
55 schools and the escalation of material and labour costs; and (iii) the addition,
with tDA approval, of repairs to 2,742 schools which had not been included in
the originally agreed Project3/

3.04 During proJect implementation the Credit financed 967 staff positions
- 92 in the PIU, 91 in the RPUs, six In the post office, 225 AUEOs and 500 assistant
teachers. The increase in expenditure on this component was attributed to the
allowances paid to the Assistant Female Teachers (AFT) durig the last year
of project implementation.
3.05 The final disbursement was made and the Credit Account was closed on
17 February 1988 when the sum of US$10.82 million was cancelled. The sum
of US$29.18 million was disbursed - 73 per cent of the Credit of US$40.0 million
- and this covered 76 per cent of project cost as foreseen. After the first year
of project implementation the rate of disbursement lagged behind Appraisal
estimates because of the devaluation of the Taka (Annex 6).

CHAPTER I
EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES
Oveview
4.01 In many respects the Project fully achieved its objectives. Al primary
school teachers in the Project Schools received some form of training whether
in-service or pre-service. In keeping with the agreed projections, the 500 assistant
teachers, mainly females, were employed. The staff training programme, which
was the most complex aspect of the Project, was satisfactorily planned and
executed. In a few areas achievements were mixed. According to data collected,
in 42 of the 44 Upazilas In the Project, (i) enrolment increased from 749,545
in 1982 to 810,812 in 1984, (ii) enrolment of females increased from 312,815
(42 per cent) to 344,595 in 1983 then fell to 341,233 (42 per cent) in 1984, and
(Iii) attrition among pupils overall fell from 112,578 to 89,001 between 1982
and 1984 and among females decreased from 44,362 to 38,692 over the same
period. The supply of school uniforms marginally increased the enrolment of
females. The AUBOs were appointed and trained and were successful in upgrading
some aspects of school administration. Despite some problems in the initial
stages of textbook distribution, textbooks in five subject areas were distributed
free to pupils in Grades 1 to 5. All School Management Committees (SMC) were
established, although they were not all effective in managing the schools. The
PEU prepared 13 educational studies relating to the problems of primary education.
Some findins of the four pre-investment studies can contribute to the future
development of education. In one area there has been little success. There was
no significant achievement in respect of the educational experiment IMPACT.
In time, this approach to leamning may be successfully implemented, but to date
it has not achieved its major objective of lowering the unit cost of primary
education.
Access to Puimal E13atiaon
4.02  The Project provided 381,800 additional primary school places - 59,050
more than the estimate of 322,750 places given in the Appraisal Report . Recent
data on pupil enrolment were not available at the time of the mission; however,
available data covering 44 Upilas in the Project (Annex 7) indicated that between
1982 and 1984 the overall percentage increase (8.0 per cent) in enrolment in
project schools was higher than that (2.0 per cent) of all primary schools combined
(Table 4.1).

The implications are clear that the project Investment substantially increased
enrolment in the project schools. However, the achievement in actual enrolment
appears to have been well below the level expected at appraisal-2l
4.03 At Appraisal females comprised 40 per cent of enrolment. By 1982 they
constituted 42 per cent and this share remained unchanged overalL The increase
of females nation-wide was 1.8 per cent, in the period 1982 to 1984, while boys'
enrolment increased by 2.3 per cent. On the other hand, in project schools the
increase of girls was nine per cent by comparison with 7.5 per cent for boys.
Thus project schools appeared to have contributed towards improving access
of females, even though only marginally and overall below expectations at the
time of Appraisal. The sluggish growth in female enrolment is understandable
as the reluctance to educate girls is a socio-cultural problem and improvement
In this aspect will require a change in the parental perception of the education
of girls. Hence the Project design could have benefitted from a public education
programme on the importance of educating females, which would have
complemented the work of the School Management Committees (SMCs) and the
AUEOs in encouraging parents to send their girls to school.
Efforts to Reluce Drop-omt and Repetitn (Wastage)
4.04 With the objective to reduce repetition and drop-out in primary school,
the Project design included such aspects as (i) school management and
administration, (ii) school supervision, (iii) training and employment of teachers,
(iv) textbooks, (v) academic achievements, and (vi) welfare assistance (free
uniforms).
1/   Appraisal Report Table 2.1 gives projected enrolment in the 40 Thanas
(which have become the 44 Upazilas). The projected enrolment for example
was 1,022,000 in 1982 and 1,405,000 in 1984. It is unwise to read too much
into these figures in view of the problems of accuracy that stlU exist
in the data collection system.

4.05 School Management and Administration School Management Committees
(SM es), comprising representatives of communities, parents and teachers, were
established for each project school. The SMC chairmen attended a training seminar
on school management held by MOE, and, were given manuals setting out the
SMC role and responsibilities. Many of these SMCs, especially in the urban areas,
have worked closely with parer.ts, teachers and AUEOs to improve school
enrolment and maintenance. Concening the headteachers, the training provided
by the AUEOs in school administration was reflected in the way records were
organized and stored in some schools and the apparent cordial relationship between
the headteacher and the staff. However, school administration was inadequate
in a few project schools In which, for one reason or another, AUEOs have not
been active.
4.06 School Supervsion The arrangement and staffing for school supervision
improved as a result of the Project. The category of AUEO was introduced and
225 posts were created. Consequently, the ratio of AUEO to schools was 1:20
a dramatic improvement on the previous ratio of Upazila Education Officerzi
to schools of 1:100. AUEOs visit the schools at least twice per month, once
for school-based teacher training and once for general supervision. In accordance
with the agreement reflected in the Appraisal Report , AUEOs were drawn mainly
from aniong primary school headteachers. They were fairly well qualified, most
of them having at least a first degree.
4.07 So far, supervision has focused on classroom management, teacher
absenteeism and the condition of the physical facilities and little or no emphasis
has been placed on subject teaching. This shortcoming was also observed in a
study undertaken by the PEU and in a paper on teacher training written by the
education advisor to the PIU. MOE has recognized this gap and plans are being
made to include a component on supervision of subject teaching in the AUEOs
training programme. The lack of transport is a major problem, since the AUEOs
cover a wide geographical area. Finally, few women have been recruited as
AUEOs - a characteristic which seems to be insufficiently supportive of the
effort to improve the enrolment of females.
4.08 Training and Employment of Teachers It was assumed at appraisal that
NAPE would be fully involved with the training of other educational personnel
at the beginning of project Implementation, since it was mainly concerned with
teacher training, research and curriculum development for primary education.
This assumption proved wrong. Thirteen members of the NAPE staff were trained
under the project both locally and abroad; however, because of their weak
background in primary teaching and supervision, they were not equipped to take
full responsibility for the training of PTI staff and AUEOs. Consequently, Unesco
was asked to assist NAPE with planning and organizing the training programme
for in-service training of AUEOs, principals and teachers and with preparing
the necessary training materials. After overcoming the difficulties in the initial
stages, NAPE was able to produce (i) training programmes and course materials
for the PTI staff, (ii) a needs ment report on PTs, and (iii) a new procedure
for involving the PTI staff with plaming and organizing the school based "cluster"
training programme for teachers.

4.09 The position of NAPE in the overall structure of the primary system remains
unclear. There seems to be a tenuous rilatlonship between NAPE on the one
hand and the National Institute of Educational Administration, Extension and
Research (NIEAER) and the National Curriculum Development Centre on the
other and some uncertainty persists as to the future of NAPE. The staff members
of NAPE are on secondment from other institutions and, in order to be promoted,
they are required to return to their parent organization. Consequently nine
members of staff who received training under the Project have left the
organization; two members of staff have retired and, of those trained, only two
are still on the staff. It would have been beneficial to the primary school system
and ensured some stability, If at Appraisal, poliey changes were recommended
for the integration of NAPE into the overall structure of primary education.
4.10 One area of concern is the under-enrolment in the PTls (Annex 8). GOB
took the decision to select persons for attending the PTI course only from among
individuals already In the teaching service, and simultaneously limited the number
of such persons who could be drawn from the schools each year. These two
decisions combined to reduce the rate at which the PTIs could be supplied with
trainees. Of the five PTIs visited during the mission, one was fuly enrolled (206
trainees) and the combined under-enrolment for the remaining four schools was
372 - 46 per cent of the combined capacity of 800. The teacher trainees had
little access to the libraries, since they were usually locked and except In one
instance, were badly maintained.
4.11 Five hundred additional teachers (mainly females) have been employed
and are among those being trained in the in-service teacher training programme.
The teachers have expressed satisfaction with the school-based (cluster) training
provided by the AUEOs. Forty teacher training leaflets covering areas such
as class management, subject teaching and community and school involvement
have been prepared (Annex 9). Overall, the training materials are sufficient
and well prepared. The shortcoming is in the small number and variety of class
activities included in some of the leaflets.
4.12 The application of the benefits of teacher training and improved supervision
is not as satisfactory. Many of the experiences gained through teacher training
were not reflected in the classrooms. Although the teacher training programmes
emphasized the importance of lesson preparation and classroom activities, in
general the teachers lecture to young children; there are few teaching aids and
little evidence of classroom activities. There were no interest corners and very
little group work, mainly because of the small size of the classrooms (para 2.12).
Teachers were required to prepare only annual teaching plans and, in many of
the schools visited by the mission, these plans were incomplete.
4.13 Textbooks. Textbooks were distributed free to pupils; Bengali and
arithmetic in Grades 1 to 5 and social studies, science and English were distributed
to pupils in Grades 3 to 5. There are some shortcomings, however, which should
have been recognized and addressed in the initial stages of the textbook
programme. First, there are errors in the arithmetic books and some
misconceptions and incorrect sequencing in some books. Secondly, the illustraftions
in some books, especially the Grade I reader, discriminate against females. For
example, all pictures of mother and child in the Grade I reader show a boy
benefitting from the mother's affection. Many of the shortcomings of the
textbooks have been identified by MOE and are being addressed, with the assistance



-20 -
of a Unesco consultant, under the Second Primary Education Project. An important
aspect of the readers is that they integrate information on the importance of
nutrition, hygiene and the socio-economic implications of population explosion
with other topics, thus exposing young children to areas which are key to socio-
economic development in tlangladesh.
4.14 Academic Achievements In order to assess the impact of the Project
on the academic performance of pupils, achievement tests were prepared and
administered to about 2,000 pupils in 1982, and a similar number in 1985 (Annex
10). Test development, undertaken under an agreement between Unesco and
the University of Dhaka, followed acceptable procedures for item preparation
and selection. The reliability coefficient averaging 0.56 was somewhat low for
the tests administered in 1982, but the average reliability coefficient of 0.86
was acceptable for the achievement tests developed in 1985. The tests were
prepared in three core subjects - Bengali, mathematics and science. A new
test battery had to be designed in 1985, because textbooks had been changed
and the primary school curriculum had been revised after the 1982 tests.
Consequently there could be differences in item-difficulty between  the
two sets of tests.
4.15 The test results showed that in
(i) Grade 3 - pupils performed better in 1982 tharthey did in 1985; however,
the difference in performance was significant- only in Bengali;
(ii) Grade 4 - there was no significant difference in the performance
of pupils in the three subjects between 1982 and 1985;
(iii) Grade 5 - pupils performed significantly- better in all three subjects
in 1985 than in 1982.
The implications are that the Grade V pupils, being exposed to project variables
for a longer period, performed better.
4.16 Despite the desire to identify the achievement of pupils in the project,
the tests could have contributed to Icamning had they been prepared as diagnostic
tests; on the basis of the performance of pupils, the teachers could have identified
general weaknesses and prepared lessons aimed at the necessary reinforcement.
4.17 Welfare Assistance (Free Uniforms) There was no evidence that the
distribution of free uniforms contributed to a substantial increase in the enrolment
of girls. A study undertaken by the PEU on the effectiveness of the free uniform
programme in increasing the enrolment of girls showed that there was a marginal
increase in the enrolment of girls when the programme was initiated, but enrolment
decreased when some girls, although not eligible for free uniforms, dropped out
of school because they were excluded from the programme.
4.18 Conclusion Because educational investments and measures such as those
introduced under the project components require a fairly long period of gestation
before the effects are manifested, it is too early after the completion of the
Project to adequately assess Project impact. Nevertheless, the latest available
data from the PIU showed that attrition among pupils was somewhat reduced
from 112,578 (15 per cent of enrolment) in 1982 to 89,001 (11 per cent of
enrolment) in 1984 (Annex 7).

Edmtlml Jmn.vantt - IMPACT
4.19  In Bangladesh, where teachers' salaes account for approximately 98
per cent of the recurrent expenditure on primary education, IMPACT offered
an altemative teaching strategy which was intended to reduce the unit cost of
this sub-sector. Some educators claim that the IMPACT approach to education
can produce a cost effective teacher pupil ratio of about 1:100. This approach
was based on programmed learning, with lessons organized in modules developed
on the basis of the currieulum and the textbooks. IMPACT promotes peer group
teaching in the upper Grades (3-5), while for the lower Grades (l and 2) small
groups of about nine pupils learn under the direction of older pupils designated
"programmed teachers". These "programmed teachers" are taught to follow
specific procedures set out in the learning modules. An important feature of
the programme is its involvement of parents and other community members
in the learning process. These groups are invited to participate in a variety of
activities such as skills learning, gardening and school maintenance.
4.20 In Bangladesh, the experiment was implemented in three stages: (i) training
of related staff and preparation of teaching materials, (ii) experimenting with
the programme in four pilot schools, in order to identify some weaknesses and
to adjust the programme accordingly, tiii) introducing the project in 18 schools
in one district. Special consideration was given to the extent to which the
programme would improve student achievement, reduce unit cost be socially
acceptable and whether it could be replicated in other districts. Two aspects
of the IMPACT programme were modified during implementation: in response
to parents' objection to their children being taught by "programmed teachers",
teachers undertook more clssroom teaching than required under the IMPACT
plan and the learning groups were formed within the Grades, hence the
"programmed teachers" taught their peer group instead of pupils in the lower
grades.
4.21 The Assistant Upazilas Education Officers (AUEOs) and School Management
Committee (SMC) chairman visited parents in order to explain (and solicit their
support for) the programme. As implemented, the programme was more acceptable
to urban parents than to rural parents who were unwilling to participate in the
school activities. Some communities participated, however, by helping to build
sheds for the children or to maintain school premises. The modules, which were
intended to be self-teaching materials, cannot be utilized by the pupils without
close supervision of the teacher or a literate parent. This defeated the intention
to make learning less teacher-dependent. Because of this shortcoming, in
conjunction with the high initial cost of preparation and the production of the
teaching modules, the objective of reducing unit cost has not yet been achieved.
At end sf project implementation, the teacher to pupil ratio was still about 1:50
in Tangail district, where the experiment was undertaken. Compared with the
other classrooms, IMPACT classrooms were just as unattractive and teaching
aids were either non existent or scarce except for large quantities of modules
stacked in the corners.
4.22 Despite the shortcomings experience. _ far, the experiment with IMPACT
should be implemented for a few more years. The programme has been expanded
under the Second Primary Education Project; however, it is advisable that no
further expansion take place at this stage so that the current problems can be
addressed. It is likely that the low level of population literacy, particularly in
rural areas is militating against the success of the programme in its present
form. An indepth study should be undertaken with a view to modifying the
programme so that it will become more socially and culturally acceptable and
educationally more effective.

Pie-nvestmelat studies
4.23 Four pre-investment studies were undertaken in the areas recommended
in the SAR (para. 2.27): (i) Curriculum Development, (ii) Education Management
and Administration, (iii) Education Costs and Financing, and (iv) Textbooks
Production.
4.24 Curriculum Development. This study was designed to review the work
of the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) and examine its future
role in the education system. The areas investigated included the physcal
infrastructure, staffing, teaching materials, scope for curriculum evaluation
and tne relationship between NCDC and MOE. The Report discussed issues
concerning the management of NCDC and expressed concern that under the
proposed merger of NCDC with the Bangladesh School Textbook Board, textbook
development activities would overshadow curriculum development. It pinpoints
the loose arrangement between the NCDC and MOE and recommends a worldng
model which would promote a closer relationship. The Report outlines a
programme of work for the NCDC and, as a logical follow-up, discusses its
implications for staffing, physical facilities and recurrent costs. The major
shortcoming of the study was its focus on the institutional framework of NCDC
rather than on curriculum development for primary education. The terms of
reference, however, were limited In this respect.
4.25 Education Manaement and Administration. The objective of this study
was to review the operations of the National Institute of Educational
Administration, Evaluation and Research (NIEAER). The comprehensive Report
discusses key aspects of the organization including management and administration,
physical facilities, staffing and financing, and offers some 34 recommendations
for upgrading NIEAER and Improving its relationship to MOE. One of the major
recommendations is for the appointment of a Board of Governors with
responsibility to (a) formulate overall policies in respect of training, (b) oversee
the capital and recurrent budget, (c) supervise development programmes and
examination evaluation. It is not clear, however, in what manner these areas
of responsibility will dovetail with those of MOE. Another major recommendation
Is the need to improve the information base - an essential requirement for
educational planning, evaluation and research.
4.26  Education Costs and Finaning. This study was intended to examine how
to improve the financial status of primary education in Bangladesh. The Report
discusses the current low level of education expenditure overall and compares
it with that of other least developed countries. It points out the inequity of the
proportion of expenditure on primary education compared with that on secondary
and higher education. If, as the Report indicates, only one per cent of the primary
education expenditure is made on non-salary items, the situation regarding the
supply of educational materials to the schools is worse than is generally
appreciated and deserves high priority attention in the Plan for developing primary
education. In its search for sources of additional financing for primary education,
the Report recommends that the land revenue tax and student fees for higher
education be increased and the additional resources be allocated to non-salary
items.
4.27 Textbook Production. The objective of this study was to review the capacity
of Bangladesh to produce and distribute textbooks and other teaching materials
in order to meet the programme requirements of the Second Five Year Education



- 23 -
Plan. The investigation was expected to focus on (i) the role and function of
the Bangladesh School Textbook Board, (ii) the capacity of the local publishing
Industry, (iii) whether GOB should be involved in textbook printing or such an
aspect should be left to private industry, and (iv) the kind of incentives which
GOB can offer to private publishing industry. The Report presents a discussion
of the foregoing areas in depth, identifies some of the major problems and makes
realistic recommendations for improving the preparation and production of
textbooks. Its recommendation for merging the Textbook Board with the NCDC,
which appears logical, has been implemented by the Government. The study
indicates the need for additional physical facilities and for training the managerial
and editorial staff.
4.28 Conclusion. Despite a few shortcomings, all four studies have provided
findings which can be utilized by MOE in planning for the development of
education. What is needed is for MOE officials to review the recommendations,,
within the framework of the Second Five Year Education Plan and its overall
objective to achieve universal primary education, and determine which ones
should be implemented and over what period of time. The findings and
recommendations of the studies on NIEAER and NCDC should be reviewed with
a view to rationalizing the many government agencies and departments having
responsibility for various aspects of education.



CHAPTER V
IIDA PERFORMANCE
5.01 The Fourth Education Project was an Integral part of the Government
proposal to achieve universal primary education. It was generated over a two-
year period and its targets included school administration and management, school
supervision, learning materials, teacher training and physical facilities which
are traditionally expected to improve the quality of primary education. Having
invested in these key areas, IDA should follow-up the progress in primary
4ducation, in order to determine their effectiveness in improving the quality
of primary education or whether there are less obvious areas which are militating
against improvement in the sub-sector. In other words an impact evaluation
of this project slould be undertaken in a few years' time.
5.02 This Project was by and large a success because it was sensibly designed.
A very important aspect of this project design was its emphasis on developing
the local capacity in project implementation and evaluation. This example should
be followed for IDA financed projects in some other countries. There were some
shortcomings. A more precise identification of the role of AFE (later NAPE)
in the structure of primary education would have been useful (para. 4.09). At
appraisal closer attention needed to have been given to the appropriateness of
the textbooks, and provision should have been made for the recruitment of a
specialist in the area of textbook production and curriculum development.
Arrangements were aIso required for a large well equipped site supervision team
(puas. 2.15-2.16). On the other hand in the project design, the IDA demonstrated
the seriousness with which it responded to past experience with delays in technical
assistance components and required that GOB make firm arrangements for
implementing the technical assistance component as a condition of Credit
Effectiveness. An important contribution of IDA staff was the requirement
to reduce the size of the Project for reasons of management, even if other financal
considerations contributed to that decision.
5.03 Supervision by IDA was good, except that (i) enough attention was not
given to the construction of the classrooms and, therefore, problems such as
the irregular performance of the contractors (including the poor quality of finishes
and the absence of suitable chalk boards) were not identified and addressed,
aad (ii) it would have been helpful if IDA staff had reviewed the tests for the
primary schools to ensure that they served a diagnostic purpose as well (paras
4.14-4.16). Thirteen supervision missions were undertaken with a reasonable
average interval of six months. Considering that the Project had a large teacher
training component, there was some imbalance in the composition of the missions,
since only five of the 13 missions comprised educators.

CHAPTER VI
IPPIJCATIONS OF EXPERIENCE GAINED
6.01 Experience with the Fourth (Primary) Education Project highlights the
importance of:
1.   establishing a permanent structure in order for a country to accumulate
experience In project implementation and evaluation (para. 2.04);
2.   ensuring that the size of the Project Is well related to the management
capacity (para 1.13);
3.   decentralizing project management operations in a country as large as
Bangiadesh so as to meet the needs of project locations far away from
the central operating base, but at the same time ensuring that an effective
communication system is set up between the central and regional offices
and adequate transportation is provided (para. 2.03);
4.   Including in budget estimates any costs of expected additional work on
site development to render the school less prone to natural disasters,
for example, flooding (para. 2.07);
5.   including certain staff costs in the project and providing training in order
to ensure that the technical and professional expertise, required for project
implementation, are in place (para. 2.25);
6.   paying close attention to details of arrangements for project implementation
when such a large and complex project is to be implemented (para. 1.16);
7.   ensuring the appropriateness of textbooks in terms of the curriculum and
the level of education for which they are being provided before
Implementing a large book distribution programme (para. 4.13);
8.   being sensitive to the type of tests to be prepared and administered as
instruments for measuring academic achievement in order to ensure that
they also function as diagnostic tests (para. 4.16);
9.   recommending policy changes to enable an institution such as NAPE to
be integrated in the overall education system and to be given a clearly
defined role before provision is made for its expawsion (para. 4.09);
10.  continuous adjustment and re-adjustment of an innovative educational
programme over a reasonable period of time until It responds effectively
to the educational, social and ciutural needs of a country (para. 4.22).
