1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Haiti, at appraisal, was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with a majority of
the population living in extreme poverty (less than US$1 a day). With an infant mortality rate of
76 per 1,000 births, an illiteracy rate of 47 percent, and the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS
outside sub-Saharan Africa, Haiti ranked 146th of 177 countries worldwide on the United
Nations 2007 Human Development Index. Nearly one-half of Haitian children did not have
access to primary education. The public sector provided only 20 percent of the primary schools
in the country, and government spending on education was only 2.5 percent of GDP, about half
the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region average. Because 80 percent of the schools
were private, there was a financial burden on poor people who sent their children to school.
2.       The Meeting Teacher Needs for Education for All Project (Formation Initial Accélerée
—FIA) originated as a component of the first Adaptable Program Grant (APG-1) Project.
Additional resources under the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) became available
so that a separate teacher training program could be financed. Teacher training had not yet been
initiated under APG-1, so FIA was the real beginning of accelerated teacher training in Haiti.
Traditional teacher training in Haiti consisted of three years of pedagogical training in
institutions (Ecoles Normales), whereas the new accelerated training called for only one year of
pedagogical training followed by two years of student teachers working in primary school
classrooms. The FIA Project was consistent with Pillar II of the GOH Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) which focused on human development and education. The emphases of
this strategy were to: (i) reorient the education supply towards poorer students; (ii) introduce a
certification policy for teachers and school directors; (iii) improve support to schools, parents
and students; (iv) improve coordination between sector actors; and (v) increase the sector’s
financial resources.
3.      The rationale for Bank involvement was to provide better quality education services
which are essential for improving human development outcomes and in reducing poverty in the
long-term. In addition, the Government of Haiti (GOH) and the Bank wanted to achieve “quick
wins? to provide hope to Haitians who were suffering from an almost total lack of public social
services. The Project aimed to support one of the strategic pillars in the Bank’s Interim Strategy
Note (building human capital), and supported reforms outlined in the HIPC initiative and the
Strategie Nationale d’Action/Education Pour Tous (SNA/EPT).
4.      FIA extended what was intended to be a short-term program under APG-1 into a
comprehensive reform of teacher preparation. This commitment to teacher preparation was
essential if Haiti were to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Education For
All (EFA) goals. The Project was designed to meet the supply-side need for a higher capacity
and higher quality teacher preparation system, which complemented the demand-side APG-1
activities of tuition waivers and school nutrition. The APG-1 Project also facilitated the FIA
Project by addressing implementation capacity issues such as financial management. The newly
trained teachers were essential for achieving the long-term objective of expansion of both access
to and quality of primary education.
5.      Contributing to the urgency of Project preparation was that the Bank faced institutional
pressures of “use it or lose it? for the funds to promote teacher training. The HIPC initiative
required the GOH to meet certain requirements for selection of teacher training candidates. If
the Project could not be prepared before the end of FY08 and if the Project did not commit to
recruiting at least 2,750 teachers for each of three years, then the funds (US$6 million) would no
longer be available to the teacher training initiative.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
6.     The higher level national objective is for Haiti to improve access and learning in basic
education and to reach Education For All (EFA) by 2015. In order to achieve this, a greater
number of higher quality teachers is needed. The PAD states that the objective of the Project is
to support the Government of Haiti (GoH) in the development and implementation of an
accelerated teacher preparation program. The Development Credit Agreement (DCA)
inappropriately mixed elements of the higher level objective into the Project objective. For
assessment purposes, therefore, the ICR uses the PDO from the PAD.
7.      Key indicators are presented in Table 1. The indicators went beyond the output of the
training programs to include the appropriate placement of teachers to ensure improved access by
students in rural areas. There was some confusion in the PAD regarding the PDO indicators as
the Results Arrangements (p. 39) had a different set of PDO indicators than did the Results
Framework (p. 37).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
8.     There were no revisions to the PDO but a number of indicators and their targets were
revised as shown in Table 1.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
9.      The main beneficiaries were the teachers who were trained and the students who are
receiving a better education from the better qualified teachers. The planned and revised numbers
of beneficiaries included:
   •   Teachers: Original—7,500 teachers (later revised to 2,300). Actual—2,916 teachers.
   •   Students: Original—6.0 million student years. Revised—2.3 million student- years.
   •   Institutions de Formation des Maitres (IFMs) (capacity building): Original—18 IFMs.
       Revised and Actual—11 IFMs.
10.    The number of student-years is based on the assumption that each teacher teaches 40
students per year over a 20 year career. Improved quality is an added benefit because the
teachers are better trained. This increase in teacher training capacity also helps reduce excess
demand for teachers in Haiti.

1.5 Original Components
Component 1: Recruitment and Selection of Teacher Candidates
11.    The Project financed the selection of teacher candidates, including screening of
applicants through an entrance examination and review of qualifications for the teacher training
program over three years.
Component 2: Accelerated Teacher Preparation
12.     This is the main component of the Project which financed: (i) the teacher training
program; (ii) the iterative revision and piloting of curricula for formation initiale accelere
(accelerated teacher training-FIA); (iii) the recruitment, professional development and payment
of teacher educators in selected IFMs; (iv) certification and placement of teachers; and (v)
related studies and evaluations.
Component 3: Improved Management of Teacher Preparation
13.     This component financed capacity building of the Direction de la Formation et du
Perfectionnement (Department of Training and Professional Development-DFP) and other
central and local agencies of the Ministry of Education (MENFP) to better manage teacher
preparation and contribute to the implementation of the reform. The DFP led the implementation
and operational coordination of the FIA. The Direction Departementales de l’Education
(regional education offices-DDE) had responsibilities to recruit student graduates, certify
graduates and identify primary schools for practice teaching locations. This component supplied
staff training, office equipment and supplies, technical assistance and other inputs to
implementing units.




                                               3
1.6 Revised Components
14.     During the 2010 restructuring, component 1 was reduced in scope as fewer student
teachers were to be recruited into the program because of the earthquake, and because of drop
outs and a number of student-teachers failing the mid-term exam. Components 2 and 3 were
expanded. Under component 2 IFM capacity to train student teachers was strengthened through
the addition of a Pedagogic Advisor and a Practice Teaching Advisor (to begin in 2011). Under
component 3 project management was strengthened through the addition of four technical
assistants and a project coordinator responsible for leading the implementation of project
activities. The Project, however, no longer was to finance reinforcement of the Human
Resources Division of the MENFP and the Regional Education Offices-- Directions
Departementales de l’Education (DDEs), since there were not directly involved in project
implementation. Component 2 was also revised later, during the 2012 restructuring, to include
the payment of student-teacher stipends.

1.7 Other significant changes
15.    The Project was restructured twice:
  1. Level 2-October 27, 2010; percentage disbursed =$1.39m/$5.8m=24.0 percent.
  2. Level 2-April 27, 2012; percentage disbursed =$5.50m/$5.8m=94.8 percent
16.     The target for new certified teachers was scaled down in the 2010 restructuring (from
2,500 to 900 the first year and from 2,500 to 1,400 the second year) for the same reasons that the
total recruited was reduced. The planned third cohort was dropped entirely from the Project
because of earlier than planned Project close, but was picked up in the second phase of APG-2.
The closing date of the Project was moved up to June 2012 from January 2013. The 2012
restructuring also reallocated funds from category 4 (goods and non-consultant services) to
category 3 (eligible expenditures financed through Participation Performance Agreements
(PPAs) under Part 2.3 of the Project) to pay student-teacher stipends.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
17.    The implementation arrangements were based on those of the APG-1, with the MENFP
implementing the Project through technical departments, primarily the Direction de la Formation
et du Perfectionnement (Department of Training and Professional Development-DFP). A Project
coordinator was hired for FIA through APG-1. Administrative and fiduciary support to the
technical departments was provided by the APG-1 Project Technical Unit (PTU), which worked
with the Direction des Affaires Administratives (Department of Administrative Affairs—DAA)
of the MENFP. The technical team and the joint PTU/DAA administrative/fiduciary team was
supported by a Comité de suivi de la FIA (FIA Steering Committee, CS-FIA), the equivalent of
APG-1’s Project Advisory Committee (PAC). The CS-FIA was responsible for the overall
coordination of activities. Technical departments and agencies within MENFP were responsible
for implementing the Project components. The MENFP was responsible for the consultations
with non-public stakeholders and for providing sites for practice teaching.
18.    The Project design was aligned with the PRSP and aimed to achieve the PRSP objectives
through an increased supply of better-qualified teachers for which all stakeholders agreed there


                                                4
was an acute need. A major advantage of the FIA approach was that teachers are in the
classroom in the second year of the program and often teach independently in the third year; they
are actually teaching students while improving their qualifications. However, with preparation
on a compressed timetable, only five months for preparation, the Project did not have adequate
time, prior to implementation, to fully upgrade the teacher training curriculum or to build
ownership of the approach to teacher training at MENFP that could withstand changes in
ministerial leadership.
19.     The Project did take into account a major lesson from Bank experience that it is
particularly important in a fragile state that the Project design incorporate close coordination
with other donors to ensure comparative advantage for the Bank and avoid duplication of effort.
In the FIA Project, the Bank opted to focus on the training of primary school teachers, which
would address the problem of large numbers of out-of-school primary students. The USAID
addressed a different education issue by financing a much larger project aimed at youth who
were transitioning from school to employment. Similarly the Bank chose not to support pre-
primary education because the IDB was already preparing an early childhood development
project.
20.     The Project incorporated a number of other lessons into its design by establishing entry
level criteria to include high school graduation and to provide three months of instruction, Mis a
Niveau (MNA), 1 in core subjects of the basic education curriculum to student-teacher
candidates who needed it. This responded to the lesson in other Bank operations that maintained
that teacher training programs are more effective when the candidates have at least a high school
education. The Project design also provided for staff and financial resources for the supervision
and monitoring of the student teaching program. However, these resources proved later to be
insufficient and needed to be supplemented in the 2010 restructuring with the addition of the
pedagogic and practice teaching advisors.
Critical Risks
21.     Institutional. The main risk to implementation was the education sector’s limited
capacity and slow absorption which could slow Project execution. The management capacity of
some of the selected IFMs was weak. The risk stated in the PAD that “The increase in the
annual graduation rate of trained teachers will require maximizing the capacity of existing public
and non-public teacher training providers? was not adequately addressed in the initial design.
The PAD’s mitigation for this risk was that “The Project design is simple, with few components,
and provides financing to the training institutes in order for them to expand their capacity and
meet the agreed targets for graduates.? However, the Project also programmed technical
assistance in financial management. The timeframe for building this capacity was absent from
the mitigation measure.
22.     Technical. To minimize the risk of miscommunications about the teacher training and
certification program, Project preparation engaged a broad range of stakeholders. This process
was important to getting the sequence of steps in the teacher training program right. Another

 The portion of the selected student teachers who did not demonstrate adequate mastery of French and mathematics
were required to take a three-month remedial course in these subjects. After the 3-month MNA, candidates must
pass an examination to be admitted to the teacher training program at an IFM.



                                                       5
technical risk concerned the student-teacher stipends. The Bank had determined that including
stipends as part of the Project through the PPA was not a necessary incentive to participate in the
teacher training. Thus, the Project did not finance student teacher stipends. The risk that was
cited in the PAD was that the “The stipends to student-teachers may represent too large an
amount for the MENFP to sustain over the long term.? The mitigation measure for this risk was
only that “The MENFP will determine stipend amounts in consultation with the Ministry of
Economy and Finance,? which did not counter this risk in any meaningful way (see Section 2.2).
However, this risk was addressed in the 2012 restructuring when the Bank decided to fund the
payment of the student teacher stipend.
2.2 Implementation
23.    A devastating earthquake occurred on January 10, 2010 that left more than 200,000
people, 5 percent of the population dead, including an unknown number of students and teachers.
There was widespread destruction of infrastructure, schools and government buildings, including
the MENFP and IFMs. From January to June 2010 very little could be done to move the Project
forward. Implementation from January 2010 onward should be assessed in the context of this
national calamity.
24.     Under even favorable circumstances, teacher training is one of the more demanding types
of projects from an implementation standpoint. The Project also was the first dedicated program
to train primary school teachers in Haiti. The Project’s success can be attributed to the
implementation and precise sequencing of a number of activities ranging from advertising the
program through final selection of student teachers and remedial training (MNA). Sequencing
activities was especially challenging because of the capacity constraints in Haiti. To support the
timing of these steps, the TTL conducted unusually intensive supervision (“supervision plus?)
including activities, such as following up with contractors and IFMs, as well as re-evaluating the
IFMs after the earthquake. Sequencing was also made difficult because a revised curriculum
was produced rapidly prior to the start of the Project, and needed to be further strengthened and
introduced module by module as it became available.
25.     In addition to sequencing challenges, there were partnership challenges. Keys to the
success of the partnership between the MENFP and the IFMs were that both had to perform their
roles: the MENFP had to develop curricula, provide money to the IFMs, and train trainers; the
IFMs had to train and assess students. The Project branded the existing “Ecoles Normales? as
IFMs, which enhanced their credibility as teaching institutions because they were identified with
the new national program for accelerated teacher training. All IFMs signed contracts to
participate in the program, which were sent to the PCU.
26.     Although teachers were trained and certified, the partnership broke down in a number of
instances. The Project provided small civil works and capacity building to the IFMs, which did
improve their ability to carry out the pedagogical portion of the program. However, the IFMs
were not able to provide adequate supervision of the in-class portion of the student-teaching
program, though this improved somewhat with the additional resources after the 2010
restructuring. The degree of ownership of the Project from the MENFP side was not always
clear, partly a result of the short preparation time for the Project. It was also a result of the fact
that the Minister of Education changed three times during the Project, which had several
negative effects. For example, it was difficult for the Project to sustain capacity-building with
the turnover in the ministry. In addition, each minister had different positions on the new teacher


                                                  6
training approach, including: (i) the allocation of stipends to student teachers; (ii) the duration of
the training; and (iii) the process for recruiting the student teachers. Some officials in the
MENFP believed that teachers should follow the traditional route of a three-year university
degree program. The effect gave a sometimes stop-and-start quality to implementation.
27.     Project management within the MENFP did not work well in the beginning. The Project
implementation also was mistimed, with the student-teacher cohort 1 beginning its pedagogical
training in March. The March start date threw off the schedule in IFMs which had ongoing
programs of students who had begun in September. By beginning the training in March 2009,
the student teachers could not complete their pedagogical training (one-year duration) in time to
begin their practical training in September to align with the school year. The policy matrix for
HIPC obligated Haiti to go through with the March cohort rather than wait until the next
academic year. After a year of unsatisfactory implementation ratings at the beginning of the
Project, the Bank decided to recruit four consultants and one assistant project coordinator to
implement the Project to replace the previous FIA Project coordinator. The Project Coordinator
was the same person who managed APG-1). Project implementation began to improve as a
result.
28.     Stipend Issue for student teachers. A serious implementation problem was created by
the MENFP’s pledge of an allocation, or stipend, for student teachers who were taking the
accelerated teacher training. The Bank took the position that the stipend was not needed because
student teachers typically paid for their education. The MENFP maintained that to reach remote
areas a stipend would be necessary to ensure participation. The stipend was poorly implemented
because the Ministry of Planning (MOP) constantly delayed approvals for the MENFP to provide
the stipend, which had been budgeted by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Delays and
underpayment of the stipend undermined teacher morale and eventually led to a student-teacher
strike.
29.     Project Restructurings. The 2010 Project restructuring scaling down of targets was
appropriate because of capacity constraints exacerbated by the January 2010 earthquake, as was
the focus on strengthening of IFMs to ensure that revised targets were met. As documented in
the 2012 restructuring paper, the Bank avoided further implementation delays and ended a
student-teacher’s strike by agreeing to, what was viewed at the time as a “stopgap? measure, pay
the stipends. Teacher stipends were put in PPAs. This move put the teacher training program
back on track and the revised targets were met. The 2012 Project restructuring was carried out
also in the context of an overall portfolio consolidation in the Haiti education sector. Shifting
cohort 3 to APG-2 was a good move because the cohort timing could be re-set and coordinated
with the school year, and did not have to start and finish by January 2013 to coincide with the
Project closing date. Dropping cohort 3 made it possible to move the Project close date up to
June 30, 2012 (6.5 months earlier).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
30.     Design. The M&E framework was adequate for the purposes of assessing the
achievement of the PDO from the standpoint of implementing the teacher training program
through, for example, cohort completion and teacher placement. The M&E framework however
relied on intermediate indicators to adequately assess the development of a teacher training
program. Additional evidence of the development of a teacher training program was produced at
the ICR stage.


                                                  7
31.    Implementation. M&E was carried out by the Project coordinator (financed by APG I)
and the assistant coordinator (financed by the FIA Project). These coordinators had
responsibility for tracking progress related to all key indicators. The coordinators collaborated
with DFP and DDE staff and were supported by the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) specialist
from the External Financing Coordination Unit (EFCU) who supported APG I. Numbers of
teachers recruited, enrolled and graduated and certified were all tracked closely through
individual IFMs.
32.     Utilization. The monitoring of implementation was critical in making key adjustments to
the program. Project M&E revealed that teacher training targets needed to be scaled back. The
often late and non-payment of the student-teacher stipend was also tracked, but not as carefully
monitored because it was not part of the results framework. This also led to action taken by the
Bank to remedy the stipend issue in the 2012 restructuring by reallocating Bank financing to
cover it.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
33.    Administrative and fiduciary support was provided to MENFP technical departments by
the APG-1 Project Technical Unit (PTU) which worked with the Direction des Affaires
Administratives (Department of Administrative Affairs-DAA). Despite some progress in
building capacity, the overall fiduciary environment remained risky, with weak budget processes
and financial controls throughout the government, and especially in the DAA of the MENFP.
However, the Project did comply with FM audit requirements. An FM task was added with the
Bank’s decision at the 2012 restructuring to pay of the student teacher stipend retroactively to
2011. Procurement requirements were complied with, although with some delays and
implementation followed the Project procurement plan.
34.      FIA was a Category C project and no environmental assessments were required.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
35.     The first cohort of teachers was deployed to primary schools to take up their assignments
in the current 2012/13 school year. The former third cohort of the FIA program has begun
training under the APG-2. A fourth cohort is planned for 2013. APG-2 is also financing the
student-teacher stipend under a revised more sustainable schedule agreed with the MENFP.

  Although the Project was restructured twice, it is rated at two rather than three stages. The reason is that only a
miniscule amount of disbursement occurred after the second restructuring, and so the weight to a third outcome
rating would be negligible.



                                                         8
36.     Objectives. The objectives continue to be highly relevant because there is a continued
deficit in trained teachers for primary schools. With 2,916 teachers trained under FIA, another
5,000-7,000 are expected to be needed to absorb out of school students. Though adjustments
were made to the Project and to PDO indicators through the restructurings, the objectives were
not changed. The original objectives are in line with the national priority to achieve universal
primary education as articulated in the Declaration of General Policy of the Prime Minister—
May 2012 (Enoncé de Politique Générale du Premier Ministre) and the national education
strategy, the “Operational Plan for Education 2010-2015,? which calls for financing across nine
strategic themes including the provision of support to basic education. They are also in line with
strategic objective number 3 of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) FY12-13, building human capital,
by continuing the teacher training program, which improves access to primary education.
37.     Design. The key feature of the Project was the accelerated and practical approach to
teacher training. This new approach contrasted with the traditional training model of three years
of institutional training in Ecoles Normales. The design of the program ensured better quality
student-teachers because of stricter selection criteria (passing an examination, having completed
high school and MNA). The higher quality of the student teacher made it possible to reduce the
pedagogical component of teacher preparation from three years to one year. Current relevance
of the Project’s design is also evidenced by the continuation of the FIA under APG-2, with a
revised stipend formula to make the teacher training program more sustainable and aligning
cohorts with the school year. The Project design also addressed the need for improved quality
and addressed about one quarter of the need for new primary school teachers (assuming that all
primary age students were to attend school). The design aimed to achieve higher quality teachers
through an improved curriculum that was further strengthened and introduced module by module
as it became available and through the supervision of the classroom training by the IFMs. About
70 percent of teachers are still not qualified. The FIA approach will continue to be relevant even
when universal primary enrollment is eventually achieved, because there will still be a need to
upgrade the qualifications of primary teachers in both public and private schools. The design of
the program became more relevant when the teacher stipend was made part of the PPAs.
38.     An additional design factor was how the Project fit complemented other Bank-funded
education projects (APG-1 and the Emergency School Reconstruction Project—ESRP). The FIA
Project, along with ESRP (school reconstruction), dealt with the supply-side problem for primary
education, i.e., the need for more teachers and more schools. APG-1 dealt with the demand side
of helping students access primary education. The design also took into account other donor
support in the education sector to help ensure that financing was available for different aspects of
the national strategy.
39.      Implementation. The restructurings improved the relevance during implementation.
The first restructuring in the aftermath of the earthquake focused the teacher training in the more
capable IFMs, added support to IFM capacity, and scaled down teacher training targets to
realistic levels. The second restructuring improved relevance by funding student-teacher
stipends, the non-payment of which was seriously impeding the implementation of the Project.
40.     As a result, the overall rating for the Project’s relevance is substantial up to the first
restructuring, and high after the first and second restructurings. The lower rating for the first
period owes to the improvements that were needed in the approach to implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Ratings: Before Restructuring—Modest
         After Restructuring—Substantial
         Overall—Substantial

PDO: The objective of the Project is to support the Government of Haiti (GOH) in the
development and implementation of an accelerated teacher preparation program.
       a.   Development of an accelerated teacher preparation program
41.     The Project results framework allows partial assessment of the achievement of the
development of the teacher preparation program. PDO indicator 3 states that newly certified
teachers complete high school (Bac II). This criterion was actually for admission to the program
and was achieved. This criterion meant that the student teachers would be coming into the
program with at least a basic level of qualification. The Project also produced a revised
curriculum and distributed it to IFMs, trained teacher educators and produced training materials
(target met). Financial systems for transfers from MENFP/MOF to IFMs operational for 100
percent of IFMs (target met). While these were intermediate indicators, they are evidence that a
teacher preparation program was developed. The curriculum revision and the training of teacher
educators were essential features of the development of the program because the accelerated
approach was new and the existing curriculum was inadequate. Setting up the financial
mechanism was also an essential feature because the program could not be established without a
way to provide resources to the IFMs which were the implementers of the teacher training
program.
42.     As additional evidence of the PDO, the ICR observes that the Project achieved a
successful sequence of steps that constituted the development of a teacher preparation program:
(i) advertising of teacher training in order to recruit student teachers; (ii) receiving applications;
(iii) conducting a qualifying examination for the applicants; (iv) making the final selection of
teachers; (v) ensuring that the training curriculum was ready for the teachers at the beginning of
the program; and (vi) remedial training (MNA) for those who needed additional preparation (in
French and Math) prior to entering the teacher training program. One weakness in the
development of the preparation program was that, initially, the teacher preparation curriculum
was only quickly revised, which meant that materials could not be fully upgraded at the outset of
the program. However, continued revisions were made and introduced throughout the Project.
In addition, as reported by student teachers during the ICR mission, there was a scarcity of
learning materials, such as curriculum guides, which made it more difficult for student teachers
to prepare outside of class.
       b. Implementation of an accelerated teacher preparation program
43.     By actually educating student teachers, the GOH objective of implementing a teacher
training program was achieved. The Project exceeded revised targets for most of the PDO
indicators: (i) the number of new teachers certified (900 target vs. 1,390 actual for cohort 1); (ii)
the number of student teachers completing the first year of practice teaching (1,400 target vs.
1,526 actual for cohort 2); (iii) the percentage of graduates certified (90 percent target vs. 100
percent actual); (iv) auditors found satisfactory implementation of MENFP-IFM contracts (target
met). By meeting and exceeding these indicators, the objective of implementing an accelerated
teacher training program was achieved. Two of the PDO indicators, percentage of graduates


                                                 10
deployed as teachers of which 10 percent in public schools and the percentage of newly certified
teachers deployed in rural schools (40 percent target), still need to be verified. The Bank is
working with the GOH to collect accurate and reliable data for this indicator prior to final ICR review by
IEG.
44.     The PDO indicators of the number and percentage of student teachers to be certified is
prima facie evidence of successful implementation of the teacher preparation program. The
indicator that student teachers complete the first year of practice teaching also provides evidence
that the implementation of the program continued through cohort 2. The satisfactory audits of
the MENFP-IFM contracts demonstrate that financial aspects of the program were successfully
implemented as well.
45.     The Project also provided educational materials to the IFMs and supported them with
small civil works and capacity building. These resources to IFMs increased their ability to
implement the pedagogical portion of the teacher preparation program as evidenced by the
training of cohorts 1. and 2., and, thus, increased the supply of much needed, qualified teachers.
Although the mistiming of the two cohorts was a weakness in design, it did not significantly
affect the achievement of the objective.
3.3 Efficiency
Ratings: Before restructuring—Modest
         After restructuring—Modest
         Overall—Modest
46.     The economic analysis centers on the number of students benefiting from the output of
newly certified teachers multiplied by the value of an additional year of schooling. The section
on beneficiaries assumed 40 students per new teacher per year in calculating the number of
beneficiaries. In the PAD, the planned number of teachers was 2,500 for each of three years.
The actual number of teachers graduated was 1,390 in year 1, with 1,526 expected in year two
for a total of 2,916 teachers. When multiplied by 40 students per year over 20 years of teaching
the total number of student-years reaches 2.3 million. The PAD cited the Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) 2006 for the value of an extra year of schooling. The return to education
was estimated at 16.2 percent with a conservative annual worker’s earnings at US$538 (updated
by the ICR for inflation). Thus, the calculation is $538 X 0.162=$87.16. Annex 2 presents the
net benefit stream, which has an IRR of 31.2 percent.
47.     Another factor in measuring efficiency is that the total number of teachers trained was
well below the original PAD target. In the final analysis, the output of new teachers is 2,916
compared with 7,500 in the original PAD target. There were a number of factors why the actuals
were well below the original target: overoptimistic targets for newly trained teachers, the severe
damage to IFMs and the deaths of some students from the earthquake. Another factor was the
inability of the Project to incorporate funds for the stipend explicitly in the Project from the
outset. Thus, the number of teachers that could be trained through the Project was overestimated.
This estimate was revised during the 2010 and 2012 restructurings, and the output of new
teachers exceeded the revised target total of 2,300 teachers. Therefore, although the economic
analysis suggests strong returns to the Project’s output of new teachers, the efficiency rating
before and after restructuring and overall is modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Before restructuring—Moderately Unsatisfactory
        After restructuring—Moderately Satisfactory
        Overall—Moderately Satisfactory
48.     Relevance and efficiency ratings before restructuring are modest. In achieving objectives,
the development of the training program was substantial while the implementation of the
program was modest. The combination of these pre-restructuring ratings yields a moderately
unsatisfactory rating (Table 2). With the adjustments of the 2010 restructuring, the relevance
and achievement of objectives ratings improve to substantial. These two overall ratings are
weighted by disbursement percentages at the date of the 2010 restructuring. The overall
weighted rating is 3.76 which is moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
49.     With Haiti’s extremely high average poverty rate (nearly 80 percent) and with the target
that 40 percent of new teachers be deployed to rural areas where poverty is even higher, the
Project focuses on the poorer segments of society.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The capacity of the DFP and other central and local agencies of MENFP improved with respect
to management of teacher preparation and to the implementation of the reform. The DDEs
showed improved capacity in carrying out responsibilities to recruit student graduates, certify
graduates and identify primary schools where student teachers could be engaged for the practical
phase of their training. IFMs received training, minor civil works, office equipment and supplies,
technical assistance, as did local agencies. The IFMs improved their capacity as evidenced by
the substantial number of qualified teachers that emerged from cohort 1.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
50.    The student-teacher stipend, which was initially seen as an enticement to apply for the
program, ended up being a serious implementation handicap because funds were not available to
support it until late in the Project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
51.     Haiti remains a fragile state with institutions such as the MENFP struggling to provide
basic services. However, the teacher training program is becoming more established within the
IFMs, which will have fully implemented, with Bank financing, a second cohort of new teachers
by June 2013, which will be placed in classrooms (October 2013 for cohort 2). In addition, the
teacher training curriculum has been improved which will enhance the quality of the training and,
therefore, the quality of education received by primary school students for a number of years. At
the same time, the gains from the Project will continue to depend on donor assistance. APG-2 is
allocating US$8 million to the continuation of the program, including cohort 3 (begun in
September 2012) and cohort 4 (to begin in September 2013).
52.     The payment of the student teacher stipend is still dependent on donor funding. However,
the MENFP has reviewed the rate of the stipend and changed the terms to the following: no
stipend for the MNA stage, 50 percent during the pedagogical training and 100 percent during
the in-practice training. This new schedule is designed to formalize the stipend, lower its cost,
and increase its sustainability. MENFP is also considering the reduction of the training duration
to two years instead of the original three years. With the early closure of the Project for portfolio
management reasons on June 30, 2012, cohort 3 was effectively shifted beyond the scope of the
FIA Project, but with the knowledge that it would be financed by APG-2. Thus, the delayed and
non-payment of stipends to student-teachers has been resolved in APG-2 and should no longer
threaten morale or the participation of the student teachers in the program.
53.      IFMs need continued assistance to train future cohorts. One particular area of assistance
is in building their capacity to carry out regular monitoring of the teacher candidates who have
completed pedagogical training and are now in classrooms. The IFMs will need substantial
capacity to carry out this function going forward. This follow-up by IFMs is important to
securing the gains from the pedagogical training which will ultimately benefit primary school
students. Finally, it is important to sustainability that the MENFP take the decision as an
institution that the accelerated teacher training method is going to be the standard approach to
meet the need for primary school teachers. On balance, the risk to development outcome
remains substantial.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
54.     The Bank faced institutional pressures of “use it or lose it? for the funds to expand the
teacher training program. It was a good achievement of the Bank team to secure these resources
for teacher training, but, as a result of the compressed time schedule, there were several
significant shortcomings in Bank performance at entry. First, the Bank did not allow enough
time for thorough revision of the teacher training curriculum. Second, the annual target of 2,750
was too high for the initial program, which should have incorporated the cost of the student
teacher stipends. Third, the artificial timing for Project preparation also threw the teacher
training program out of synch with the school year because the first cohort began in March
(2009). All of these issues were driven in part by pressures to meet the HIPC requirement.


                                                13
55.     Regarding the student teacher stipend, because teachers often paid for their own
education, the Bank believed that it would be a sufficient incentive for teachers to receive free
training under the Bank Project and that it was unnecessary to add an additional benefit to the
participants. The Bank appears to have been incorrect in this issue. The risk matrix in the PAD
shows that the Bank was aware of the stipend. However, the risk mitigation plan for what turned
out to be a serious problem was weak. During the ICR mission, the team received a variety of
views on the stipend with the majority believing that the stipend was needed.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
56.     The Bank dealt effectively with the impact of the earthquake and hired consultants to
evaluate the IFMs’ physical infrastructure. The Bank also took the opportunity to re-evaluate
managerial capacity and determine which IFMs were the strongest for the program going
forward. The Bank also brought in supplemental technical assistance for curriculum reform,
setting up the teacher practice teaching program and pedagogical supervision. The additional
resources for pedagogical supervision improved supervision somewhat, and the Bank performed
well in recognizing the need to address the issue through the 2010 restructuring. The Bank
provided “supervision plus? in which the Bank was a true implementation partner who worked
intensively with the implementers, both before and after the earthquake. The restructurings were
effective in improving Project implementation and in adjusting targets to realistic levels.
57.     The Bank had maintained that the student teacher stipend was not a necessary incentive
to get qualified candidates to apply to the program. Later, the Bank correctly observed that, the
non-payment of the stipend was impeding and would continue to impede Project implementation.
There was also a reputational risk to the Bank of poor Project performance. In the 2012
restructuring, the Bank made the decision to fund the student teacher stipend retroactively to
2011, which was the right decision. A minor shortcoming is that the Bank addressed the stipend
issue rather late in the Project.
58.     Another decision that was helpful to improving the implementation of the teacher training
program was, for portfolio management reasons, to close the Project earlier than planned. This
decision paved the way for the teacher training program to be picked up by the APG-2 and for
the future cohorts 3 and 4 training to be aligned with the academic year.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
59.     The Bank’s performance at entry was moderately unsatisfactory, but improved to
satisfactory at supervision. With the outcome rating at moderately satisfactory, the Bank’s
overall performance is moderately satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
60.     The GOH and the MOF were generally supportive of the Project. However, although
there were available funds allocated by the MOF for the student teacher stipend, for reasons not
entirely clear, the MOP was sporadic in approving the release of the funds. As a result, student




                                               14
teachers received much less than their promised stipends and always months late, which
handicapped Project implementation and was a major shortcoming.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
61.     The MENFP, with the help of the Bank and the PCU, responded reasonably well to the
devastating earthquake. The MENFP supported the adjustments that were agreed during the
2010 restructuring to focus on the IFMs that had the capacity, both physical and managerial to
carry out their teacher training responsibilities. Thus, Project resources could be focused on
those IFMs which were motivated to stay in the program and which had the capacity to operate
after the 2010 earthquake. Even with the turnover in ministers and the sometimes limited
ownership, the MENFP worked with the PCU to ensure that the contracts with the IFMs were
implemented so that they could deliver on their revised targets. One moderate shortcoming was
that the MENFP was still not realistic about its ability to implement the student-teacher stipend,
nor about its ability to reach the original targets for student teacher graduates. However, in
fairness, it was bound to these targets to be eligible for HIPC funding.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
62.    With the GOH (MOF and MOP) rated moderately unsatisfactory, the MENFP rated
moderately satisfactory, and outcomes rated as moderately satisfactory, the overall Borrower
performance is moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
63.     Accelerated teacher training is an effective approach in the Haitian context in which
there is an undersupply of qualified teachers. One important advantage of the program was
that student teachers were actively educating primary students after only one year of pedagogical
training. On the quality side, applicants had to have a high school degree and pass an initial
examination. Those two requirements alone put the qualification level of student teachers above
that of many active teachers who have only a ninth grade education and who have never passed a
screening examination.
64.      If there is a stipend for student-teachers, it is critical to ensure at the outset that that
stipend can and will be paid. In the Teacher Training EFA Project, the inability of the GOH to
reliably pay the stipend caused serious implementation difficulties in the program to the extent
that student-teachers even went on strike. The Bank and the Recipient need to ensure that the
institutions with decision-making power regarding the stipend are on-board with its timely
payment. Failure to regularly disburse the stipend can demoralize and disillusion the student-
teachers and jeopardize the program.
65.     A progressive implementation of stipends may provide a solution to fiscal
constraints and to retention of student-teachers. The MENFP has devised a more sustainable
formula and process, which is now in effect under APG-2: No stipend is paid for the MNA stage,
half of the full stipend is paid during the one-year pedagogical stage, and full stipend is paid for
the two-year practice teaching stage.
66.   Implementation of a teacher training program should be coordinated with the
academic year to ensure greater efficiency and less disruption to the training institutes


                                                 15
(IFMs). The teacher training program began its first cohort in March of 2009 which misaligned
graduation of student-teachers with the beginning of the next school year. This meant that
graduates would be released from the program with a long hiatus. It also was disruptive to the
IFMs who had ongoing programs and had to suddenly accommodate the influx of new students.

Introduction
The Education For All Support Project (EFA-SP), commonly called the FIA, was launched in
March 2008, as a complement to the 2007 Education For All (EFA) project, and more
particularly the “Accelerated Initial Training? component (FIA) of component 1 entitled
“Improved access to basic education.?

Like the EFA project (phase 1), the EFA-SP was implemented and overseen by the MENFP,
over four fiscal years (2008-2009 to 2011-2012). The project was intended to improve teacher
qualifications, alleviate the shortage of qualified teachers to meet the need created by
expanded access to basic education, and standardize teacher training curricula across the
country. It was also consistent with the Haitian government’s more general objective of
expanding education to all by 2015.
The project included the following three components:
   - component 1: Recruitment and selection of student teachers;
   - component 2: Accelerated initial training for teachers;
   - component 3: Improved management of accelerated initial training.

This document is the end-of-project report for the EFA-SP, which ended in May 2012,
marking the end of the Haitian government’s commitment in this regard.




                                            28
Executive summary
The EFA-SP was introduced during a period characterized by increasing political stability and
the beginnings of an economic upturn, despite the ongoing presence of worrisome
socioeconomic issues. The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010, crippling the
country’s economy and triggering a breakdown in social conditions, had major repercussions
on the EFA project.

The education sector faces sizeable challenges. The MENFP is in no position to regulate this
sector given that approximately 90% of the country’s schools are privately run. Schools are
either clearly lacking or run down, and there is a severe shortage of qualified teachers.

The EFA-SP was launched in March 2008 as an add-on to the EFA project to support the
teacher training component, and stems directly from the Haitian government’s commitment to
improving the quality of education in the country.

It experienced a difficult start-up period and underwent restructuring to make sure objectives
were attainable given the obstacles encountered. The revised objectives will most likely be
reached and even surpassed, however, the indicators will only be measured at the end of the
student-teacher training process, i.e. after the project is completed.

The Bank’s performance is rated as satisfactory. It provided substantial support and
supervision in improving the project management process, although its actions may have
occasionally been perceived as overly interventionist. The government’s performance is rated
as moderately satisfactory. It expressed renewed interest in and demonstrated concrete
political support for this project, which is consistent with its goals for the education sector.
However, the skills transfer process, to be achieved by adding experts to the MENFP teams,
has not yet reached satisfactory levels.

Several lessons were learned during implementation of the EFA project, namely with respect
to strengthening institutional capacities and overcoming obstacles, the importance of
communication and the involvement of decentralized stakeholders in education-related
projects, the essential role of steering committees, and the need to pay student-teachers’
allowances on time as any delays have major repercussions on the project.




                                              29
I. Situation at the start of the project
a. Economic and social conditions
At the time the EFA project was first introduced, the country seemed to have turned the page
on its long history of political crises. The sense of insecurity had lessened and the economic
reforms implemented were beginning to yield results. Inflation had dropped to 7.9% in 2007,
compared to almost 40% in 2003.

However, the economic and social situation was still alarming. With an estimated GDP of
US$6.2 billion, Haiti is the last remaining least-developed country (LDC) in the Western
hemisphere. According to the 2004 poverty map, 55% of households were subsisting on less
than $1 per day, and 76% of the population were living below the poverty line with less than
$2 per person per day.

The education sector was already feeling the impacts of the perilous socioeconomic situation.
Families cannot always afford the high tuition costs and the State is struggling to meet the
need for education. It is estimated that 80% of schools in Haiti are private.
b. Priorities of the education sector
The priorities of the education sector were outlined in the following two documents: the
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (DSNCRP 2008-2011) and the National
Strategy-Education For All (SNA/EPT).

The planned changes involved redirecting educational services to poor students, improving
teacher qualifications, emphasizing preschool education programs, improving the basic
education system by focusing specifically on the problem of overage students and by
providing families with assistance to send their children to school, adapting curricula to the
socioeconomic conditions, and identifying ways to effectively oversee the education sector.

In 2007, the year the project was launched, only 500 new teachers per year were graduating
from the country’s teacher training program versus the 2,000 needed to achieve the objectives
of the Education For All program.
c. Activities of the World Bank and other sector financial backers
The education sector is supported by a number of financial backers at virtually all levels, i.e.
governance, improvement of programs and curricula, improvement of training for education
stakeholders, support for basic education and early childhood education, vocational training,
and the construction of new schools.

The World Bank strongly supports implementation of the SNA/EPT operational plan, and
provides funding for the EFA and FIA projects, and the Emergency School Reconstruction
Project (ESRP). It emphasizes basic education and early childhood education. The Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) is another important financial backer of the SNA/EPT,
contributing to financing for both the EFA and the ESRP.

The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) provides funding mainly for
primary education, and the European Union (EU) finances teacher training, classroom
renovations, and a regional pilot project for overage students. Other financial backers include
the Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation



                                              30
(AECID), the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the World Food Programme
(WFP), and specialized UN organizations such as UNESCO and UNICEF.

II. Implementation
a. Implementation measures/division of responsibilities
The implementation measures were based on the model devised for the EFA project. The
technical departments within the MENFP, mainly the Department of Training and
Professional Development (DFP), were responsible for project implementation. Given the
weaknesses noted within the DFP, it was decided to create a support framework for the FIA
that would simultaneously bolster capacity-building within this department. This framework
would help to ensure suitable conditions and technical support for the EFA-SP/FIA project.
The Administrative Affairs Department (DAA), with support from the UTP/EFA, would
manage the administrative and accounting aspects of the project.

An FIA monitoring committee, comprised of representatives from the central technical
departments, the private sector and the teacher training colleges, would be set up to coordinate
project activities; however, this committee was unable to fulfil its monitoring role.
b. Project preparation work
The project preparation work was satisfactory and was based largely on available data, reports
and information, as well as similar experiences with teacher training programs in other
countries, notably Guinea and Senegal. The National Strategy-Education For All, a document
on the vision and strategy behind EFA, was a valuable reference.

Alternative scenarios were considered during the analysis/preparation phase; various
institutional, financial, political and technical risks were analyzed, and mitigation measures
identified. Finally, a great deal of groundwork was done to prepare for the project itself.

However, not enough advance consideration was given to the principal contractor’s project
management capacity (availability of human and material resources), resulting in objectives
that were difficult to attain. This aspect of the project had to be reviewed in light of the
problems at start-up, the delays encountered, and the new situation following the January
2010 earthquake. Moreover, the stakeholders’ reservations and misunderstandings about the
project’s end goal were not adequately addressed in advance, which led to delays in
implementing the project.
c. Monitoring and assessment framework
The monitoring and assessment framework was designed based on general project
advancement indicators.

The component coordinator and assistant coordinator were mainly responsible for monitoring
the project’s advancement, jointly with the DFP and DDE, and under the supervision of the
FIA monitoring committee. The UTP/EFA monitoring and assessment specialist assisted the
FIA coordinators with monitoring activities, and quarterly reports were issued, albeit after
substantial delays.

The monitoring committee, which did not work out as planned, was supposed to have
overseen application of the operational plans, budgets and procurement plans.




                                              31
Assessments of project implementation results were to have been conducted by national or
international independent consultants.

d. Restructuring and changes to targets
The FIA was initially conceived as subcomponent B of component 1 of the EFA project:
improved access to basic education. Its goal was to introduce a short (one-year) initial training
program that would produce large numbers of qualified teachers over a three-year period. It
was developed in response to the poor quality of teaching offered in many public and private
schools due to the shortage of qualified teachers.

Major problems in implementing this subcomponent were encountered from the outset. The
DFP, the project’s principal contractor, was unaccustomed to managing such a large project;
not only did the DFP have to coordinate the project, it also had to ensure it was fully
integrated. In addition, the institutional mechanism, the steering committee and the technical
committees, set up to ensure the standardization, coordination and orientation of FIA
activities, never got off the ground. These problems led to a series of delays (e.g.
student-teachers starting work approximately one year behind schedule), prompting the World
Bank to rate the project as moderately unsatisfactory. In September 2009, the decision was
made to hire four technical assistants within the DFP.

Despite the changes made and warnings issued by the Bank, by late 2009, the FIA still had
not achieved the hoped-for results. The project was further jeopardized by the collapse of the
MENFP building in the January 2010 earthquake, which killed the FIA coordinator, DFP
director and assistant director. To make matters worse, several teacher training colleges in the
Port-au-Prince region were either heavily damaged or completely destroyed.

Following this tragedy, in October 2010, the Haitian government, jointly with the World
Bank, acknowledged the need to restructure the project, specifically to revise the results
indicators downward, to improve the teacher-training capacities of the MENFP and the
selected teacher training colleges, and to revise the project budget upward to account for the
restructuring costs.

In the end, the restructuring that took place in 2010 did not yield the promised improvements.
The teacher training process was held up due to delays in paying allowances to the students.
The government request a second round of restructuring to again revise the indicators, shut
down the project prematurely, and revise the budget to account for the restructuring process.
III. Results and assessments
a. Appropriateness of the project design and objectives (based on priorities)
The Government of Haiti committed to the goal of EFA at the World Conference on
Education for All in Jomtien, Thailand in March 1990, and then reiterated this pledge at the
World Education Forum in Dakar in 2000, subsequently including the goals of the Dakar
Declaration in its SNA/EPT. One of these goals was to improve the quality of education
across the board to ensure that all students achieve recognized and quantifiable results,
specifically in reading, writing, arithmetic and essential life skills.

The EFA-SP objectives were completely appropriate in that they were designed to help the
Haitian government implement its Accelerated Initial Training program for teachers, so as to
increase the number of teachers certified each year. As such, it was consistent with all



                                               32
national priorities. The project components were defined based on the SNA/EPT and were all
focused on achieving the goals set forth in the Dakar Declaration.

b. Results indicators based on project development objectives
Given the delays caused by the problems encountered during the start-up phase, the project
had to be restructured twice in order to revise the target results downward.

Original results indicators:
   o Minimum of 2,500 new teachers earn an FIA diploma (cohort 1), minimum of 2,500
       additional teachers (cohort 2) complete the first year of practical training, and
       minimum of 2,500 additional teachers (cohort 3) complete classroom training;
   o 80% of new teachers are hired as teachers; 50% of new teachers are hired by public
       schools;
   o 90% of teachers who complete the third year of the program are certified;
   o At least 70% of FIA-certified teachers are hired in rural areas.

Following the first restructuring in October 2010, the results were revised downward:

   o Minimum of 900 teachers are certified by the end of the project (cohort 1), minimum
     of 1,400 additional teachers (cohort 2) complete the first year of practical training, and
     minimum of 1,440 additional teachers (cohort 3) complete classroom training;
   o 80% of new teachers are hired as teachers; 50% of new teachers are hired by public
     schools;
   o 90% of teachers who complete the third year of the program are certified;
   o At least 40% of FIA-certified teachers are hired in rural areas.

Following the second restructuring, the project end date was moved up to June 30, 2012, from
January 2013, and target results were once again revised. Cohort 3 will fall under phase 2 of
the EFA project, and the main results will not be known until after the FIA project is
completed:

   o Minimum of 900 teachers are certified by the end of the project (cohort 1), minimum
     of 1,400 additional teachers (cohort 2) complete the first year of practical training;
   o 80% of new teachers are hired as teachers; 10% of new teachers are hired by public
     schools;
   o 90% of teachers who complete the third year of the program are certified;
   o At least 40% of FIA-certified teachers are hired in rural areas.

Currently, 1,444 student-teachers are doing a professional placement. Far more than the target
900 students from cohort 1 will be certified by the end of the project. Moreover, 1,278
student-teachers are currently doing a practical placement (classroom). The other indicators
will only be measured after the students from cohort 1 are certified, i.e. once the project is
completed.
IV. Performance of the World Bank and the Haitian government
a. Bank
The Bank’s performance is rated as satisfactory. The Bank team was actively involved in the
project preparation work, providing data drawn from similar experiences in other countries
and playing a central role in preparing the project content and guidelines. The project design
was very appropriate and its objectives were consistent with the SNA/EPT. The decision to


                                             33
appoint the MENFP as project coordinator was a clear departure from the usual practice of
creating an external unit, and was part of a long-term plan to strengthen various Ministry
departments. This process emphasized the sustainability of an ambitious project requiring a
long-term investment.

The Bank emphasized the planning and implementation schedule for the FIA mechanism,
specifically the preparation of TDRs for studies required and prior technical assistance
required.

There was a sustained level of high-quality project supervision throughout the project.
Supervision missions took place regularly. The mission of September 2-10, 2009, rated the
progress of the FIA project as moderately unsatisfactory and focused on devising an action
plan to support its implementation; subsequently, the progress of this action plan was assessed
during the mission of October 5, 2009. When it came time to restructure the project in 2010,
the Bank team played a central role in redefining actions and targets. The recommendations
made by the successive supervision teams helped to improve the project’s procurement
process and financial management.

However, response times to requests for the Bank’s “no objection? were occasionally too
long. Moreover, the Bank’s heavy involvement in the project management process may have
been perceived as an attempt to limit the Haitian stakeholders’ decision-making capacities,
which led to misunderstandings between the principal contractor and the Bank as to what the
MENF wanted and what the Bank thought it was necessary to do.
b. Government
The Government of the Republic of Haiti, via the MENFP, was responsible for overseeing the
project. Due to weaknesses in the structures involved in implementing the project (particularly
the DFP), the FIA coordinators, tasked with supporting the Ministry, played a very active role
in this respect. The effective use of planned monitoring and steering mechanisms would have
resulted in better project coordination and improved management. Despite everything, the
target objectives set after the restructurings were achieved by the end of the process. The
government's overall performance can be rated as moderately satisfactory.

Coordination of the FIA is rated as satisfactory: due to initial problems caused by delays in
the preparatory work, the programs and modules were not yet developed, the furniture was
not available, and the teaching equipment and materials had not been acquired. Furthermore,
the project did not yet have access to the necessary qualified teachers. Both the central and
decentralized MENFP units that were tasked with implementing the project were not ready to
do so, nor were they in a position to provide the necessary coordination on short notice. In
these circumstances, the project had trouble getting off the ground and was rated as
moderately unsatisfactory during the World Bank’s September 2009 supervision mission.

Measures were taken to speed up project implementation, including the hiring of technical
assistants (TAs) to provide skills training to DFP agents, the renovation and repair of
damaged teacher training colleges, the finalization and distribution of FPI 1 modules, and the
restructuring of the FIA project by the Haitian government with support from the World
Bank.




                                              34
Despite the delays, the progress seen today is an achievement given the problems encountered
along the way. Nevertheless, the skills training that should have enabled the DFP to take over
after the TAs left was unsatisfactory.

Constant progress was made with the procurement process throughout the project, to achieve
an overall satisfactory level. The Bank’s standards and requirements were generally respected.
A procurement plan was drafted each year for the project activities. However, there were
persistent shortcomings in terms of setting up an adequate monthly follow-up system.

Financial management was satisfactory despite the shortcomings. The financial management
department experienced problems at the outset and was especially hard hit by the January
2010 earthquake, in which its specialist perished and a large amount of documents were
destroyed. However, the financial information needed for the Operating Manual or for
monitoring purposes was sent regularly, although not always on time. Conversely, the internal
control unit was the weak link in the chain and was unable to provide sufficient support for
financial management and follow-up on recommendations. Moreover, malfunctions by the
GESCOMPTE software prevented the adequate tracking of disbursements and resulted in
delays in the presentation of financial information. The acquisition and installation of the new
TOMPRO financial management software will resolve this problem and ensure the better
flow of financial information.

V. Viability
Training quality teachers is essential to improving the quality of education in Haiti—a fact of
which the Haitian government is well aware—and the FIA meets this need very well.
However, the sustainability of this type of project will depend on several factors: the quality
of training and the skill level of certified student-teachers, and the opportunity for newly
certified student-teachers to quickly find jobs in public or private schools so as to attract new
graduates to a field with almost-guaranteed employment, all of which will make the training
content appealing to new teachers.

However, while the Haitian government can partially subsidize this initiative, it does not have
the means to take it over completely. Its sustainability will depend largely on the
government’s capacity to obtain external funding.

Thanks to this project, the DFP now has a curriculum and teaching materials. Once the
training modules are finalized, the training program is likely to become a benchmark in the
field of teacher training.

Providing TAs to assist the DFP was not really effective. The skills transfer process was not
made easier by the physical separation between the TAs and the DFP agents due to the
collapse of the Ministry building. To speed up capacity-building, the TAs would have to work
physically at the DFP and each be paired with at least one agent whom they would be
responsible for training.

The renovation of teacher training colleges meant that the MENFP had access to at least one
acceptable initial teacher training centre per department, with the exception of Nippes.
However, the sustainability of the renovated buildings and the materials provided will depend
on the ability to finance their maintenance.

VI. Project lessons
   •   In the Haitian education sector, any innovation quickly arouses suspicions and is met
       with significant resistance. An understanding of the causes of this resistance and the
       issues faced by the different stakeholders is needed to improve project outcomes.

   •   Time and effort spent on seeking a consensus between the stakeholders is not wasted;
       it improves the project’s chances of success.

   •   The FIA experience has shown that capacity-building for project stakeholders is an
       essential component of any project, which risks being jeopardized by the virtually total
       incompetence that plagues the country’s institutions.

   •   The Ministry’s involvement and accountability in department-specific projects
       considerably increase the chances of success.

   •   Communication, transparency and the efficient circulation of information between the
       various stakeholders is essential, as it prevents misunderstandings, controls rumours,
       and overcomes a number of other problems.

   •   In projects involving the payment of allowances, every effort must be made to pay
       them on time, as delays will cause recipients to become discouraged, in turn holding
       up the project.

   •   Having steering and monitoring committees that perform up to standard helps with the
       coordination of stakeholders and the exchange of information; it also allows for
       prompt action in the case of project delays. Unfortunately, in the case of the FIA, these
       committees were ineffectual.

   •   There is a high level of incompetence in the public sector. However, this should not
       systematically lead to the creation of provisional or parallel project management
       structures. Projects need to be spearheaded by the public sector, in the aim of
       strengthening the country’s institutions in the long term.

   •   The relationship between consultants and civil servants is still very troubled, largely
       due to discrepancies between the fees charged by the former and the salaries earned by
       the latter. The possibility of paying a bonus to civil servants involved in this type of
       project is being evaluated.
