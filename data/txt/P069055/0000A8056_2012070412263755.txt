                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has achieved its project development objective (PDO) against two outcome indicators: enrollment rate in primary grades has increased and Parents-Teachers
                         Associations were active in 86% of the schools in the project districts. However, the PDO level indicator added under the Additional Financing -- construction of the National Testing
                         Center's premises-- might not be met by the Project Closing Date due to five month delay in the design of works. The Government has expressed interest in extending the project by
                         six months to allow for the completion of the civil works.
