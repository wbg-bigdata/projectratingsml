INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOI"fDENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL FOR A
TECHNICAL AND AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Senegal in amounts in various currencies
equivalent to US$ 2.0 million for a technical and agricultural education
project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In March 1970, the Government of Senegal submitted to the
Association a proposal, prepared with the assistance of UNESCO, for the
financing of an education project. The proposal stemmed from a reform
program, including reorganization of Senegal's general education system,
which was thon being prepared.
3.        The project was appraised in September/October 1970, with a
follow-up mission in March 1971 to appraise a modification requested by
the Government in February 1971. The appraisal mission found that the
proposed reforms had not been fully defined and agreed upon within the
Senegalese Government, and it was therefore decided to defer consideration
of the secondary education and teacher-training items, thereby limiting
the project to technical and agricultural education.
4.       Negotiations with a delegation led by Mr. Ousmane Seck, Secretary
of State for Planning, were completed on May 7.
5.        The proposed credit would be the first Bank Group assistance
to education in Senegal. Most of the Bank Group's lending in Senegal
(Annex 1) has been for transportation, in particular for economically
justified projects which could not easily be financed by traditional
lenders. The 1966 railway project is about three years behind schedule,
because of delays in bidding procedures, difficulties on the managerial
and financial side and the use of savings for further track relaying.
However, satisfactory measures are now being taken by the Senegalese
authorities and a follow-up operation is being considered in the Bank
Group. In 1967, a loan was made to the Port of Dakar. All new con-
struction work has been completed; only dredging, because of the unex-
pected presence of hard material, is delaying completion and will require



further extension of the closing date. Execution of the 1970 highway
project, which focuses on the improvement of feeder roads, is progressing
satisfactorily. The contract for construction was awarded in March, and
work is expected to start soon. The road improvement and maintenance
study financed by this project began in November 1970. The status of
the agricultural credit project was reviewed in detail in the Report
and Recommendation of the President submitted to the Executive Directors
in connection with the two credits for agriculture (Terres Neuvres
Resettlement and Casamance Rice Projects) approved on May 11, 1971
(see R71-25/1 dated May 6, 1971).
6.        In August 1966, IFC made an equity investment of US$ 0.8 million
and a long-term loan of US$ 2.46 million to Societ6 Industrielle    d'Engrais
au Senegal (SIES), a Senegalese company which operates a fertilizer plant
near Dakar. Adverse developments in agriculture have caused fertilizer
consumption to drop sharply. As a result, the company has had to invoke
the clauses in its agreement with the Government which entitle it to
receive payments from the Government so long as production remains below
a certain level. Discussions are under way between representatives of
the Government, IFC and the shareholders on these matters.
7.        Preparatory work for projects in various fields is well advanced,
and projects for public utilities, urban development and railways are
scheduled for consideration by the Executive Directors in FY 1972.
Institution building is a major feature of these projects. This is an
endeavor of great importance to Senegal and to which the contribution
of the Bank Group's expertise is actively sought by the Government.
Over the longer term, projects ;ill o. prepared to continue
diversification of agriculture.
PART II - CCUNTRY BACKGROUND
Economic Situation
8.        A report on "The Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Senegal" (AlW-15a) was distributed to Executive Directors on June 10,
1970 (R70-113). A Basic Data sheet is attached (Annex 3).
9.        Since independence in 1960, Senegal has experienced low economic
growth rates. Having been the economic and administrative center of French
West Africa, Senegal had, at the time of independence, an artificially
high standard of living, out of proportion to the limited economic potential
of the country and the generally low% standard of education. The very diffi-
cult adaptation process was aggravated by the loss of preferential prices
for groundnuts on the French market in 1967/68 and in recent years by poor
groundnut harvests.



- 3 -
10.       Ihe Report and Recommendation of the President on the Terres
Neuves Settlement Project and the Casamance Rice Project (P-923) dated
April 29, 1971 provided a detailed account of the structure, problems and
prospects of the Senegalese economy, focusing particularly on the ground-
nut sector, which is of overriding importance. Between 1964 and 1968,
gross public capital inflow averaged $ 19 million per year or 53 percent
of total public investment but increased to over $ 36 million in 1969
largely due to increased disburseiments of aid from the European Economic
Community (EEC) and the Federal Republic of Germany. Of the remainder,
about 43 percent was financed by public savings (Government and public
enterprises) and 4 percent by running down treasury reserves and by some
local borroiing. Total external aid including technical assistance was
about US $ 64 million in 1969. The share of grants has fallen from over
75 percent during the period 1964-68 to under 50 percent in 1969. The
high inflow of grant aid in the past explains Senegal's small external
public debt and the low debt service ratio of 2 percent of total exports
in 1970. Half of foreign financial aid during 1964-69 was provided by
the EEC and another 30 percent by France. The remainder came mainly from
the Bank Group, the United States and Germany. Technical assistance has
averaged $ 29 million per year or over 20 percent of the Government's
budget; almost 83 percent was provided by France. Most technical as-
sistance is used to assist the Government in carrying out its normal
administrative functions, mainly in education. The Government is also
gradually improving its capacity to execute projects, and future foreign
aid can be expected to make a more substantial contribution to growth
than in the past.
11.       Since independence, the Government has maintained a conservative
financial policy but public finances have nevertheless shown a steady
deterioration since 1965 mainly because of a decline in economic activity.
While the current budget is likely to remain in surplus it can make
little contribution to the financing of investment over the next few
years. A very large share of public investment will therefore have to
be financed by foreign aid which will have to cover some local as well
as foreign expenditure. As the difficult public finance situation
limits the scope for conventional borrowing, most foreign aid will have
to be on soft terms.
Manpower Needs
12.       The population of Senegal is about 3.9 million and is growing
at about 2.2 percent per annum. Dakar, the capital, has a population of
almost 600,000. About 75 percent of the total labor force is engaged in
the traditional occupations, mainly agriculture. The training of
Senegalese extension workers is a condition for improvement of
extension services in agriculture. Since the majority of farmers are
illiterate, adequate oral presentation and demonstration are virtually



- 4 -
the sole means of transmitting information on techniques to improve
productivity. Progress has been slow, as the extension service is
poorly coordinated and most technicians are inadequately trained. A
reorganization of the extension services is underway, giving increased
responsibilities to the centrally managed agricultural services instead
of to a number of local autonomous agencies.
13.       Output from Senegalts important fish resources has increased
rapidly in recent years, reaching about-200,000 tons with a value of
CFAF 7.8 billion ($ 28 million) in 1969. Positions as officers and
mechanics in the industrial fishing fleet, now held by expatriates,
could be filled by Senegalese if adequate training were provided.
14.       Manufacturing industries - including groundnut processing -
constitute about 15 percent of GDP, a higher percentage than in most
West African countries. This relatively high rate of industrialization
is due to the central position Senegal enjoyed in French West Africa.
Manufacturing relies heavily on expatriate management and skills; as
many as half of the smiall industrial "family" enterprises (employing
10-20 people) aro under foreign onerslip, while 9C porcent of busi-
nossos omploying -:iore than 20 wjorkers are foreign c.med. Because of the
relatively high costs of expatriate manpower and low capital costs,
industrial investment has been capital-intensive, and employment in
this sector grew by only 3.5 percent annually since 1959, reaching
18,000 in 1968. The reduced importance of Dakar as an administrative
and economic center has resulted in virbaal stagnation of salaried
employment since independence. Employment in the modern sector fell
from 135,000 in 1960 to 125,000 in 1968; of this total about half is
employed by the private sector, one-third by Government and local
administration and one-fifth by public enterprises. Because of the
predominance of foreign ownership in industry, and because of a lack
of sufficiently trained and experienced Senegalese, it is probable
that even by 1980 as much as 75 percent of the managerial staff in
Senegal will still be high-salaried expatriates. It is at the middle
level that industry could effect economies in its salary bill if
adequately trained Senegalese were available to replace expatriates
and to occupy new vacandes as industry expands. The Government's
objective is to replace all non-Senegalese-occupying middle-level
positions in industry and commerce by 1980.
Education and Employment
15.       The Senegalese school system tends to cater to the small
minority who proceed to higher education and it neglects the more
practical needs of the majority. French is the language of instruction
and the literacy rate for the 14-plus age group is about 10 percent.
IThiile all primary teachers are Senegalese, three-fourths of the second-
ary level teachers are expatriates.



- 5 -
16.       There is an urgent need to make the school system more
responsive to the country's economic and social requirements in rela-
tion to: (i) the continuous growth in rural migration, which is causing
increasingly difficult problems of employment in the cities; and (ii)
the skills required in the modern sector to replace non-Senegalese
staff and to increase productivity of local manpower. The Government
is aware of this need.
17.       Total educational expenditures in 1969/70 were equivalent
to about US$ 11 per capita or 5.7 percent of GDP. This high propor-
tion reflects the exceptionally large and high-cost support which
Senegal receives from France. If the additional cost of expatriate
over Senegalese personnel is discounted, educational expenditures as
a proportion of GDP wsould be about 4.7 percent. Of current budget
expenditure, education at present accounts for about 20 percent and
expenditure on the institutions included in the project, less than
one percent.
18.        The slowr growth of modern sector employment and a contin-
uous rural exodus are leading to rapidly rising urban unemployment,
while the Senegalese wage system appears to be an incentive for a
"6apital deepening" process in industry.  According to a rough cal-
culation, around one-third of Dakar's manpower is unemployed. It
has been estii,iated that Dakar's population is increasing by some 6
percent a ycar (about 36,000), half of whiiclh is due to natural
g'rouTth and harlf to migraticn from the countr2yside.  The majority
of those  iLrc'nto ,,ro unlikcly to find -,ork in Darkar and wjill swell
the ran.!z of the unemployed.
PART 3Il - THE PROJECT
19.       Along with the reform of general education, which is still
being discussed and which will lay the foundation for a subsequent
project, Senegal requires assistance to (a) rehabilitate existing
training schools for skilled manpower in industry, agriculture and
fishing; and (b) provide expanded schools to train middle-level
staff for those occupations. Industry could effect substantial
savings in its salary bill and hence improve its competitive strength,
if adequately trained Senegalese technicians were available to re-
place expatriates and to incr_ase labor productivity.       In
agriculture,    improvement  of   the    existing   pre - service



- 6 -
and in-serv. ce training     of     extension workers is needed.   The
training of Senegalese officers and mechanics for the fishing fleet must
also be developed in order to provide a permanent manpower base for the
fishing industry and to reduce operating costs through progressive
replacement of foreigners. The proposed project, although relatively
small, would therefore have a significant economic impact.
20.       The project includes specifically:
(i) Technology Institute at Dakar University: construction,
equipment and furnishing for about 565 students;
(ii) Delafosse Technical School at Dakar: rehabilitation,
including laboratories and workshops, equipment and furnishing, for at
least 800 upper-secondary level students;
(iii) Peytavin Technical School at St. Louis: reconstruction,
including five new classrooms and equipment and furnishing for
at least 300 upper-secondary level students;
(iv) School for Agricultural Agents at Ziguinchor: construction
including a science laboratory, staff housing, equipment, tools and
furnishing for about 120 students.
(v) A three man-months' study with a view to reorganizing the
Merchant Marine School at Dakar, including the preparation of a training
program, of courses of study and of lists of equipment and the establish-
ment of entrance requirements; and
(vi)  Equipping the Merchant Marine School at Dakar following
completion of the above-mentioned study.
21.       The Technology Institute would offer two-year, sub-professional
training courses in mechanical and electrical engineering, civil engi-
neering, chemistry and food technology, and business studies. Between
110 and 130 of the students graduating each year are expected to be
employed by industrial and commercial enterprises. The remainder would
enter Government service, pursue higher education or receive additional
training as technical teachers and instructors. During negotiations
the Government agreed to revise the curricula and to submit them to the
Association for review.
22.       The Lycee Delafosse at Dakar and the Lyc6e Peytavin in St. Louis
are the only institutions in Senegal which can provide upper-secondary
level technician training with a practical bias. Curricula are satis-
factory but thc buiidings arr; obsolete.



- 7 -
23.       Agricultural technician training at the junior level is at
present provided in two schools, one in Louga and the other in Ziguinchor.
Both institutions are uneconomically small, resulting in very high costs
per pupil. As a result of the project, improved training and better
facilities will be provided at Ziguinchor. The Louga school will
discontinue pre-service training thus enabling the Ziguinchor institution
to operate at capacity and reduce costs. In-service training, which is
highly desirable, will go on at Ziguinchor and most probably also at Louga.
24.       The project provides for technical assistance and equipment for
a new program at the Merchant Marine School in Dakar to train officers and
mechanics. The new program would be submitted to the Association for
agreement.
25.       Totql project costs are $ 2.5 million enuivalent, of which the
forcign exchange .componcnt is about S 1.3 million eruivalent (Annex 2).
Th. proposed , 2.0 million ID., credit wrould amount.to 80 percent of total
project cost andSwould cover all foreign expenditurws and US$ 0.7 million
-of local expenditures.
26.       The project would be executed in 4-1/2 years and would be
managed by the Director of Public Works with the guidance of a project
unit, includi-ng a full-time architect and accountant. The project unit
would be assisted by an advisory group comprising representatives of the
Jlinistries of National Education, of Technical Education and Vocational
Training, and of Planning. For the planning and supervision of construction
of project institutions, the services of consulting engineers would be
secured.         '                   -
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRTMENTS AND AUIHORITY
27.       The draft Development Credit Agreement (Technical and Agricultural
Education Project) between the Republic of Senegal and the Association, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Appointment of a project director and an accountant,
in consultation with the Association, would be a condition of effectiveness
of the credit. Agreement by the Association on the Technology Institute's
curricula and on a training program for the Merchant Marine School would be
conditions of disbursement for these project items.



- 8 -
28.       I am sa-tisfied that the proposed Development Credit for
Technical and Agricultural Education would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECCONYENDATICN
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
