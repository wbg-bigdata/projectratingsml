SECOND POLYTECHNIC PROJECT
(LOAN 2290-IND)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) .or the Second
Polytechnic Project in Indonesia for which Ln. 2290-IND in the amount of
$107.4 million was approved on April 25, 1983. The loan was closed on
December 31, 1990. one year behind schedule.  The loan was fully disbursed
with the exception of $1.4 million and the last disbursement was made on
May 20. 1991.
The PCR was prepared by the Population and Human Resources Division
of Country DepavtMent V of the former Asia Regional Office (Parts I and III).
Part II was prepared by the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) for the
Borrower.
The PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),
the Loan Agreement, supervision reports, internal Bank documents and
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower. The PCR also draws from the
Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) dated May 1989, the PCR for the
Seventh Education (Polytechnic) Project (Cr. 869-IND) and the Report of a
Polytechnic Education Evaluation Team (PEET) comprising of professors from the
Institutes of Technology of Bandung and Bogor. The PEET was established by
the Director General of Higher Education with terms of reference that included
defining appropriate mechanisms for management of the polytechnic system as
well as evaluation of the system. The PEET carried out its work in the period
from June - December 1989.

S!COND POLYTECHNIC PROJECT
(LwOAN 2290-IND)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.   Obiectaos  To expand the engineering and commerce polytechnic subsystem
through the extension of seven polytechnics (six of which were provided under
Cr. 869-IND) and the provi',Ivn of eleven new polytechnics to increase by
14,960 to 19.240 the number ot places in engineering and commerce with the
concomitant increase in the provision of teachers; to develop new and improved
courses and curricula; and to improve management of the polytechnic subsystem
(par. 3.1).
2.   Implementation Experience.  The project was generally implemented as
planned, albeit with a one year delay due to procurement and budgetary
problems. Difficulties were encountered in attracting and training teachers
for electronics and telecow-unications and one new course, aeronautics,
remains to be implemented 'para 5.1 et seq).
3.   Results.  The project his had a positive impact on consolidating the
development of the six schools rovided under Cr. 869-IND and in substantially
increasing the availability ot . .ineering and commerce technicians for
industry and business. Less satisfactory is the slowness in reaching project
targets for enrollment (72X for academic year 1990/91). Enrollments are now
planned to rseach 901 of target in academic year 1992/93 (paras 6.1 - 6.3).
4.   Sustainability.  Project benefitt are expected to be maintained in the
long term due to the growing appreciation of industry and commerce of the
polytechnic system, the improved GOI funding for operations and maintenance
and the decision by GOI to allow the polytechnics to retain income generated
from services and consultancies provided to tt^_ private and public sectors. A
danger to sustainability is the low salary range for polytechnic teachers
compared with the private sector particularly in banking, tourism, electronics
and telecomm.nications (para 7.1).
5.  Lessons Learned.  (i) the capability demonstrated by MEC to undertake
satisfactorily two complex overlapping projects in the new polytechnic
subsector of higher education; (ii) the need to carefully analyze the effects
of timing of follow-on projecte to establish the advantages and disadvantages
of overlapping or sequential projects; (iii) the need to ensure that definite
arrangements for all aspects of equipment procurement are in place before
determining initial date of operations; (iv) the importance of the capability
of school principals; (v) the need to anticipate change when emphasis changes
from implementation to operation; (vi) the need for permanent institutional
arrangements for maintenance of equipment in systems such as the polytechnic
system; (vii) the futility of mandating liaison arrangements when one party,
outside the control of GOI, perceives no benefits in the arrangements; and
(viii) the improvement of supervision quality through joint missions with
parallel financing agencies (para 8.3).

2.        Backtro_nd
2.1       Sector Development Obiectives.  In support of the Government of
Indonesia (GOI) policy of rapid economic growth, the sector objectives
concentrated on the alleviation of the serious imbalances in the country's
manpower structure, particularly on the severe shortages of skilled and
trained workers at all levels. Initially the sectoral objectives related to
the provision of skilled workers and junior technicians until 1978 when the
first Polytechnic Project (Cr. 869) was initiated with the objective of
establishing a new system of post-secondary technical education, to help meet
the need for middle level technicians, and which would gradually replace the
related non degree courses in universities which lacked the facilities and
equipment necessary to run programs producing technicians. The first project
(Ln. 869-IND) was designed for an annual output of 1,340 technicians; this was
followed in 1983 with the Second Polytechnic Project (Ln. 2290-IND) with the
objective of adding an annual output of 5,180 technicians from the polytechnic
system.
2.2       Policy Context.  Repelita III-the third five-year development plan
1979-84-called for an annual average growth rate of 11 percent in industry,
10 percent in transport and communications and 9 percent in construction.
Recognizing that manpower would be a constraint, GOI placed increased emphasis
on expanding education and training. Instead of waiting until 1985 to review
the outcome of the first polytechnic project, GOI decided in 1982 to press
ahead with the second project in the context of the need for technicians to
meet the Repelita III objectives of economic growth.

3.        arodect OJectV  and Description
3.1       Proiect Qbjectives.  The project had three main objectives:
(i) expansion of the polytechnin system through extensions to the six existing
polytechnics provided under Cr. 869-IND and the Polytechnic Mekanik Swiss
(?MS) at Bandunt, andi constructing and equipping eleven new polytechnics to
provide an additioral i4,960 places in the engineering and commerce
polytechnic subsyste-a (ii) increase the number of polytechnic teachers and
develop new and improved courses, curricula and teaching materials; and
(iii) assist the MEC in defining mechanisms for management of the polytechnic
system within the higher education system.
3.2       Proiect ComPonents.  Extension of seven existing polytechnics and
provision of eleven new polytechnics with equipment and furniture; development
of existing courses and introduction of six new engineering and four new
commercial courses; recruitment and tra4ning of teaching staff; and the
development of the Technical Education Development Center (TEDC) into the
Polytechnic Education Development Centar (PEDC).
4.        Project Design and Organization
4.1       Prolect Concept.  The conceptual foundation of the first
Polytechnic Project (Cr. 869-IND) was the need for a new system for the
education of middle level engineering technicians to meet the manpower
requirements of the growing industrial sector rather than attempt to revamp
the unsatisfactory non-degree university programs. At that time, experience
with polytechnics in Indonesia was limited to the successful Polytechnic
Mekanik Swiss which was established in Bandung in 1974 with aid from the
Government of Switzerland. It was decided that schools in the first project
would be located in areas of high industrial deneity. Accordingly, the six
polytechnics comprising the first project, all designed for three-year diploma
courses, were located in Java and in North and South Sumatra. For the Second
Polytechnic Project, GOI. supported by the Bank, decided that growth potential
and equity in the distribution of post-secondary education opportunities would
also be criteria for selecting school locations. In accordance with the new
criteria, one of the 11 new polytechnics was located in an area of high
industrial density, three in industrial growth areas, and seven in more remote
areas of potential growth. GOI, supported by the Bank, decided that the seven
schools in the more remote areas would initially comprise D II diploma courses
pending the expected growth in industry and student demand in those areas.
4.2       The decision to set up the new polytechnic system rather than
revamp the related non-degree university courses was supported by all parties
and, with hindsight, this decision has been proven to be correct. Once this
decision was made, the recognition by MEC and the Bank that the six
polytechnics in the first project could not be a viable system, the plan to
expand the six and add a further eleven schools in a second project was one of
the strong points in project concept. The development of the polytechnic
system did not take into consideration the third level technician training
carried out in line ministries, such as the two and three year diploma courses
carried out for paramedics by the Ministry of Health. MEC was almost
certainly correct in this decision since an effort to integrate the line



-3-
ministries' technician courses would have seriously delayed the development of
the polytechnics.
4.3       In 1984 NEC, with the assistance of an ADB loan, set out to
establish six agricultural polytechnic. with an agricultural polytechnic
development center. In 1985, a specialist electronics polytechnic was started
at Surabaya with aid from the Japan International Cooperative Agency. Both
the a$ricultural project and the electronic project were developed
independently of the engineering and commerce pclytechnic system. The
separate development and management of three polytechnic projects, although
probably unavoidable because of the involvement of three separate aid
agencies, has inhibited the development of an integrated polytechnic system.
When each of the three projects is operational for a period of three to four
years it would be beneficial to GOI to review the total polytechnic system and
develop a national strategy and action plan for the management, operation and
further development of the uystem.
4.4       Innovation.  The project was innovative in so far as that it was a
major extension of a new post-secondary technician education system and
planned to introduce six new engineering diploma courses in aeronautics,
chemical engineering, shipbuilding, energy, foundry and telecommunications and
four new commercial diploma courses in banking, secretarial/office management,
accounting and tourism.
4.5       Scale.  The scale and scope of the project were appropriate in so
far as the project was as large as practicable. In the context of estimated
manpower requirements, the combined first and second polytechnic projects
output was estimated to provide less than 18 percent of total requirements for
middle level technicians. Even though reliable data were scarce it was clear
that the polytechnics would only supply a small percentage of total middle
level technician requirements.
4.6       Preparation.  The project was well prepared in relation to the very
short time given for project preparation. However, the short time available
for preparation resulted in locations being finalized at post appraisal stage
and architectural designs being unavailable for the 11 new schools at date of
Board approval. The tight deadline for preparation also inhibited
coordination with potential cofinancing agencies.
4 7       Timing.  The First Polytechnic Project (Cr. 869-IND) was approved
by the Board in December 1978 while the identification mission for the Second
Project (Ln. 2290-IND) took place about three years later in October 1981,
with appraisal taking place in July 1982. At the appraisal stage for
Ln. 2290-IND, no element of the first project was operational and accordingly
no benefit of operational experience on the first project accrued to the
follow-up project. In practice the two projects overlapped to provide
together the new national engineering and commerce polytechnic subsystem.
4.8       The development of the polytechnic subsystem as a whole benefitted
from the timing of the second project. Both project designs were similar and
the same core team of the Borrower was engaged in the overall polytechnic
system development. Moreover, the six schools from the first project were



-4-
operational while receiving assistance from the sezond project and this
assistance was used very effectively by the polyteahlu1 directors of the six
schools in as&ociation with the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) team. Had
the appraisal of the second project been delayed until operational experience
had been gained from the first project, the cohesivxs development of the system
would not have been possible and sequential implement%tion would probably have
meant a loss, to other duties, of the experienced members of the PIU.
4.9       Rolea and Resgongibilities.  The roles and responsibilities of the
institutions and agencies engaged on the project were clearly defined and
understood. The statue of the polytechnics, which was the &,%me as in the
first project, caused some unease on the Bank side in their baing responsible
to their host university rectors for the administration and menagement of the
polytechnic while the Directorate General of Higher Education, through PEDC.
had responsibility for course and staff development. The division of
authority gave rise to some anxiety on the future autonomy of the polytechnic
in budgetary and educational matters. The Bank's concern related to possible
weakness of the po.ytechnics in fighting for budget allocations after project
completion whilo still under the administrative control of the universities.
The position was reoolved in July ).990 when the Minister of Education issued a
decree which, inter alia, would sever all formal relationships between
polytechnics and their host universities and which would allow the
polytechnics to retain income generated through services to industry. With
regard to PEDC, its role in teacher trairing and course development was well
defined but inadequate attention was paid to its role when the polytechnic
system would become operational.
4.10      Generally implementation was well facilitated by the roles and
responsibilities of the various parties laid down during project preparation.
The relationships ,etween the polytechnic and their host universities varied
but, in most cases were beneficial to the polytechnics in their early stages
of operation. Only in one case was the relationship unsatisfactory where the
university rector virtually took over the duties of the polytechnic direc-.or
and seriously interfered with the educational autonomy of the polytechnic.
5.        Proiect Implement tion
5.1       Overall, project implementation was successful albeit with a
completion period one year longer than planned and a delay of about two years
in --. procurement of the equipment for the engineering courses at the D II
sod. technics.  Due to concerns about employment prospects in a declining
o: struction industry, several polytechnics restricted civil engineering
i±-takes. MEC is now reviewing this policy in view of GOI's policy to expand
major infrastructure and the prospects for local authority employment
following decentralization of public works. Otherwise, components were
implemented as planned with the exception of the technical assistance program,
the postponement of the aeronautics course at Bandung and the non completion
of course notes, by project closing date, for many subjects in the third year
of the engineering courses. As anticipated by the SAR, savings from Cr. 869-
IND were applied to Ln. 2290-IND. The amount totalled US$6.3 million and was
used to fund, partially, the civil works component. Also specific provision
was made in Ln. 2944-IND (Higher Education Development Project) for additional
funds to make up for equipment shortfall (para 5.2). In responding to



b4dgStary constraints, which affected all Bank project& during 1984-86, loan
allocation. were adjusted to include new categoriet of (i) project Taanagement
and (ii) operational expenditure including PEDC training. The budgetary
constraints resulted in a total GOI contribution to the project of US$44.4
million instead of the US$58.4 million anticipated in the SAR.
5.2       The two year delay in *rgineering equipment was due to a shortfall
in project funds of about US$17 million caused by a combination of low SAR
estImAter of requirements, a delay of about 12 months in awaiting decisions
from the State Secretariate (Sec.Neg.) on contract awards, and tL 
depreciation of the US dollar against the currencies of the supplie-s (US$/SDR
rate increased from 1.069 in tu.A 1983 to 1.344 in mid 1988). The shlortfall
was made up through increat       he loan allocation to the equipment category
from available savings in other - tegories and including about US$14 million
for the category under the subsequent Higher Education Development Project
(Ln. 2944-IND).
5.3       The technical assistance planned fcr the project was implemented by
the governments of Switzerland (engineering and management) and Australia
(commerce), with grant funds. This T.A. made a major contribution to the
operational phase of the project and the assistance is expected to continue to
the end of FY94. The bilateral financing of TA released project funds which
were used to expand the teachers' fellowship program to include overseas
degree courses and to increase equipment loan financing. The aeronautics
course at Bandung was postponed by the Director Gener*l of Higher Education
pending agreement on funding from the Aircraft and Aerospace Industry, the
main employer of graduates.
5.4       One of the loan cov- onts, later waived, (Loan Agreement, para
3.02) required that industria_ advisory boards be established for each
polytechnic. Despite the establishment of these boards by decree, and
considerable effort on the part of some schools to implement the decree, no
board ever met more than twice. However, ad hoc liaison with industry grew as
industry began to see the benefits of liaison with the polytechnics. The
liaison blossomed when GOI decreed that polytechnics could retain certain
gene,ated income and some polytechnics began to provide services to industry.
6.   Proiect Results
-6. 1Overview.  The project was generally satisfactory and, together
with the Seventh Education (Polytechnic) Project (Cr. 869-IND), has
astablished a strong and competent group of schools which benefitted from both
projects. The eleven schools which were assisted by the second project (Ln.
2290-IND) still struggle with the basic problems of the initial operational
stage and the slow development of PEDC in the past in non teacher training
areas which resulted in inadequate assistance to the second group of schools
where support was most needed. GOI has decided to concentrate on a five-year
consolidation period, ending in 1994, for the polytechnic system. An in-depth
impact evaluation study at the end of the consolidation period would be
necessary to determine the long term c'ntribution of the polytechnics to
national development.



-6-
6.2       ZnXolMnt  n1AL_WMJut   Table 4A, Part III. ind Annex 2 show the
details of enrollments, intakes and outputs. In 1990/91 total enrollment for
the ergin.ering and commerce sub-system was 13,894 (721 of the target of
19,240. Th'~ enrollment in engineering reached 702 of total and that vf
commerce 77S. The lower figure in engineering is due to the reduction of some
civil eninse.ring classes, postponement of aeronautics and awaiting the return
of 42 graduates to tea n engineering subjects. The overall ratio of
applicants to intakes is satisfactory at 10:1 (8:1 engineering and 14:1
commerce). The overall figure, howeve-, hides a disturbing trend in the sev(en
schools running two-year diploma courses where the average ratio of upplicants
to intakes is almost 2:1 ranging ftom approxivQately 3:1 in Samarinda to 1.3:1
in Manado. While the unsatisfactory figure in Mansdo is influenced by a
slower than expected development of industrial estates, the trend for each of
the schools shows a general deteriorating trend which needs attention from
MEC.  The SAR set a target of 902 of first year intakes obtaini4g diplomas.
While this appears to be an ambitious target it was achieved by the schocGs
assisted by both projects. Corresponding figures for the four new schools
with three-year courses and the seven schools with two-year courses were less
satisfactory at 231 and 28X, respectively.
6.3       leaching Staff.  Tables 4B and 4C of Part III show the figures for
staff recruitment and overseas fellowships. The target of 1,699 new staff
under Ln. 2290-IND, to be added to the 634 teachers recruited under Ln. 869-
IND, was almost reached with a total of 1.531 by 1990/91. Total teaching
staff of 2.334 in the engineering and commerce system represents a current
teacher:student ratio of 1:6 which would increase to 1:8 if the subsyotem
succeeds in reaching the targeted SAR total of 19,240. The project assisted
in overseas degree programs for 219 teachers, not included originally, in an
effort to improve teaching quality (Table 4C, Part III). However, the current
ratio of DIII diploma holders to graduates at 1:0.7 remains too high.
7.   Proiect Sustainability
7.1       One of the risks to project sustainability, identified at
appraisal, was that the polytechnics would receive inadequate funding for
operations and maintenance (0&M) at the level required which would be higher
than average university MtM costs. Two developments have offset this risk to
a large extent: (a) the current 001 policy to provide adequate funding for
O&M generally, and (b) the MEC decree of 1990 which, inter alia, gives
polytechnics the right to retain income generated from commercial and
industrial activities and consultancies. Two polytechnics who anticipated the
1990 decree have been highly successful in income generation. If polytechnic
directors and staff display initiative and diligence, it seems that there is a
wide market for their services in income generating activities. A second risk
to sustainability could be the relatively low salaries of teachers in relation
to those in the private sector, particularly in the boom sectors of banking,
accounting, tourism and electronic engineering. Again, the right to retain
income should offset this risk to some extent, since it could be arranged that
teachers be awardei incentives paid from generated income. One polytechnic
has already succeeded in retaining quality staff, despite stiff industrial
competition, through granting additional payments from generated income.



-7-
7.2       To enhance the sustainab4lity of the benefits of the *ngineering
and commerce polytechnic system, MEC needs to: (i) review the structure of the
National Polytechnic System ensuring that overall control and guidance can be
developed at MEC and that PEDC is improved to develop and monitor education
standards and provide support servicess; and (ii) stren8then teaching quality
through upgrading practical experience of teacher, improving libraries,
developing management skills in each school, developing equipment maintenance
.capabilities and ensuring that safety standards are respected in workshop and
laboratories. Also, PEDC should monitor the trends at the two-year diploma
course schools where there is a decreasing ratio of applicants to intakes and
a high dropout rate. The PEET report, in references to polytechnic system
management and sustainability issues, covers many of the foregoing topics.
8.   Bank Performance
8.1       The main strength of the Bank was that the staff engagei on the
follow-up project during preparation and the early years of supervision were
also engaged in the first polytechnic project. The Bank performed well
through the appraisal stage except perhaps in dealing with possible
cofinancing and in the consideration of the changing roles when the project
moved from implementation to operations. These shortcomings, which were
probably due to the short time available for project preparation, led to the
eventual suspension of the aeronautics course and to a late consideration by
PEDC of its role in an operational system.
8.2       The Bank performed well in project supervision except in the
initial phase when there was no supervision mission during a period of one
year after loan effectiveness. In instituting joint supervision missions with
the Swiss and Australi*n parallel financiers, the Bank's supervision quality
improved due to the increased technical strength of joint missions and the
ability to cover more project institutes. The joint missions were also
popular with the Borrower and helped in maintaining cohesiveness in project
impl snentation.
8.3       Lessons.  The main lessons which may be relevant to other Bank
financed projects are:
(a)  the capability demonstrated by MEC to undertake satisfactorily the
design, implementation and operation of two complex averlapping
projects in a new subsector;
(b)  the need to review carefully the timing of follow-up projects and
to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of sequential or
overlapping projects;
(c)  the need to ensure that arrangements for all aspects of equipment
procurement-funding, specifications, contracts and supply dates--
are firmly in place before final decisions are made on initial
dates of operations;
(d)  the importance of the competence and character of the director of a
school; this lesson is reinforced by experience gained in the
ougoing Ln. 2542-IND (Health Manpower Project) and attention to the



- 8 -
appointment of suitable school directors in project documents
should be considared;
(e) the ne-d to make provisions for the changing role of units such as
PEDC when the emphasis changes from project development and
implementation to operations;
(f) the need to make provision for permanent institutional arrangements
for maintenance of equipment in subsystems such as the
polytechnics;
(g) the futility of mandating liaison with industry on a formal basis;
industry saw no incentive in such liaison but effective ad hoc
liaison came about when industry recognized how they could benefit
from the polytechnic system; and
(h) the improvement in supervision quality and coverage through joint
supervision missions with parallel or cofinanciers.
9.        Borrower's Performance
9.1       Preparation and Implementation.  The strong performance of the
Borrower was a feature of the preparation and most of the implementation phase
of the project. The experienced core team engaged in the first project also
managed the second project for most of the implementation period. With the
exception of the delay in some critical equipment, the Borrower performed well
in project preparttion. implementation and project management up to within 18
months of loan closing. A change in project management in mid-1988 resulted
in a noticeable deterioration in the Borrower's performance. The change
resulted in the transfer of project management responsibilities from Bandung,
where all staff and agencies most experienced in polytechnic development were
situated. to Jakarta. The Borrower's management of the project came in for
heavy criticism in the PEET report written towards the end o3f 1989. A third
change in project management in 1990 transferred responsibility back to
Bandung but this was too late in the implementation process to affect project
outcome.
9.2      fteration.  In the initial years of the subsystem's operation, the
Borrower's performance has been noticeably weaker than in project preparation
and implementation. PEDC has performed well in teacher training but has not
fully met its responsibility for the supply of course notes, particularly for
the senior classes, or for curricula updating. The PEDC staff suffers from a
lack of industrial and commercial experience and this weakness needs to be
addressed if the polytechnics, particularly the newer and less able D II
schools, are to keep abreast of the changing requirements of industry and
commerce. These shortcomings need to be addressed by the strengthening of
PEDC through employing staff with the relevant qualifications and experience.
9.3       Lessons.  The main lessons from the project for the Borrower ares



(a)  the need to plan at an early stage for the operational phase of the
project;
(b)  the risks in deciding on operational dates for courses without firm
arrangements being in place for equipment delivery;
(c)  the underostimation of competition from the private sector in
attracting suitable candidates for teaching in telecommunications,
electronices. banking and tourism;
(d)  the disadvantages of appointing a Jakarta based project manager
when project staff continued -g be based in Bandung; and
(e)  the difficulties which resulted from delegating project
implementation duties to project site units without first
establishing clear control and reporting procedures.
10. Project Relationshins
10.1      Generally the project relationships between the Bank and Borrower
were satisfactory and were a continuation of the amicable and mutually
beneficial relationships which existed under the first polytechnic project.
In general, the individual polytechnics have developed good relationships with
industry and commerce.
11. Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
11.1      The project consultants were provided through grants from the Swiss
and Australian governments. Civil works were executed by local contractors
and apart from problems and delays in some of the smaller remote schools, they
performed adequately. Overall, equipment suppliers performed well with the
exception of a group of local agents who has been reluctant to carry out
repairs and maintenance. The difficulty of equipment repair, particularly in
the less densely populated locations, is a cross-sectoral problem and one that
should be given more attention at the project preparation stage. Furniture,
which was centrally procured in the first project (Cr. 869-IND) and was
satisfactory, was procured locally at each polytechnic and the results were
mixed, with some schools being supplied with substandard furniture that has
not stood up to the wear and tear anticipated by the project specifications.
12. Prolect Documentation and Data
12.1      The legal agreement was adequate and the SAR, particularly the well
set out tables, was invaluable to Bank and Borrower during implementation.
12.2      Data relevant to the preparation of the PCR was readily available
although the final data dealing with internal efficiency and the like and the
project accounts had to be collected from each individual polytechnic. This
was a result of the delegation of some project implementation duties to units
at each host university without first establishing control and reporting
procedures between the units and the PMU. PEDC is, however, now engaged in
centralizing all polytechnic data and updating them on a regular basis.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
SECOND POLYTECHNIC PROJECT
(LOAN 2290-IND)
PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
General
We agreo with the data in Part III.
1.  Coment of Analysis in Part I
Parsarrgh 2.2
To be more specific, the objective of pressing ahead the second
polytechnic project was to meet the skilled manpower requirement to support
the industrial and economic growth especially in East Indonesia.
Paraaranh 3.1
As an addition to point (iii), the project objective was to assist
the NEC not only in defining mechanisms for management of the polytechnic
system within the higher education system, but also in project planning and
feasibility studies by providing consultant services and fellowships.
ParagraDh 4.3
Integration of the management system as well as creation of a
special unit for professional education within the DGHE is now in the process
of implementation based on the Law No.2, 1989, By Law (PP) No.30, 1990, and
other Ministry decrees.
Paraaranh 4.5
Based on the needs of skilled manpower, the scale of the project is
relatively small. However, based on the manageability and practicability, the
project size is large.
ParaaraDh 4.10
Following the decision of the DGHE to give autonomy to the
polytechnics. such situation is resolved.



- 12 -
Paragraoh 5.1
The Hinistry has decided, in cooperation with Garuda and IPTN, to
start a degree course at ITB in year 1991/92 with an intake of 24 and are now
considering the diploma course in Polytechnic Bandung. The incompletion of
course note writing was mainly due the philosophical changes in the use of
course notes.
Paragraph 9.1
The noticeable deterioration in the borrower's performance was not
only caused by the changes in project management, but also caused by the new
policy in project management introduced by the Government, where it was
decided to decentralize the project. This decision was not directly followed
with a clear operational guidelines, so that both Central PIU and local
project directors developed their own perception concerning of the system,
resulting in a chaotic situation with overlapping and unclear
responsibilities.
Parazraph 11
Most of the local suppliers are general trade companies and they
have no adequate workshop and technicians to do the repair works. Further
more, since the equipments ordered by polytechnics are specific equipment with
only limited customers, it is not economically feasible for them to establish
such workshops and technicians. Therefore, it is difficult for them to do the
repair works after the guarantee periods is expired.
2.   Proiect Implementation
2.1       Policy.  Step taken to start the second polytechnics project
overlapping with the first has been a just decision. By pressing ahead the
second phase, fulfillment of manpower need would be closer to the National
Development target beside avoiding gap in funding need. During implementation
of the project, several changes in policy and procedures were made by GOI in
the project decentralization and contract award, as well as by the Bank in the
payment procedures from direct payment to special account for contract under
US$50,000. The new policies were meant to simplify monitoring.. However, as
clear operation guidelines were not directly introduced, adjustment had to be
made causing some delays. The consequences of these changes will be discussed
further later.
2.2       Civil Work.  Total volume of civil work targeted in the SAR was
164,200 m2. In the realization a total floor area of 236.400 m2 construction
work had been achieved. The work includes 121,623 m2 extension of
polytechnics and PEDC, and 114,773 m2 new polytechnics. The enlargement of
the total area for buildings and utilities was made based on the review of
needs without exceeding the allocated budget. This was made possible by using
the BAPPENAS standard cost which was lower than planned in the SAR. After
operation it was proven that the addition of floor area had been a just
decision to better meet the real need. Due to lengthy awarding process and
the devaluation of Rupiah completion of civil work was delayed for about one



- 13 -
year. however. the education program had not been effected seriously by the
completion of the buildings.
2.3       F llawshi2    In country fellowships for short courses was planned
in the SAR for 10.5 man years of teacher training. In the implementation 219
staffs had been sent abroad. This was made possible due to additional
fellowship reallocated from the technical advisor budget replaced by grants
from the Swiss and Australian Governments. The decision to increase the
fellowship was directed to obtain better qualified teachers in significant
number.
2.4       Eguigments and Materials.  Purchase of equipment had been carried
out through both local and international competitive bidding with a total
disbursement of US$64.2 million. Due to some shortages in GOI funds and as a
consequence of depreciation of the US Dollar, completion of D2 equipment
supply was delayed for about 2 years. Steps were taken to make up the
shortfall. However, because of the lengthy awarding procedure the contract
could be made effactive only after August. 1988. As a consequence of the
equipment delay, the courses for the first batches of students had to be
rearranged. Some of the workshop and lab work were carried out using existing
focilities in the surrounding industry or vocational training institutions.
Even though, such efforts had not been able to avoid postponement of the first
graduation for one semester beyond curriculum requirement. For Chemical
Engineering and Energy Technology difficulties in tendering the utility had
caused long delays in completion of some equipment installation. Steps were
taken to rearrange the courses and to tend students to PEDC to do the
necessary practical work.
2.5       Manatement and Monitoring.  Due to budgetary problems on the GOI
side, it was decided that for budget year of 1987/88 the management and
monitoring activities should be covered from the loan. For the last periods
of the project no more allocation was available for this purpose causing
difficulties for the CPIU to monitor Polytechnics and to control reimbursement
process.
2.6       Operational.  An allocation was also made available from the loan
in the amount of US$5 million for polytechnics operation, channelled through
their host Universities. This policy caused difficulty later to control and
monitoring the reimbursement process.
2.7       Educ8tional Programs.  During the course of the project, 1531
staffs had been recruited out of 1700 planned in the SAR. Difficulty in
getting the needed quality and professional background had been hindering the
achievement of the targeted figure as scheduled. Consequently, out of the
planned total of 19,240 student enrollment, only about 14,000 could be
accepted in the 1990/91 academic year. In some polytechnics the student to
teacher ratios are low. This does not automatically mean that teacher needs
are fulfilled. For small Polytechnics with small number of student but with
the same number of subjects to be taught a relatively high student to teacher
ratio is understandable.
2.8       The PEDC.  It is clearly stated in the SAR that the task of PEDC
was to set up and coordinate Polytechnics in terms of providing syllabi,



- 14 -
teachware, and pretraining for Polytechnics teachers. The eyllabi for both
Engineering and Commerce had been prepared for both D2 and D3 programs. The
teachware production, especially the D2 course notes, had not been fully
realized. This was due to a change in policy in the selection of teaching
methods. As teachers were getting more experienced in teaching, they were
urged to develop their own materials. Emphasis then were placed on the
provision of text books and translations. Within the last three years of the
project, when the pretraining activity was reduced, PEDC directed its programs
to upgrade teaching quality of Polytechnics through curriculum adjustments and
staff retraining. Short assistance were given to Polytechnics in cooperation
with the Swiss and Australian projects. Further Polytechnic development will
be carried out through a consolidation progranme where for the next three
years PEDC will play a vital role in planning, executing, and monitoring.
3.   Bank Performance
Along the course of the project relation between the Bank and the
borrower had been good. The role of RSI in Jakarta had been helpful for the
borrower especially in coordinating the reimbursement process and bridging
differences in policies of the GOI and the Bank. From the borrower's point of
view the RSI could be given larger role and authority to make decision in
order to speed up solution of urgent problems. Regular supervision missions
had been effectively conducted by the Bank particularly in assisting the
borrower to identify and solve problems.
4.   Borrower's Performance
Weak performances of the borrower were found mostly during
implementation of the project. The source of this could always be traced back
to the project management at central or system level as well as at local or
institution (Polytechnic and the mother University) level. Lack of
experienced managerial and administrative staff particularly in dealing with
complicated regulations and procedures sometimes inhibited the project from
progressing smoothly. The change of policy by the GOI to decentralize the
project in particular had created difficulties in controlling and monitoring
contractual and financial matters. In the case of teaching in the
Polytechnics and PEDC, weak performance could be traced back to the
difficulties in recruiting qualified candidates for teachers and master
teachers. This problem could only be solved by a long term effort to make
teaching assignment comparatively attractive within existing industrial and
business environment. In spite of the weaknesses encountered in the project,
the resul;s had been encouraging judging from the achievement of the main
objectives. The newly established courses and Polytechnics had been operating
smoothly to produce graduates before the project terminated. The graduates
could easily find jobs in industry and business where their employers were
generally satisfied and more experienced, and Polytechnic education was
getting known and understood nationwide, quality of students and teachings
tended to improve gradually.

5.   Lesson Learned
The main lesson which may be relevant to other similar project
financed by loans in human resource development are:
(a) Within the feasibility study, the scale of the development related
to the availability of human resource needed to support the
implementation should be taken into consideration.
(b) Trainings for managerial and administrative personnel should be
included in the plan, starting from the early stage of the project.
(c) For a long term project in education, major reviews should be
included within the course of implementation to adjust the program
to the changing trends and situations related to the objectives.
(d) As sustainability of the system resulted from the project includes
capability to sustain self development, critical assessment should
be conducted before termination of the implementation to consider
further steps to be taken.
