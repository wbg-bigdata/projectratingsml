I. THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE AND MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT
Sector Setting
1.01      Manpower Demand.  The shortage of skilled and trained manpower is a
major constraint to economic growth in Indonesia and achievement of the
planned growth targets will require an increased supply of skilled manpower at
all levels - skilled worker, technician, and professional. Manpower
development is required, in both quality and quantity, to consolidate the
present position and to provide the base for future economic expansion. The
estimation of manpower requirements in Indonesia, particularly at subsectoral
levels, suffers from serious gaps in data: estimates of demand, therefore,
provide only broad indicators of priorities and magnitudes rather than precise
projections. On the basis of available data, including 1980 census figures,
demand for technicians is estimated to grow at around 4.3% p.a. between 1980
and 1990, representing an additional 371,000 workers at this level over the
ten-year period. Of this total, about two thirds would be required in
engineering specializations and one third in commerce. Government, services,
construction, and modern manufacturing sectors show large projected demands
for engineering technicians; middle-level staff trained in commercial fields
would be required in large numbers in the trade, government, and services
sectors (Table 1.1).

1.02      Manpower Supply.  Of the approximately 371,000 technicians required
during 1980-90 only about 5,000 p.a., or 14% of the requirement, could be
supplied from the existing formal educational system. It is estimated that
about 40%O could be supplied by various in-service training schemes and
upgrading, leaving about 45% or 167,000 technicians positions to be filled
through additional routes including expansion of the formal educational
system. Since the early 1970s the Government has sought to strengthen the
capacity of the formal system to produce the skilled manpower necessary for
industrial growth. While substantial progress has been made at the secondary
level, where the output from vocational schools nearly doubled during 1970-80,
progress has been slow at the diploma level, the major source of supply for
technician or middle-level manpower. The creation of a network of technician
training institutions within the formal educational system began only in 1976
with the establishment of the Swiss-assisted Polyteknik Mekanik Swiss,
followed in 1982 by the opening of six polytechnics established under the
Polytechnic I Project (Cr. 869-IND). Current enrollments in university
diploma-granting programs in technical/commercial fields represent only 9% of
total tertiary enrollment. Tertiary level enrollment is itself only 3% of the
relevant age group, among the lowest in countries in the East Asia Region.
The present output from existing university diploma engineering and commerce
courses is estimated to be about 2,500 annually (Table 1.2) and is expected
to double by 1990. Part of this increase will be provided by the contribution
from the first group of six Bank-assisted polytechnics - about 1,000 in 1985
rising to 1,300 in 1986.
The Ministry of Education and Culture (NIEC)
1.03      Structure. The system of formal education in Indonesia at present
consists of a six-year primary cycle, a six-year secondary cycle divided
into two three-year segments, and a tertiary cycle including (a) one to three
year diploma programs, (b) four to seven year Sarjana (Sl) degree courses,
(c) the two-year Pasca Sarjana (S2) postgraduate courses, and finally
(d) two-year Doctor's (S3) degree courses (Chart 1). Vocational and technical
programs are available in specialized schools and programs from the junior
secondary level through university. Secondary and tertiary institutions
operate under both public MEC and other government ministries - and private
auspices. Among tertiary institutions, the standard of training is generally
higher at the public institutions, but there are some exceptions. Nonformal
training arrangements, both public and private, supplement the formal
programs.

1.04      Administration.  Presidential Decree No. 34 of 1972 assigns overall
authority for education and training, including technical education, to the
MEC but divides operational responsibility among the MEC (general and voca-
tional education) and other bodies including, the Department of Manpower
(specialized and vocational training) and the Nlational Institute of Public
Administration (civil service training).  The decree authorizes the TEC to
define the functional working relationships of these agencies and to regulate
education and training programs of all other government and nongovernment
institutions. Within the MEC, secondary-level technical education is regu-
lated by the Directorate General for Primary and Secondary Education. The
Directorate General for Higher Education (DGHE) is responsible for all
tertiary-level public education including the diploma programs in engineering
and com-nerce offered by the universities and polytechnics. The DGHIE, through
its coordinator for private higher institutions, also monitors the operations
of around 360 private institutions which now account for well over half of all
tertiary enrollments (both degree and diploma programs) in technical and
commercial studies.
1.05      F-Financing.  Central government expenditure on education as a whole
rose from around 2% of GDP in early seventies to about 2.4% in 1982/33.  This
is low when compared to other East Asian countries such as Korea and Malaysia
where comparable figures were 7.7% and 5.2%, respectively. The government
budget for education in 1982/83 as a percentage of total budget on public
expenditures (7.2%) is below the average for comparable countries in East Asia
where, with the exception of China, central government expenditure on educa-
tion as a proportion of total government expenditure averages about 16%.
However, if Indonesia-s large private education sector is taken into account,
the total expenditure on education would approach the regional average. Of
total government expenditure on education over the six-year period, approxi-
mately 67% was devoted to the I4EC. Over the eight-year period between 1975/76
and 1982/83, expenditures for higher education increased at an average annual
rate of 23%. In 1982/83 total allocations to higher education represented 19%
of the MEC budget, compared to 5% in the early 1970s. The significant
increase in expenditures on higher education indicates the Government's
emphasis on this subsector. Data on expenditures in tertiary-level technical
education are not available as polytechnic operation began only in September
1982. The current percentages of capital and routine /1 education budget
allocation in the total government budget are 8.4% and 6.2%, respectively,
indicating that there is a wide margin for further incremnental increases in
educational expenditures.
/1 Routine expenditure is a term used in Indonesian government budget docu-
ments. It is not the same as recurrent expenditure. Frequently the
development budget includes some recurrent expenditure such as
incremental operating costs in development projects.

Issues in Technician Education
1.06      Overview.  Major slhortcomings in the existing system of technician
education which inhibit its response to increasing demands for middle-level
manpower are:
(a) inadequate classroom and laboratory facilities;
(b)  shortages of technical teachers;
(c)  a narrow range of curricula;
(d)  lack of good teaching materials;
(e)  low internal efficiency; and
(f)  absence of a well-defined planning and management system.
1.07      Inadequate Facilities.  The lack of classroom and laboratory
accommodation is one of the main reasons for the shortfall in the supply of
technical manpower in Indonesia. In addition to the six new polytechnics
which started in 1982, engineering technicians are being trained through
diploma programs at 8 public universities with an enrollment of 4,500
students and at some 200 private universities, institutes, and academies
enrolling around 18,000 students. Diploma-level business training of varying
quality is offered by 14 public universities in programs enrolling around
4,000 students and by some 160 private institutes with enrollments of around
17,000 (Table 1.2). Many charge substantial fees, three to four times the
average level for public institutions. Both the high fees and the urban
location of most private institutions limit student access. The diploma
programs at the public universities generally do not have adequate facili-
ties: some use space rented in STMs; laboratory and workshop equipment is
lacking; and staff are in short supply and underqualified or excessively
academic. The private technician courses experience the same problems,
particularly the deficiencies in equipment and staffing. Output from the
existing public and private engineering programs at the technician level is
very low; with only about 5% to 10% of those enrolled graduating, i.e. about
2,500 p.a. To compensate for the general shortage of graduates from formal
technician education programs, some government departments and semi-public
and private industries have initiated inservice training programs to train
technicians. However, shortfalls continue and some private firms are still
filling technicians' jobs with expatriates because local staff are not
available. By 1985, the new polytechnics will begin to supply high quality
technicians in the basic engineering fields - civil, mechanical, and elec-
trical - but in numbers far below the projected demand. Moreover, shortages
in other specialized technical fields will continue to hamper efforts to
expand and diversify the economy.
1.08      Teacher Shortages.  The shortage of technical teachers is the
critical constraint to the rapid expansion of technician level education in

Indonesia.  Most countries have recognized the need to set up facilities to
train teachers for technician level training but Indonesia did not have such a
facility until the Technician Education Development Center, financed under the
Polytechnic I Project, opened in 1981. Moreover, it has no pool of qualified
and experienced technicians on which to draw to provide a teaching force. In
implementing the first project, the government had to rely solely on graduates
from secondary technical schools as the source of staff for the new polytech-
nics but from 1985 the main source would be the output from the polytechnics.
To expand the polytechnic system on the scale planned in the second poly-
technic project would require around 1700 new teachers. Given competing
demands from the industrial sector where salaries are markedly higher than in
education, the high cost of expatriates, and the scarcity of university
graduates in technical and commercial fields the government will need to
continue to recruit relatively inexperienced staff to the polytechnics and
provide considerable in-service training and experience; e.g. training of at
least three years duration for secondary technical school graduates and one
year for polytechnic graduates. Following this training it would be necessary
to provide appropriate compensation and incentives to retain the teachers in
the polytechnic service.
1.09      Range of Training Programs.  The Government commissioned consultant
studies in sub-sectors where present and planned investments are likely to
create new or increased demand for middle level manpower. These studies,
which were carried out by specialists working with the Government in Bank-
financed or bilateral assistance programs provided estimates of the demand in
quantitative and qualitative terms for technicians in the following sectors:
telecommunications, chemical engineering and processing, refrigeration and air
conditioning, aeronautics, power and energy, foundry and shipbuilding and
repair. A study of the supply and demand of manpower at middle level in
business showed industry-s growing demands for well-trained, middle-level
staff in general and office administration and in specialist fields such as
accountancy, data processing, and banking. In order to train technician-level
manpower in these fields it would be necessary to design new courses, develop
teaching material, establish laboratory and workshop facilities and train
specialist teachers.
1.10      Teaching Materials.  Many of the existing university diploma courses
employ degree course syllabi and materials and much of the content is not
relevant to the employment needs of technicians. With the establishment of
the TEDC, well designed courses and relevant teaching materials have been
prepared for the polytechnics - but only in the basic mechanical, electrical
and civil engineering fields. Technicians are needed in a wide range of other
subsectors for which courses and teaching material needs to be prepared.
1.11      Internal Efficiency.  The output from most of the existing public
and private technician level courses is very low; only about 5-10% of those
enrolled graduate, i.e. about 2,500 in 1981. There appear to be many reasons
- lack of motivation, poor selection of students, lack of discipline, poor
facilities, low quality of teaching and high costs of private courses. By
contrast the Polyteknik Mekanik Swiss and the TEDC have had success rates of
more than 90%.

1.12      Planning and Management.  Responsibility for physical planning,
development and staffing of the first six polytechnics has rested with the
MEC's Project Implementation Unit (PIU) set up under the Polytechnic I
Project. The polytechnics are located on university campuses and their
directors are responsible to the university rectors through the deans of
undergraduate studies. As these polytechnics become fully operational and
more are built, the MEC, as presently designed, will face problems in
managing the expanded polytechnic subsystem within the higher education
system.
Subsector Investment Strategy
1.13      Government Strategy.  The Government aims to increase the supply
of middle-level manpower by creating a nationwide system of polytechnics.
In the first phase of this educational development program, the six
polytechnics financed under the Polytechnic I project opened in September
1982. The project now proposed would launch a second phase, designed to
further expand and strengthen polytechnic facilities and broaden the range
of specialist technician courses in fields in which needs have been
recognized, including commerce.  The rate of polytechnic expansion will be
constrained by the rates at which new facilities can be created and teaching
staff trained. Staff development would be the major constraint. The main
source of new technical teachers would be the graduates from the first six
polytechnics and it is envisaged that 20 to 25% of the first three years
output, 1985 to 1987, would be recruited and trained as teachers for the
second phase polytechnics. From 1988 the larger output of polytechnic
graduates would provide the source of teachers for further expansion through
a third polytechnic project.
1.14      Bank Lending Strategy.  To date the Bank Group has financed
12 education projects in Indonesia. Investments have pursued the main
objectives of meeting critical manpower requirements, improving quality, and
increasing equity.  Five projects address quantitative expansion and quali-
tative improvement of basic education: the Nonformal Education Project
(Ln. 1486-IND) which concentrates on adult and nonformal education; the
First and Second Textbook Projects (Cr. 387-IND and Ln. 2102-IND) which are
assisting with textbook production and distribution and related teacher
training; and the First and Second Teacher Training Projects (Ln. 1433-IND
and Ln. 2101-IND) which aim to upgrade the qualifications of primary and
secondary school teachers. Six projects have focussed on expanding and
strengthening vocational and technical education: the First Education
Project (Cr. 219-IND) and the Fourth Education Project (Ln. 1237-IND) have
provided assistance to vocational education while the First and Second
Agricultural Training Projects (Cr. 288-IND and Ln. 1692-IND), the First
Polytechnic Project (Cr. 869-IND) and University Development I (Ln.
1904-IND) have financed agricultural training, technician training, and
university degree training in science and engineering. The First Public
Works Manpower Development Project (Ln. 2258-IND) is financing training to
upgrade manpower in the Public Works sector. OED Project Performance Audit

Works Manpower Development Project (Ln. 2258-IND) is financing training to
upgrade manpower in the Public Works sector.  OED Project Performance Audit
Reports (PPAR) have been prepared for two completed projects and the lessons
of experience have been incorporated in the design of the proposed project.
The PPAR for the Technical Education Project, (Credit 219-IND) (No. 2998,
dated June 2, 1980, SecM80-440) stresses the importance of including fellow-
ships for development of teachers and school administrators, and appointing
key staff for project implementation in a timely manner. The PPAR on the
First Agricultural Training Project (Credit 288-IND) (No. 3058, dated
June 30, 1980, SecM80-527), stresses the importance of advanced preparation
and the need for carefully designed and suitable technical assistance compo-
nents. The Bank is responding to long term needs in several education and
training subsectors by initiating a series of repeater projects, e.g., in
agricultural training, teacher training, textbooks, and more recently, in
the development of the polytechnic and university subsectors. Apart from
education projects per se, the Bank is also helping the Government to over-
come manpower constraints in specific sectors through a series of training
projects, and project-related training in a variety of sectors, e.g. power
and health. The future Bank-lending program includes a proposed industrial
training project which would complement the polytechnic project. Other
assistance to technical education by the Asian Development Bank, Australia,
Japan and the Netherlands has been directed primarily to strengthening STMs
and vocational schools and to providing secondary teacher upgrading in
commerce education.
TI. THE PROJECT
Objectives
2.01       In support of the Government's plan to increase the supply of
middle-level manpower by expanding, strengthening, and diversifying the
polytechnic system begun under the Polytechnic I Project, the proposed
project would pursue the following objectives:
(a)  expand polytechnic enrollments and output by constructing,
equipping and staffing seven extensions to existing polytechnics
and eleven new polytechnics which upon completion would accom-
modate about 15,000 students;
(b) increase the number of technical teachers and develop new
and improved curricula and teaching materials by financing
construction, equipment and technical assistance to establish
a Polytechnic Education Development Center (PEDC); and
(c) assist the MEC in defining appropriate mechanisms for management
of the expanded polytechnic subsystem within the higher education
system and supporting project planning and feasibility studies
by providing consultant services and fellowships.

Components
A.  Polytechnics (proposed outlay US$147.4 million, including contingencies)
2.02      The objective of this component would be to expand technician
enrollments and output and diversify courses through provision of additional
polytechnic facilities (paras. 1.07 to 1.11). The project would finance the
following: construction of the polytechnics; equipment; overseas fellow-
ships for polytechnic teachers and administrators, and consultant services
to assist with the introduction of planned new specializations. The
additional facilities would be provided by construction of extensions to the
six polytechnics established under the Polytechnic I Project and to the
Swiss-assisted Polyteknik Mekanik (PMS) and construction of eleven new
institutions.
2.03      Administration.  As in the case of the six polytechnics estab-
lished under the Polytechnic I Project, the new institutions included in the
proposed project would be located within university campuses, but their
training objectives would be distinct from those of the universities.  The
polytechnic directors would be responsible to the university rectors,
through the deans of undergraduate studies, for the management of the poly-
technics. Overall polytechnic development would be coordinated by the DGHE;
the PEDC would have special responsibility for course and staff development.
Each polytechnic would comprise a director, an assistant director and four
functional units responsible for administration, teaching programs, student
services and liaison with business and industry. An advisory board would be
established for each new polytechnic and would include provincial represen-
tatives from the Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Development Board and
industry. Advisory boards would provide liaison with local enterprises on
matters such as advising on program development, assisting in arranging
on-the-job training for polytechnic students, and providing part-time
instructors from local businesses and industries. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that, as with the first six polytechnics: (a) an
advisory board would be established within six months of the opening of each
new polytechnic; and (b) the functions and composition of the boards would be
satisfactory to the Bank.
2.04      Location.  The seven existing polytechnics to which extensions
would be added are located in four provinces in Java and two provinces in
Sumatera on the following university campuses: Indonesia (Jakarta),
Brawijaya (Malang), Diponegoro (Semarang), North Sumatera (Medan), Sriwijaya
(Palembang), and the ITB (Bandung) - (both the polytechnic and the
Polyteknik Mekanik Swiss). Annex 2 shows basic data on the polytechnic
locations. Industrial density was the major factor in the Government's
selection of these original locations. For the eleven new polytechnics, the
locations have been determined on the basis of both industrial growth,
actual and potential, and equity in the distribution of post-secondary
educational opportunities. The new locations cover a wide geographical
area from Aceh to Ambon. The four large new engineering polytechnics will
be located in areas of relatively high population density and industrial

growth; one is located in Java, two in Sumatera and one in Sulawesi.  Each
polytechnic is associated with a regional university: Andalas (Padang),
Hasanuddin (Ujung Pandang), ITS (Surabaya), and Lhok Seumawe (Syiah Kuala).
It is understood that the suitability of the site at Lhok Seumawe would be
reviewed by a Bank mission before September 1983. Seven smaller polytechnics
would be located in relatively less developed areas in Kalimantan, Sulawesi,
Seram, Timor, and Bali, specifically to support regional infrastructure
development and related construction industries. These institutions would
be sited on the following university campuses: Udayana (Denpasar), Nusa
Cendana (Kupang), Mulawarman (Samarinda), Lampung Mangkurat (Banjarmasin),
Pattimura (Ambon), Sam Ratulangi (Manado), and Tanjungpura (Pontianak).
2.05      Course Development.  Polytechnic developments would include
additional courses in the three basic engineering fields established in the
Polytechnic I Project (civil, electrical and mechanical) including
diversification into mechanical power and energy and electronics; the
introduction of six new engineering specializations related to existing and
planned industrial development - aeronautical engineering, chemical process
engineering, telecommunications, shipbuilding and repair, refrigeration and
air conditioning and foundry, and the introduction of four commercial areas -
secretarial/office practices, accounting, banking and tourism. The banking
courses would be introduced at Jakarta, Semarang, Bandung and Medan only and a
tourism course only at Denpasar. All courses would emphasize practical
application in business and industry. In engineering courses laboratory work
and workshop projects would occupy about 40% of student time. Likewise, in
commerce, about 40% of student time would be spent on practical office and
business skills.
2.06      The majority of new courses in both engineering and commerce would
be of three years duration as in the six existing polytechnics but in the
seven smaller polytechnics in the less developed areas the courses initially
would be of only two years duration. These two-year courses would provide
broad-based training in engineering or business relevant to the job needs of
the regions. In engineering this would include civil engineering for the
public works and construction sector and mechanical and electrical maintenance
engineering, particularly for construction machinery and plant maintenance.
Commerce courses would be introduced initially in only three of these seven
polytechnics: in each case they would include broad courses in secretarial
studies and accountancy but at Denpasar (Bali) a three-year course in tourism
would also be developed.
2.07      The polytechnic accommodation provided under the project would
comprise classrooms (27%), laboratories and workshops (50%), and communal and
administration facilities (23%). There would be no provision of staff or
student housing.
2.08      Enrollment and Intake.  The proposed project would increase the
overall intake capacity of the polytechnic system by 5,740 to a total of
7,200 places. Of the new first year places there would be about 3,770 in
engineering and about 1,970 in commerce as shown in Table 2.1. Annex 3

shows the first year intake in each polytechnic by specialization. The total
enrollment in the polytechnics would reach nearly 20,000 by 1989 (Table 2.2).
The additional intake of 5,700 students in the polytechnic system would
represent a 10% increase over the 1981/82 intake at public institutions of
higher learning.

2.09      Students recruited to the polytechnics would be graduates of senior
secondary schools - general secondary (SMAs), commercial secondary (SMEAs),
and secondary technical schools (STMs). The number of secondary school
graduates far exceeds the intake of existing and planned places in degree and
diploma courses, the ratio being 70:1 with respect to the 5,700 new places in
the polytechnic system. The output of secondary school graduates in each
region in 1980/81 exceeded the proposed first-year polytechnic enrollment by
considerable margins, ranging from the lowest of 6:1 at Samarinda up to the
highest of 134:1 at Surabaya (Annexes 2 and 3). In 1982, the first year of
operation, and with no publicity in the schools, there were about 10,000
applicants for the 1,000 places in the six new polytechnics. Selection would
be based on the results of a national entrance examination, set centrally and
taken locally, and interviews. This selection procedure was introduced for
the first polytechnic entry in 1982. The first semester curricula provide
alternative streams to overcome differences in academic backgrounds of SMA and
STM graduates, e.g. supplementary mathematics and basic science for STM
graduates and extra workshop technology for SMA graduates.
2.10      Output and Internal Efficiency.  Overall, as a result of the
proposed project, the annual output of polytechnic diploma holders would
increase from about 1,000 in 1985 (the first year-s output of the six new
polytechnics) to about 6,500 by 1989. Of the total annual output of 5,200
graduates produced under the proposed project, 3,400 would be in engineering
and 1,800 in commerce. Total output, however, would be expected to exceed
6,500 as the polytechnics introduce part-time and upgrading courses in
response to local needs, as in the PMS Bandung. The proposed project



- 14 -
institutions are expected to achieve a significantly higher internal effi-
ciency than that of existing diploma courses, with 90% of the first year
student intake obtaining diplomas. Factors contributing to the high gradua-
tion rate would include: (a) the introduction of relevant student selection
procedures which include attitude testing and consequent high student
motivation; (b) the high standard of courses with good facilities and
equipment and well trained staff; and (c) the expectation of tl-,e students that
on successful completion of training they could expect good jobs. There is
supporting evidence for these assumptions from the experience of the
Swiss assisted polytechnic where there is a high pass rate and the pay of the
graduates' first job is comparatively high.
2.11       Staffing.  About 1,700 teachers would need to be recruited and
trained between 1984 and 1988 to staff the extensions and new polytechnics
planned under the proposed project. Around 1,000 of the required teachers
would be engineering teachers and workshop instructors and 700 would be in
commerce and general subjects (Table 2.3 and Annex 4). Training of the new
polytechnic staff would begin in 1984 in the TEDC with a first batch of 120
trainees recruited from STM graduates and continue from 1985 with polytechnic
graduates as the main source, as shown in Annex 5. In addition to the
teaching staff it would also be necessary to select, appoint and train about
70 senior staff for the new polytechnics including principals and heads of
teaching and administrative departments.

Source: Annex 5 (Totals rounded).
2.12       Bearing in mind the lack of initial qualifications and experience
of new staff, the project would finance a total of 63 man-years of overseas
fellowships for polytechnic administrators and for selected teachers,
particularly those responsible for new specializations and those identified



- 15 -
as potential section or department heads (Table 2.4 and Annex 6).  During
appraisal, the schedule of appointment and training - preservice, inservice.
and overseas - of polytechnic staff, and the criteria and procedures for
selection of fellowship recipients, were decided upon.
2.13      The major risk to the proposed project is the potential loss of
trained teachers and workshop instructors to better paid posts in industry.
The system of bonding of staff as a condition of training would help to
prevent loss in the short term. Other incentives such as loans for purchase
of housing, especially in remote areas, could also reduce losses. The
problem is important and the staffing situation should be closely monitored
by the government to identify the magnitude of attrition at an early stage.
The University Development I Project (Ln 1904-IND) includes a feasibility
study of "financial and administrative schemes to enable university teaching
staff to devote their full time to their university duties and carry out
their responsibilities in teaching, research and science." During negotia-
tions it was agreed that the Government would extend this study to include
polytechnic teachers. It is understood that the study would be initiated by
September 30, 1983.
2.14      The proposed project would finance a total of 105 man-years of
foreign consultant services to assist the polytechnics to implement the new
courses and to provide related pre-service and in-service training of teachers
in some specialist fields (Table 2.5 and Annex 7). These consultant
services would complement the assistance with course planning, materials
development and teacher training provided for the PEDC (para. 2.18).
2.15      Monitoring and evaluation of the polytechnic system.  The
monitoring and evaluation system developed under the Polytechnic I Project
would be continued under the proposed project and extended to include a
mid-term review. It is understood that the mid-term review would be carried
out in April 1986. It was agreed at negotiations that monitoring and
evaluation would be carried out in accordance with terms of reference and a
schedule satisfactory to the Bank.
B. Polytechnic Education Development Center (proposed outlay US$11.1 mil-
lion, including contingencies)
2.16      The purpose of this component would be to establish a Polytechnic
Education Development Center (PEDC) responsible for training technical
teachers and developing new and improved curricula and teaching materials in
the extended range of technical and commercial specializations (paras. 1.07
to 1.11). The PEDC would provide a permanent capacity for training poly-
technic teachers for the long-term development and maintenance of the poly-
technic system. The PEDC would absorb the TEDC set up under the Polytechnic
I Project at Bandung. The project would finance construction and equipment
costs of the PEDC, overseas fellowships for PEDC staff, and consultant
services for assistance in staff development, curriculum development and
production of teaching materials.

2.17       Location.  Located adjacent to the campus of the Bandung Poly-
technic, the PEDC would share facilities with the polytechnic in fields
where low utilization makes it uneconomical to provide separate specialized
facilities - aeronautical engineering, foundry, telecommunications and
chemical process engineering. In the case of the other two specializations
to be offered at a single polytechnic - i.e., shipbuilding and tourism -
course development and staff training would take place mainly in the poly-
technic concerned but under the control of the PEDC.



- 18 -
2.18      Training Programs.  Induction and formal inservice training
required by new polytechnic teachers would be conducted at the PEDC with the
assistance of consultants engaged under the proposed project. The training
would aim to upgrade the qualifications of the teachers in their respective
fields of study, to orient them to the purpose of polytechnic education and
to enable them to plan and utilize effectively the facilities for practical
work. Training of the 1,700 new polytechnic staff required by the proposed
project would be provided by the PEDC in the period 1985-89 jl (Annex 5).
Thereafter the PEDC would be required for inservice upgrading and preservice
training for replacement teachers. STM and SMEA graduates chosen for staff
positions would receive a total of three one year periods of training alter-
nating with teaching. After 1985 the main source of recruitment of poly-
technic staff would be polytechnic graduates for whom the PEDC would provide
one year of specialist subject upgrading and teaching training. The PEDC
would also provide periodic inservice training for part-time teachers. This
would take the form mainly of workshops conducted by PEDC staff at the poly-
technics and would focus on teaching methods for practical subjects including
devising workshop and laboratory exercises and examinations.
2.19       Curricula Development.  The PEDC would also be responsible for
developing new curricula and materials and continuing the work carried out
by the TEDC in the basic engineering disciplines (mechanical, electrical an1'
civil engineering). Initial planning of courses and identification of
equipment lists in new engineering subjects commenced in the TEDC in 1982/83
in preparation for the proposed project.
2.20       Staffing and Technical Assistance for PEDC.  With the establishment
of the PEDC, staffing needs would increase from about 70 in the TEDC in 1983
to about 140 in 1986/87. Annex 8 provides details of the new teachers
required. New staff would require in-service training supplemented by 6-12
months overseas training.  The proposed project would finance 10.5 man-years
of overseas fellowships for this purpose. Foreign consultants engaged under
the proposed project would conduct the inservice portion of the PEDC staff
training program. They would also supervise and advise on the training of
polytechnic staff, and advise and assist with curriculum development and
materials production. The proposed project would provide the PEDC a total
of 42 man-years of consultant services. Details of the consultant services
and fellowships for the PEDC are given in Table 2.6.
/1 About 120 engineering teachers would be trained in the TEDC in 1984/85
ready to start to teach courses in the polytechnic extensions in 1985.

C. Planning and Management Support (proposed outlay US$7.0 million,
including contingencies)
2.21      Planning and Management.  This component would provide about four
man-years of consultant services to conduct studies to determine management
skills requirements and to establish a reliable and relevant information
system to assist MEC in defining appropriate mechanisms for management of
the expanded polytechnic subsystem within the higher education system. The
consultants would also assist in identifying specific management training
needs and drawing up an appropriate program of overseas training for senior
management staff of the NEC. The project would also finance 4 man-years of
overseas fellowships to MEC staff for this activity.
2.22      Project Planning and Preparation.  To support the MEC-s project
planning, the proposed project would provide technical assistance and
professional services to carry out preparatory work i.e. academic planning
and architectural design, for a third polytechnic project. Project funds
would also be provided to support feasibility studies and identification and
development of other projects in the education and training sector. These
would include a comprehensive study of technical teacher requirements in
relation to the economy's need for trained manpower - that is, the number
of technical teachers required, their utilization, sources of teachers and
their training. A total of US$5.4 million or equivalent would be allocated
for these services. Terms of reference for the study on the shortage of
technical teachers, to be included as a part of the feasibility study
mentioned in para. 2.13 above, were discussed by a Bank mission in Indonesia
in April 1983 and will be finalized for implementation before September 30,
1983. Terms of reference for the studies for the preparation of the
proposed third polytechnic project would be prepared after information on
the operating outcomes of the First Polytechnic Project becomes partly
available in 1984.
Technical Assistance
2.23       Total technical assistance would comprise 151 man-years of foreign
consultant services and 77 man-years of overseas fellowships as shown in
Table 2.7. The technical assistance program would be provided under con-
tract with organizations drawing on the resources of technical institutions
able to supply the specialist consultant services and training under the
fellowship program. No more than three contracts are expected to be
required. The technical assistance required is relatively high because of
the need for expertise to guide the development and provide in-service staff
development in a wide range of specializations for which there is no experi-
ence of technician education in Indonesia. The input in any one specialist
area would be modest as shown in Tables 2.5 and 2.6. The general terms of



- 21 -
reference and timing for consultant services were agreed during appraisal.
Terms of reference for consultants to assist in development of programs in
basic engineering, chemical engineering and telecommunications were reviewed
at negotiations. It is understood that terms of reference for consultants'
services in shipbuilding, aeronautics, commerce and foundry would be
available for review by May 31, 1983. Criteria and procedures for selection
of fellowship recipients drawn up under the Polytechnic I Project would be
applied to the proposed project. Agreement was reached with the Government
at negotiations that all consultants would be selected in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines.

III. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION
Costs
3.01      Summary of Costs.  The total cost of the project is estimated at
Rp 160.6 billion or US$165.5 million equivalent. The estimated cost by
project component is summarized in Table 3.1 and by type of expenditure in
Table 3.2. Costs by institutions are shown in Annex 9.
3.02      Basis of Cost Estimates.  Base costs refer to March 1983 prices.
Construction costs were estimated on the basis of unit costs in building
contracts under the Polytechnic I Project adjusted for inflation: accommo-
dation schedules were based on educational worksheets available in the
project file. Site development costs vary from 10% to 15% of construction
costs. Regional cost adjustments have been applied to the costs of civil
works (site development and construction). Unit building costs for class-
rooms, workshops and administrative buildings vary from US$315 per sq m to
US$215 per sq m. The cost of professional services including supervision of
construction are estimated at 10% of the cost of civil works. The costs of



- 22 -
furniture and equipment are based on preliminary lists prepared in six
specialist study reports (Annex 14) as well as the unit costs derived from
bids under the Polytechnic I Project adjusted for inflation. Unit costs for
technical assistance are estimated at an average of US$8,300 per man-month
for foreign consultants (inclusive of salaries, allowances and international
airfare); US$2,140 per man-month for local consultants, and US$1,500 per
man-month for overseas fellowships.

3.03       Utilization and Cost per Place.  Utilization factors for the project
polytechnics would average 70% based on 38 teaching hours per week and are
reasonable for specialized facilities. Capital costs per student place are
shown in Table 3.3 and are also reasonable. For the extensions, the average
cost would be about US$5,040 including civil works, furniture, and equipment,
book and materials.  For the new polytechnics, it would be US$8,040.  The
overall average cost would be US$6,400 per place. Annex 9 provides details
of unit costs by polytechnic.  The high unit cost for the foundry extension
at Bandung is a consequence of a small enrollment in a subject which requires
a relatively wide range of specialist facilities. The four small engi-
neering polytechnics would also have a relatively high unit cost but if
these polytechnics are extended under a future project the unit cost would be
substantially lower. Overall the costs compare favorably with the average
unit cost of US$10,500 per student place for a current Bank-financed
polytechnic project in Malaysia./l

3.04       Contingency Allowances.  The contingency allowance of US$44.8 mil-
lion includes: (a) physical contingencies estimated at 10% of the base costs
of civil works, equipment, furniture and professional services, and 5% of
the base cost for technical assistance and fellowships; and (b) price
contingencies averaging 25.6% of the base cost plus physical contingencies.
Price contingencies have been calculated with the following percentage rates
of price escalation in accordance with the implementation schedule (Annex 10):

3.05      Duties and Taxes.  The project cost includes an estimated
indirect cost of duties and taxes amounting to about US$5.9 million (about
3.6% of the total project cost). The Government contribution would finance
such costs. Imported instructional equipment is exempt from import duties.
Financing
3.06      Capital Costs.  The proposed Bank loan of US$107.4 million would
finance the full foreign exchange requirement of the proposed project
including the front-end fee of US$0.27 million.  The Government contribution
of US$58.4 million equivalent would be financed through annual budgetary
allocations. The proposed allocation of the loan funds is shown in Annex 11.
An estimate of annual project expenditure is shown in Annex 12.
3.07      Operating Costs.  The proposed project would generate an estimated
recurrent expenditure of about US$9.6 million p.a. in 1983 prices when the
polytechnics and PEDC are in full operation in 1988. With inadequate data
yet on the operating costs of the polytechnics under the Polytechnic I
Project (para. 1.06), the unit cost per engineering student per year (US$650)
is an estimate, based on costs of salaries of teachers, materials and
overheads, while the unit cost per commerce student (US$300 per year) is
based on costs of teaching in the commerce secondary schools (SMEA). The
project-generated recurrent expenditure represents about 0.6% of the annual
budget for education or 3.3% of the higher education budget in 1982/83 and
should not constitute an unreasonable budgetary constraint to Indonesia.
The operating cost, however, does not include funds for replacing equipment
which according to Indonesian practice would be included in development
budgets. About 13% of the recurrent costs in public university-level
education is recovered by fees and it is assumed that this will also apply
to the polytechnic system./l

Project Management and Implementation
3.08      Management.  The proposed project would be implemented by the
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) set up under the DGHE to implement the
Polytechnic I Project./l The PIU is responsible for site acquisition,
design and construction of polytechnic facilities, furniture and equipment
procurement, foreign experts and fellowship management and academic planning
and development. The PEDC, which would absorb the TEDC, would be directly
responsible to the PIU for curriculum development, preparation of teaching
materials, staff training and allocation of staff to the polytechnics. It
would also provide support to the PIU for academic planning.
3.09      The PIU is adequately staffed with a Project Director appointed by
the Minister of Education and Culture, an Assistant Project Director and
administrative and support staff.   The Project Director is also assisted by
foreign experts at MEC and PEDC: he reports to DGHE. The organization chart
of the PIU is shown in Chart 3.1. The PIU has four divisions: (a) construc-
tion, planning and design; (b) furniture and equipment procurement; (c)
accounts; and (d) administration. Each division is headed by a chief and has
three to six professional staff. Due to the additional workload generated by
the proposed project an understanding was reached with the Government dele-
gation at negotiations that by the end of 1983 each of the four divisions
would be staffed with at least three professionals and seven support staff,
and that thirty staff from the PEDC would also assist the PIU on a part-time
basis.
/1 The PI'! for the Polytechnic I Project has functioned well in carrying
out the proJect ahead of schedule and with a cost underrun.

3.10      Implementation.  The implementation schedule for the proposed
project is shown in Annex 10. The implementation period would be approxi-
mately six years from late 1983 to mid-1989. Civil works and furniture and
equipment procurement would be carried out in phases. Construction would
proceed in three phases: (a) beginning in April 1984 for the PEDC and the
extensions to the six polytechnics established under Cr. 869-IND, for
completion by June 1985; (b) beginning in June 1984 for seven new polytechnics
for completion by June 1986; and (c) beginning in April 1985 for four new
engineering polytechnics and extensions for foundry work, also for completion
by June 1986. All construction sites for the first phase are within existing
institutions. The Government agreed during negotiations that all sites
for second and third phase construction would he acquired not later than six
months prior to the scheduled start of construction at each site. Master
equipment lists were included in six study reports (Annex 14). Furniture
lists are largely the same as those prepared for the Polytechnic I Project.
The program of consultant services and overseas fellowships would start in
January 1984 and would be completed by June 1989. All project components
would be scheduled for completion by June 1989. The Closing Date would be
December 31, 1989.



- 28 -
3.11      Status of Project Preparation.  The project is in an advanced stage
of preparation. It is understood that the PIU will engage architects not
later than May 31, 1983 with funds under Credit 869-IND to complete survey
and design work and prepare detailed drawings and specifications for the
first phase civil works. Bid documents would be the same as those used in
the Polytechnic I Project and bids for civil works could be invited by the
end of 1983. Specifications for about 60% of the equipment and furniture
would be ready for invitations to hid to be announced soon after loan
signing. General terms of reference of specialists and procedures for award
of fellowships would be similar to those approved for the Polytechnic I
Project. Additional staff for the PIU and PEDC are being appointed.
Procurement
3.12      Civil Works.  Civil works contracts for 13 sites which are
estimated to cost over US$2.0 million each would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Procurement
Guidelines. On the basis of experience with the Polytechnic I Project all
bids are expected to be local since construction sites under the project are
spread over a wide geographical area and foreign firms are unlikely to be
interested. The construction contracts for the remaining six sites would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance
with government procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Prior Bank review
would be required for about nine awards of contracts exceeding or at about
US$3 million each, covering about 63% of the total civil works value.
3.13      Furniture and Equipment.  Furniture and equipment items for the
project would be grouped into packages to the extent possible for bulk pro-
curement. Equipment contracts costing US$100,000 equivalent or more would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines. Local manufacturers would be extended a 15%
preference margin, or the prevailing customs duties, whichever is lower, in
bid evaluation. Equipment items which cannot be grouped to form bid
packages of US$100,000 equivalent or more and all furniture items totalling
about US$3.6 million and averaging less than US$200,000 per institution
would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding, under GOI
procurement procedures satisfactory to the Bank subject to an aggregate
total value for equipment not exceeding $5.0 million equivalent (about 10%
of the total equipment value). Miscellaneous equipment in packages not
exceeding US$25,000 equivalent, and subject to an aggregate total not
exceeding $1.0 million equivalent, would be purchased off-the-shelf on the
basis of at least three price quotations. Instructional materials and books
estimated at about US$1.5 million would be procured through direct purchase
after negotiations for discounts. Prior Bank review would be required on
awards above US$250,000 for equipment contracts. Such contracts are expec-
ted to account for about 23% of the number of contracts and about 77% of the
value of contracts, based on the contract profile of the Polytechnic I
Project.



- 29 -
3.14      Project equipment would need to be procured early so as to be
available for use at the planned opening date of the polytechnics. Equipment
would also need special care in maintenance and repair. During negotiations,
the Government agreed to make adequate provision for the proper
maintenance and repair of equipment procured under the proposed project.
Disbursement
3.15      Disbursement would be made on the basis of:
(a) 40% of the cost of civil works;
(b) 100% of the cost of consultant and professional services,
fellowships and studies; and
(c) 100% of the foreign expenditures of imported materials and
equipment, 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
materials and equipment, 65% of the cost of imported materials and
equipment procured locally.
3.16      The proposed loan of US$107.4 million equivalent would be disbursed
over a period of six years. Disbursements are expected to be completed by
June 30, 1989. The yearly disbursement amounts are based on expected yearly
expenditures according to the planned six-year implementation schedule but
adjusted on the conservative side with reference to the latest regional
disbursement profile (Table 3.4). The profile for the proposed project still
shows an above-average disbursement rate, but this is considered justifiable
because of (a) the advanced level of preparation (para. 3.11); and (b) the
experience with the Polytechnic I Project, which is being implemented and
disbursed ahead of schedule.

3.18      Accounts and Audit.  Project accounts would be maintained accord-
ing to accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank as under
the Polytechnic I Project. Annual audits of project expenditures would be
carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. During
negotiations, the Government agreed to provide the Bank with audited annual
financial statements within six months after the close of each Indonesian
fiscal year.
Reporting
3.19      Reports on progress of implementation would be submitted to the
Bank quarterly. Six months after the closing date of the loan, the PIU
would submit to the Bank a project completion report. The Government agreed
to these review and reporting arrangements during negotiations.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01      The major beneficiaries of the proposed project would be the
manufacturing, transportation, telecommunications, construction, energy and
commerce sectors through the supply of the additional and better trained
technical manpower from the strengthened polytechnic system. Four principal
benefits are expected to result from the proposed project: (a) expanded
output of higher quality technicians in commercial fields and in both basic
and specialized engineering disciplines to help meet future national man-
power needs; (b) increased supply of well qualified technical teachers, now
in critically short supply; (c) an improved range and quality of teaching
materials and curricula; and (d) improved management of polytechnic
education. At full operating capacity, the annual output from the
polytechnics would rise to about 6,500 graduates, from the level of about
1,300 under the Polytechnic I Project, thus meeting about 18% of estimated
annual requirements for trained technicians. Further, the new polytechnics
would supply part of the remaining manpower needs by various part-time
programs to be offered at a variety of locations in 15 of the 27 provinces
in Indonesia. The PEDC would provide a permanent capacity for training
about 700 technical teachers each year. The polytechnics established under
the proposed project would have a high internal efficiency and would set
standards for the technical education subsector as a whole and have a
positive impact on the quality of other public and private diploma-level



- 32 -
programs. The proposed project would also enhance the opportunities of
senior secondary school graduates to receive tertiary-level education
through the provision of an additional 5,700 first-year places, representing
a 10% increase over the 1981/82 intake at public institutions of higher
learning.
Risks
4.02      Achievement of anticipated benefits from the proposed project
would depend largely on success in recruiting, training and retaining
teaching staff. There is a risk that the MEC would find it difficult to
recruit adequate numbers of qualified staff to run the polytechnics on a
full-time basis. Recognizing this problem, the project is designed to
commence with recruitment and training of inexperienced STM/SMEA and
polytechnic graduates rather than relying on the less likely prospect of
recruiting experienced staff from industry or universities. The project
would provide intensive initial training and in-service support for all
polytechnic teachers and offer overseas fellowships to selected teachers.
The risk of immediate loss of newly trained staff to higher paying jobs in
industry would be reduced by: (a) the existing system of bonding, and (b)
the availability of low cost housing loans for teachers. The results of the
study on university staff included in the University Development I Project
(Ln 1904-IND) (para. 2.13) are expected to provide the Government with
information on which it could base the development of a long-term strategy
for staff incentives. In a context where great prestige is attached to
degree status, a second risk is that the polytechnics, located within
universities, might introduce degree courses, thus diluting their
polytechnic function. A related risk is that the polytechnics would not
receive funding for recurrent expenditures at the level required, which
would be higher than average university running costs. To offset these
risks, the proposed monitoring system and mid-term review would serve to
highlight deviations from project objectives at an early enough stage to
allow corrective action to be taken by the MEC. The studies on ways to
improve management of the polytechnic system built into the proposed
project would also help reduce these risks.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Government
would:
(a) establish an advisory board for each new polytechnic within six
months after its opening with functions and composition satis-
factory to the Bank (para. 2.03);



- 33 -
(b)  extend the feasibility study of financial and administrative
schemes related to university academic staff under the University
Development I Project (Ln. 1904-IND) to cover polytechnic
teaching staff (para. 2.13);
(c) monitor and evaluate the project including the conduct of a mid-
term review in accordance with terms of reference and a schedule
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.15);
(d) appoint all consultants in accordance with the "Guidelines for the
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank
as Executing Agency" published by the Bank in 1981 (para. 2.23);
(e) acquire all sites for second and third phase construction not later
than six months prior to the scheduled start of construction at each
site (para. 3.10);
(f) make adequate provision for the maintenance and repair of equipment
procured (para. 3.14);
(g) provide the Bank with audited annual financial statements within
six months after the close of each Indonesian fiscal year
(para. 3.18); and
(h) prepare and submit to the Bank a detailed completion report
within six months of the closing of the loan (para. 3.19).
5.02      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for a loan of US$107.4 million equivalent to the
Government of Indonesia, for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace
period at the standard variable rate.

Conparative Edocation Data are oseful in the evalootion of various edocotion osytens and  .a.lysis of relative stages of edocational development between various
countrien.  However, on tho basin of the preseni data, cr.ss-national conparisnn nhonld be approached with great caotiEo.  Data prseonEed in tho abovo table have
been collected lurgely by Bank misoions from governenet sources; the rema.ider are staff estimates or data froe U-esco. Efforts hove been made to standardize
definitions and, withio imits, to check the accuracy of the data. Nevertheless, sech data are still imperfect in several respects and the Bank is working to
ieprove then progressively on the occasion of its operatioeal work.  Io the use of these data, the followlng qualihications  nhould be kept ic nind:
(1) "Education" as defined in tho table iEclodes all education and traiinig, both farmal and no-formal.
(2) PrilAry education refers to educatios at the first level and "secosdary" education refers to all education at the seconda-y level regardless of type
(e.g., ge-eral, technical, agric-ltur-l).
(3) "Litercy rates" (col. 6) are often obtained fron coo-try censuses. In easy countries they are only approximations a*d it is doubtful that any unfform
definition of 'literate' has been followed co-sisttly.
(4)  'Poblic expeoditure in edcation' (vole. 4 aod 5) refere to all capital and recorrent enpenditrres devoted to educotion by poblic and qua.i-public
agencies.
(5)  "Enrollment ratio' (co-s. 7, 12 and 14) refer to school year and are the percentage of eligible children eorolled full-tine io the appropriate ochool,
psblic and private by level.  They are ofteo -ubject to a wAde  -argin of error io the deyelopiog co-ntries o-ing to varfati..e  An the ac-c.rcy of baosc
