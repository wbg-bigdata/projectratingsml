MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
FOR A PILOT FEEDER ROADS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed pilot
feeder roads project to the Republic of Zaire for SDR 9.6 million (US$ 12.4
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity and would help strengthen
institutional capacity for feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance in
Zaire. The project would be cofinanced with UNDP (US$ 3.3 million
equivalent). Part I of the present document describes the country policies
and Bank assistance strategy. It draws upon the latest country brief for
Zaire, which wss distributed to the Executive Dire:tors in June 1990. Part
II describes the proposed credit. Country econom-c and social indicators
are in Schedule E.
PART I - COUNTRY POLICIES AND BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
2.        This section first assesses the varied pace and scope of Zaire's
macroeconomic reform effort since 1983. It then focubes on the central
development issues, highlighting the inefficient management of public
resources as the key element of the policy dialogue. This is followed by a
descriprior, of the Bank's lending strategy, which currently consists of a
core lendiag program in response to the deteriorating country performance
in general and public expenditure management in particular. The section
continues with a description of the criteria for evaluating progress
towards improved economic management and the conditions for a gradual
build-up of the lending program, including a resumption of quick disbursing
operations. This is followed by a description of aid coordination efforts
and collaboration with the IMF. The concluding paragraphs highlight the
main thrust of the lending strategy.
Background
3.        After a difficult period of civil turmoil and severe economic
decline following Independence (1960), the Zairian economy underwent three
major cycles: the growth years of 1967-74, when growth averaged 4.4 percent
p.a. in real terms, fueled by favorable terms of trade and substantial
direct foreign investment. The current account balance was in steady
surplus, inflation was low, and social indicators improved; the crisis
years of 1974-82, when falling commodity prices and rapidly eroded investor
confidence (brought about by the nationalization and "zairianization" of
foreign-owned businesses) led to a decline of GDP at a rate of 1.5 percent
p.a. on average, and persistent current account deficits. Expansionary
public spending financed by money creation and heavy external borrowing
(much of it on non-concessional terms and for nonviable projects) failed to



2
stimulate growth, while fueling inflation and worsening the public finance
and the balance of payments outlook; and the adiustment years of 1983-89,
when the Government embarked on a structural adjustment program, albeit not
without hesitations and lapses, and with mixed results.
Assessment of Performance
4.        The adjustment program init'ated in late 1983 introduced
important stabilization and reform measures in public resource management,
price and trade liberalization, and other private sector incentives. As
mentioned above, however, the pace and scope of reform varieds
. From 1983 to mid-1986 Zaire undertook courageous reforms, including
a 78 percent devaluation of its currency in SDR terms; substantive
exchange, trade and price liberalization, including the decontrol of
agricultural producer prices and interest rates; tighter public
expenditure controls, including containment of wage increases; and
measures to reduce the burden of parastatals on public finances.
* From late 1986 to end-1988 the Government discontinued the
stabilization program and weakened its adjustment effort. Although
it continued trade liberalization measures - through a first stage of
the import tariff reform, the abolition of levies on manufactured
exports, the simplification of export procedures, and tax incentives
to private investment - the Government's failure to control public
expenditure weakened the impact of these reforms. Previous progress
in exchange rate adjustment and price liberalization was partly
reversed. The government allowed the differential between o icial
and parallel market exchange rates to increase, and did not remove
ex-post and administrative price controls.
In 1989 the Government made a significant effort to strengthen
fiscal mobilization, to maintain a flexible exchange rate, to bring
controlled prices and interest rates closer to the market, and to
improve the access of the private sector to foreign exchange. The
Government also approved several performance contracts regulating
financial relations with state enterprises. The authorities were far
less successful, however, in improving the allocation and control of
public expenditure, including public investment.
A preliminary assessment for 1990 indicates that the Government has
discontinued its pursuit of improved mana- - -ent of public
expenditure. The adjustment program is oti track, especially as
regards the control of government expenditure and public investment,
inflation and credit targets, avoidance of external and domestic
arrears, and parapublic sector reform.
5.        In the initial phase of the adjustment program, strong
stabilization and adjustment measures showed positive results. Over the
1984-1986 period, GDP growth averaged 3.3 percent p.a., up from 0.7 percent
in the preceding three years; copper mining, the backbone of the economy,
regained profitability and a large part of coffee, diamond and gold exports
started to flow through official channels, allowing export earnings to grow
by 4.8 percent p.a. on average in current terms. Helped by a strong



3
response of domestic production of foodstuffs and manufactured goods,
imports contracted by 1.1 percent p.a.; Government's net recourse to
domestic credit averaged 1.1 percent of GDP, compared to 3 percent in the
preceding three-year period; inflation decelerated from 76 percent to 24
percent; and the overall fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) averaged only 0.3
percent of GDP, compared to 1.9 percent during the 1981-1983 period.
6.        Equally swift was the economy's deterioration owing to the
reversal of adjustment as of late 1986. In 1987-89, despite recovering
copper prices and a significant increase in net external transfers, GDP
growth averaged only 0.6 percent p.a. and per capita production contracted
by 2.4 percent p.a.; the current account deficit averaged 7.6 percent of
GDP (70 percent higher than in the preceding three-year period); and
inflation soared. Economic performance reflected the uncertain economic
environment, the rapid deterioration of infrastructure and public services,
and the deteriorating public finance situation.
7.        Budgetary revenue other than from GECAMINES (the national copper
mining company) declined to 6.4 percent of GDP on average between 1987-89,
compared to 8.5 percent in 1984-86, while non-debt expenditure increased
from 6.2 percent of GDP in 1984-86 to 10.3 percent in 1987-89. The overall
fiscal deficit (on a cash basis, after rescheduling) of 0.3 percent of GDP
in 1984-86 increased to 2.4 perceat in 1987 and peaked at 6.3 percent in
1988. Government's non-debt for dgn exchange expenditure increased sixfold
in 1987-88, from US$92 million in 1986 to US$550 million in 1988, mostly
for non-developmental purposes. Since most of the deficit was financed
with domestic bank credit, money supply more than quadrupled between 1986-
88, inflation (year-end) reached 106 percent in 1987 and 92 percent in
1988, and the availability of domestic credit and foreign exchange to the
private sector sharply declined. Government's attempt in 1988 to check
inflation through control of the exchange rate, interest rate and prices
backfired, further depressing economic activity.
8.        The effort to resume the stabilization program in 1989 and the
favorable external factors (high copper prices and large external inflows)
yielded some positive financlal results. Higher taxes and improved tax
administration spurred non-G;.2AMINES budgetary revenue to 6.8 percent of
GDP compared to only 5 percent in 1988, while expenditure was trimmed from
15 percent to 10 percent, partly due to lower than projected debt service
payments. Both revenue and expenditure performance remained, however, well
below that of the 1984-85 adjustment years. Current outlays for goods and
services, in particular, were 50 percent higher than programmed, and the
composition of expenditure retained heavily biased in favor of non-
developmental purposes. Monetary creation was sharply curtailed, and
inflation declined to 60 percent on an annual basis. However, private
investment and growth remained sluggish. GDP is estimated to have declined
by almost 2 percent in 1989, and per capita income contracted by about 5
percent. As a result of the deterioration in macroeconomic performance
tow;ards the end 1989 and the failure to reach understanding on a program
for 1990, the IMF's stand-by arrangement lapsed and Zaire was unable to
complete the last two purchases under the stand-by.



4
9.        The outlook for 1990:  Government expenditure in 1990 has
followed the same pattern as last year. Deteriorating t rms of trade
(especially for copper and coffee), GECAMINES' declining copper output due
in part to labor unrest in the producing region, higher delt service
obligations, an unforeseen 55 percent increase in the civil service wage
bill, and declining marginal tax yields are giving rise to a poor budgetary
outlook for this year. Inflation is also accelerating: consumer prices
increased by 12.7 percent during the first trimester, compared to 4.4
percent in the last quarter of 1989. At this pace, annual inflation is
expected to reach at least 60 percent, against a 20 percent target
envisaged under an uninterrupted program. The gap in the foreign exchange
rate between the official and parallel markets is widening and has reached
about 30 percent, as opposed to an objective of maximum 10 percent. GDP
growth is projected to decline by 1.9 percent, and private per capita
consumption is expected to decline by 4.2 percent.
Central Development Issues
10.       Despite partial and fragile progress in adjusting its economy,
Zaire faces formidable development constraints. These include inefficient
management of public resources; a heavy debt burden; inadequate transport
and other basic infrastructu:e and public services; insufficient attention
to human capital development and the environment; a poor risky investment
climate; and, last but not least, serious governance issues.
11.       The second Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for the 1989-1991 period
presented to the Executive Di ectors of the Bank and the Fund in late FY89
reiterated the Government's )mmitment to economic growth, liberal economic
policies, and financial di.  )line.  As mentioned above, the financial
results in 1989 were encou   ing.  The Government had also agreed to cancel
or postpone several large u...aconomic projects, strengthen the management of
GECAMINES' dividend policj respect stricter ceilings on foreign exchange
expenditure, avoid new financial commitments outside the agreed
macroeconomic framework, achieve real interest rates for domestic credit to
economy, and slow down inflatKon. Whereas the Government made headway in
some areas, these achievements were largely offset by poor public
expenditure management.
12.       The orientations of the PFP remain correct, even if the
interruption of the adjustment program has temporarily 4;ast doubts on their
feasibility and has made their timing uncertain. The medium-term strategy
agreed upon in the PFP included the Government's commitment to strengthen
fiscal discipline and improve the quality of public expenditure, to
continue the reform of the state enterprises, and to implement aggressively
a program intended to reverse the long-standing neglect of human capital
development. While recognizing its direct responsibility for economic
stabilization, adequate basic infrastructure and public services, and
helping finance human capital development, the Government intended to allow
the private sector to take the lead in productive investment.
13.       The fiscal reform program aimed at a substantial improvement in
tax collection, broadening of the tax base, provision of fiscal incentives
to investment, and strengthening and simplification of tax administration.
On the expenditure side, the Government had announced its intention to



5
continue and improve the screening of development expenditures and to
extend it to recurrent expenditure. Priority tasks included the
introduction of multi-aniual expenditure programming, increased
transparency in executing expenditure, and generalized application of
common law provisions. Particularly critical was the improvement of the
quality of expenditure, both public investment and recurrent spending for
operation and maintenance.
14.       The reform of state-owned enterprises was to have focussed on
the disengagement of the State from production of tradeables (with the
notable exception of copper mining), increased financial autonomy and
responsibility of parastatals (together with economic pricing of their
production, taxation of their procurement, and prompt payment of goods and
services sold to the Government), and increased transparenicy of their
operations.
15.       The decline of government spending in education and health has
put an increasingly unsustainable burden on users (who are contributing 80%
of recurrent costs for health care in rural areas, and 75% of primary and
secondary education costs) and non-governmental organizations, and is
largely responsible for the visible erosion of Zaire's human capital. The
Government appeared determined to reverse its long-standing disengagement
from the social sectors, with the support of a proposed IDA-financed Social
Sector Adjustment project, which would attempt to improve the efficiency
and equity of education and health through key policy adjustments, public
expenditure reallocation and rationalization, social programs targeted at
the most vulnerable groups, and strengthening of institutions (including
the national capability to monitor the quality of life of the population by
region and income levels). The 1990 budget took a first step, albeit
modest, to reverse the erosion of the government expenditure in the
education and health sectors. It remains to be seen, however, whether this
priority will be reflected in increased outlays.
16.       Given the uncertainty of the present situation, it is difficult
to develop accurate projections. Nevertheless, Bank staff have attempted
to project the economic and financial outlook of Zaire over the next five
years in conjunction with the macroeconomic framework of the second PFP,
which has been updated by staff to account for lower than expected
investment and growth in 1989 and poor expenditure performance in 1990, for
the decline in aid flows, and for revised commodity price forecasts. The
revised outlook assumes a resumption of the adjustment program by end-1990
at the latest, which, considering the recent economic developments and the
state of Bank/Fund dialogue, is not at all certain. Delayed or partial
adjustment will severely hurt development prospects.
17.       GDP growth is projected at 3.3 percent p.a. on average between
1990-1994, 0.3 in per capita terms, as compared to the 3.8 percent growth
rate projected by the PFP. Growth is expected to result mainly from
private sector response to improved incentives and availability of credit
and foreign exchange; import substituition in edible oils, meat, cotton, and
grains; larger exports of crops such as coffee and rubber; increased
efficiency and productivity of state-owned enterprises, notably GEGAMINES
(whose production is, however, currently declining, due primarily to slow
implementation of a rehabilitation program supported by the Bank); private



6
investment in gold and diamond mining; and increased public investment in
basic infrastructure, essential public services and human capital. Public
investment would exceed 7 percent of GDP, and about three-quarters of it
would come from parapublic sector investment during 1990-94. Aggregate
e .orts are expected to weaken with lower copper prices, while imports
would follow closely GDP growth in order to satisfy private sector and
basic infrastructure needs. (-urrent account projections show a US$1.2
billion deficit in 1990, i.e., almost 10 percent of GDP, declining
temporarily to about 8 percent of GDP in 1991-1992 but rising to 12 percent
in 1993. External financing requirements (before debt rescheduling, and
including disbursements from existing commitments) average US$1.1 billion a
year in 1990-1991.
18.       The above macroeconomic framework assumes not only an early
resumption of adjustment policies, but conditions its pursuit on
substantive external support. Zaire's external debt stood at US$8.4
billion (88.7% of GDP) at the end of 1989. Continued debt rescheduling
according to the Toronto options and adjustment cofinancing under the
Special Program of Assistance for debt-distressed countries could fill the
bulk of financing requirements if Zaire's adjustment program successfully
resumes. This would leave a residual unfinanced gap of US$208 million in
1990 and of US$317 million in 1991. The 1990 gap is expected to be
financed through accumulation of external arrears; the financing of the
1991 gop will depend on progress made by the Government in resuming
adjustment, and the eventual conclusion of debt buy-back arrangements and
other exceptional debt rescheduling and reduction schemes. Under these
projections, the ratio of debt service to exports of goods and non-factor
services would decline from 48 percent in 1990 and 51 percent in 1991
(before rescheduling and including arrears) to 26 percent in 1990 and 21
percent in 1991, after rescheduling (excluding the service of debt
contracted to cover the unfinanced gap). TMF charges and repurchases add
another 8 percent to the debt service ratio in 1990, 4.7 percent in 1991,
and 3.5 percent in 1992-1993. Debt service (including IMF service) is
proAceted to consume 36 percent of the Government's cash outlays in 1991-
93. The projections indicate increased dependence on multilateral
financing, and less room for manoeuver in future debt rescheduling.
The Composition of Past Lending
19.       Since 1951, Zaire has received ten IBRD loans for a total amount
of US$301 million, and 54 IDA credits for a total amount of US$1,243
million. IBRD loans were limited to financing enclave copper mining
projects (GECAMINES). In recent years, the level of leneing has fluctuated
with the Government's changing commitment to undertake reforms. Overall,
sainial lending averaged about $70 million in FY83-84, $200 million in FY85-
86 and about $140 million in FY87-88. Lending volume declined to $114.7
million in FY89 and $19.9 million in FY90, reflecting the recent
deterioration of performance. Bank Group operations have financed physical
and social infrastructure, key production activities, and institution-
building. Agriculture accounted for about 9 percent, transport 34 percent,
mining and industry 32 percent, energy 6 percent, and human resources and
social sectors 8 percent. Structural adjustment lending accounted for 11
percent. In the productive sectors an important aim was to strengthen
Zaire's export capability, and commodity production in general. As part if



7
this strategy, the Board approved in FY86 a $110 million IBRD loan to
rehabilitate GECAMINES, and in FY89 a second IDA-financed GECAMINES
technical assistance project ($20 million). Other IDA credits approved in
FY89-90 include a sector management, an institutional development credit
and a pilot extension credit in the agriculture sector, a transport
rehabilitation credit in infrastructure, and an AIDS ce-trol project in
health. Structural adiustment lending started in FY86 with an Industrial
Sector Adjustment Credit ($80 million), followed by a Structural Adjustment
Credit in FY87 ($160 million), and a SAL Supplement in December 1989 ($14
A           million).  The SAL was accompanied by a technical assistance credit ($12
million) to help implement the adjustment program. There have been six IFC
investments in Zaire, the most recent being an investment in UTEXAFRICA
(textiles). IFC also has a US$1.3 million equity participation in the
Societe Financiere de Developpement (SOFIDE, the development finance
company).
20.       The current portfolio includes 25 IDA credits and the IBRD-
financed GECAMINES project. Disbursement performance deteriorated in ?Y89
due to the delayed second tranche release of the Structural Adjustment
Credit, the very slow disbursement of the GECAMINES loan, and the
suspension of several credits. Overall disbursement fell from US$206
million in FY88 to US$136 million in FY89 and to US$80 million during the
first three quarters of FY90. Portfolio performance is poor, with almost
one-third of it classified as problem projects. Project implementation is
affected by lack of counterpart funds, poor management and generalized
institutional weaknesses, procurement delays and irregularities, the
deterioration of the transport and marketing systems, and, more generally,
the unfavorable economic environment. Three projects were suspended: the
Sixth Highway project, because the mobilization of local resources through
an earmarked levy on fuel proved elusive; the river navigation project
(informal suspension), because of financial irregularities attributed to
the management of the executing agency; and the suspension of the
commitment authority for the eighth credit line for SOFIDE, because of the
deteriorating portfolio of the corporation (over 90 percent of its
portf -io is affected by arrears of more than three months). Progress made
toward restoring local financing of the Sixth Highway project and
improving the management of the river navigation company permitted lifting
the suspension for these projects. SOFIDE's management was replaced as a
step towards a comprehensive restructuring of the institution and its
shareholders are considering a capital increase, but the credit remains
suspended.
Country Lending Strategy and Priorities
21.       The main objective of the Bank Group in Zaire is to promote
equitable and sustainable growth of income. The policy advice and dialogue
focus on (i) promoting sound macroeconomic policies, particularly exchange
rate policy and public expenditure size, composition and quality; (ii) an
incentive structure geared at promoting the supply response and investment
of the private sector; and (iii) preservation of Zaire's long-term
development potential, particularly human capital, essential
infrastructure, and environment.   A corollary objective is to help develop



8
a donors' consensus on Zaire's development priorities and policy options,
and help mobilize the external financing required to realize the country's
development potential.   The main instruments for implementing this
strategy are policy dialogue, lending, economic and sector work, and aid
coordination.
22.       The key constraints affecting the pursuit of these objectives
stem from issues related to governance, including macro-economic management
and commitment to development. Zaire's poor performance in addressing
these issues has led to an erosion of the country's external credibility.
The Government needs to take decisive and sustained steps to improve
economic management in order to convince the donor community that it can
efficiently use external resources. Only after such steps are taken and
convincingly implemented over a reasonable period of time would the Bank
help Zaire mobilize concessional aid, including IDA resources, in amounts
consiLtent with the country's development potential and needs.
23.       The quality of the policy dialogue between the Bank and Zaire
has varied over the last decade, reflecting the uneven management of the
country's economy and the authorities' changing willingness to implement
sustained structural adjustment policies. Over the last twelve months, the
dialogue has focussed primarily on public expenditures, since it is now
recognized that Zv're's growth prospects will hinge on improved management
of public expenditure. Repeated misallocation of public expenditures makes
it impossible at this time to justify quick-disbursing lendine to Zaire,
and has jeopardized the !mplementation of many of IDA supported investment
projects.
24.       In response to the deteriorating country performance in general
and public expenditure management in particular, the Bank has scaled back
its lending program. This includes indefinitely postponing the preparation
of new quick disbursing operations and of large sectoral investments, which
are predicated on improved public expenditure management in the sectors and
on the Government's ability to provide adequate local funding for project
execution.
25.         The current assistance strategy consists of a core program of
high priority investment and institution building projects which address
long-term development issues, and whose benefits would continue to accrue
to the population even in the absence of a satisfactory macroeconomic
framework. The proposed Pilot Feeder Roads Project described in Part II of
this report fits this strategy. The project would improve the performance
of transport and agricultural sectors, alleviate rural poverty and improve
food security. In addition, the project aims at tackling the
rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder roads in an experimental manner
(including pilot cost-recovery methods to improve long term
sustainability). Finally, the project's limited scope and short duration
take account of current budgetary problems.



9
26.         Given recent and current performance, and the apparent lack of
determination to pursue urgently needed reforms, the lending program for
FY91-93 is limited to three small IDA credits a year. This program, which
is clearly below Zaire's development potential and financing needs, could
be increased in response to eventual progress towards improved economic
management. In addition to the proposed Pilot Feeder Roads Project, the
current program focusses on infrastructure maintenance (urban
rehabilitation), human capital development (education and social sectors);
capacity building and institutional development (macroeconomic management
technical assistance, agricultural research, and technical assistance to
SNEL, the electric power utility); and environmental protection (forestry
and environment).
Criteria for Evaluating Progress towards Improved Economic Manazement
27.       In the immediate future, the public expenditure management issue
will be the key element of the Bank's dialogue with Zaire. While the
dialogue between the country and the Bank remains open and corcial,
particularly at the technical level, the political authorities have not
endorsed proposals to strengthen the management of public expenditure. A
heavy political agenda is expected in Zaire over the next twelve months in
connection with recent pronouncements of separation of the Party and State,
gradual introduction of multi party system, and the revision of the
Constitution. It is unclear, however, whether significant progress can be
achieved over this period on issues of governance and public expenditure
managewent. In the meantime, the dialogue with the authorities will be
pursued in the context of discussion of the Bank's reports under
preparation on public expenditure, private sector incentives, and trade and
transport fac_Aitation.
?.$       Progress in economic management would be evaluated
simultaneously on two criteria: first, the Go7ernment's ability to
implement sustainable macro-economic policies, especially with respect to
public sector deficit financing and exchange rate policies; and second, the
Government'3 capacity to undertake meaningful improvements in the quality
of public expenditures. Given Zaire's uneven track record in the past on
implementation, a new agreement on the measures to be taken will not be
sufficient to convince the donor community to fully underwrite such a
program. What is needed to restore confidence is the actual satisfactory
implementation of an agreed program for a reasonable period of time.  Only
when such a track record has been established could external financing
commensurate with the country's needs be expected to become available.
29.       The Bank would respond to improved performance by a gradual
build-up of its lending program. Following agreement on a natisfactory
macro-economic framework, including on the composition of public
expenditures and adequate quarterly monitoring mechanisms, the Bank would
consider progressively increasing its project pipelire and presenting to
the Executive Directors sizeable investment projects. Moreover, following
sustained satisfactory performance under the agreed macro-economic program,
Bank staff would consider recommending a resumption of quick-disbursing



10
operations to the Executive Directors. The overall magnitude and
composition of the Bank's financial assistance would take into account not
only Zaire's performance and the country's needs, but also reflect a
reasonable burden sharing among donors, creditors and international
financial institutions.
30.       Economic and Sector Work.  The economic and sector work strategy
and program are predicated on two central premises: that Zaire faces
structural problems requiring sustained attention over a long period of
time; and that the Bank, despite limited success in promoting reform, and
notwithstanding the temporary lull in dialogue, retains a comparative
advantage and a leadership role in policy advice and donor coordination.
The operational requirements of the proposed lending program add several
other dimensions to the ESW strategy, particularly as regards project
design favoring maintenance of critical institutions; the greater role of
the private sector and non-governmental crganizations in project financing
and execution; the critical importance of public finance issues in project
financing and recurrent cost coverage; and the importance of investment
strategies and public investment program formulation. These principles lie
behind an economic and sector work program focussed on (i) strengthening
analytical country information and deepening Bank's understanding of issues
and policy options; (ii) helping develop a national and international
consensus on policy options and approaches, while contributing to capacity
building; (iii) emphasizing work on governance, decentralization,
institutional development, role of private sector and NGOs; and (iv)
reviewing public resource mobilization and use with a view to improving
their orientation, composition and quality. The immediate priority in FY91
will be the review of and advice on public expenditure management.
Aid Coordination and Relations with the IMF
31.       In the past, donors have expressed support for Zaire's
adjustment program, but initially aid was slow in materializing. From 1983
through 1987, balance of payments support came essentially from IMF
drawings and debt rescheduling by bilateral donors. Both these sources
were expensive relative to Zaire's repayment capacity, and their cost is
now reflected in Zaire's balance of payments. Since 1983, the IMF has
approved several stand-by arrangements, two purchases under the
compensatory financing facility, and two annual SAF arrangements. Several
other donors, notably the ADB, the EEC, the US, and Japan also provided
balance of payments support.
32.       Net transfers to Zaire (including debt relief and IMF transfers)
were negative (-$75 million) over the 1984-86 period. This was one of the
main reasons invoked by the Government for discontinuing the adjustment
program towards the end of 1986. The Bank sponsored a meeting of the
Consultative Group in 1987, helping Zaire mobilize considerable external
support.  Net transfers increased sharply in 1987-1989, totalling US$1,092
million, of which US$326 million consisted of IDA financing. The



11
Association approved two major structural adjustment operationst an
Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit (cofinanced by the African Facility),
and a Structural Adjustment Credit. Both credits were fully disbursed, as
was a supplement to the SAC, approved in December 1989. During the 1987-
89 period, th>e Bank was the most important source of BOP supp. tt and net
transfers to Zaire.
33.       Non-project assistance to Zaize and the country's performance in
policy reforms is discussed frequently with Zaire's main donors under the
framework of the SPA. Donors have been generally supportive of the Bank's
position to suspend quick-disbursing financing to Zaire following the
deterioration of macro-economic management of late 1989 and early 1990, and
have generally endorsed the proposed conditions under which such lending
could resume in Zaire. The most recent such discussion took place in Paris
in June 1990. Close collaboration with the IMF has been a long standing
feature of the Bank's relations with Zaire. Ever since the preparation of
the first Policy Framework Paper in 1987, Bank and Fund economic missions
have closely coordinated the substance and timing of their work. There
have been several parallel missions as well as cross-support between the
staffs of the two institutions.
Summary Assessment
34.       Zaire has tremendous development potential, but is beset by
formidable constraints, stemming primarily from issues related to
governance, including public expenditure management and commitment to
development. Zaire's poor performance in addressing these issues has led
to an erosion of the country's external credibility. In response to
deteriorating country performance in general and public expenditure
management in particular, the Bank has scaled back its lending program.
This includes indefinitely postponing the preparation of new quick-
disbursing operations and of large investments which are predicated on
improved public expenditure management in the sectors and on the
Government's ability to provide adequate local funding for project
execution. The current assistance strategy consists of a core program of
high priority investment and institution building projects which address
long-term development issues, and whose benefits would continue to accrue
even in the absence of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework.
35.       The current program, which is clearly below Zaire's development
potential and financing needs, could be increased in response to eventual
progress towards improved economic management. Progress in economic
management would be evaluated simultaneously on the basis of the
Government's ability to implement sustainable macro-economic policies, as
well as on the Government's capacity to undertake meaningful improvements
in the quality of public expenditures. The Bank would respond to improved
performance by a gradual build-up of the lending program. Following
agreement on a satisfactory macro-economic framework, the Bank would



12
consider progressively increasing its project pipeline and presenting to
the Executive Directors sizeable investment projects. Following sustained
performance under the agreed macro-economic program, Bank staff would also
consider recommending quick-disbursing operations to the Executive
Directors. The overall magnitude of the Bank's lending would take into
account not only Zaire's performance and the country's needs, but also
reflect a reasonable burden sharing among Zaire's external partners.
PART II - THE CREDIT
Background
36.       The transport system in Zaire is an interconnected network of
rivers, railways and roads linked at strategic points. The Zaire river and
its tributaries dominate the system and, along with the 5000 km of
railways, form a vital rail/river system for internal-regional transport
and external access. The road network, mostly built during the colonial
period, was designed to provide access to the rail/river system, although a
few major roads also provide inter-regional transport. Since independence,
the bulk of this network has deteriorated into tracks due to lack of
rehabilitation and maintenance. While the main road network under the
responsibility of a parastatal, the "Office des Routes" has received some
maintenance (though insufficiently to a large extent), feeder roads in
particular have long suffered from neglect, thus jeopardizing the
productive capacity of a number of potentially-rich agricultural
communities and food security in much of the country. Given the vastness
of Zaire, appropriate organizational and funding mechanisms to tackle the
difficulties of feeder road development are essential to facilitate
agriculture growth and poverty alleviation.
37.       In the past, the Government has attempted to improve feeder road
maintenance but with varying degrees of success, principally due to
institutional weaknesses, inadequate implementation capacity, and irregular
funding. In 1987, it created the National Service for Feeder Roads (SNRDA)
put in charge of an emergency program of feeder road rehabilitation and
maintenance. In 1988, a broad feeder road study was launched to recommend
ways of improving institutional arrangements, local management
capabilities, and the planning, implementation, monitoring and financing of
feeder roads and to review criteria for project economic analysis and
standards for rehabilitation and maintenance works. The proposed project
is largely based on the recommendations of this study. In mid-1989, the
Government decided to decentralize feeder road activities, i.e., the
programming, procurement, payment and monitoring of the works. Regional
Road Committees, consisting of Regional representatives of the Ministries,
businesses and NGOs, meet twice a year to discuss regional road programs
and review their implementation. The financing of feeder road works was
partly ensured by earmarking a portion of the road tax to SNRDA. This
mechanism was improved in 1989 with the introduction of an ad valorem fuel
tax and the resumption of periodic price adjustment of petroleum products.

Rationale for IDA Involvement
38.       The Pilot Feeder Roads Project is an important component of
IDA's strategy to help improve the performance of the transport and
agriculture sectors, alleviate rural poverty and improve food security.
Feeder roads are essential for facilitating the supply of inputs to remote
rural areas, for marketing agricultural products, for reducing transport
costs and thus food prices, for improving rural-urban linkages, and for
creating (mostly private sector) employment in rural areas. The proposed
s           project, a complement to IDA's Pilot Agricultural Extension Project
approved by the Executive Directors in February 1990, aims at tackling the
rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder roads in an experimental manner
(through the use of labor-intensive techniques; reliance on existing local
institutions --private sector and NGOs-- as executing entities; and pilot
cost-recovery methods to improve long term sustainability). In addition
the project's limited scope and short duration take account of current
budgetary limitations and a mid-term review will permit the necessary
course corrections. The project thus constitutes a "core" operation whose
benefits would continue to accrue to farmers, consumers, and the rural poor
(mostly in the form of employment), even in the absence of a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework. The project is fully consistent with the Bank
assistance strategy as presented in Part I of the present report.
Prolect Objectives
39.       The project's objectives are to:  (i) strengthen institutional
capacity for the programming, implementation, financing and monitoring of
feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance; (ii) test and evaluate various
methods of rehabilitatior. and maintenance of feeder roads under different
institutional and financial arrangements in selected rural areas throughout
the country; and (iii) develop a local capacity to rehabilitate and
maintain feeder roads and bridges on a sustainable and replicable ba.is.
Proiect Description
40.       The project will finance:  (i) a technical assistance, study and
training program to develop the organization and management systems
necessary to maintain the national feeder road network; (ii) a four-y-ar
program of low-cost rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder roads under
various institutional arrangements; and (iii) research and development
activities to evaluate the environmental, social, financial and economic
impact of rural road improvement. The bulk of the project will be
implemented by existing private entities (2 cotton companies) and by a
well-established and reliable local NGO.
Project Cost
41.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes is estimated at USS
17.5 million equivalent, with foreign costs of US$ 10.4 million and local
costs of USS 7.1 uillion. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group



14
operations in Zaire are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No.8589-ZA dated May 17 1990, is being distributed
separately.
Actions Azreed
42.       Yearly work programs and budgets for feeder roads would be
submitted for IDA's approval by November 1 and Government would allocate a
minimum amount of US$5.3 equivalent (in 1990 constant terms). The criteria
for selecting the roads to be rehabilitated, the principles guiding
centralized cost-recovery procedures and monitoring mechanisms have been
agreed. Given the pilot nature of the project, a mid-term review to
evaluate the project performance and discuss any corrective measures as may
be required would be carried out. During project implementation, the
Borrower will submit to IDA (i) quarterly progress reports and annual
implementation reports; and (ii) auditor's reports and management letter at
the end of each fiscal year. The submission of the work program and budget
covering the period ending December 31, 1991 and the finalization of
arrangements acceptable to IDA between SNRDA and the Office des Routes, for
the use of ODR's zone engineers and training facilities would be conditions
of effectiveness.
Benefits
43.       Rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder roads will restore
access to populations otherwise isolated and to a number of potentially
productive agricultural communities; reduce vehicle operating costs;
provide employment and thus alleviate poverty in rural areas; generate
increased agricultural revenues and improve food security. The use of
small-scale local contractors will ensure greater project commitment at the
grassroots level, while staff training will strengthen local implementation
capacity for feeder road works. Appropriate financing mechanisms will be
put in place in order to promote sustainability and replicability of feeder
road maintenance on a larger scale. Under conservative assumptions, the
economic rate of return would average 22 percent.
Risks
44.       The main risks associated with the project are: (i) the weak
administrative and financial capacity of the Government; (ii) the weak
capabilities of the local entities to execute feeder road works; (iii)
possible delays in payments to the executing entities; and (iv) difficulty
with access to the project areas that would delay supervision and the
circulation of information. Project design addresses these risks generally
by adopting a pilot approach and remaining at a modest scale given the
needs in this area. Specifically these risks will be addressed bys (i) the
technical assistance and training program; (ii) close monitoring and
evaluation of the project progress and a mid-term review of project
implementation by the Government and IDA; (iii) the limiting of local
financing requirements to SNRDA's operating costs and to routine



15
maintenance funding requirements in line with revenues from the fuel tax
surcharge; (iv) progressive start-up of works to facilitate the monitoring
and evaluation of activities and permit prompt corrective actions; (v)
close supervision of the payment mechanism; and (vi) the timely supply of
required vehicles and equipment.
Recommendation
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
