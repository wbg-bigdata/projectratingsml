MEMOGRAVIDUM. AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Federative RepubLic of Brazil for US$117 million is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate. It would help finance the first phase of
Brazil's National Environmental Program (PNMA).
2.       Background.  During the 1980s in Brazil, there has been a growing
recognition by the public and Government, that sustainable and efficient economic
development can only be assured if development programs are based on sound natural
resource management. The protection of the environment is therefore considered a
central issue in Brazil, and the Government has made a significant effort to deal
with it under a systematic policy and institutional framework. Brazil now faces
three key issues that Government policy is attempting to address: (i) the need for
better conservation of immediately endangered and irrecuperable environmental
resources: (a) how best to protect the most vulnerable ecosystems -- now recognized
as being on the verge of destruction -- such as the Pantanal wetlands, the remnants
of the Atlantic Forest and parts of the the Brazilian Coast from uncontrolled land
clearing, pollution and other destructive activities, and (b) how best-to provide for
the long term conservation of areas representative of all of the country's endemic
systems under its National System of Conservation Units; (ii) the need for
strengthening of the institutional framework: how best to equip the institutions of
the environment sector for effective environmental management, protection, and
enforcement of the existing regulatory framework for environmental licensing,
monitoring, and planning; and, (iii) the need for further strengthening of the
policy and regulatory frameworkt in order to (a) harness the potential contribution
of the Amazon to development, without giving rise to the environmental and
agricultural production problems, such as the degradation of soils and loss of forest
cover; (b) improve the management of land and water resources to redur.e the incidence
of soil erosion, water pollution, siltation and the consequences of these for
agricultural production, health and periodic flooding or water shortages,
respectively; and (c) address the effects of rapid urbanization and industrial growth
on air pollution, water management and waste disposal.
3.       Over the last two years  i3 parallel with the preparation of the PNMA that
would be supported by the proposed project, the Government has modified a number of
important policies and laws, which conflicted with environmental protection and
management goals. One major action was the adoption of the "Nossa Natureza" Program
for the control of environmental degradation, especially in the Amazon. It revised
the two key policies which had, until its decree in April 1989, directly contravened
environmental goals. These were: (a) the elimination of fiscal incentives for the
establishment of extensive livestock schemes in forest areas in the Amazon
(previously, these incentives had been a major cause for land clearing in rainforest
areas); and, (b) the elimination of legislation which required land clearing as proof
of land occupancy and a precondition for land titling (also a major cause of land
clearing in the Amazon). The "Nossa Natureza" Program also included measures in
support of extractive sustainable uses of the forest; for the control of mining (to
cut down on the indiscriminate use of mercury); and, for setting aside large areas as
National Forests. At the same time, Government undertook a major institutional
reform of the environment sector, merging the previously dispersed government
agencies which had environmental responsibilities in a single National Environmental
Agency (IBAMA), with statutes that allow for greater autonomy in environmental
management and protection. IBAMA has some 5,600 employees (202 with its Brasilia
headquarters, and 80? with its state level Superintendencies), and its annual budget
in 1989 was in the order of US$100 million.



- 2 -
4.       These actions represent substantial progress, and provide a good framework
for expanding protection programs; however, overall environmental management and
protection must be further improved. Enforcement of environmental laws is only
partially effective, because of the constraints under which the environment sector
operates. The enforcement of legal requirements, such as environmental impact
studies (RIMAs), licensing (and subsequent monitoring and enforcement), environmental
zoning, and the protection of unique ecosystems and bio-diversity in Conservation
Units (para.5) have been limited by: (a) serious institutional and funding problems,
at the federal and state levels; (b) a lack of clear standards and guidelines for the
preparation, approval and enforcement of RIMAs, which are mandatory for all large
industrial, mining, infrastructure or agriculture projects; (c) a lack of well
defined environmental regulations; (d) a lack of systematic consideration of
environmental factors in regional and sectoral planning; (e) some remaining
contradictions between environmental law and some broader economic policies and
incentives; (f) a lack of environmental research, as well as poor use and
dissemination of existing scientific information; and, (g) a lack of public awareness
and understanding of environmental issues. As a result, serious and in part
irreversible damage to the environment has occurred in many areas of Brazil, at high
economic and social cost.
5.       If major, irrecuperable losses in genetic materials are to be avoided, these
problems must be addressed and Brazil's conservation system strengthened through
increased protection in existing conservation areas and the designation of
additional, carefully selected areas. In order to preserve some of Brazil's unique
ecosvRtemA. which are on the verge of suffering irreversible losses, localized
conservation efforts will not suffice, and broader regional programs for
environmental management, control of land use and polluting activities, watershed
protection and law enforcement for the protection of flora and fauna will be
necessary. Brazil is widely recognized as possibly containing the richest diversity
of genetic materials in the world, and has been classified as one of the world's six
"mega-diversity" countries by the World Wildlife Fund. Major examples of endemisms
in Brazil can be found in the Amazon, the Pantanal wetlands, the Atlantic Forest, the
Cerrado and along the Coast. To conserve the country's biological resources,
Government has established a National System of Conservation Units, under which, as
of July 1989, Brazil had 123 federal Conservation Units (2.45Z of the national
territory) and 205 state conservation areas. So far, however, the maintenance of
this conservation system, which requires significant research, protection and land
tenure regularization, has been precarious and it must be strengthened if major,
irreversible losses in genetic materials are to be avoided. In addition, broader
regional programs for control of land use, pollution, and for the enforcement of laws
protecting watersheds, flora and fauna are necessary.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy for Brazil emphasizes a
wide spectrum of environmental issues, including soil erosion, depletion of renewable
resources and bio-diversity, and air and water pollution from industrial or mining
sources. Over recent years, environmental issues hate assumed increasing importance
in connection with the Bank's program in Brazil, because most operations have a
direct impact on the environment, and, beyond this, because the Bank's interest in
sustainable and efficient economic development can only be assured if development
programs in Brazil are based on sound natural resource management. Externalities
must be fully taken into account or long-term returns to the economy will be
misjudged and development activities risk being misoriented. The Bank is concerlled
with the impact of environmental problems on people (among others through problems in
air and water pollution, and sanitation), and of broader effects of ervironmental
problems, such as the deforestation of the Amazon basin and the extinction of unique
species.

7.       The overall objective of a strategy for Bank assistance to the Government in
the environmental sector in Brazil would be to help put in place an economically
rational and effective system of environmental management and protection, that
balances objectives of environmental management and economic development. Such a
system must address the issues of conservation of bio-diversity, the protection of
vulnerabie ecosystems, Amazon development, land and water resources, and urban and
industrial pollution, within the broad guidelines of environmental directives and
legislation in Brazil. To help overcome present constraints, the Bank's assistance
strategy in the environmental sector is multi-pronged. Through lending instruments,
the Bank is helping to finance freestanding projects and environmental protection
components of projects which have an impact on the environment. It is helping to
strengthen the institutional capacity for environmental management, evaluation and
planning of organizat:.ons directly responsible for the environment, as well as of
other government organizations, whose programs might affect the environment (e.g. in
the energy and transport sectors). Economic and sector work, as well as related
support for ongoing Brazilian technical aseessments of the environment, are being
undertaken to increase the knowledge base for the identification of appropriate
economic and other policy incentives and interventions that would support sound
environmental management and protection.  In the short-term, four objectives call for
immediate Bank support: (i) the strengthening of Brazil's Conservation System; (ii)
the protection of critically endangered ecosystems, which would otherwise suffer
permanent, irreversible losses, (iii) the strengthening of the institutional capacity
to implement and monitor environmental policies, and (iv) the initiation of a longer
term process to improve the regulatory framntork.  Over the meditum-term, as
environmentally-damaging activities become better understood--both on the technical
and economic fronts-- these institutional regulatory efforts will have to be
supplemented, as appropriate, by more market-oriented policy instruments such as,
inter alia, pollution taxes, selective tax-subsidy schemes and marketable permits.
8.       Over the last decade, the Bank has supported environmental, forestry, and
Amerindian protection programs under many of its projects in Brazil. The Northwest
Region Development Projects (Loans 2060, 2116 dnd 2353-BR) and the Carajas Iron Ore
Project (Loan 2196-BR) were the first significant environriental programs, which were
supported by the Bank; they had mixed results but provided important lessons
regarding the design and execution of environmental programs. This first set of
projects was followed by the more successful Loans for the Electric Power Sector
(First Electric Power Sector Loan (Loan 2720-BR)), and for Pollution Control in Sao
Paulo (Loans 1822-BR and 2831-BR). The most recent loan in support of environmental
management was the Parana Land Management Project (Loan 3018-BR) (which, among
others, provided funds for start-up conservation activities in the Atlantic Forest
Region of the State of Parana). In 1989, the Bank also agreed to reallocate funds
under the Northwest Loas to an emergency campaign for the containment of forest
fires in Amazonia.
9.       The major lessons emerging from the experiences under the e'rlier projects,
have been the recognition of the importance of the consistency of the objectives
reflected in the overall economic policy framework, and of the specific environmental
actions supported in project or sectoral lending. Capable institutions for effective
environmental management,  an adequate legal framework, and broad educat.onal
information programs have been shown to be of critical importance. Based on the
range of its project experience in Brazil, its good dialogue with Government on these
issues, and broader technical and economic work on environmental issues, the Bank
appears to be in a singular position to assist the Government in the implementation
of a national environmental program.



-4-
10.      Project Objectives.  The project objectives are: (i) the strengthening of
the protection of the most important conservation areas, and endangered ecosystems,
and a reduction of economic and environmental losses. in the Pantanal, Amazonia,
Atlantic Forest and the Coastal Zone, and (ii) the strengthening of the national
environmental agency, IBAMA, and of state level environmental agencies, and of
environmental licensing, montitoring and planning functions, especially the guidelines
for RIMAs, Environmental Zoning, River Basin Management and the management of toxic
substances.
11.      Project Description.  The project would support the first three-year phase
of Brazil's PNMA. It would finance: (i) the strengthening of the National System of
Conservation Units (29Z of baseline cost), through improved protection of 50
existing conservation areas and establishment of at least five additional ones
representative of important ecosystems; (ii) Protection of Ecosystems (35? of
baseline cost), through special projects for environmental management and protection
for the Pantanal wetland, the remnants of the Atlantic Forest, and endangered
ecosystems along the Brazilian coast, and (iii) Institutional Development (34? of
baseline cost), through measures for the strengthening of IBAMA and selected State
level environmental agencies, including provision of mane,ement and legal assistance,
training, equipment, remote sensing and data-base information systems. Measures to
strengthen the regulatory framework, and environmental education would also be
supported. IBAMA would be responsible for overall coordination of the project, and
for the execution of the Conservation Units and Institutional Development components.
For the Protection of Ecosystems component, IBAMA would, through Operating
Agreements, delegate local environmental protection tasi's to the environmental
agencies of participating state governments. The Bank Loan of US$117 million would
cover 752 of total project cost. This disbursement ratio is justified: (i) to ensure
that current fiec±l ce -etr xntc do not further de'lay critical eavituluenLai
protection programs, which must be implemented now although their benefits will only
materialize over the long term, (ii) because important initial policy and
institutional actions have already been taken by Government during the preparation of
this Loan, in an effort to begin to put in place a significant environmental
protection program; and (iii) to minimize risks to the prompt execution of
environmental protection programs through shortfalls or delays in counterpart
funding. Recurrent costs for environmental protection activities would be financed
on a declining basis, and subsequently assumed by the respective state governments
for state activities, and by the federal government for federal conservation areas.
Retroactive financing will be made available for project expend4.tures incurred after
November 15, 1989, up to an amour.t not exceeding 10? of the loan.
12.      Agreed Actions.  Government has agreed to the following actions: (A) as
conditions for loan effectiveness: (i) that a unit responsible for Project
coordination would be in operation in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, with
adequate staff, equipment, facilities and other resources, and that the positions of
head of said unit and of three coordinators who will assist the head of the unit,
have been filled with professionals whose qualifications, experience and terms of
reference are satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) that IBAMA has assigned eight
professionals, whose qual'fcations, experience and terms of reference are
satisfactory to the Bank, to project activities; (iii) that higher level staff, in
adequate numbers and with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank, have
been retained by IBAMA to strengthen its Directorate for Administration and Finance,
and that the latter has been provided with adequate accounting equipment; and, (iv)
that the counterpart funds required to carry out the first year of the Project shall
have been approved in terms consistent with the estimated costs itl the 1990 budget of
the Borrower; (B) as conditions for loan disbursement: (v) for each existing
Conservation Unit to be consolidated under the project, that IBAMA would have updated
its 1988 baseline data on the the status of that Unit; (vi) for the execution of the
Protection of Ecosystems and Institutional Development components, that the
respective Operating Agreements with each of the participating States and executing
agencies will have been signed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank;
(vii) for the Brazilian Coast sub-component, as a condition for disbursement under



- 5 -
the project in each State and at the level of the Secretriat of the Interministerial
Council for Resources of the Sea (SECIRM), that local project coordination and
administrative arrangements be in place, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank; (viii) for the Remote Sensing sub-component, that IBAMA will have submitted to
the Bank (a) a copy of the executed agreement between IBAMA and INPE, satisfactory to
the Bank, u,der which INPE shall train staff to be assigned by IBAMA for the
interpretationi of remote sensing data in the 4 centers included under the project,
and (b) detailed terms of reference for the administration and staff of, and first
year training programs and required consultants'services for, the 4 centers included
under the project; and (C) among the dated covenants: (ix) that, by June 30, 1990,
IBAMA will have furnished to the Bank, for comments, detailed draft terms of
reference for the first set of studies proposed under the Technologies for
Environmental Management sub-component; (x) that, by June 30, 1990, IBAMA shall
contract the services of a management consulting firm to assist with the structuring
of IBAMA; and (xi) that, by September 1, 1990, ar. independent academic institution
will be hired by IBAMA, with qualifications and under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank, for the carrying out of annual iidependent evaluation studies of the
project.
13.      Benefits.  The immediate benefits of the project would bet  (i) better
protection and conservation of bio-diversity in existing priority Conservation Units,
and the creation of additional Conservation Units in other endangered habitats; (ii)
better environmental management and protection of the ecosystems of Amazonia, the
Pantanal, the Atlantic Forest, and the Coast; and, (iii) improvements in the
institutional and regulatory framework, which would have a country wide impact, (a)
within the environment sector, through improved capacity in key agencies (better
trained personnel, better access to and use of environmental information and
available expertise, better equipment and technical support from IBAMA for selected
State Environmental Agencies, improved legislation, environmental licensing, planning
and control procedures, and Lmproved opportunities for environmental financing from a
variety cf public and private sources); and, (b) outside the environment sector,
among the wider community (better information, comm<unity involvement and
environmental education). In the longer term, the activities supported under the
project will lay the foundation for sustainable and efficient economic development
through sound management of natural resources and strengthening of Government
capabilities for the implementation of Brazil's environmental policies.
14.      Risks.  One main risk is that the project executing agency, IBAMA, which has
been created only recently, is not yet fully consolidated, and therefore might
experience problems in carrying out this additional program.  Risks to the continuity
of the project may arise in connection with current changes in the Federal
Government, and changes in state governments in 1991. Project success would also
depend on a continued conducive policy framework, in which any remaining incentives
for environmentally adverse activities and investments, which might affect the
specific goals of environmental protection in the ecosystems of the Amazon, Pantanal,
Atlantic Forest and the Brazilian Coast would be identified and eliminated. To the
extent possible, these risks have been addressed in project design. IBAMA is to be
strengthened under the Institutional Development component. Detailed operating
agreements with participating states are designed to assure continuity of project
execution at the state level; regarding the commitment of the incoming new Federal
Government, prospects for implementing the project seem good, given that the
President elect advocates strong environmental programs. The need for continuity of
a favorable policy framework would be addressed through IBAMA sponsored studies of
and proposals for strengthening the legal and policy framework, including the
drafting of legislation to strengthen federal and state level environmental laws; in
addition, it would also be addressed thrcugh the Bank's policy dialogue and Economic
and Sector Work.

15.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the loan.
