MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRlESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTI  DIRtECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THIE REPUBLIC OF EUNGARY
FOR A TAX ADMNITRATION MODERNIZATION P?ROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Hungary for US$29 million equivalent to help fimance a Tax Administration
Modernization Project. The loan would be fer a term of 15 years, including a five-year grace period,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.    Badkground. Hungary's program to reform the tax system has been successfully undarway for
several years-it was the first Eastern European economy to introduce a market-oriented tax system. In
1986, it embarked on a program of tax reform which resulted in the replacement of a comple7. sys:em
of taxes with a Personal Income Tax (FtT) and a Value Added Tax (VAT) in 1988, and an Enterprise
Profits Tax (Err) in 1989. Thest taxes have become an important source of revenue for the Govermnent:
together with excise taxes, they accounted for about 44 percent of government revenue, equal to about
23 percent of aDP in 1992.
3.    In 1992, Hungary's fiscal situation deteriorated, maindy as a result of lower-than-expeced
revenues, and an increase in social safety net spending due tc the recession. The deficit in the
consolidated sta budget in 1992 was about 7.5 percent of GDp, and is projected at 6 percent of uDp for
1993. The Government is seeking to introduce a system under which moderate taxes are collected from
all economic actors, to promote development of the private sector by encouraging risk-taking and
initiative. It realizes that fiscal pressures must not be allowed to put pressure on legal tax rates, and that
fiscal improvement must come from improvements in collection achieved through better administration
of the tax system.
4.    To administer its new tax system, the Tax and Financial Controls Office (APEH) was established
in 1987. It has been assisted in this task by the reforms to date, the broad thust of which has been the
simplification of the tax system, since a tax administration can operate most effectively in a system with
a few broadly-based taxes, with low rates, and where exemptions are not widespread. Tax administradon
resources can therefore be allocated to checking income and profit levels, rather than on processing
excessive mbers of refunds, etc.
5.    In addition to reforms of the system of tax rates, significant effort has been expended on
modernization of the tax administration, in line with Hungary's transformation into a market economy.
The magnitude of the transition required in tax administration is enormous and, despite the good effort,
poses serious implementation problems. In mid-1991, drawing on the work of a series of IMP technical
assistance missions, APEH fornmlated a strategy for institutional improvements and strengthening, with
the objective of introducing a system of paying taxes based on voluntary compliance. APEH is in the
process of restructring along fimctional lines; shedding non-tax related responsibilities; strengthening
collection and audit functions; and developing improved procedures for filing of reurns and making
payments through the banking system. It proposes to implement a decentralized organizational structure,
under which county directorates would be autonomous in tax processing, and tax payments would
continue to be received through banks and post offices.



2
6.    Since Am'S esblishmenth the number of taxable entities has increased shaply, causing major
increases in worload. Regised legal economic organizations have incressed from 10,000 in 1988 to
over 69,000 by end-992 and there are currently more thum 100,000 taxable registered private companies
and entrepreneurs. With all VAT payers now required to submit reurns and payments monthly instead
of ammually, the number of rers to be processed annually will increase from 200,000 to 2.4 million,
causing major increases in workload. In addition, APBH is expecting to process about 140,000 Epr
reuns (up from 110.000 in 1992) and 1.6 million individual tax retrns in 1993 (versus 1.4 million in
1m).
7.    Sharp increases in the number of tax filings and collections are straining existing procedures,
systems and capacity. APH's information systems and work procedures largely date from its formation
in 1987 and were designed with the limited number of existng taxable entities in mind. Consequently,
there remains a serious iformation systems and technology constraint to the efficient administration of
a modern tax system in a market-oriented economy. Despite efforts to supplement capacity, existing
hardware will reach the end of its expected useful life in about 5 years and is already insufficient to deal
with the current workload. Furthermore, applications systems have been developed in-house in an ad
hoc mner to different standards and qualities and lack the flexibility to be adapted to facilitate efficient
tax processing. In keeping with implementation of a decenutized approach to tax processing, procedures
need to be redesigned, a new system engineering is necessary, and additional equipment needs to be
procured. This should Improve the efficiency of tax collection and provide the information necessary to
enable an effective and credible audWing process to be instituted. These requiements will be supported
by the proposed project.
8.    Project Objective. The objective of the project is to help strengthen tax administration, in line
with the ongoing tax reform, in order to maximize tax revenues in a sustainable way.
9.    Project Description. The proposed project is designed to support APEW'S modenization efforts
to develop and streamline policies and procedures, and to implement the underlying information
technology (rr) systems necessary for the ftioning of a modern and efficient tax administration.
Specifically, the project will support:
(a)   institutional development through the financing of short-term experts to provide advice
in tax administraion;
(b)    development and implementation of a new information technology system, including: Ct)
technical assistance to guide the development of a tax applications systems software, to
operate on new computer systems; (i) mainframe computers for Annes headquarters and
Budapest branch office, minicomputers and microcomputers for county offices, associated
peripheral equipment; Ciii) software development tools; and (iv) administrative software
packages; and
(c)   training in development and the use of applications systm.  Training in use of
hardware, and softWare tools will be provided by suppliers.'

10.   A special feate of the proposed prbjeat is the in-hotse developmat of tax applications systi ns
software by APEH's existing systems analysts and programmers. Its rr staff have the critical mass had
experience to effectively accomplish the task. However, to assist in designing systems that conform with
prevailing practice in modern tax administrations, this will be done under the guidance of two eternal
systems development specialists to be financed under the project. One, a senior tax automation specialist,
would be appointed for three years and would be the Project Coordinator. A shortlist of candidates for
this position has been agreed with the Bank and appoinm  of the Project Coordinator is a conditsion
of loan effecivess. The sewnd expert, a tax systems analyst, would be appointed at the time of start
up of the systems design process. The development and implementation of the new system will be phased
to take into account the absorptive capacity of APEWs staff.
11. A detailed description of the project is provided in the Technical Annex to this Memorandum.
Attacme  I to the Technical Annex presents an action program summadzing the objectives, expected
outputs and target dates for priority areas for further reform.
12.   Project Fllnanclng and Cost. Project cost is estiated at $55.6 million equivalent, excluding
taxes and duties from which the project is exempt. Of tbis, the foreign exchange cost is estimated at
$29.0 million equivalent. The Bank will fiance all foreign exchange costs (52 percent of total project
cost), while local costs ($26.6 million equivalent) will be financed by the Government. In addition, APEH
intends to use available EC PHARE grant fimding, separate to, but complementing the project, to finance
tax administration training. Retroactive financing of up to $2.9 million would be included to cover the
cost of equipment, training, and consultants needed for timely project start up. A breakdown of costs,
and the financing plan are contained in Schedule A. Attachment 3 to the Technical Annex gives a more
detailed cost summary. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Hungary are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
13.   Project Implementtion. The project would be implemented over three and a half years (see
Attacmen 2 to the Technical Annex for an implementation schedvle). To ensure timely project start-up,
APEH hired consultants to help draft the tender document for the main procurement package (hardware
and software development tools) to be fimanced under the project and issued the tender in mid-March
1993.
14.   APEH is also putting in place a variety of measures to help ensure the success, and sustinability
of the project. First, in view of its importance, APEWs President will manage the project, assisted by
a Steering Committee, which was established in March 1993. The Steering Committee, staffed by senior
APEH managers and the Project Coordinator, would guide institutional strengthening measures in line with
tax Iministration reforms, and ensure consistency between development and implementation of the
information systems and APEH'S tax operations. The responsibilities and staffing of this Committee have
been agreed with the Bank. Second, APEH is reorganizing its rr Department to facilitate the transition
to the new systems. In accordance with its rr Department reorganization plan, which it has agreed with
the Bank, separate units for policy/standards, systems design and programming will become operational
in a first phase, while divisions providing operational support will do so in a second phase. Selection of
the Head of the uf Deparme, assignment of at kast 50 percent of Uts stff, and commencment of
operations of the inil units Is a condition of lan effceness. And third, with regard to traiing,
APEH has prepared and discussed with the Bank a concept paper on tax aministaton training. This
paper is comprehensive, and provides an overall st     for training in both tax administraon and



4
information technology. By end-December 1993, APEH will prepare a program for training users of the
new tax application systems, which will be agreed with the Bank by March 31, 1994.
6S.   The IMw will continue to guide APEH on the institutional framework for tax administration, as
well as to provide technical assistance to ensure the successful implementation of the reforms. It has
helped prepare the project and will play an active role in implementation.
16.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. Lessons from similar projects indicate the need for
a clear focus and limited scope in the project; commitment at all levels (political, manageria and
technical); and a sense of ownership of the project by executing agency staff. The Ministry of Finance
and APEi management have indicated strong support for the early implementation of this prject.
Furthermore, AP}H and its President have consistently demonstrated initiative and ability to 4esign,
manage and implement reforms in tax administration policies, processes and procedures to date.
17.   Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is
in line with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAs) to continue supporting tne systemic
transformation process in Hungary. Specifically, the CAS states that the ptiority on the revenue side is
now to strengthen tax administration and collection, which will expand the tax base. Furthermore, the
Govrnments efforts to reach an agreement with the Ito hinge on reducing the budget defici, which
must come from increasing revenues as well as from increasing the efficiency of public expenditures
witiin the constrained macroeconomic parameters. Through the proposed project, the Bank and the ha
will support the Government's significant efforts in modernizing tax adminitration to help implement an
efficient and fair tax system. In addition, the Bank's involvement has strengthened project design and
will continue to guide the procurement process.
18.   Environmental Aspects.  In accordance with OD 4.01, the project has been placed in
environmental category C.
19.   Project Benefits and Risks. The institutional strengthening of APEH will improve tax collection,
promote compliance and improve information systems. This shoWid result in increased tax revenues,
generated at lower cost, and improve the faimess and efficiency of the tax system. APmE is currently
handling several billion dollars in tax revenues annually (a projected $9 billion in 1993); consequently,
even a marginal improvement in the level of collections would pay for the project and have a major
positive effect on the government budget. A possible risk is that a change in government or APEH's
management could change or delay the tax reform program. The risk of the tax reform program derailing
is minimal because the Government has a strong interest in improving the efficiency of the tax system
in order to increase revenues. Further, the potential benefits from improved administation are expected
to be robust in the face of delays and not dependent on tax policy considerations; hence the risk is
accptable.
20.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations the financing plan was confirmed and agreement was
reached on the following: (i) the shortlist for the Project Coordinator (para. 10); (ii) APEH's plan to
reorganize the rr Department (para. 14); (iii) APEH's proposals with regard to the Steering Committee
ara. 14); and (iv) APEH's concept paper, on training (para. 14). Agreement was also obtained from
APEH that it will maintain the Steering Commnittee and the reorganized rr Department in accordance with



5
the proposals, as geed with the Bank. The following actions are conditons of loan ffectiveness: (i)
appointment of the Project Coordiator (para. 10); and (ii) implementation of the first phase of the plan
for the reorganization of the Information Technology Dpartent (para. 14). By December 31, 1993,
Apm wil prepare a program (to be agreed with the Bank by March 31, 1994) to train its staff to operat
the new tax applications 8ystems (para. 14).
21.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

HUNGARY
TAX ADNIMTRTION MODERIZATION PROJECT
Technical Annex'
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. TaX         2
1.    Hungary was the first Eastern European economy to introduce a market-oriented tax system. In
1986, it embarked on a program of tax reform, which resulted in the introduction of a Personal Income
Tax (Prr) and a Value Added Tax (VAT) in 1988, and an Enterprise Profits Tax (Enr) in 1989. The Prr
and VAT replaced a complex system of over 100 consumer turnover taxes, a 3 percent property tax on
the net assets of enteprises, a 15 percent municipal tax on profits, a 10 percent wage bill tax and a
Ogeneral individual income tax. The Err replaced profit taxes that were differentiated by sector and type
of enterprise, a number of small sector-specific production taxes, the earnings tax and the entrepreneurial
tax. The tax reform of 1988 was particularly successfil in that it reduced intersectoral differentials in
taxation, and shifted the form of taxation from direct to indirect taxes, and among the former, from
enterprs to Individual taxation. It thereby increased the public's awareness of the scale and cost of the
Government's involvement in the economy.
2.    Until end-1992, the VAT was strutured with three rates-0, 15 and 25 percent. The zero rate
applied to about 40 percent of all consumer expenditures (ncluding most food products, fuels,
pharmaceticals, and household heating), while the 15 percent rate applied to most services. Ihe
standard 25 percent rate applied in 1988 to about 40 percent of consumer expenditures, and generated
95 percent of VAT revenues. Rebates were allowed for exported goods, while the VAT was levied on
imported items. Rebates were also allowed for housing construction by individuals and communities.
With the passage of the 1993 Budget Law, the structure of the VAT system has been overhaled, and on
January 1, 1993, the Government introduced a two-tier VAT system, with rates of 6 and 25 percent.
Most of the formerly zero-rated goods and services will be rated at 6 percent, which applies to staple
foodstffs, fuels and gas, public transport, water supply and sewerage, and some industrial products. For
the time being, medicines and household electricity will continue to be exempt from VAT. It is estimated
that in 1993, expenditures taxed at the 6 percent and 25 percent rates will generate about 25 percent and
75 percent, respectively, of total VAT revenue.

3.    When itroduced, the Prr had 10 brackets, with tax rates ranging from 20 to 60 perceat. Taxes
on inerest and dividend incomes were levied at a flat 20 perent, and were withheld at source. Given
the large amount of noncash inoomes, the widespread application of exemptions from taxable income,
and use of deductions, the Prr was effectively levied on only about 40 peren of household income. The
Prr was refrmed furher in 199M, bringing into the taxable base a number of fringe benefits previously
excduded. Furhermore, from 1992, the incomes of small agricultural producers, artis and invents
are increasingly subject to the Prr, which is expected to broaden the tax base by some Ft. 7.5 billion.
Maginal tax aes under the Prr have been reduced to 0, 25, 35, and 40 percent, wih the top rate being
applicable to monthly incomes above Ft. 500,000.
4.    The Err replaced profit taxes that were dffeentated by sector and type of etprise (e.g.,
publicfprivate, cooperativeslenterprises), as well as a number of smail sector-specific prduction taxes,
the enings tax, and the entrepreneurial tax. The En rate was set initly at 50 percent, with a 4
percent surcharge added for reenue reasons in 1989 alone. However, it included numerous tax reliefs,
targeted toward specific sectors and activities, with a resulting reduction in the effective unification
of tax rates.
5.     The VAT, Epr, and Prr, as well as excise taxes, all of which pass through Ann, represent a
significant source of goverment revenue. In 1992, they are esdmated to have accounted for about 47
percent of all government revenue and about 23 percent of onp; these percentages are projected to be
about the same in 1993. In 1992, the budget defict soared, in large part becase of shortffis in
corporate and personal income tax revenues due to a shrinkage In the tax base. This resulted from the
severe recession in Hungary, the decline in industrial production, and tax arrears and evasion-a large
part of the emerging private sector Is not yet captured in the tax net The impact of real sector events
is reflected in low corporate tax revenues-for 1992, they amounted to about 30 percent of the total
projected for the year, while Prr revenues were some 10 percent below target.
6.    The focus of the tax reforms has been to simplify the system, since a tax adminisration can
operate most effectively in a fiscal system where taxes are broadly based and few in number, where ta
rates are low and few, and where exemptions and specW prerences are not widespread. In such a fiscal
system, tax administation resources can be allocated to checking income and profit levels, rather than
to processing excessive numbers of refunds or exmning entitlement to preferences. The recent reforms
bave been signiflca  st    wards accomplishing these goals, though further modifictions remain
necessary
B. T Ado
7.    The Tax and Financial Controls Office (APi) was established in 1987 o administerthe new
system of taxes by consolidating the functions previously assigned to the General Directorate for Financial
Audit with a large part of the tax aminon functions carried out by local councis. However, its
opeaions have been constrained in several ways. First, it has had to perform a number of activities not
related to tax administrton, such as undertakig financial and economic audits of the state-owned
e prises  (sas), and dministste subsidies. Second, its work procedures, which largely date from
is formation in 1987, were designed with the limited number of taxable etitles then in existence in mind,

and are not well suited for administerlng a modern tax system In a market-oriented economy.' And
third, the design of the tax system, which includes significant exemptions and other reliefs, added
considerably to ApEm's administrative burdens.
RatIonal for Tax Administration Reform
8.    With the move toward privatization and a vigorous market-oriented economy, the share of
revenues collected from SES should decline and that of revenues collected from the growing !rivate sector
should increase considerably, provided tax compliance can be enforced adequately in that sector. If APnu
is unable to do so, considerable revenue shortfalls coud result.
Reform Progm
1. Objetives
9.    Since mid-1991, when a new APEH President was appointed, a major program to modernize tax
adminisUation has been underway, in line with recommendations of, and technical assistance from, the
bIP. APEH'S top management has been, and continues to be, a prime supporter of these changes. Ihe
new system being put in place by AmN has three major objectives-Mat it be based on strengthening
revenue performance, that it encourage voluntary compliance, and that it improve resource allocation.
In regard to the first, APEH's objective is to secure budgeted revenues. This will be achieved by setting
revenue targets for the counties, by closer monitoring of large taxpayers, and by effecting more reglar
payments to improve cash flow management for the state. With regard to the second, APn would
promote voluntary compliance by creating a reasonable risk that noncompliance will be detected, and once
detected, will be penalized. With regard to resource allocation, APEH's objective is to free itself from
unproductive tasks and those that can be accomplished equally well by other agencies, to allow it to
concenate on compliance enforcement. This will be achieved through further simplification of the tax
system and improved collection of taxes. The implementation of the reform program in AnH Is well
underway and is moving at an impressive pace, as described below.
2. Role and organization
10. APEH'S management has initiated an in-depth internal restructuring. As an important initial step
in the reform program, APEH'S role has been clarified-it is to be first and foremost a revenue collection
agency. It is therefore no longer required to undertake economic and financial audits of sss. For the
time being, however, until they are significantly reduced or phased out, APEH will continue to adminster
state subsidies.
11.   APn  now has a two-tier organizational structure, with headquarters in Budapest, 20 county
offices (including the directorate in Budapest) and 200 county-level branches. APEH has fully merged
tax operations at the county level, and APEH has been reorganized along fimctional lines with activities

for aU taxes combined under separate divisions, e.g., collecion, audit, etc. Ibis streamlining of APN's
operations has allowed it to consolidate its most important functions-tax collections and audit. In line
with its intention to dentize its processing operaions, all taxpayer registration systems and records
were transferred to county offices in December 1992 and certain payment and return processing systems
in January 1993. Among other significan changes, the Financial Data Center, a governt-owned
computer processing agency which was responsible for maintaining data for taxpayer accounting systems
and for processing payments, has been taken over by APEH and aagamatd with the Tax Accounting
Office. APEH has over 7,000 staff, of which about 1,100 are located at APE's headquarters and 1,200
at the Budapest directorate. An additional 4,700 are located in the remaining counties. Tbe staff are
genealy highly qualified and almost half have graduate degrees.
3. Tax Processing
12. Workload. Processing of VAT accounts for the major part of APEH's worldoad, and an
increasingly importan source of its revenues. Of about 500,000 VAT registrations, 200,000 are active
taxpayers; the rest are either exempt or have turnovers below the Ft. 300,000 teshold. Commencing
Jamuary 1993, all of the active VAT payers are required to file and pay VAT monthly, which wil increase
the mnber of return prosed annually to 2.4 mIllion fiom 200,000. Of these, the 14,000 largest
taxpayers (enterprises with an annual VAT, Epr, PIr assessment or excise liability greater than Ft. 3
million) will also need to file special monthly returns for reconciliation of EPr advances, Prr withholding
and excise taxes. About 14,000 medium-sized taxpayers will also have to file quarterly reconciliations;
the remainder will continue to submit annual reconciliations. Epr returns are projected to increase fom
110,000 in 1992 to 140,000 in 1993; and some 1.6 million PIT returns are expected to be processed
during 1993 (up from 1.4 million in 1992). Finally, wealth declarations for an expected 5 million
residents are due to be introduced in mid-1993.4
13. In addition to tax returns, APEH processed about 500,000 refund and adjustment claims in 1992.
Ptr refund claims are not subject to review prior to the processing of returns (Prr refunds average about
Ft. 10,000 per return). All VAT refund claims exceeding Ft. 200,000 are subject to audit, and a large
number are denied. By phasing out VAT refimds for self builders, claims for VAT refinds are expected
to decline by up to 200,000 cases after 1994.
14.   Procedures. Revised procedures for filing rens and payment of taxes became effective at the
beginning of 1993. Changes include: new monthly payment advices required from the largest 14,000
taxpayers (increased controls by APEH staff should ensure that these payments are made on time); a new
monthly VAT form to report retrns; and a new annual ret  for 1992 income to be completed by Enr
payers.
15.   The accounts of the 14,000 monthly filers (with VAT, Err, Prr wifthholding tax or excise
liabilities exceeding more than Ft. 3 million annually) are being handled by the counties as of February
1993. Payment data received at headquarters can be broken down by county, taxpayer and by tax.
Monies paid into the taxpayer's account by the end of the day can be posted to the taxpayer's account
the next day. All taxpayer registration functions have already been transferred to the county compute

so th  in the fiture only summary data on taxpayer registrations will be held at the head office for
bap   purpose.
16.   In 1992, county offices were allocated specific revenue targets, consiste with the move to give
them greater responsibility; revenue collection is now a key measure in assessing their prformance.
APEH staff participated In the preparation of the 1993 budget estimates and are satisfied that 1993
collection targets can be achieved. The different counties collected between 98-103 percen of their
targets for the 1992 reporting year.
17.   CoDecton of tax through banks. Curently, tax payments are made to bans and post offices;
returns are fled separately with APEH. Approximately 90 percent of the value of Apmi's tax payments
are made through the commercial banks, the remainder through the National Savings Bank and the post
offices. Payments through the commercial banks represent about 83 percent of the total number of
payment transactions. Problems in collecting taxes through the banks arise becase of delays In the
processing of payment transfers by the banks and the practice of taxpayers signing transfers when there
are insufficient fimds in their accounts to cover payments. The banks forward a payment slip to APN
only when a transfer has been effected. Payment information is frequently accompanied by insufficient
da  or, especially that prepared by the banks, contains errors. Hence, AnH invests considerable
reoces in reconciling taxpayer records and bank records of payments to control non-payers and late
payers. This is a serious problem that results in large amounts of tax being placed in suspense accounts
for extended periods. Consequently, APH is keen to move to new arrangements under which taxpayers
would both fle simplified reurns and make payments through the ba     system.5 This is eWpected
once the banks and the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) are linked into the new inter-bank Giro payments
system. Under the proposed process, the banks would transfer an electronic truncated version of the tax
returns direcly to Apn's account in NBH, and simultaneously batch and forward the paper returns to the
Am  county office for subsequent reconciliation. Although the Giro system is epected to be operational
shordy, it will be another 2 years or so before enough banks have been sufficiendy modemized for AIN
to transfer to the new system.
18.   Audit. APNH is also actively using audits as a means to improve tax collection. In l992, it
completed about 200,000 audits, including comprehensive, specific audits (e.g., VAT control audits) and
"cash management" audits. ITis last category includes checks to reconcile tax payments ;n transition
frm banks to APEH and investigations to identify moveable propert that can be confiscated where
taxpayers owe signiflcant amounts. Joint reviews have been undertaken with the customs service on VAT
and excise matters. Audits of related entites are also being pursued at the same time because significant
tax frauds are being perpetrated through such practices as the use of "paper" invoices between related
entities. APEH has found it difficult to collect tax and penalties in many audit cases because companies
have no assets when audited and their principals have moved on and set up new businesses. In this
regard, the Government is apparently considering new laws requiring guarantees tat debts Wil be paid.
The interest payable on unpaid taxes is currently 40 percent (double the central bank's base rate), and
the penalty for evasion is 50 percent of the tax evaded. For 1992, tax audit assessments amounted to
s     Posite argangems for fiing retus ad mkng payms thrugh th banking systm ar outund in Appendi

about Ft. 27 billion and about t. 13 billion were collectd by the end of the year (a 100 percent
improvement over the previous year).
19.   With regard to tax armar, AnH  is vigorously pursuing collection efforts. The  wnmbe of
collection officers has increased from 350 at the start of 1992 to 600 curenty, and further increases are
possible in 1993. APSH has the sam stabus as an unsecured creditor in liquidation proceedings, and little
tax is collected through these proceedings. Seizure of assets is considered a more effective approach but
the difficulty has been to detect cases where assets have not been dissipated before collection action Is
inidated. APnN's stVpped-up efforts yielded about Ft. 25 billion in 1992 (compared to Ft. 16 billion In
1991); however, some Ft. 65-70 billion in arrears remain outstanding. Only Ft. 10-15 bilion of this Is
estmated to be recoverable; the remainder has been won the books" for some tme, and consist of debts
of enterlpses that are in bankruptcy or being liquidated.
C. Informaion Technology Systems
20. lardware APEH's existing tax-processing systems are based on DEC 4000 and 6000
minicomputers in the counties and head office, which have insufficient capacit to deal with the current
processing worldoad. In addition, the Head Office uses four mainhfam  Siemens 7560 compute  to
process collections and refnds, and to support tax accunting. All machin4 operate at ful capaci
during peak hours and all on-line disk storage is effectively utilized. Microcomputers are used
extensively in APEH's offices.
21.   Tax Applications Softwar  A number of operating systems and database nmagement tools are
used for systems development and processing of taxes. The tax applications softwae was developed in-
house by APEH's sysems development and programming staff. Although this softwaR functions, it was
developed incrementally, at different locations, and to different standards, qualities and internal corols.
Moreover, APEH lacked the benefit of an experienced exter  tax systems design specialist; consequently
the existng system does not optimize hardware utlization or integrate tax operations functions, and does
not provide an effective manaement information system  MM.  Furthermore, the diversity of
programming languages used has resulted in excessive systems development and maance ovetheads,
as well as the need to repeatedly train staff in different technologies.
22.   Communications. Ihe existing APEH data communication faciities comprise a centr routing
VAx computer using dial-up X21 standard interfaces. To minimize data transmission costs, the x2i linkS
form a star network operating at 2400 baud, with data compression to achieve throughputs of 7200 baud.
In addition, the more expensive 9600 baud x2s packet switching connections are used when incred
bandwidths are required for high volume file transfers. APn has also recently established a microwave
link between its Budapest computer ceater and its accounting office, located about six kilometers away,
and is transmitting data effectively at a rate of 2 megabytes.6
23.    Iformation Technology Staffing.  Ann currently has 37 systems analysts, most with
substantial systems design experience, and 100 programmers with varying levels of expertise. Ihis staff
6     Conideble pogress has been made over the pastw yea in t upgmdiag of h publicu

consists of severa groups, one of which mainains and operates the existg tax and adminiradve
application syste. Anoter group works with APEH's Siemens mainfme computers, undertakes the
centralized cash managemen and accounting fmnctions and also operates a limited number of systems for
agencies such as the Ministy of Finance (MOP) and the National Savings Bank (NSB). In the futur, when
its new systems become operational, APn  plans to disontine servicing these agencies and will transfer
to them the Siemens computers, the appropriate software and the necessay support staff (about 30
programmers).
24.   System  Constraints. As mentioned above, the tax applications software iS not Wroprily
designed to fcilitate efficient tax processing, and cannot be modified adequatly to enable it to do so.
Hence, a completely redesigned system is necessary, consistent with AnN's decealization of
prmcesing, and improvements in its procedures, controls and work flows. This system should be flexibly
designed to accommodate future operational improvements, such as: development of a national tax
denification system; selective audit strategies and delinquency management, and single-return filing and
payment arrngements with commercial banks and the post office network.
25.    The inadequacy of Amn's informatton systems to handle its rapidly growing workload is
impeding its collection, audit and enforcement actvities. Rs existing hardware is on average at least 4-5
years old. Since the useful life of such equipment does not usually exceed 10 years, it would need to be
replaced within the next 5 years. Consequendy AnH has the option of either continuing to increment
its proessing capacity with additional DEC hardware, or planning a long-term hardware engineering, to
be phased in over the next few years. The option of incrementally prcring equipment has two principal
diadvantges: new equipment would likely be comparable in cost and less flexible than an integrated
solution; and used equipment, although cheaper, would need replacement within the next few years in
any case, and would be less reliable.
U. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
26.   The proposed project is designed to address the above constrin  and to support Ames
modernization effbrts. It will include institutional development measures to develop and streamline
procedures in critical areas such as the collection systems, audit selection capability and compliance
monitoring; and implement information systm  to support the process Improvements. Specifically, the
project will finance: (a) technical assistance for instittonal development; (b) implementation of a new
information technology system (ardware, database software development tools, software packages for
adminitrative applications and technical assistance to guide the development of tax applications software);
and (c) taning.
A. Insttutonal Development
Priority Operaona lmprovements
27.   As mentioned above, AnH has made commendable progress in implementing institonal reforms
as part of its modernizon progrm.  s focus now will be to consolidate the gains of recen refom
and to implemen high-priority iniiatives relating to collecion and audit. In this conte=4 Ann has



18
PAP  of 19
identified the following areas as priorities for further reform in the short to medium term. Priority
acions and indicative target dates are summized in Achment 1.
a.   Colection of txes. Currently, tax collectons, payments aid refimds (cashier function) are
procssed centraly in Budapest. Collections from individuals are received through the National Savings
Bank and the post offices, while payments from enterrises are rec<ived through commercial bank
brnches or the NBH network. APeH's first priority in its modernizaton program continues to be the
ln~pwvemm of its collecion systems, particularly with respect to the payment of VAT, excises,
withholding taxes and Epr advances by the largest taxpayers. Most impc rtandy, these improved systems
will be designed to ensure eady Identification of taxpayers who fall to file rerns and pay taxes on time.
29.   As a first step to improve this situation, a new VAT retr and a stdardized payment form in
respect of tax debit adjustments on Prr reus ue to be introduced in 19)3. More importly, the use
of standardize slips for payment of all taxes will also be discussed with the banks. In the medium-term,
as Hungay's banking system is modemized, APEH plans to introduce new procedures for filing retums
ad paying tax at banks, using a single doument. ITis importa reform will require careful planning
and a staged implementation to ensure its effectiveness in simpliffing processing and the monitoring of
returns and payments by APBm staff.
30.   Return simplification and coletion of "non-a" data. Recent reforms of the tax laws have
not made the task of simplifying the Information requirements of Hungay's tax returns any easier. The
inclusion of additional items in the new VAT return form at the request of the Statistics Office conflicts
with APEH's priority to proess only data necessary for tax adminisation purposes. ITe decision to
require the filing of approximaely 5 million wealth declarations will also create a significant additional
presing workload for APEH. As APEH modernizes Its computer systms, it will need to cnti ly
subject Its inormation requirements to critical review. Tax returs will need to be simplified, removing
items that have a 'non-txc purpose, wherever possible. APEH is discussing this issue with the
Government.
31.   Audit. Large taxpayers are audited anmnally, medium-ized businesses every two years, while
privatelsmall businesses are targeted for audit within a five year period. Reoognizing that   is not
possible to undertake regular audits of the liabilities of all taxpayers, APE} will introduce a new selective
audit strategy that will provide an appropriate coverage of the taxpayer population. As part of the
strategy, APEH wiul instite  a progrm of issue-based' audits, and audit staff will be monitored more
closely than in the past to ensure that audit plans are followed. For 1993, 80 percent of audit target
categories have been set for the counties, the remaining 20 percent is left to the discretion of the county
directors. Well-designed audit systems and procedures will ensure tgat there is a reasonable rk that
noncompliance with the tax laws will be detectd and penalized aproprtly. APEH continues to
improve its audit planning and strategies and, in 1993, as part of its efbrt to intensify its audit activities,
plans to undertake over 2,000 person-years of audit work.
32.   Process Inpro-ements. A number of changes and improvements in proceses also remain to
be implemented. APE's program ptoposes a decentralized processing operation under which the county
direct      would be autonomous in tax processig, while banks and the post office would condtne to
receive tax payments. Under this sysem, all reus and other taxpayer information will be processed
at the county level. In the near ftue, APEH lso plans to decentalize the account management functns

(receivaleslpayables/accounts) to the couty offices. County office computer wil be able to access up-
odate information regarding the accounts of local taxpayers and mainain information to assist with the
loca audit activities. In the fiture, Amn plans to continue to streamline its organizaton to improve its
efficiency and effectiveness. APEH also Intends to introduce a centrally maintained Tax Identification sub-
system in 1994. lTis will facilitate compliance monitoring and auditing.
Techndcal Assistance for Institutional Development
33.   In line with the priorhies identified above, the project will ffnance about 18 months of shortterm
uternal consultants, to assist APEH in the implementaion of its Insiatutional reform. The heP will help
Anm to identify needs, define terms of reference, identify the appropriate consultants to provide this
advice and supervise outut, and, as appropriate, provide some technical assistance direcdy. Areas for
possible assistance are indicated below. lhe foreign exchange cost of tis cmponent ls estimated at
about $0.3 mUlon.
3     D       dDevelopxme ofsandard1zedpaymentsfoim. Amn irnends to inroduce astandardized payment
form for Pnr debit adjustments in 1993 and to discuss with the bans the use of stdardzed
forms for the payment of all taxes to help alleviate the current problems in reconciling tax
payments with tax liabilities. A specialist in form design would be required for about one month
to assist in this effovi.
-     Rtedesgning returnjbns. To help improve tax administration, APEH would like to simplify tax
retr forms, particularly those for VAT and Prr, and to eliminate from these forms data
reuirement unnecssay for tax purposes. About two months of external assistance will be
required to assist in this process.
*     Deweopment of selection crteriafor VAT audtS. With the introduction of a reglar monthly VAT
return in 1993, APBH will be able to gather statistical data from those returns. Through analysis
of markup ratios of different categories of VAT taxpayers it will then be possible to select cases
for specific VAT audits in a more systematic way. The development of a computer-based
iformation system that uses markup ratios to identify taxpayers for VAT audits is a priority for
AnH, especially given the importance of this revenue source. About three months of external
assistance is provided under the project to help develop these selection crteria.
*     Devopment of new procedures forfUng rewslpaylng txe through the baking ystem. As
the ban  begin to introduce mon banking practices, APh  intends to develop new procedures
for filing returns and paying ta . sarough the banking system. Introduction of such procedures
will require carefal planning. Implementation would take place on a staged basis, for example,
sarting in one county with the more technologically advanced banks. About six months of
extera exptise i provided under the project to assist in the development of these procedures.
*     Other needs. Provision is also made in the project for additional external assistance to meet other
short-term needs identified during the course of project implementation.

interconnection would be through telecommunications drivers and high-speed networks. The existing
networks support this telecommunication engineering.
Applicat;ons System Design and Development
44.   The project will support the In-house development of a new tax applications system software,
which would conform with prevailing practice In other tax administrations. This would be done by
APEH'S existing in-house rr staff, complemented by external systems design specialists (para. 51). This
rr staff has developed the existing tax applications software and will provide the critical mass and
experience to effectively accomplish the task. Once the new systems are operational, Apn will require
fewer programming staff. Some would be required to enhance, operate and mainn the new tax and
administrative applications; others would be retrained in DBase, rr standards and other rr disciplines.
Some reduction in staffing is also expected to take place through attrition and reassignment.
45.   A standard systems development methodology, together with advanced (CASE) tools, would
enhance rr staff productivity and ensure consistent and quality deliverables. In addition, an advanced
reletionai database management system (RDBMS) would be procured to facilitae systems development,
programming and reporting activities; this would operate in all the counties and at the head office. To
ensure stringent protection of the confidentiality and security of the database, systems will incorporate
access and authentication controls at all levels ai4 access to the database will be restricted. Encryption
and decryption software would be provided to secure data and prevent unauthorized access to APEH
records and data.
46.   Systems designs and specifications would be developed by a central systems development group
at APEH's head office. Programs would be developed using four minicomputers at development sites in
the Budapest county office and three other counties, where experienced systems development staff are
located. The programming tasks allocated to these decentralized programming groups would be
modularized, and systems integration and testing effected centrally in Budapest to ensure the quality and
integrity of systems before they are put into production. APEn would 'prototype" new systems to ensure
that each module is responsive to the end user's needs. To effectively obtain end user participation and
input into the design of processes, processing logic, reports and forms, APEH will consider the creation
of functional teams (e.g., auditing, cash management) to jointly identify requirements with the systems
designers. Each functional team would be responsible for the effectivoess of Its operational sub-systems,
with the rr Department being responsible for the error-free operation of the sub-systems. In line with
the above approach, any modifications or enhancements to the applications systems would be made by
the central systems development group.
47.   This approach will be reviewed periodically during project Implementation and modified as
appropriate to ensure effective implementation of the new applications system. In addition, a
methodology will be instituted to verify the operational effectiveness of each system module, which would
be pilot tested for at least one operational cycle after it has been programmed to ensure that it is fully de-
bugged before it becomes fully operational. To this end, one of the counties would be nminated as a
pilot site where the new tax application systems will operate in parallel with the old systems to verify the
inegrity and accuracy of processing data.

Technical Assistance for Information Technology Development
51.   The project will finane technical assistance to support Amn's information tecbnology program.
Specifically, it will finance two long-term specialists in systems design and development to coordinae
system development activities. One expert, a senior systems specialist and also project coordinaor,
would remain in place until project completion.  This expert would coordinate informion
techology/systems activites (particularly with regard to inouse systms development and
implemention activities) with the improvements in processes, forms and controls, cooint
procrement actvities and liaise with hardware suppliers and assist in regular reporting of project

progress. An important part of this advisor's responsibilitis will be to train counterpart staff so that this
role can be paed out toward the end of project Implentation and the futions _ad by local staff.
APEH has provided the Bank with a sordist of candidat  for the project coordinaor position. Ms
poime  Is a condiion of loen ede. The second specialist, to be appoitd for 12 months,
to coincide with the start up of the sytem  design process, would be an experienced tax systems andyst
and would help design the new system, and assist AuH staff tO program and implement it. Both
speciai  will assist Ann in acceptance testing of software packages, and specify any special
ustiaion necessary. They will alo assme primary responsibility for sytm testing, protyping
and nteation acves and for emurag cost effectve and responsive system operation. Tes of
Refernce for both advisors have been agreed with tie Bank and are contined in the Project Fie. Te
project wll also finance a frig expert for about 1 month to assist Ann In evaluati  te bids and
drfting a evaluation report for the main bardware conac and softwaes development tools to be
provided under the project, and tax system experts for abou 2 mondhs to validate the systems' overall
design philosophy and desig  lhe emeforgn exchange om of dis eqon ks abow $0.8

Transiton to the New Systm
52.   Given that the new syms and equpmet being financed under the project are not expd to
be fully opeationa until 1995, but tih  Ann's workload will increase shaply between 1992-94, it wil
need to implement measurs to cope in the itrim. To ac     d   the ubsay increased
worlad, in 1992 A}H purchased some $5.5 million eq aent worth of addional DEC compute and
priphera equipment. Recent work undertakn by consoltants indicates that by mid-1993, Ann wl naeed
additional 4uipment. AnE  will theefore agmnt its exisdag hardware with addiional  ed DWc
eqipment of tpproximately t  same age as the exst  equipmenT   acqition i estmatd to comt
Ft. 30 million (about $0.4 millon eq aent), and wil be financed by Am. As tie new applications
systems become operational and he etg quipmnt reaches the end of its useful life, Ann woud
need to decide whether the    Inistrte applications (apm   48) should also operate on the new
hardware. During the transition piod A     would postpone making any changes to theextg tax
application syms opeatnl on th DC equippment except hose neceita  by change in the law.
Ths approach would allow m staff to proced with the design of the new system in a rational and
organized manner, and would enace success  Implementation of the project by minimizin the rbsks
associated with the alternave of overly rapid introduction of nw techology. The project will finance
a foreig  expert for about 1 week to help ientfy suitable suppliers of used DEC equipment (to be
instIled during the transition period), obtain quotatin and ensure that the needed used equipmt is
appropriay certified.
C. Traiw
53.   AnH propos  to train its staff through a variety of sources. Training in the use of bardwar,
and software development tools, will be provided by the suppliers. n addition, the project will finance
the  ollowing: (i) technical tain   ni the aDMs, CAss tools, etc., for about 100 rr staff by exteal
speciaists; (Hi) a course in a stndard system dvelopment methodology; Oil) taining of about 400 staff

from different disciplines in the operation of the new systems;  and (iv) a limid nmber of study tours
(10 weeks in total) for Amn operational staff to visit other taxation authorities to review their tax
ope ation practices.  he esatedforegn exchange cost of ds componentis about $O.S mlion.
54.   With the assistance of the project coordinator, APE  will draw up a detailed training program by
December 31, 1993, which will be discussed and agreed with the Bank no later than March 31, 1994.
nhis program will identify the items to be financed under the Bank loan, provide details on the staff
needing to be trained in specific technical dhciplines and help identify suitable staff for advanced rr
training. It will also outline the in-house programs, to be developed to provide training in the operation
of the new systems, which wil be financed by APrH.
55.   Support for training for tax administration will be provided under a grant from the wc-PHARE.
APEH and HAnR have agreed that the latter will assist with the development of a traiing stategy and
program for AnH, based on a detailed needs assessment. As a strting point for this needs asessment,
Am has prepared a training concept paper,' which was discussed with an expert from the training
department of the UK Inland Revenue, financed by PHARE, who visited APEH in January 1993. This
paper, which is a comprehensive document providing an overall strategy for training in both tax
Iaministration and information technology, was discussed with the Bank during negotiations. Based on
feasiblity studies, PHAn could assist AnN to finance a taxation training center, pilot "train the trainer'
programs, and finance the production of specialist training materW from existing allocations. As needed,
supplementary funding from the PHARaxs 1993 allocation may be sought.
D. Project Cost and Financing
56.   Project Costs. The total project cost (Schedde A) is estimated at about $55.6 million equalent,
of which about $29 miUlion are foreign exchange costs. Local costs associated with the project are
esdmated at about $26.6 million equivalent (Ft. 2.2 billion). Hardware and software costs are subject
to physical contingencies of 10 percent. Foreign costs are subject to price contingencies of 3.8 percent
for 1993, 1.9 percent for 1994, 2.7 percent for 1995 and 3.4 percent for 1996. Local costs are subject
to price contingencies of 13 percent in 1993, 11 percent in 1994, 9 percent in 1995 and 7 percent in
1996. The cost estimates for studies, consultans assignments and tning are based on typical current
costs for such assignments. Local costs include anmual equipment manenat ce costs, which are estimated
at 8 percent of costs, and software maitnce and licenses esdmated at 15 percent.
57.   F1andng. A summary of the project financing plan, which was confirmed during negotiations,
is also shown in Schedule A. The proposed Bank loan will finance 100 percent of the foreign exchage
cost of the project (about 52 percent of the total cost). The local curency cost requienit (about $26.6
million equivalent, including incremental recurrent costs) will be met by APEH from its own resources.
In addition, APH intends to use available n-PHAuE grant funding, separate to but conplementing the
project, to finance the tax adminisration training.

ID[. PROJECr ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMrTATION
A. Project Implementation Arrangements
58. The Project is expected to be implemented over a three and a half year period (mid-1993 to end-
1996). The Ministy of Finance will be the borrower of the Bank loan, while APEH will be responsible
for Its execution. In view of the Importance of the project to APEH's ability to carry out its tsks, the
President of AnPH will be the overall project manager, and will be assisted in this task by a Steering
Comoitte. It w-ill also reorganize its Information Technology Department to better implement the
project.
Stewing Comnittee
59.   Role. Armi has established a Steering Committee to guide and oversee institutional strengthening
measures and tax adm      on  reforms, and to ensure consistency of the development and
implementation of the informaion system with AP$H's tax operations. The activities of this Committee
will be closely integrated with AnH's day-tday operations. Its responsibilities and staffing were agreed
during ngotiations and ae outlined below.9
60.   ResponsIbities. The Steering Committee will provide guidance on: (Q) institutional strengthening
mesures, including ;plementation of recommendations formulated by the external specialists; (ii)
process improvements in line with ta administation reforms; and (iii) information systems development
and information technology activities in the implementaion of the new systems. In this context, the
Committee would be involved in the major decisions involving strategies, system engineering,
procurement, operational impacts, staffing, and budgeting for the project. The Committee would also
be expected to resolve conflicts or problems arising in implementing the systems developmental activities
and ensure consistency of recommendations from the various tax adminison and reform specialists.
61.   Composition. The Committee is chaired by the President of APEH, and includes the heads of
at least six departments, including the following departments: Tax Operations, Collection and Settlement,
fTormation Technology, Personnel and the Budapest County Directorate. Ihe Project Coordinator will
be a non-voting member of this Committee.
Information Technology Department
62.   To promote efficient project implementaton, APsH plans to integrate its rr staff into one
department. The task of designing, developing and implementing the new tax application systems
requires at APEN systems analysts and programmers work together as one team. Although they would
belong to the central rr department, they would continue to work out of the head office and the counties.
APIH plans to accomplish the reorganization task in two phases.10 Aa cond4 on Of loan effecVeness,

of their fidl complement.  The remaining divisions, which would provide operational and
telecommunication support functions, would also be created at that time and fully staffed by early 1994.
To avoid weakening the systems development effort, APEH plans to segregate as much as possible staff
developing the new systems and those mainning the existing one. The new rr Department will be
structured so as to ensure this separation.
B. ocureanent
63. Schedule B summarizes the project elements, their estimated costs and the proposed methods of
procurement
64.   ICE. Procurement for the proposed project will be in accordance with Bank Procurement
Guidelines. Equipment will be procured following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures for
packzt.,es estimated to cost more than $300,000 equivalent per contract, in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (May 1992). It is anticipated that
about 90 percent (about $26.0 million total) of all project-related hardware and software will be grouped
in one large package and two smaller packages, the contents of each of which could be provided by one
supplier, and procured through IcB. The major package for hardware and software development tools
is expected to be valued at about $20 million. APEH engaged consultants to prepare the bidding
documents for this package. The documents, which were issued in mid-March 1993, are based on the
standardized documents currently being used in other projects in Hungary and specify a two-stage bidding
process. The other two packages (software for administrative applications and image processing
quipment, valued at about $2.5 million and $3.5 million respectively) will be in accordance with World
Bank one-stage procurement guidelines. All draft documents will be reviewed by the Bank prior to
finalization. In the comparison of bids for equipment procured through ICs, domestic maurers
would be allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent, or the existing customs duty, whichever is lower,
over the CIF prices of competing imports. This may be applicable to locally assembled microcomputers,
modems, etc.
65.   International Shopping. IS procedures would be used for contracts for equipment which are
estimated to cost less than $300,000 per contract and not to exceed an aggregate amount of $1.0 million
equivalent. Contacts would be awarded on the basis of price quotations solicited from at least three
suppliers from three eligible countries, provided that quotations are obtained from at least two eligible
countries, in accordance with the Bank's standard procurement guidelines.
66.   Other Methods. Computer room facilities and equipment, and incremental recurrent costs such
as equipment and software maintenance, telecommunications costs, etc. (about $26 million equivalent)
will be financed entirely by the Government and would be procured in accordance with standard
government procedures. Direct contracting could be used for items of a proprietary natre, up to a
maximum of $500,000 in the aggregate, in accordance with Bank Guidelines and with the prior agreement
of the Bank. Procement of the standard systems development methodology training and materials, and
computer applications software, including annual upgrading and licensing arrangements, would be carried
out through this procedure.



28
Annex
Page 18 of 19
67.   Teucncal Assistance. Trai    and consultant services (estimated at about $1.4 million),
including two longterm advisors and about 18 moths of short-term consultants, will be procured in
accordance with Bank "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and The World
Bank as Executing Agency' (August 1981). In addition, to help strengthen its procurement activities,
APEN engaged consultants to help prepare the bidding documents for the major procurement package.
Training and contracts for key specialists (the project coordinator and experts to assist in tender
evaluation), which could be financed retroactively under the Bank loan (para. 69), will also be awarded
following these Guidelines.
68.   Review. Procurement documents for ICB contracts for hardware and software (estimated to be
in three lots) valued in excess of $500,000 per package will be reviewed by the Bank prior to final award
decisions being made. The Bank would review master lists of equipment, packaging of bids and updated
cost esmates, texts of bid invitations and bidding documents, etc. For technical assistance, the Bank
would review al terms of reference for contracts valued at $100,000 or above, and for contracts with
individuals it would also review letters of invitation and award decisions. It is estimated that these
reviews would cover about 93 percent of the value of all contracts to be financed from the proposed loan.
The remaining contracts for goods packages valued at under $500,000 and technical assistance contracts
with firms valued at under $100,000 would be subject to selectve post-award reviews by the Bank.
C. Disbursemts
69. The proposed project is expected to be disbursed over three and a half years. This schedule is
somewhat shorter than the average disbursement profile for Hungary, but is considered feasible because
bidding documents for the major procurement package are expected to be issued in March 1993.
Furthermore, the deliveries payments will be phased over the implementation period, since equipment
will be installed at each location in stages, in line with APEH'S absorptive capacity. The proceeds of the
proposed Bank loan will finance 100 percent of eligible foreign exchange expenditures for hardware,
software, technical assistance (consultant services and training). At the Government's request, retroactive
financing of up to $2.9 million would be included to cover the cost of equipment, training and key
specialist services (the Project Coordinator and support for tender evaluation) necessary for timely project
start-up. Retroactive financing would be limited to expenditures incurred prior to loan signing, but after
Jamuary 1, 1993. All disbursements for contracts for goods and services exceeding $300,000 equivalent
would be filly documented. For expenditures below that level, disbursements may be made on the basis
of Statements of Expenditure (sOE). The required supporting documentation would not be sent to the
Bank but would be retained by APEH for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report
for the year in which the last disbursement is made. The documentation will be made available to the
Bank upon request. A Special Account in US dollars would be set up by the Government at the National
Bank of Hungary, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. The initial deposit into the
Special Account would be $2 million, which is judged adequate to cover about 4 months' foreign
exchange expenditure under the project
D. Reportdng, Auditing and Supervision
70. Project Accounts and Auditing. Separate project accounts will be maintained by the National
Bank of Hungary. Project accounts, including the Special Account, would be audited in accordance with
the "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Fmanced by the World Bank" (March



29
Anex
Page 19 of 19
1992). During negotiations, agreement was obtained from the Government that within six months of the
end of each fiscal year, it will provide the Bank an audit report of such scope and detail as the Bank may
reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank on
disbursement against certified soEs. The separate opinion should mention whether the soBs submitted
duing the fisa  year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation,
can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications.
71.   Progress Reportng. Forms to be used in reporting project progress have been prepared and
agreed with APEH and are provided in the Project File. As well as summarizing the status of project-
financed procurement, they wil also give details of disbursements from the loan. In addition to these
standard formats, the Project Coordinatr will provide, for AFEH management and the World Bank, a
brief report assessing progress in project implementation. Ibis report would summarize implemenation
status (in regard to both the new computer system and other project-financed assistamce), explain any
important deviations from the proposed schedule, highlight potential problems and recommend solutions,
and flag any anticpated changes in project costs. It was agreed that APEH will provide these reports to
the Bank on a quarterly basis. Within six months of the closing date, APE} will prepare and furnish to
the Bank a completion report of the project.
72.   Supervision.  In the iniial stages, the project will require close monitoring; this effort will be
facilitated by the Project Coordinator who will be on site and will provide regular progress reports. In
addition, the Bank is monitoring closely the technical evaluation for the main procurement package.
Estimated total staffweeks for project supervision are as follows: FY94, 15 staffweeks; FY95, 12
staffWeeks; FY96, 10 staffweeks; and FY97, 4 staffweeks; for a total of 41 staffweeks. Much of the
supervision effort would be provided by an rr speciaist (about 29 staffweeks in total), the balance would
be provided by the task manager (10 staffweeks) and a procurement specialist (2 staffweeks). In addition
to these inputs, about 10 staffweeks of support are anticipated from the IMw, which will coordinate the
implementation of tax admintion reforms being undertaken under the project and provide guidance
to APEH on priorities to be accorded to various elements of the modernization project. The first mission
(three persons, including an IMP representative) is planned to coincide with anticipated loan effectiveness.
The relatively intensive supervision effort proposed for the first 12-18 months of the project corresponds
with the major miestones in project implementation.
