                           RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A. SUMMARY

  1. This Project Paper seeks your approval for the extension to the closing date for
     the Fast Track (FTI) Initiative Catalytic Fund Grant 3 by nine months, from
     September 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. This would be the second extension for this
     Grant bringing the total number of extended months to 24. The paper also seeks
     your approval for the revision of the Grant Agreement to include the rehabilitation
     and provision of furniture to the dormitory of the Republican Institute for In-
     service Teacher Training (RIITT) in the Grant’s scope of activities.

  2. In a letter from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) dated March 2, 2012, the
     Recipient requested an extension of the Project Closing Date from September 30,
     2012 to June 30, 2013. Furthermore, in a follow up letter from the MOF dated
     April 4, 2012, the Recipient also requested the Bank’s approval to include
     rehabilitation and furniture provision of the dormitory of the Republican Institute
     for In-service Teacher Training in the Grant’s scope of activities.

B. PROJECT STATUS

  3. The FTI Catalytic Fund third year allocation for Tajikistan (FTI-3) of USD13.5
     million was approved in November 2009, signed in December 2009 and became
     effective in April 2010. The two previous FTI CF allocations totaling USD18.4
     million were satisfactorily implemented during 2006-2010. The FTI-3 joint donor
     Mid Term Review conducted in December 2011 rated the Grant’s implementation
     as Satisfactory.

  4. Implementation progress on the grant includes: (i) completion of civil works of
     four schools; (ii) completion and evaluation of the directors’ training and
     mentoring program; (iii) supply of reading materials for primary grades (with
     parallel financing from UNICEF) to 1,000 schools (26 percent of all schools in
     the country) benefitting 300,000 students; (iv) development and national
     introduction of eight Education Management Information System (EMIS)
     modules; (v) successful completion of a Ministry of Education (MOE) sponsored
     regional conference on per capita financing in general education; and (vi)
     finalization of a new National Strategy for Education Development (NSED) by
     the MOE.

  5. There are no outstanding project audits for this Grant and the 2011 audit
     identified no serious concerns. All quarterly IFRs are submitted on time and they
     are found to be acceptable to the Bank.

Closing Date

   6. The proposed extension is necessary in order to enable the Recipient to complete
      activities that have already started being implemented, achieve the PDO and avoid
      a funding gap between FTI-3 and the proposed GPE-4, currently under
      preparation. This would be the second extension for the Project, amounting to a
      total of 24 months. Since effectiveness, the Project has disbursed USD 5.74
      million (35.4%) and has commitments for another USD5.4 million. The existing
      disbursement lag was mostly caused by the longer than planned time it took to
      design the civil works (CWs) resulted in the CWs’ belated commencement
      followed by stoppage of the CWs for five months at fifteen out of thirty schools
      due to severe winter conditions. CWs together with the school furniture provision
      comprise 73% of the total Project cost. In March 2012, the work recommenced
      and is envisaged to be completed by November 2012.

   7. Additionally, there are also several important surveys planned under the Project
      that would need more time for completion. Those include: “Operational and
      financial audit of the Textbooks Revolving System,? “Review of the in-service
      training programs,? and “School transportation.? The design of the surveys also
      took more time than expected due to their complexity and lack of adequate
      expertise on the Client’s side. An extension would allow for the completion of
      these surveys.

   Components

   8. In March 2012, the MOE approached the Local Education Donor Group (LEDG)
      with a request to use savings of the FTI-3 proceeds for the rehabilitation and re-
      furbishing of the dormitory of the Republican Institute for In-service Teacher
      Training (RIITT). The existing RIITT building has administrative offices and
      classrooms for conducting training for education sector employees (district
      education specialists, directors, and teachers). All training has been put on hold due
      to the decayed building conditions. As such, the MOE requested that Grant
      financing be used to rehabilitate the RIITT dormitory which would be used as a
      temporary premise for RIITT administration and training classrooms. The estimated
      budget is USD400,000 and this would be financed with savings resulting from the
      successful procurement of civil works and also from gains from exchange rate
      fluctuation. As such there is no need to reallocate funds across disbursement
      category. The LEDG is in agreement with this request.

   9. The proposed addition to the FTI-3 Grant fits in with the PDO “to contribute to an
      increased access to improved learning environments and a more efficient delivery
      of quality education services? at it would improve the learning environment for
      those teachers and school directors receiving training thus contributing to their
      qualification upgrade. The following intermediate indicator would be added to the
      Project’s result framework, “RIITT facility rehabilitated.?
