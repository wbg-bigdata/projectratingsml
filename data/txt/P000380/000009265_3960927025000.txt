MEMORANDUM AND 3ECOMMENDAT1ON OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A LIVESTOCK SECTOR DEVELMPNENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Cameroon for US$34.6 million equivalent is submitted for
approval.  The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 17 years
maturity,-including a 5-year grace period, at the standard variable
interest rate, and would help finance a livestock sector development
project. The project would be cofinanced by the Iiuternational Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) (US$10.8 million equivalent), the European
Development Fund (EDF) (US$1.9 million equivalent) and the Aid and
Cooperation Fund (FAC) of France (US$1.6 million equivalent).
2.        Background.  Agriculture, and in particular livestock, could
make an important contribution to reshaping Cameroon's economy, hard hit by
the fall of the world market prices of its principal commodities.
Agriculture's contribution to the economy dropped from 40? of GNP in the
1960s to-about 202 in 1986 due to oil production. Agriculture still
provides employment to three-fourths of the population, 252 of export
receipts, 152 to 202 of State revenues and, with tie depletion of domestic
oil reserves, is returning to the forefront of the economy. The ecological
diversity of the country offers a wide range of possibilities for crop and
animal production. The livestock sector accounts for 162 of agricultural
production and is an important souwce of income for 302 of the rural
population. It offers immediate growth opportunities, as appropriate
markets, technology, feed resources and husbandry skills exist. Yet, the
majority of the pastoral population still livea below the relative poverty
level. The domestic 4emand for meat is about 50Z higher than domestic
production and still growing. High rates of livestock mortality due to
diseases result in losses of about US$100 million per annum and could be
substantially reduced with a better health service delivery system.
Available range la-ds could carry two or three times the present livestock
population, though in densely populated areas the actual stocking rate is
close to carrying capacity. The main bottlenecks of the sector are of an
institutional, financial, and administrative nature.
3.        The efficiency of the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and
Animal Industries (MINEPIA) is severely hampered by inadequate resource
allocation, with a focus on animal health activities which could mostly be
taken over by private agents. Most of the recurrent expenditures budget
pays for salaries or subsidizes veterinary treatments and drugs. As a
result, field extension activities have been limited and lack a coherent
approach, and are not coordinated with crop extension activities. Communal
land use and the absence of land registration discourage investments in
range land improvement. The import and distribution of veterinary drugs
are entrusted to a parastatal agency, the Veterinary Pharmaceutical Office
(OPV), which has not been managed according to commercial criteria and has
created a financial burden Cb. the Government's budget. Private sector
involvement in the marketing of veterinary drugs is still incipient. The
technical performance of the Bank-funded Livestock Development Company



- 2..
(SODEPA) is satisfactory in ranching and slaughterhouse activities but the
company has been burdened by excessive overhead costs. The project would
assist SODEPA in improving its manaaement but would not provide further
investment in the company. It is expected that SODEPA's extension
functions would be transferred to MINEPlA's field services. Two previous
Bank-financed projects have, with moderate success, financed infrastructure
for the livestock sector, tsetse clearance over a large segment of the
Adamaoua Province, credit, and the construction of slaughterhouses. They
have, however, only slightly touched on policy and institutional aspects.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project would emphasize
privatization and environmental policies. Progress in these areas could
open the way for similar policies in other sectors and for the proposed
structural adjustment program. The proposed project's approach has been
successfully implemented in other Bank projects in Africa. The Bank could,
therefore, contribute useful experience to project implementation. The
project would also be a logical follow-up to the National Agricultural
Research Project and would be in harmony with, and complement, the proposed
Agricultural Extension project, ensuring closer extension cooperation
between the Ministry of Agriculture and-MINEPIA. Financing of these
various projects by the same institution would enhance the coordination and
impact of the total package.
5.        Prolect Obiectives.  The project would aim to increase meat and
milk production, raise producer incomes, in particular of poor livestock
herders, and reduce the Government's financial burden resulting from its
services to the livestock sector. The project would reach these objectives
bys (a) improving the efficiency of the traditional and emerging modern
livestock production sector; (b) promoting the role of the private sector
in the provision of services to producers; (c) making parastatal
enterprises profitable and competitive; and (d) strengthening the planning
and extension capabilities of MINEPIA's livestock services. The project
would test various procedures, allowing the recognition and consolidation
of the rights of herder groups to particular grazing areas, water resources
and, in the North, transhumance routes.
6.        Proiect Description.  The project would combine policy reforms
based on the Government's shift of focus toward traditional herders and
emerging semi-intensive production units, institution building based on the
realignment of responsibilities within the sector resulting from the policy
reforms, and further investments and credit lines. The main policy reforms
would cover: (a) the privatization of veterinary services by providing
incentives to Govenment agents to transfer to the private animal health
care sector; (b) full cost recovery for all clinical services, vaccinations
and drugs provided by MINEPIA; (c) the reorganization of OPV; (d) the
transformation of SODEPA's commercial activities into autonomous, self-
financing operations; (e) the harmonization of the extension methods and
activities of MINEPIA and the Ministry of Agriculture; (f) the limiting of
staff recruitment in MINEPIA to the number required to compensate for
normal attrition, other than the agents transferred to the private sector,
and reorientation of its training centers to the training of existing istaff
and private sector agents; and (g) the monitoring of the impact of meat



-3-
Import taxation on consumption and production.  Proiect investments would
comprise (a) an institution building component to create and strengthen
producer associations, promote grass-root participation by women and poor
herders in development activities (item financed by, and added-at the
specific request of, IFAD), improve livestock extension services in the
main production areas, and strengthen the planning and administration
capability of MINEPIA; (b) a resource management component to test land
tenure and sustainable land use systems in pilot land management areas
(PLMHs), which would be provided with minimum infrastructure, to expand
range land research and monitoring, and develop a sustainable protection
system for areas cleared of the tsetse fly; (c) an animal health component
to finance the reorganization of OPV, the eventual clearance of an
additional 12,000 km2 of tsetse infested' areas, and the introduction of a
special health program for small stock; and (d) a credit component for
onlending for the establishment of private drug import and veterinary
clinics, livestock and land development and women's activities in the
PLMAs, semi-intensive poultry production, and feed and livestock processing
industries.
7.        Actions Agreed Upon.  Th. Government has forwarded to the Bank a
Letter on Livestock Development Policy, indicating its intention to
implement the measures on which agreement was confirmed during
negotiations, i.e., that it would (a) facilitate the transfer of MINEPIA
staff to private practice by providing them, free of charge, an initial
stock of drugs and protecting them from competition by Government agents;
(b) charge producers full cost for veterinary services, treatments and
drugs provided by the Livestock Service and a contribution in cash and kind
from herders in areas kept clear cf the tsetse fly, using the revenues thus
generated mostly to finance MINEPIA's non-salary operating costs; (c)
reorganize SODEPA as of December 31, 1989 and OPV by December 31, 1990; (d)
carry out a study of the budgetary and administrative procedures applied by-
HINEPIA and implement its recommendations as of July 1, 1990; (e) ensure
that, starting in 1989190, enrollment of new students in the livestock
training institutes would not be automatically linked to recruitment for
public service, which would be limited to compensation for attrition; and
(f) recruit an extension specialist, a small stock specialist, and an
administrative controller before June 1, 1989. Conditions of loan
effectiveness would be (a) communication to the Bank of the choice of the
area where privatization of animal health care would begin,  (b) the
promulgation of new tariffs for veterinary services; (c) the establishment
of a committee in MINEPIA to supervise the privatization of veterinary
services; and (d) cross effectiveness with IFAD's loan and FAC's grant.
Conditions of disbursement for the credit component would be the signing of
an agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, between the Government and
financial intermediaries for the management of the subloans, and, for the
insecticide component, the Bank's agreement on the type of insecticide to
be used.
8.        Benefits.  Quantifiable project benefits, in the form of
increased meat and milk production, would result from an improved
availability of veterinary drugs nationwide, health and extension services
in the three major livestock producing provinces, and the conservation and



-4-
further extension of areas cleared of the tsetse fly in the Adauooua
Province. Further non-quantifiable economic, social and environmental
benefits would result from the policy measures, institution building
efforts, and pilot land improvement activities. Financial benefits would
accrue to OPV and private veterinary practices, and by extensionu to the
Government's budget.  The project would have a special input on women,
poorer herlers, and the environment. The internal rate of return of the
project components leading to quantifiable benefits is between 26Z and 34Z,
depending on the herders' response to the proposed measures.
9.        Risks.  The project's success would depend on (a) the degree of
private sector interest which would materialize for the provision of
veterinary services; (b) the availability of an efficient financial network
to channel credit to the service and production sectors; (c) the motivation
of MINEPIA's field extension staff; (d) the availability of adequate
budgetary resources for MINEPIA; (e) the avoidance of detrimental effects
of population pressure on pastoral activities; (f) the absence of serious
droughts during the first few project years; and (g) the containment of
environmntat damage which might result from more intensive livestock
activities. Measures to create private sector interest have been built
into the project and could be increased if necessary. Improved financial
channels, needed after the first year of the project, are expected to
become available through the planned establishment of a new agricultural
credit bank. The onlending function could otherwise be entrusted to
adequate rural development entities or non governmental organizations.
Field staff are expected to be motivated through improved training and the
introduction of mixed crop and livestock farming to contain the effects of
increasing population pressure on pastoral activities. Finally, the risk
of highly damaging droughts is acceptably low at the latitudes where most
of the project would be Implemented. An Improved offtake rite and measures
to strengthen the herders' rights to rangelands and their: 1.terest in
protecting them are the two factors which should best contain the
environmental risks of the project. The introduction of non-polluting
tsetse control methods would also reduce the impact of residual
insecticides oan the local fauna.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the IBRD and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
