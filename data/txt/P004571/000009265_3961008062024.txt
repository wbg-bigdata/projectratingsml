MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT O' THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMIENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON TWO PROPOSED LOANS
TO THE NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR A
TRANSMISSION GRID REINFORCEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommeiidation on two
proposed loans to the National Power Corporation (NPC) of the Philippines for JS$250 million
equivalent to help finance a Transmission Grid Reinforcement Project. The loans would be
guaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines. The first loan, for US$100 million equivalent,
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including five
years of grace; the second, for US$150 million, would be a floating rate single zurrency (US$)
loan, also with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace.
Background
2.    Since 1992 there has been a qualitative improvement in the structure o- the Philippine
power sector. This change, which was initiated in 1989 by the issue of Presidontial Executive
Order 215 ending NPC's monopoly on generation, has accelerated since 1992 with an enthusiastic
response from the private sector to the Government's call for help to relieve chronic power
shortages. Independent Power Producers (IPPs) are now expected to play a precominant role in
future development of generation, complimenting the role of the investor and c nsumer owned
utilities that distribute electricity throughout the country. NPC's current generation facilities
include 2,000 MW  of hydro and 2,300 MW  of thermal plants; in addition, NPC owns the
nationwide extra high voltage transmission (EHV) grid and the high voltage ,ubtransmission
networks. Under existing long-term contracts with some 35 IPPs, NPC will also be the purchaser
of more than 80% of their 3,000 MW of production. These arrangements enx isage that NPC
would provide an adequate transmission system to evacuate the electricity produced, much of
which is on a 'take or pay" basis, and subject to substantial penalties if it fails to construct the
required transmission facilities. The proposed operation supports the construction of an important
transmission development that is needed to connect the grid to two major IPPs to be commissioned
in 1998 and will help bring about the economic dispatch of energy generated throughout the power
system.
3.    Under its 1992 Energy Sector Plan (ESP), the Government is committed to privatization of
NPC's various operations, including its transmission activities. To assist the Government in
formulating a strategy for the power sector, the Bank prepared a study entitled 'Structural
Framework for the Power Sector" (Report No. 13313-PH, November 30, 1994). W'hile supporting
the Government's objectives, the report recognizes that complete privatization Is likely to take
several years, given regulatory, commercial, and financial constraints and the extent of effort
needed to prepare different parts of the company for the financial and operational changes that
privatization will imply. The proposed project would continue the efforts under previous projects
to support well targeted preparations for NPC's privatization.
4.    A principal recommendation of the aforementioned Bank study, aimed at improving the
environment for private participation in the power sector and enhancing competition, is that the
IPPs need to be furnished with unbiased access to an efficient transmission system. In general, this
implies that the EHV grid and subtransmission networks must be strengthened and extended as
needed to serve the system's growing load; moreover management of the EHV grid should be kept



-2-
separate from the interests of any particular supplier or distributor. The study also recommends
the formation of a separate government-owned company to absorb and, thereaft(r. operate and
maintain the transmission operation. The key steps towards accomplishing this objeclive would be:
(a) for NPC to organize its transmission activity into an autonomous profit center. (b) to develop
wheeling charges to reflect the cost of providing the needed equipment, operation aiid maintenance
of the networks, interest and taxes, and yield a surplus sufficient to enable self financing of a
reasonable proportion of new investments, and (c) to develop a modem transpa ently operated
generation dispatch function to support the transmission operation. The proposec project would
support these activities including strengthening the role of the National Load Dispatch Center
(NLDC) operation.
5.     The framework established by the Government for the eventual structun of the power
sector is reflected in the draft Omnibus Electric Power Industry Code that tI c Government
proposes to submit to Congress for consideration. The Bank has reviewed and corunented on the
draft legislation and is satisfied that the draft code would provide a sound basis for rationalizing
the responsibilities of the respective power sector agencies. Specifically the main pi ovisions are as
follows:
*   The Department of Energy (DOE) would serve mainly as the policyi maker for the
sector. It would formulate strategic vision and define the framework vN ithin which the
Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) would adjudicate.
*   ERB would remain a quasi-judicial agency for regulating mainly thb tariffs of all
companies that quaiify as electric utilities. However, the approacl to regulation
would reJy most heavily on market forces and thereby limit the inter 'entions of the
regulator. ERB's span of jurisdiction would be altered to include the pow er to award
franchises, thereby briniging franchising and certification activities uncler the same
organization
*   NPC through its subsidiaries, would limit its role to being an owner al d, for the time
being, operator of its generating facilities. It would retain lead responsibility for
developing hydropower projects and would be one of many supplirs of therrnal
electricity, all competing on an equal commercial footing. In the n ~ar term, until
DOE develops the needed capabilities, NPC would continue to undertake power
sector planning under contract to DOE. Also, in the near term, urtil distribution
subsector reform has taken root, NPC would continue as the wholesale- of electricity,
including the management and operation of the subtransmission networi Ws.
*   A new national transmission company (TRANSCO) would be establis ied to serve as
owner, developer, and operator of EI-V networks, providing all supp iers with non-
discriminatory access to the EHV7 grid for a fee. To ensure adequ tte and timely
service, TRANSCO would submit its investment program  annuall- to ERB for
approval. To ensure that its charges are fair, its cost-based rates woul I be subject to
regulation. Within TRANSCO, a national dispatch entity would be cr ,ated, with the
rules for dispatch initially to be made by a technical committee consisting of
representatives of parties to existing power sales contracts with advice 'rom DOE and
ERB.

Project Objectives
6.    The objectives of the project are to: (a) evacuate power from two major generation plants
at Sual and Masinloc, both expected to be operational in 1998; (b) reinforce overloaded substations
and extend the EHV grid in northwest Luzon and in western Visayas; (c) strengthen the
transmission system and the load dispatch operations so that these can be integrated into an
autonomous transmission subsidiary, and (d) support the restructuring of NPC under the
Government's power sector reform program. Key performance indicators would b - monitored and
would include meeting agreed dates for project implementation, targets for reserve reductions, and
financial indicators.
Project Description
7.    The project has four main components: (a) the northwest Luzon transmission component
comprising: (i) the development of a double circuit transmission line interconnection at 230 kV
from Masinloc to a new substation at Labrador, and thence at 500 kV extending about 225 km to
500/ 230 kV substations at San Manuel and San Jose, (ii) associated 230 kV interc nnections from
Labrador to the Sual power station, (iii) reinforcement of eight 230/69 kV substzLtlons supplying
the central Luzon subtransmission networks, and (iv) supply of conductors for the rehabilitation of
the southern Luzon Naga-Tayabas 500 kV line; (b) the NLDC component comprising the
installation of a new national load dispatch center, communications, metering and protection
equipment in Luzon and Visayas; (c) the Visayas subtransmission component o reinforce the
138/69 kV systems in Negros, Panay and Cebu, and (d) the provision of expert services
comprising: (i) engineering services for the design and implementation of the NLDC facilities, (ii)
project management services for transmission and substations, (iii) management consulting services
to support NPC's privatization program, (iv) the provision of office equipment, MIS facilities, and
(v) architectural and design services associated with the new TRANSCO headquarters.
Additionally, the Bank assisted ERB in securing a PHRD grant to assist in establishing a basis for
wheeling charges.
8.    The total project cost is US$750 million. Total financing of about UJS$750 million
(including Interest During Construction (IDC)) would be provided by: (a) two Bark loans totaling
US$250 million equivalent (50% of the foreign exchange cost and 36% of the total project cost,
excluding IDC); (b) loans by ADB and the Japan EXIM Bank (US$246 million ,quivalent), and
(c) a loan by KfW (US$29 million equivalent). The balance of about US$221 nillion, including
the provision of US$56 million for IDC, would be financed by NPC from local borrowing and
internal cash generation. NPC would bear the foreign exchange risks for the loam from the Bank
which would be guaranteed by the Government. US$20 million in retroactive financing from
February 1, 1996 for advance payments in the turnkey transmission line and conductor supply
contracts is being recommended. Breakdowns of the project costs and financing plan are given in
Schedule A. Procurement amounts and methods and the disbursement profik are shown in
Schedule B. The time table of the key processing events and status of Bank groiup operations in
the Philippines are presented in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 6658-PH dated February 20, 1996, is being distributed separ itely.
Project Implementation
9.    NPC would be responsible for implementing all project components in ac ,ordance with a
Project Implementation Plan satisfactory to the Bank. A Project Director (PD). reporting to



-4-
TRANSCO management, would serve as NPC's representative for implementing the project. In
addition, the PD would be responsible for overseeing the development of the Masinloc power
station, and for coordination with the developers of the Sual power station. The PD was appointed
at an early stage of project preparation and has been closely involved in all decisions relating to
project formulation.  The PD is supported by a small team with office facldities at NPC's
headquarters and has been provided with adequate budget to support his operatiom.
10.   NPC's Engineering Department, under an agreement with the PD, would be assigned
project engineering responsibility for the transmission components both in Luzon and Visayas. It
will be assisted by consultants. Implementation of the NLDC subproject has been assigned to a
project team based in the existing load dispatch operations unit. This team is led by a Project
Manager also certified by the US PMI, who will coordinate closely with the PD iin reporting to the
Bank. Management of the TA component would be coordinated by NPC's Manager of Corporate
Services, working closely with NPC's Privatization and Restructuring Executive Office.
Project Sustainability
11.   To help ensure sustainability the project includes the following activities: (a) the
development of an independent transmission operation providing IPPs with unbiased access to the
power market, thereby increasing competition among suppliers; (b) the creation of the NLDC to
manage generation dispatch operations and facilitate the application of wheeling charges;
complemented by support to the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) to appraise th. framework and
the particulars of proposed transmission charges, and (c) the strengthening of the subtransmission
networks to help provide the distributors with better service and thereby improve their chances of
taking over regional high voltage networks as a key step towards reform of the distribution sector.
Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement
12.   The Bank had limited involvement with NPC over 1978-88. Since thea, the Bank has
made five loans to NPC, with the most recent Loans 3700-PH and 3746-PH, to f nance the Leyte
Geothermal project, receiving Board approval in February and June 1994 respectix ely. Two of the
earlier loans (the Bacon-Manito Geothermal Project (Loan 2969-PH) and the Eneigy Sector (Loan
3163-PH)) closed in December 1995, and implementation completion reports are under
preparation. During 1995 US$55 million was canceled from the Power TTansmission and
Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3626-PH) to reduce the scope of work in response tk changes in IPP
development projects. Each of these three loans has encountered implementation delays, largely
due to NPC's preoccupation with its chronic generation shortfall. NPC and the Bank have
identified other important reasons for these delays, and addressed them in thc: ongoing Leyte
Geothermal Project. Specific corrective measures include: (a) appointment of PDs under a Project
Management Office to manage the responsible design groups in the Engineering Department, as
well as outside consultants; (b) strengthening NPC's procedures to deal with cnvironment and
resettlement issues; (c) training in the implementation of Bank procurement procedures, and (d)
standardizing bid documents to ensure a uniform approach in the evaluation and award of
contracts. The proposed project would strengthen NPC's capabilities in project preparation and
execution, making better use of modem technology and available project managemcrnt software.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
13.   The policies and programs pursued by the Government are in accordance with the Bank's
policies and guidelines for power sector reform and the reform program is progressing



-5-
satisfactorily. The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to
the Board with these loans. It would support the Government's efforts to move from the current
economic recovery into a period of sustained growth. As discussed in the CAS, the Bank's support
to the Philippines addresses the long term development issues designed to enhance competition and
upgrade infrastructure. The relevant priority areas for Bank assistance include strengthening
infrastructure to ensure that the full benefits of new generation capacity reach the public. This will
require measures to focus on improving private business environment and strengthening
policy/project implementation-all of which are embodied in the proposed project.
14.    Although the amount of Bank financing has been modest relative to NPC's overall needs of
recent years, the Bank's broad involvement in the Philippines' power sector has enabled it to
provide considerable strategic guidance to the sector in general and to NPC in parti ular. The 1992
Energy Sector Plan (ESP), formulated by the Government in consultation with the Bank, outlines a
series of actions toward reforming the energy sector, while the Bank's Power Sector Study
provides a strategic framework for restructuring and privatizing the power sector.  The
Government has moved a long way towards laying the foundations for reform and has succeeded in
adding a large number of IPPs onto the grid. It has now begun to concentrate on the privatization
of NPC and the separation of transmission from generation activities. Thesc latter actions,
embodied in the Government's Philippines Energy Plan 1994-2010 represent the most difficult
aspects of the ESP.
15.    The Bank's continued financial involvement as well as its technical assistance would help
the Government implement critical aspects of the program and the last remaining stages of power
sector restructuring. Indeed, bearing in mind the significant penalty charges which NPC is liable to
pay to the owners of the Sual IPP, successful implementation of the project is of vital importance
to NPC. The Bank's presence in the power sector would also help ensure satisfactory and timely
completion of the reform process that the Government has embarked upon. The proposed project
specifically supports reorganization of NPC's transmission activities including (a) setting a time
table for the establishment of an autonomous transmission company leading to its eventual
privatization, and (b) the provision of a framework of procedures (i.e. a Grid Code) for
implementing optimal load dispatch.
Agreed Actions
16.   During negotiations agreements were reached with the Government that it would (a)
conduct an annual review of progress in carrying out its program for restructuring and privatizing
the power sector, exchange views with the Bank with respect to its future implementation, and take
all measures necessary for such implementation; (b) present to Congress for consideration not later
than July 30, 1996, a proposed Omnibus Power Industry Code, which proposed legislation it shall
certify as an administration bill; (c) exchange views with the Bank and the Borrower on the actions
needed to carry out the agreed power development plan no later than October A each year; (d)
investigate by June 30, 1996, (i) the underlying inefficiencies in economic load dispatch and draw
up a timebound plan for eliminating said inefficiencies, the plans would include specific steps for
promoting competition in power, and (ii) thereafter carry out said plan, and (e) take all measures
necessary to enable NPC to adjust the structure or level of its tariffs to permit NPC to meet its
agreed financial targets.
17.    On its part NPC agreed to (a) submit an application to ERB by October 31, 1996, for a
new rate structure designed to (i) phase out subsidies between grids, (ii) introduce long run



-6-
marginal cost principles in the Luzon grid, and (iii) introduce appropriate charges or the wheeling
and ancillary services in the Luzon grid; (b) prepare a timebound action plan to establish
transmission activities as a separate corporate entity and establish a holding company by March
31, 1997, with attributes, functions, and resources acceptable to the Bank; (c) no later than
October 1 of each year, prepare a Power Development Plan for the follovA ing five years,
exchanging views with the Guarantor and the Bank, and thereafter take all necessary steps to
implement the plan; (d) maintain its tariffs at levels that enable its net revenues to y ield (i) a rate of
return on net revalued assets in operation of 7% in its fiscal year 1996 and 8% thcreafter; and (ii)
maintain net revenues sufficient to cover the company's debt service requirements for each fiscal
year; (e) not incur additional debt unless its debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.  through 1999,
and 1.3 thereafter; (f) prepare and review with the Bank, by December 31 of each year, its
projections in respect of its capital expenditures and the demand for power supplied by it for the
following five years (g) fumish to the Bank, by June 30 of each year, audited financial statements
for the previous year, together with the certification and long form report prepared by an
acceptable auditor, and (h) submit to the Bank at the end of each quarter comprehensive reports on
the implementation of the project and provide detailed external monitoring and evaluation reports
to the Bank at quarterly intervals during the implementation of satisfactory Resettlement Action
Plans (RAPs). Conditions of effectiveness will be (a) fulfillment of all conditions precedent to the
effectiveness of financing agreements with ADB, JEXIM and KfW, and (b) finalization of a
detailed resettlement action plan acceptable to the Bank and approval of the RAPs by all necessary
corporate and government bodies.
Environmental and Social Aspects
18.    The project has an environmental category B classification.  NPC has completed a
satisfactory Environmental Assessment for the transmission lines.  They do not pose any
significant environmental problems as they are routed mainly near existing roadway; or adjacent to
existing 230 kV lines, and affect no forest or sensitive areas. Land acquisition for the project will
involve relocation of about 766 households, and payment of compensation for affected assets and
easement fees for the rights-of-way. The costs for relocation and compensation for the project are
estimated about US$30 million (3% of project costs). There are four components of the project
that will involve land acquisition and/or right-of-way compensation. These are: (a the northwest
Luzon transmission line (affecting 600 households); (b) the Sual-Labrador transmission line
(affecting 24 households); (c) the KfW financed Masinloc-Labrador transmission line, (affecting
89 households), and (d) the Visayas subtransmission which includes the Panay IV Did Negros IV
transmission lines (affecting 53 households).
19.    The Bank has been working with NPC to revise its policy framework for 1l md acquisition
and resettlement, for transmission projects in particular. A new policy framewors (RAP I) has
been agreed for transmission projects which will be piloted under this project. NPC' compensation
policy for transmission projects has, until recently, been limited to offering cash comnpensation for
affected assets, which has often tended to be below replacement and/or market value. The new
policy framework for transmission projects includes: (a) alternatives to cash compensation, such as
replacement land and/or livelihood development schemes for equitable res.-ttlement and
rehabilitation of affected people; (b) compensation at replacement value for houses structures; (c)
compensation for crops and trees at fair market and economic values, respectively, and (d)
coverage for those with weak tenure status. Resettlement Action Plans for th, four project
components (RAP II) are being prepared by NPC. The acceptability and clearance of RAP II by
the Bank is a condition for loan effectiveness.



-7-
Benefits and Risks
20.    The main benefits of the project are to (a) increase transfer capacity and improve the
reliability of the EHV transmission of bulk power to the major load centers in central Luzon; (b)
reduce generation reserve requirements in the Luzon-Visayas grid, and (c) reduce losses and
improve the quality of supply to consumers in the western Visayas region. Timely implementation
would avoid crippling financial penalties under 'take-or-pay" contracts with BOT developers. The
500 kV extension will also facilitate development of hydro resources in the north 'the most likely
prospects being San Rogue (300 MW) and Casecnan (200-600 MW)). The development of a load
dispatch system would protect the consumer through cost effective selection of generation
alternatives. The NLDC component would ensure that supplies are brought into the system
according to merit and that the basis for future contracting takes into account responsibilities by
individual generators for achieving coordinated power system operations. The overall ERR for the
project is estimated at 20%.
21.    The technologies for all project components are conventional and well proven. The basic
planning of the transmission system and related components has been comprehensivclv reviewed as
part of project preparation; therefore, implementation should proceed fairly smoothly. Project risks
are primarily associated with NPC's financial and implementation weaknesses. If NPC is unable to
meet its financial targets or to achieve its implementation targets, the project could face cost
overruns and delays. A delay beyond six months could affect the commissioning of the Sual plant
in early 1999, and -subject NPC to heavy penalties associated with 'take-or-pay" contractual
provisions. In this respect the Bank is requiring considerable improvement in NPC's project
management and reporting capability prior to loan approval, and will be monitoring this aspect of
the project closely. This should ensure that potential problems are identified and addressed early in
implementation. In addition, the proposed covenants requiring the Republic of the Philippines to
support NPC's financial needs, if necessary, should ensure a timely completion of the project
investment program. Another risk factor that may affect the performance of the project is the
possibility that power demand will grow at a lower rate. In this case, the estimated ERR would
still be 16%.
22.    While NPC's financial situation has improved over the past five years it is still not fully
satisfactory. For the next five years the company is expecting to face cash flow constraints as a
result of excessive reliance on foreign currency denominated debt. The severity of these constraints
depends on the company's ability to (a) maintain its tariffs at or near statutory ceilings, and (b)
raise equity capital from private interests in support of NPC's restructuring program To the extent
that the Government and NPC are acutely aware of this issue and given the Government's
agreement to ensure that NPC has adequate funding for its investment program, the Bank believes
the risks are manageable.
