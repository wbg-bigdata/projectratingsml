Transmission Grid Reinforcement Project (TGRP)
Project Description and Implementation Arrangements
1.     The TGRP is designed to provide NPC by 1998 with the means of operating a major EHV transmission
grid facility serving over 80% of the electricity demand in the Philippines, by interconnecting over 5000 MW of
power station capacity in Luzon and Visayas. When the project is completed, EHV overhead transmission lines
will extend over 2000 km from the 1000 MW Sual power station in Northern Luzon through submarine cables to
the island of Panay in Western Visayas. Facilities will also be provided to manage grid operations from a National
Load Dispatch Center (NLDC) located in the new headquarters of the proposed NPC Transmission Company
(TRANSCO). The project comprises four components as follows: (i) the northwest Luzon 500 kV transmission
extension and associated system reinforcement component; (ii) the TRANSCO HQ, National Load Dispatch Center
(NLDC), communications and protection Facilities component; (iii) the Visayas subtransmission component; and
Techical Assistance to support (iv) implementation of the above, NPC privatization and MIS facilities. The
following provides a summary of the technical details and the scope of the project including implementation
arrangements as described in NPC's Project Implementation Plan of September 15, 1995.
North West Luzon 500 kV Transmission Extension and Associated EHV System Reinforcement Component
2.     The Bank financed 500 kV transmission line component is designed to complement new investment in
northwest Luzon of about US$ 2 billion for generation and transmission projects financed by ADB, KfW, Japan
Eximbank and the private sector. The line will be required to evacuate electricity from the first 300 MW unit at
Masinloc by end 1997; followed by a second 300 MW unit at Masinloc and a 1000 MW unit at Sual, both planned
for commissioning in mid 1998. Parallel financing has been arranged with ADB for the 230/500 kV substations,
and KfW for the 230 kV lines interconnecting Masinloc. During the period of construction of the 500kV northwest
transmission system NPC will also be reinforcing a number of 230 kV substations supplying the greater Manila
region subtransmission netwvorks to cater for the increase in demand. Expansion requirements for eight of these
substations will be financed under the project. In addition Bank funding will provide for additional resources to
support 500 kV development under the ongoing Leyte Luzon project (Loan 3646-PH) through supplemental
financing to cover the increased cost of the 500 kV Naga Tayabas line. The project, a schematic of which (showing
interfaces with components funded by ADB and kfW) is shown overpage. It is designed to be commissioned in time
for commissioning of plants about six moths ahead of the scheduled dates to evacuate power from the 600 MW
Masinloc and 1000 MW Sual Power plants details of which are summarized below:

3.     This US$ 577 million component will be implemented under various turnkey packages to ensure that the
responsibility managing each component of the project is clearly defined. Taking into account the specialized
nature of the work, the financing arrangements and the need for competitive bidding, the turnkey packages have
been grouped as follows:
(a)    Furnishing and installing about 225 km of 500 kV double circuit overhead lines from San Jose to
Labrador, and 10 km 230 kV double circuit lines from Labrador to Sual (Bid under three lots and
financed largely by the Bank loan);
(b)    Furnishing and installing 5400 MVA 500/230 kV transformer capacity in three substations
(including 540 MVAR reactors, and 55 switchbays) at San Jose, San Manuel, and Labrador,
(financed by ADB and Japan Exim Bank - which organizations are also the prime financiers of the
600 MW Masinloc plant);
(c)    Furnishing and installing 112 km 230 kV lines and 500 MVA of associated 230 kV substations
from Masinloc to Labrador (financed by kfW);
(d)    Consulting Services for Project Management for each component (financed by Bank loan, ADB
and KfW respectively);
4.     The scope of the US$ 165 million northwest transmission Bank component is covered under 3 turnkey
construction contracts and 3 engineering supervision assignments as listed below. Twenty companies were pre-
qualified during 1995 using the Bank's (May 1995 draft) model pre-qualification documents. Bid documents were
prepared by NPC with the assistance of Consultants (EBASCO) based on design criteria established under TMP
study. General conditions of contract are based on the Bank's model document issued as final draft in March 1995.
Provision is made for contract price variations due to: (i) delays in contract award (in accordance with Bank
Guidelines - para 2.56); (ii) Aluminum price increases; and (iii) bonus for early construction and penalties for
delays. One or more contracts will be placed with the lowest price complying bidder, at an estimated contract cost
including contingencies, as indicated below. Six consultants were shortlisted for supervision of the lines in
accordance with TOR approved by the Bank. The consultants are expected to be in place in time to assist in
preparing the project for construction by the successful T/L contractors.

Proiect Implementation
11.   The project will be implemented by the NPC PMO, which appointed a Project Director in 1994 responsible
for both project preparation and the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). At the time of Appraisal the status of
project preparation is as follows:
(a)    Consultants are being recruited to assist NPC with overall supervision, project management and provide
additional technical advice as necessary for checking designs and commissioning. The transmission line survey work
was completed and cleared by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, which issued an
Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC). All the land required has been obtained. Twenty contractors were
pre-qualified for the 500 kV transmission line to be bid in three approximately 80 km sections to facilitate greater
competition. Contracts will be for supply and erection (turnkey) basis to set a single responsibility for the completion
of each major component and thereby achieve faster and improved construction. Bids are expected to be evaluated
for the transmission lines, with contracts to be awarded by end of 1995.
(b)    The design for the nine 220/138 kV substations required to be reinforced under the project have been
completed by NPC Engineering and bid documents with bidding expected to take place in December 1996. The
conductors to be supplied for the Naga Tayabas 500 kV line will be provided to the successful contractor of the line
financed under the Leyte Luzon project, who is expected to be in place by the end of 1995. There are no resettlement
issues for the reinforcement measures which will be done in existing substation land owned by NPC. Likewise, since
the Naga Tayabas line is an existing facility, resettlement issues are not expected to be an issue but in any event will
be subject to the Bank policies under the Leyte Luzon project.
(c)    Planning for installation of the load dispatch, communications and protection facilities must necessarily
await completion of a design study which is expected to be completed in mid-1996. Consultants are being recruited
in accordance with TOR agreed with the Bank. They will be contracted to complete the investigation, design work
and bid documents while also verifying the scope and contract packaging of the communications, protection,
computer equipment and software for implementation. The consultants will also be retained to supervise the
construction of the NLDC facilities expected to commence about mid 1996. In addition, they will provide layout
information to NPC's architects who will design the building for the proposed new TRANSCO headquarters in which
the NLDC facilities will be housed.
(d)    The scope of the 138 kV line extensions and associated substation reinforcement have been identified with
arrangements for establishing rights-of-way (ROW) in progress. Implementation of detailed design and construction
will be handled by a specially trained Contract Administration (CA) groups to be established within the NPC regional
structure. Consultants have been employed under the Leyte Cebu project (Loan 3700-PH) and will establish the
standardized designs for contracting which are expected to be available in time for NPC to call bids for the
installation.
(e)    The program for Privatization and Restructuring of NPC, including establishment of the TRANSCO, has
been prepared to determine the needs and timing for further TA support beyond that provided by the ADB (Annex
17). A preliminary report by NPC consultants (Ontario Hydro / SNC lavalin was completed by appraisal which set
out the basis for further support for MIS development. Likewise the report by PTI was completed August 2 and will
form the basis for further technical support to enhance load dispatch operations.
NPC Proiect Organization
12.    . A project organization (Chart 5) has been defined to administer and manage the turnkey projects, with
staff from NPC's engineering department based on covenanted agreements in accordance with the procedures set
out in Annex 6. Overall direction and monitoring of the implementation will be coordinated by the PD's office using
NPC's existing Atemis software to consolidate information by contractors and NPC supervision staff. A summary

of the implementation plans for each of the subprojects is shown on the attached schedule. Quarterly reports will be
prepared for issue to the various agencies (e.g. IBRD, ADB, JEXIM, kfW, NPC Management, DOE, NEDA)
concemed within one month of the end of each quarter.
(a)    The northwest transmission system must be completed before July 1, 1998, to ensure commissioning
arrangements are ready for Masinloc and Sual plants to be tested. For the northwest Luzon subproject NPC have
established Project Management office with a total of 76 staff, under a Project Manager in Manila. He will head
three general divisions: Technical and Administrative Services (6 staff), A ROW unit (30 staff), Project Control and
Administration (8 staff), 230 kV Design and Construction (9 staff) together with consultants financed by kfW, 500
kV line construction (9 staff) together with consultants financed by the Bank, and Substations (12 staff) together with
consultants financed by ADB.
(b)    The NLDC project will be managed by a unit within the Systems Operations Division (SOD) with
support by consultants. SOD assignments will be as follows: Project Management including Administration and
Finance (10 staff), National Control Center Unit (10 staff), Telecommunications unit (14 staff), and Protection Unit
(14 staff).
(c)    Details of the management of the Visayas project are to be finalized pending completion of a study
of the formation of a Contract Administration Group (CAG) which will provide the basis for plans to concentrate
regional construction under a special local units. Final plans will be reviewed by the Bank during future supervision
visits.
(d)    Management of the TA component will be coordinated by the Network and Technology Services
Department within the Corporate Service group. This has established three units to undertake the recruitment of
consultants and coordination of their work with other affected NPC operational units. The TA assignments will be
managed respective under (i) a Technology Services Division (8 staff), (ii) Network Management Division(10
staff) and (iii) and Enterprises Systems Division (8 staff).

MANAGEMENT AND SERVICES GROUP (CMSG), headed by the VP-CMSG.
2.     Upon direction from the Corporate Planning Group who identifies the projects and its
components as included in the PDP, the VP-PMO shall designate and give full
responsibility for overall project coordination and completion (including commissioning) to
the PROJECT DIRECTOR.
3.     The PROJECT DIRECTOR establishes through a Terms of Reference, the scope of
goods/services to be delivered, preliminary costing, time-frame and standards to be
undertaken by the appropriate ENGINEERING SERVICE CONTRACTOR, and issues
an Invitation Proposal (IP), duly noted by the VP-PMO.
4.     The concerned ENGINEERING SERVICE CONTRACTOR manifests his interest in the
activity undertaking through a Letter Proposal (LP), duly noted by the VP-Eng'g or VP-
CMSG, containing the appropriate project scope, job costing, scheduling, and other
pertinent items.
5.     The PROJECT DIRECTOR and the ENGINEERING  SERVICE CONTRACTOR'S
reach a mutual agreement formalized through a PERFORMANCE COVENANT.
6.     The COVENANT defines the scope of contracted services, resource allocation and
disbursement, standards, monitoring agreements and project milestones, agreed and signed
by the VP-PMO and the concemed ENGINEERING SERVICE CONTRACTOR (VP-
Eng'g or VP-CMSG).

shall have full authority to organize the team, led by the designated Group Manger/Project
Manager/Committee Head to carry out the services contained in the approved
COVENANT, taking into consideration the time frame and the cost to implement such
services.
8.    Changes in the COVENANT shall be negotiated by the parties involved and settled
promptly to prevent delays in the project execution.
9.    For future projects, the ENGINEERING SERVICE CONTRACTORS may render their
expertise to the PMO and other groups as well, namely, the CORPORATE PLANNING
GROUP, the REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS and the forthcoming NPC
TRANSMISSION COMPANY (TRANSCO).

TRANSMISSION GRID REINFORCEMENT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1. The main technical contributions of the proposed project are to increase the transfer capacity of the EHV
transmission of bulk energy to the major load center of Metro Manila and improve the reliability of the
transmission system as a whole. These technical improvements would provide economic benefits associated
with: (i) the evacuation of lower cost energy from the Sual and Masinloc plants and an initial hydropower
development in Northem Luzon; and (ii) important savings in reserve capacity requirements which would be
reduced by about 10% as system reliability improves. The first benefit is directly associated to the proposed
project. The second benefit is attributed to the overall transmission interconnection program which includes, in
addition to the 500/230 kV transmission system of the proposed project, the first and second stages of EHV
interconnection investments in Leyte and Visayas. As it is not possible to separate reserve capacity benefits for
different interconnection investments the project's economic rate of return is calculated for two approaches.
Namely:
A.    Northwest 500/230 kV. An assessment of the proposed northwest 500/230 kV transmission system
where benefits are limited to the economic value of incremental sales from Sual. Masinloc and initial
hydropower development (up to 2050 MW in total). The cost stream comprises investments in
transmission and substations of the proposed project, corresponding operation and maintenance costs
and the cost of energy evacuated from northem Luzon. Approach A comprises the principal part of the
proposed project (85% of total investment) and part of its benefits. In this respect, approach A
provides a minimum measure (lower bound) of the project's economic viability; and
B.    Interconnection Program. An evaluation of the transmission overall interconnection program, including
all components of the proposed project (i.e., the northwest 500/230kV transmission line and
substations, the load dispatch center and the Visayas 138kV grid extension) plus the first and second
stages of the EHV interconnection investrnents in Leyte and Visayas. Approach A is a subset of
approach B, in this sense approach B includes additional costs and benefits. It considers in addition to
the incremental sales benefits, the benefits stemming from a reduction in reserve capacity requirements
(which can be attributed partially to the proposed project but are not separable). Costs include
investments in the said components, corresponding operation and maintenance costs and the cost of
energy from northem Luzon.
2. For all cases costs are expressed in 1995 constant values. Financial flows are converted to economic costs
by: (i) netting out taxes and other domestic transfers, (ii) expressing import components at CIF prices, and (iii)
applying a conversion factor of 0.93 to local costs in order to express them in equivalent border prices.
3. The economic rate of return (ERR) is computed on the basis of the net benefit flow considering benefits and
costs as identified above. Incremental electricity sales are limited to the future generation of committed projects
and are valued at the current bulk energy tariff of US.cents 6.98 /kWh, ignoring consumers surplus. The cost
of energy evacuated from Northem Luzon is valued at US. cents 5.8/kWh. Investment savings from reduced
reserve requirements (in approach B only) are valued at US$750/kW, an estimate for the weighted average of
gas turbines and coal plants' capital costs. It is estimated that capacity savings will reach 2150 MW in a
period of six years, beginning in 1999. Average energy losses of the proposed transmission system are
estimated at 3.i%.
4. The intemal economic rate of return of the project is estimated to lie betveen 20.3% and 27.2%. This
range is based on approaches A and B which render the lower and upper values, respectively. The economic
viabilitv of the project was tested against three adverse assumptions associated with project risks: (i) 15%
increase in the investment cost; (ii) a delay of ninc moths in the implementation of the project, including the

Paee 2 of 4
penalties associated to the Sual plant take-or-pay contractual provisions, and (iii) a lower demand growth. In
the latter case, part of the benefits of the first year are valued at US. cents 2.2/kWh, an estimate of variable
costs saved in existing plants. In addition, sensitivity analysis was also undertaken for the favorable case where
the proposed Northwest transmission is used at its full potential, estimated around 3,500 MW. The results of
the ERR computation and sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table 1. Details of the calculation for the
base cases of the two main approaches are given in Tables 2 and 3.

Transmission Grid Reinforcement Project
Recommended Program To Enhance Load Dispatch Operation
The following is a list of key recommendations arising from a study of contracting and economic dispatch
for power producers operating in the Philippines national grid system. The lists will be used by DOE and
NPC as a basis for formulating a strategy for the enhancement of system operations under the control of
the planned national Load Dispatch center (NB bracketed information refers to specific sections in the
Phase 2 Report No R71-95 by Power Technologies Inc. dated August 2, 1995). The list is in the
recommend chronological order, but does not imply priority of any specific item.
1. Revise Megallen Utilities Development Corps Transmission Service Agreement to improve contract terms;
remove explicit wheeling rate definition; and petition ERB to approve wheeling rate outside contract (5. 1).
2. Revise existing LDC scheduling and dispatch procedures to better accommodate contractual Minimum
Energy Takeoff Rate (MEOT) considerations (3.1
3. Implement telemetry and data acquisition capabilities for private producers which are not currently
monitored (3.5);
4. Formalize data registration and submission procedures for private producers (3.1.2);
5. Enhance and expand bid solicitation, evaluation and contracting staff; standardize contract terms and
conditions. Review MERALCO Power Service Agreement to improve contract terms in future PSAs (4.2)
6. Reactivate and enhance economic dispatch and automatic generation control capability (3.1.3);
7. Revise PDP planning procedures with respect to the treatment of hydro resources and MEOT constraint(
2.6.2)s;
8. Formalize operating procedures, connection conditions, scheduling and dispatch and metering requirements
for inclusion in standard contract provisions( 3.1.5);
9. Enhance performance monitoring capabilities; introduce automatic performance monitoring requirements in
bid solicitations (6.3);
10. Study requirements for ancillary services by private producers; implement these through contract
conditions and scheduling and load dispatch procedures (3.2);
11. Expand and enhance least cost planning aspects of the PDP process. No particular include a rigorous
analysis of the key risks as a key element of the decision process (2.6);
12. Undertake a detailed study of tariff requirements for transmission access and wheeling, select suitable
tariff structures and petition ERB for approval (5.4);
13. Organize working group for development of a Grid Code; Develop requirements and framework for a grid
code; Prepare Grid Code (3.6);
14. Promote the adoption of an indicative rather than normative generating expansion process; evaluate and
promote the modification of legal and regulatory restrictions in order to advance the indicative framework
(2.2).

Environment, Land Acquisition And Resettlement
A.    Environment
1. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) aims to establish baseline information on the existing
environmental conditions on the area to be traversed by the Project, identifies the significant environmental impacts
of the project, and prescribes appropriate environmental management measures for the identified adverse effects.
Topography/Terrain of North West Luzon Component
2. The proposed Northwestern Luzon EHV transmission project will be erected in the Northern (Region I) and
Central (Region 111) Luzon. For most of the route the proposed EHV line will be parallel to the existing 230 kV T/L
connecting Labrador S/S to San Manuel S/S to San Jose S/S. A 67.63 km section will emanate from the existing
Labrador S/S to connect with the existing San Manuel S/S and will compose of 179 tower sites. The 157.44 km
section will emanate from the existing San Manuel S/S to connect with the existing San Jose S/S and comprise of
413 tower sites. The area is divided into two major terrain categories namely gently elevated alluvial terrain. The
first section will traverse areas underlain by intrusive rocks, sedimentary rocks and alluvial deposits. A total of 17
tower sites are situated on intrusive rocks, one on sedimentary rocks and 161 on alluvium The longer section will
traverse areas underlain by pyroclastic rocks, sedimentary rocks and alluvial deposits. A total of 61 tower sites are
on pryroclastic rocks, ten on sedimentary rocks and 342 on alluvium
Meteorology
3. The prevailing climate in the area (Region I and Region III) is categorized under Type I of the Coronas climate
classification of PAGASA. It has two pronounced seasons: dry from November to April and wet during the rest of
the year. Rainfall is at a minimum during the months of January and February. Mountains along the proposed
route affects the local wind regimes throughout the year; thus, the prevailing wind at various synoptic stations is
different. The prevailing wind at Dagupan is southeast, east at Iba and northeast at Cabanatuan. The
climatological data gathered from PAGASA stations in Dagupan (1951-1985), Iba (1951-1985) and Cabanatuan
(1951-1976) indicate an annual mean temperature of 27.8C, 27.0C and 27.60C, respectively. The mean annual
RH value is 77% at Dagupan City, 79% at Iba and 76% at Cabanatuan City. The transmission line right-of-way
will go through six (6) perennial rivers namely the Agno, Sinocalan, Talavera, Pampanga, Penaranda and Angat
and small creeks which are usually dry during summer. River water is used for washing clothes, irrigation,
quarrying, livestock watering and other general purposes.
Ecological Environrment
4. The proposed areas of expansion of the Labrador and San Manuel Substation is currently under rice plantation
(average yield of 3.02 mtlha, DA, 1993). Likewise, the expansion areas of the Labrador-San Manuel and San
Manuel-San Jose del Monte T/L route consist mostly of ricelands The vegetation at the proposed San Jose del
Monte substation expansion site on the other hand comprises mostly of grass shrubs and fruit bearing trees. Oryza
sativa (rice) is the main crop grown in the lowlands of Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija and Bulacan. Grassland and
patches of trees are found on the hills site, open lands and marginal lands along the T/L route. The dominant grass
species identified were Themeda triandra, Imperata cylindrica (cogon) and Saccharum spontaneum (talahib). A
total of seven (7) birds species, 5 mammals, 4 reptiles and 2 arnphibians inhabit the provinces of Pangasinan,
Nueva Ecija and Bulacan. Common bird species are Egretta garzetta nigripes, Haliastus indus, Passer montanus,
Corvus macrorhynchus, Collocalia troglodytes, Dendrocygna arcuata and Megalurus palustris. Sus sp., Cervus sp.
Rattus mindanensis, Suncus occultidens, and Ptenochirus jagorii were the mammalian species recorded. Common
amphibian species listed were Bufo marinus and Rana cancrivora. Hemidactylus frenatus, Gecko gekko, Varanus

Pafe 2 of 5
salvator and Brachymeles gracilis were the reptilian species observed along the proposed substations and
transmission line route. Five (5) common fish species and freshwater shrimp were recorded in six major rivers to
be traversed by the proposed EHV T/L namely: goby (Glossogobius sp.), murrel (Ophicephalus striatus), catfish
(Clarias sp.), dilis (Stelophorus sp.), eel (Synbranchus sp.) and freshwater shrimp (macrobrachium sp.).
Public Involvement
5. Information dissemination regarding the project was started in December 1993 prior to the commencement of
environmental and socioeconomic surveys (SES). Several consultations with local officials and informal dialogues
with the would-be-affected households were undertaken to answer queries concerning relocation and compensation
during the environmental inspection and SES survey in January and April 1994 respectively. The application for
the Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) was submitted to the DENR on February 7, 1994. A joint NPC-
DENR site inspection was then conducted in March. The ECCs for the project were released by DENR in April,
1994. However, changes in the S/S lay-outs were made after the actual staking of the T/L towers and additional
EIA studies had to be undertaken. The revised T/L route and SIS site and supplementary EIA were then submitted
to the DENR in September 1994 and revision of the ECC was requested. Subsequently, the DENR released a new
ECC for the project. In September 1994, mayors of all the 28 affected municipalities in the provinces of
Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija and Bulacan were advised about the project through correspondence.  Project
presentations were then conducted in 26 municipalities, 12 barangays and for 5 local NGOs. These information
campaigns/presentations resulted in the issuance of 5 endorsements from Pangasinan, 6 from Nueva Ecija and 2
from Bulacan. On September 22, 1994, a meeting was held with the landowners of the proposed San Manuel S/S
expansion site. The discussion focused primarily on the compensation for the affected land. Continuing
consultations with other affected households to discuss their respective concerns will be undertaken as needed.
Impacts and Management Measures
6. In order to minimize the visual impact that the erection of the line will cause, they will be built at an angle to
the existing highways and not be higher than the mountain range. Environmental guidelines to contractors covering
civil works including excavator and cutting/filling activities, will ensure that project construction will not cause
adverse impact on water quality. Spoils generated during construction shall be used as filling materials and the
surplus will be spread and compacted around the tower sites. All filled areas shall be compacted then revegetated
to make the area stable. Excess spoils shall be properly contained and deposited as described above away from
water bodies. Hazards from fire after clearing wvill be prevented by burying the cut vegetation such as dried
leaves/twigs/branches as mulch or compost materials and by giving away twigs and shrubwood to residents for use
as firewood.
Ecological Impacts
7. No critical habitats such as primary forests, national parks and wildlife reserves will be traversed by the
proposed line route and substations. Any ecological impacts from the project are expected to occur only during
erection and will be minor and temporary in duration and will involve ecologically common species of plants.
Construction of the substation and clearing of the easement corridor will certainly result in the loss of natural
vegetation and crop production. To mitigate the impacts of the proposed project, construction should be scheduled
after harvesting of major crops to avoid production losses. Landscaping and revegetation of open and exposed
areas shall be undertaken immediately after completion of the civil works. Erosion and sedimentation of nearby
river channels during construction of the project will disrupt biological and ecological processes of freshwater
organism. The impact however, is temporary and insignificant and construction shall he undertaken during dry
months.

B.    Land Acquisition And Resettlement
1.    The project will involve land acquisition, payment of compensation for assets affected and payment of
easement fees for the right-of-way for transmission lines. About 966 households (4,730 people) will need to be
relocated. The four components of the project that will require land acquisition and/or right-of-way (ROW)
compensation are delineated below and are also summarized in Table 1.
(a)    The NW Luzon transmission component includes a 500 kV/225 km transmission line from Labrador to San
Manuel to San Jose, and one sub-station at each of the three locations. This component will involve relocation of
about 600 households. The costs for relocation and compensation are estimated at Pesos 586.6 million;
(b)    The Visayas subtransmission component includes: (a) Panay IV transmission line (123 kV/79 kIn); and (b)
Negros IV transmission line (138 kV/73 km). These components will, together, involve the relocation of 53
households. The estimated costs of relocation and compensation are about Pesos 54.4 million;
(c)    The Sual-Labrador 230 kV transmission line will affect 24 households.  Costs for relocation and
compensation are estimated at Pesos 9.6 million;
(d)    The Masinloc-Labrador 230 kV transmission line, financed by KfW, will affect 89 households. The
relocation and compensation costs are estimated at Pesos 41.2 million;

2.     The borrower (NPC) has prepared a consolidation Relocation/Resettlement Action Plan for the project as a
whole, acceptable to the Bank. The key aspects under this project are:
NPC has prepared a new Relocation and Resettlement Policy (Annex 15) for transmission projects that will be
piloted under this project. The proposed policy enhances the framework agreed for the Leyte Geothermal project; it
has been approved by NP Board;



- 76 -                                     Annex 14
Page 4 of 5
Technical assistance, to continue efforts to strengthen NPC's capacity, were initiated under the Leyte Geothermal
project. This capacity building effort focused on social impact assessment, preparation and implementation of
resettlement action plans and community development programs. In addition, the technical assistance will finance
hiring of consultants to assist with: (a) revision of NPC's right-of-way manual; and (b) development of the
framework and/or charter for NPC's proposed real estate subsidiary -- NPC Properties Incorporated.
3.     Proposed Policy Framework for Relocation and Resettlement. NPC's policy for transmission projects was
until recently limited to providing cash compensation for affected land, houses and crops and a fixed disturbance
allowance; it did not include measures for resettling the displaced or for restoring their incomes. Further,
compensation for land, houses, crops and trees was based on municipal "schedules of value" which are often well
below market and replacement values of these assets. Finally, only those that could demonstrate ownership were
eligible for cash compensation for land, houses and crops. This means, for example, that those who do not own the
land on which their house is built -- tenant farmers, households granted use rights by landlords, and squatters - did
not receive compensation for their house lots and were often unable to find house lots to relocate their houses. By
contrast, people displaced by NPC's power plants were and continue to be eligible -- irrespective of their tenure
status - for a resettlement package which includes a house plot with a core house in a serviced resettlement area
developed by NPC, or its cash equivalent. They are also eligible for livelihood development programs financed and
administered by NPC.
4.     To overcome the shortcomings of the existing policy framework, NPC and the Bank have agreed on a
relocation and resettlement policy for transmission projects (see Annex 15). This policy has been approved by the
Board of NPC and has been adopted as corporation policv. "Land for Land" compensation, will, however, be first
piloted under TGRL and other World Bank and ADB financed projects. Its incorporation into NPC's policyis
contingent on the results of the pilot project. The new policy will provide: (a) compensation at replacement value
for affected houses, eliminating the current practice of deducting depreciation from the assessed value; (b) to
affected people the option of obtaining equivalent replacement land or cash compensation at fair market value; (c)
compensation at market value for affected crops and at economic value for trees (such as coconut, mango and
bamboo); (d) assistance and/or loans for livelihood development to affected people; and (e) coverage for people
with weaker tenure status. In addition, to improve the mechanism for asset valuation and reduce complaints of
"unfair and low assessment" by affected people, NPC will hire competent private assessors.
Resettlement Action Plans - Key points.
5.     Entitlements. As per the policy delineated above, affected families will be entitled to cash compensation for
lost assets, and the costs for demolition, transfer and reconstruction of houses. In addition, they will receive a
disturbance compensation equivalent to at least two months of income to cover initial income losses. Displaced
families will have the option of receiving equivalent replacement land, from NPC, instead of cash compz2nsation for
their land. Finally, displaced families will be provided either a residential lot or its cash equivalent, irrespective of
their current tenure stature.
6.    Institutional Strengthening. Project delays caused by social opposition to NPC's projects and delays in
obtaining environmental clearances, have been principal constraints to NPC's development. This indicates the high
priority that needs to be accorded to strengthening environmental and social units in the organization. These units
are currently overworked and are in need of competent staff trained in environmental engineering and social
sciences. NPC has agreed to review the staffing of its Environmental and Social Engineering Departments and
advise the Bank of its plans for capacity enhancement. As a first step, technical assistance under the Leyte-Luzon
project will finance (through grant funds) consultants/advisors to assist NPC in re-assessing the existing
institutional arrangements for environmental and social assessment work. The second phase of the Leyte technical



- 77 -                                         Annex 14
Paee 5 of 5
assistance grant will be directed towards building capacity in specific areas identified as priority areas in the first
phase of the work. As mentioned earlier, this project will provide additional TA to continue and complement on-
going efforts towards capacity building. In particular, this project will provide TA for: (a) revision of NPC's right-
of-way manual; and (b) development of the framework and/or charter for NPC's proposed real estate subsidiary.
7.     Implementation Arrangements. The Project Director will be assisted by Project Managers assigned to
specific project areas. A special Right-of-way task force will be set up to ensure timely and efficient land
acquisition and compensation.  Further, implementation teams of about eight persons will be assigned the
responsibility for every 30 km  segment of the transmission lines; they will support all activities related to
compensation and relocation. Internal monitoring will be the responsibility of the Project Manager and Director. In
addition, consultants will be hired to conduct external monitoring and evaluation and prepare reports on a periodic
basis - every six months during the implementation of the RAPs and a final evaluation report six months to one year
after completion of the resettlement program. These reports will be in addition to the updates on implementation of
the RAP that will be prepared by the PMO to be included in NPC's quarterly project progress reports to the Bank.
8.     Budget. The relocation and compensation costs which include compensation for lost assets and payment of
easement fees for the right-of-way, are estimated at about Pesos 691.5 million. One sub-project - the NW Luzon
transmission line - accounts for 91 percent of the entire outlay. Table 2 presents the budget disaggregated by sub-
project. Experience with other NPC projects indicates, however, that the budgets are not firmly fixed because the
final unit rates are determined by assessors during implementation and also because they are often negotiated with
affected people.

RESETTLEMENT/RELOCATION OBJECTIVES, POLICY FRAMEWORK, GUIDELINES,
ENTITLEMENTS/ELIGIBILITY AND DEFINITION OF TERMS
A.    Objectives
1.    To clear the right-of-way limit of houses/structures and crops/improvements beyond 3 m. In height and the
proposed substations expansion sites of the same.
2.     To smoothly and effectively resettle the affected families.
3.    To restore the economic life of the affected families or better yet to improve it.
4.     To satisfy the requirements of funding agencies for the humane and orderly transfer of affected families.
B.    Policy Framework
1.    Project Design. Transmission line projects and their components shall be designed in a manner to avoid or
at least minimize displacement and adverse impacts on incomes of the affected population.
2.     Compensation and Benefits. People to be displaced by land acquisition and/or right-of-way shall be
compensated fairly of their properties - land, houses/structures, crops and improvements based on the principle of
replacement value.
a.     Principles on compensation are as follow:
1.    Lands to be acquired as sites of substations, cable terminal and converter stations and residential lots within
the T/L right-of-way shall be paid based on fair economic and market values. The valuation shall be determined by
an independent appraiser hired by NPC or by government financial institutions (GFIs).
2.     Right-of-way (ROW) easement fee for agricultural lands shall be paid 10% of the fair economic and market
value arrived at similar to the process in item I above. However, the lands shall be acquired if the valuation is not
acceptable to the landowner. If this is still unacceptable, these shall be replaced in kind. Where the affected
households lose only part of their holdings such that their life style and means of earning are not affected adversely,
they will be paid compensation only for the affected property. However, where 25% or more of the property is
affected or where the remaining property becomes unusable or economically unviable, the affected households will
be entitled to surrender entire holding and ask for full compensation and resettlement benefits. All the affected
households entitled for relocation will also be offered land-for-land option in lieu of cash compensation. Under the
land-for-land option the location of plots will preferably be in the vicinity of affected property and/or acceptable to
affected households. In the case of residential plots it will be of comparable size and for agricultural plots it will be
of comparable size and of equivalent productive potential.
3.    Houses and structures shall be compensated based on their replacement value which is the cost of materials
and labor in the locality at the time of relocation. No depreciation cost shall be applied. The house-owners shall be
responsible for dismantling the affected house and shall own salvageable materials. However, if NPC does the
dismantling, salvageable materials shall be owned by the corporation.
4.     Crops and improvement shall be compensated at fair economic and market value as indicated also in item I
above.

Page 2 of 3
5.     Tower occupancy fee equivalent to 100% of the fair economic and market value of the area within the ROW
width limit occupied by steel tower/pole/woodpole cluster, but not less than P600.00 shall be paid to agricultural
lands that were paid of easement fee only.
6.     Financial assistance to tenants on agricultural land shall be granted per provision of Executive Order 1035.
The amount shall be equivalent to the value of gross harvest for one year on the principal and secondary crops of the
area acquired based on the average annual gross harvest for the last three (3) preceding crop years, provided that in
no case shall the financial assistance be less than P15,000 per hectare. The tenants in the affected lands shall be
accredited by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR). Tenants not covered by EO 1035 will also be entitled for
compensation and other benefits similar to those offered for accredited tenants provided these are certified by land
owners/local authorities.
7.     Disturbance compensation shall be given to each affected household equivalent to the daily minimum wage
in the project-affected area multiplied by 60 days per Republic Act (RA) 7279 or the Urban Development and
Housing Act of 19921.
8.     Grant of cash equivalent of residential lot area of either 90 sq.m. (urban), 120 sq.m. (semi-urban) and 200
sq.m. (rural) with prices based on the fair economic and market value in the project area, or
Grant of residential lot if there are 10 or more affected households per group/cluster in a common place who
opt to relocate to an NPC relocation site.
C.    Compensation Package
Each affected households will be paid and/or granted the following compensation/benefits:
1. Payment of land
2. Payment of houses/structures
3. Payment of crops and improvements
4. Grant of disturbance compensation (DC)
5. Financial assistance to tenants per E.O. 1035, for agricultural land
6. Payment of easement fee
7. Payment of tower/pole/guy occupancy fees, if the TAL ROW has been paid of ease,ment fee only
8. Grant of applicable residential lot or cash equivalent
9. Participation in livelihood projects in accordance with Energy Regulation 1-94
3.     Negotiations procedures. Disagreements on the valuation of lands and crops and improvements shall be
settled by an independent Appraisal Committee composed of representatives from any of the GFIs such as Land
Bank, Development Bank of the Philippines and the Philippine National Bank and a private real estate expert.
Further negotiations will be based on the Committee's recommendations and will be finally decided/approved by the
NP Board.
All ROW negations for both power generation and transmission liens and substations projects maybe contracted to
an outside party.
lDue to the difficulty of ascertaining the monthly average family Income based on SES results (relocatees usually pad their Incomes upon learning of
compensation package after Information disseninatlon campaign or at times number of respondents are few/not sufficient to get correct figure), this
has been adopted. Data are taken from the Department of Labor and Employment.

Page 3 of 3
4.     Re-establishment of Production System. To ensure the well-being of the displaced families, they shall be
given the priority to participate in livelihood projects per ER 1-94 to be implemented by the concerned local
government units.
5.     Existing Laws and Decrees. NPC shall adhere to existing laws and decrees in the grant of necessary and/or
additional compensation to displaced families.
6.     Participation of Displaced Families. The affected families shall be informed and consulted during the pre-
resettlement/relocation plan preparation on compensation package, relocation options and procedures for payment
and settlement of conflicts/disagreements. Subsequently, they will be regularly informed and consulted in every
stage of plan implementation. Any request for meeting/consultations with SED shall be coursed through the PMO or
they may personally come to the SED office as some of them are wont to do.
7.     Resolution of Conflicts, Appeals and Grievance Procedures. The PMO shall put up an Appeals and
Grievances Desk within the project site office to be manned by one of its staff to receive and manage/supervise the
resolution of complaints/suggestions/requests from the relocatees, affected landowners, NGOs, POs and LGUs.
Right-of-way cases requiring legal opinions/decisions shall be handled by the Land and Land Rights Department
(LLRD), Office of the General Counsel including legal problems arising from relocations. The Social Engineering
Department and the PMO will resolve all other relocation complaints.
8.    Implementation Schedule. The resettlement plan will have a clear implementation time frame. Affected
people will be compensated prior to resettlement and will be given sufficient lead time (2 months) to move before the
start of construction works on their properties.
9.     Monitoring, Internal and External. The implementation of the resettlement plan will be monitored by the
PMO with the assistance of the Social Engineering Department. A copy of the status of plan implementation will be
included in the quarterly project status reports to the funding agencies.
For external monitoring, the Project Director or Manager will recruit a third partly to check the implementation
results and to evaluate the effectiveness of the resettlement plan. The monitoring group will be hired prior to
relocation and will be retained until approximately six (6) months to one year after completion of resettlement. The
group will focus on developing indicators for ascertaining the adequacy and impact of the resettlement plan and on
establishing the extent to which the standards of living of the affected people have been restored or improved. It will
prepare and submit to the Project Director/Manager, with a copy to the Bank, a report every 3 months.

Institutional Support to the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB)
Basis for Technical Assistance:
1.     As the energy price regulatory body of the Philippines, ERB is responsible for the rates that may be charged
for electric power transmission, wheeling, stand-by, back-up or other related services of any public utility in the
Philippines, including of NPC. For example, ERB is responsible for NPC or other utility transmission and wheeling
rates and other related charges that would be implemented as a result of the recent DOE rule implementing EO 215,
which law itself opened the generation market for entry of IPP's. In the future, ERB would also control any such
charges of a spin-off company such as the proposed TRANSCO transmission entity contemplated by subsidiarisation
and privatisation of NPC.
2.     Many of these issues are new for ERB. Prior to 1993, the responsibility of ERB in the electric sector was
primarily for the retail rates and charges of private electric utilities. Responsibility for NPC rates was only added in
December of 1992. Staff to provide the necessary analysis was only available finally by late 1994. Most of the staff
hired, while professionally capable, were not experienced in utility regulation nor in electric transmission matters.
Other duties were also added to the ERB in the December 1992 reorganisation of government institutions in the
energy sector, and also only staffed by late 1994. Still further duties have since been added and others are presently
contemplated by the current session of Congress. Over half of the present staff is thus newly hired.
Purposes of PHRD Grant to ERB:
3.     Therefore part of the Philippines Transmission Grid Reinforcement Project is a Japanese Technical
Assistance grant under the Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) program for institutional development
and strengthening of the ERB. The TA will recommend and provide means to strengthen the institutional capacity of
ERB in general, and will specifically strengthen the capacity of ERB to evaluate transmission rates and charges and
related dispatch issues in particular. The TA completes these tasks through two projects: an institutional assessment
TA, and a transmission rates TA.
ERB Institutional Assessment Under PHRD Grant:
4.     An assessment of ERB institutional strengths and weaknesses has been completed, as to both staff and
facilities. The assessment of agency shows that the agency is constrained by government hiring rules and salary
schedules, making it difficult or impossible to hire and retain suitably qualified staff. Of 254 authorised positions as
of January 1, 1995, about 20 professional positions for attomeys, economists and engineers were unfilled due to
absence of qualified or in cases even any applicants, and 10 positions in information and data processing were
unfilled for similar reasons. Most remain vacant. The analysis showed that the minimum staff requirement of the
ERB for current duties in regulation (apart from antipilferage enforcement) is 300 professionals. Recruitment of this
level of staff may well be difficult at current salaries. Therefore, as part of a Revenue Fund Bill proposed by ERB to
Congress, ERB is requesting exemption from these government restrictions and the ability to establish its own salary
structure. The TA report strongly endorses this action.
5.     At the same time, using ESL funds allocated to ERB, a training program is being instituted to fill areas of
support identified by the TA study. This program is hiring at least eight different in-depth training seminars from
professional training organisations, to be given on ERB premises for local staff. These cover topics including electric
.utility rates method, regulatory analysis of electric power systems, management analysis of utility systems, utility
finance and accounting, legal issues, and other relevant topics. Research seminars from established organisations
with previously completed bodies of relevant research are being hired, and their collections of research purchased for
the ERB library.  Published sets of regulatory decisions of major foreign regulatory commissions have been
purchased for the ERB library.



- 82 -                                   Annex 16
Paee 2 of 3
6.    The ERB presently has a main office in Pasig, Metro Manila, of 2500 square meters, and two remote offices
in Cebu City and Davao, of about 150 square meters each. The actual requirement of ERB, present and minimally
required future staff of 300, are at least 4500 square meters in Manila, and proportionate increases in the remote
offices. New space is also needed because the government property management of the existing structure makes it
barely habitable and non-functional. For example, although ERB pays the government P 1,000,000 annually added
to the rent for air conditioning, the air conditioning unit in the building has not worked for many years. Rats inhabit
the space and eat wiring of computers and other equipment, creating fire, health and other hazards, in addition to
damage to equipment. Lighting is grossly inadequate. The Institutional analysis therefore recommended that new
main office space be acquired, if possible also in the Pasig area for convenience of staff and public access.
7.    The Institutional analysis also assessed the equipment used and needed by the ERB, especially the number,
kind and uses of computers and related information management. The recommendations of a 1993 ERB study of
computer uses, sponsored by ESL funds, were reviewed and compared to the present condition. Essentially each
employee should have a computer. While the ERB presently owns 70 computers, it requires at over 200 computers
for the present staff levels. Every ERB position of government grade 6 or higher in the agency, which is all but 16
positions, relies on data input, data analysis, or other written documents, in a manner that is very much more efficient
when done on computer. The agency also presently owns 34 printers, most of the dot matrix type. These are
relatively slow, and are unsuited as local area network (LAN) servers. Use of a LAN increases efficiency of use of
attached equipment such as printers. The 1993 computer use study and this one both recommend that ERB install a
LAN among its machines. Therefore, future ERB printer purchases should be of laser printers, suited to LAN
application. Using a 4:1 ratio of networked computers to printers, ERB requires at least 50 laser printers for present
staff levels.
ERB Transmission Rates TA Under PHRD Grant:
8.    The larger portion of the PHRD TA is for assistance to ERB in understanding the framework for and
particulars, of how to assess and set transmission and related rates and charges, including how to properly assess
generation dispatch issues. ERB PHRD TA consultants will recommend a specific rate method or methods
applicable to Philippine electric power transmission system transmission rates and related charges. They will give
specific examples of how to apply these methods in particular rate cases using representative data from NPC and
Meralco or another representative utility. The Rates TA consultants will also provide training to ERB on how to
perform the actual computations to apply the rates method.
9.    As to dispatch matters, the ERB TA will provide ERB with institutional capability to appraise price and
efficiency effects of the eventual dispatch rules, grid code, and industry structure, that may be proposed for
NAPOCOR. (A separate TA was let by NPC to Power Technologies, Inc. for work on dispatch issues on behalf of
NPC under the Grid Reinforcement Project. Among other matters, the PTI work should result in recommendation of
a particular Grid Code for the operation of the dispatch system. Questions of industry structure are also to be treated
separately, in the process of privatisation of NPC. The ERB Rates TA will provide ERB the capability to evaluate
these actions). The Rates TA work will be completed before the end of 1995.
Related ERB Energy Sector Loan Projects:
10.   A $650,000 portion of the Energy Sector Loan originally allocated to DOE has now been reallocated by
DOE to ERB for projects related to ERB institutional development. These funds are being applied in diverse projects
as listed below:
Computer software training for ERB personnel in operating systems, data bases, spread sheets and word
processing;

SUMMARY OF NPC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (TA) COMPONENT
1.     ADB Funded Technical Assistance
(1)    Institutional Support - Accounting Services (US$1.2million)
This project will review NPC's present accounting system, and its planned restructuring and privatization
program, and recommend an accounting system which will be appropriate to its needs. The project will (i) design
a management information system and accounting system which is appropriate to the needs of the holding
company and subsidiaries; (ii) recommend the extent of centralization that is justified for the accounting services;
(iii) develop a uniform code of accounts for the holding company and subsidiaries; (iv) develop standardized
accounting manuals for the holding company and subsidiaries; (v) monitor the implementation of the accounting
systems; and (vi) train staff in the implementation and maintenance of the management information system and
accounting system;
(ii)   Institutional Support - Human Resources/Change Management (US$200,000)
The restructuring and privatization of NPC will require changes to its organization and use of human resources.
This will require the transfer of some personnel to subsidiaries, and may have to be accompanied by training to
impart new skills. The privatization exercise will lead to an optimization of its present human resources, and may
require reduction in staff. In the latter case, plans must be prepared to assist affected persons in obtaining gainful
employment. Assistance is to be provided in (i) drafting a policy statement on the principles and goals to retain
staff; (ii) determining staffing requirements after taking into consideration practices in similar utilities and the
need to avoid duplication; (iii) preparing a master plan for human resource deployment and the associated
training needs; (iv) determining remuneration levels; (v) determining mechanisms for the preservation of rights
and benefits of persons transferring to subsidiaries; (vi) establishing guidelines for an employee stock ownership
scheme; and (vii) recommending a system for human resource record keeping;
(iii)   Institutional Support - Valuation of Plant in Service (US$1.3 million)
Covenants with multilateral lending institutions require NPC to perform a full-scale valuation of its plant in
service every 4 years. The last full valuation was performed in 1992 therefore another valuation is due in 1996.
The 1992 valuation concentrated on power plants. Work on transmission assets was limited and no valuation
was performed for buildings. Since up to date valuations have a direct bearing on the valuation of a subsidiary's
equity, it is important that these values be correct. The valuation must also be suitable for establishing the rate
bas of each company, and must be acceptable to regulatory bodies and the Security and Exchange Commission.
The work to be performed would include (i) valuation of production plants; (ii) valuation of each transmission
line 69 kV or higher in areas served by NPC; (iii) valuation of each substation and switching station in the NPC
system; (iv) valuation of all NPC owned buildings; and (v) ensuring that values have been correctly recorded in
the books of account.
(iv)   Institutional Support - Wheeling Tariffs (US$l150000)
Initially the transmission subsidiary company (TRANSCO) will have to face high operating costs attributable to
the 69kV sub-transmission systems which represent over 70% of the circuit length of all transmission lines. It is
expected that a substantial part of the 69kV systems will eventually be transferred to distribution utilities. A
mechanism is needed to demonstrate transparently that wheeling tariffs to be charged by TRANSCO cover only
its cost and a fair return. Assistance is needed to (i) develop a transparent mechanism to calculate wheeling
charges; (ii) design a financial model to facilitate transparent calculations of tariffs which is suited to changing
conditions; and (iii) develop adequate programs to calculate load flows and losses, and a dispatch system that can
record all parameters pertinent to costs.

Paze 2 of 5
(v)    Institutional Support - Tools for Financial Evaluations (US$25.000)
Assistance is needed in the development of a computerized financial model that will evaluate the financial
performance of each subsidiary company, and consolidate these results into the holding company. The model
should be flexible and capable of calculating several types of dynamic financial scenarios and tariffs, and should
be able to (i) compute rates of return on rate base and internal rates of return given various levels of loads, tariffs,
O&M costs, fuel costs and amortization; (ii) compute revenue requirements for different returns; (iii) consider
differing borrowing and debt service scenarios; (iv) provide a cash flow analysis; (v) have means of recognizing
local and foreign exchange investments and costs; and (vi) be capable of checking important financial and
operating ratios and guidelines.
(vi)   Formation of Transmission Subsidiary (US$500,000)
As part of its restructuring and privatization program, NPC intends to convert its transmission operations into a
separate subsidiary company in two distinct phases. Phase I would involve forming a separate transmission
profit center within its organization, and transferring the functional responsibility for operation of the
transmission network to this new profit center. NPC envisages work in Phase I to include decisions regarding the
industry and business structure; organizational and staffing requirements and allocations; identification of asset
boundaries and compilation of asset records; review, amendment and implementation of operating procedures;
costs and revenue analysis and budgeting and the preparing of a preliminary business plan. NPC would execute
the work in Phase I with the assistance of consultants.
NPC has asked the Bank is consider providing technical assistance (TA) of about $500,000 equivalent for Phase
II of the exercise, which would involve the actual formation of the transmission subsidiary company. Phase II
would build on the work performed during Phase I, and would involve refining the organizational structure of the
subsidiary; drafting its detailed business plan; recommending technical interfaces with industry participants;
preparing financial projections and capital investment programs; ascertaining funding requirements and
recommending the needed debt/equity mix; developing the regulatory structure in which the subsidiary would
operate; and identifying other actions needed to enable the subsidiary to operate.
2.     Other Technical Assistance Funded by NPC
(i)    Stakeholders analysis - An evaluation of the NPC's Social Development Program - (US$100,000)
Social responsibility dictates that the NPC consider the different stakeholders in policy formulation and program
implementation.  This study shall therefore identify the different stakeholders of NPC and analyze their
relationship with NPC.  It shall also evaluate the existing community relations scheme to determine its
effectiveness and sustainability as a community based development strategy. The TA shall be used to assist in
the conduct of in-house seminar-workshop that will train local personnel in the stakeholder analysis process.
Principles as well as practical learning through case studies, as well as prescriptive tools for managing, will be
discussed. Workshops are focused on experiential learning and surfacing of stakeholder issues confronting the
Corporation. Given the nationwide scope of NPC operations, it shall limit its scope of analysis to the Head
Office and select plants in the three regional centers.
(ii)    Training Programs/Seminars/Workshops/Fact-Finding Missions - (US$ 300.000)
Select groups of NPC staff members will attend training programs/seminars/workshops being conducted by the
International Management Group, Financial Engineering Institute, Euromoney, among others. They will also
participate in fact finding missions, hands-on training, familiarization studies in selected electric utilities which
have undergone restructuring and privatization. The TA will provide them with vital and additional skills



- 86 -                                    Annex 17
Paee 3 of 5
necessary to the various activities involved in the restructuring and privatization program of NPC. Consequently,
these will ensure its smooth, successful and cost-effective implementation.
(iii)   Energy Center Project Study - NPC Efficiency and Reliability Department - (US$400.000)
Energy demand by the year 2005 is estimated to increase to about 16,256 MW with 6.3 M households being
electrified nationwide. NPC's responsibility is to provide information on energy-efficient technologies accessible
through building an Energy Center which will showcase working displays of technologies such as advanced
lighting, air conditioning, glazing, building envelopes and system controls to aid architects, engineers, designers,
owners and developers as well as the household residents. The Center will realize the effectiveness through the
efficient utilization as well as the reduction of electricity consumption nationwide with considerable growth in the
country's GNP. It will also provide an energy resource library to serve as a market of new ideas and information.
The TA will finance consultants to provide the latest information as well as appropriate demonstration
methodology and to determine the energy-saving technologies and/or opportunities to be considered.
(iv)   Integrated Resource Planning Workstation - (US$500,000)
Significant structural changes being considered to the power sector in the Philippines will have profound effect on
the way the system is planned. The planning process has several areas for improvement ranging from
enhancements to the existing legal framework to changes to the specific system planning methods and procedures.
The TA will be used to finance consulting services together with system planning tools and softwares to expand
and enhance the capability of system planners to pursue a more in-depth analysis of least cost system expansion
plan as well as to allow the conduct of more sensitivity studies considering all resources available. A computer
model is required for analyzing bids between competing projects in order to demonstrate and document the factors
prompting the choice for generation additions. Besides being a tool for analyzing competitiveness and economic
value within power pooling environments, the model must also handle all types of thermal, hydro, and renewable
resources as well as all demand-side management programs such as direct load control, efficient lighting
programs and numerous others. It will be used to determine or illustrate the merit of building power generation
facilities to serve export markets or determine the benefits of imports (or establish the price for imports to be
economic).
(v)    Transmission Lines Reliability Improvement Study - (US$600.000)
The project is aimed at assisting NPC identify and determine shortcomings and weaknesses of the current T/L
operations and maintenance practices by conducting a comprehensive review of the existing O/M policies,
procedures, methods, techniques, and technologies being employed. Transmission line reliability is one major
area that is worth looking into with an outside assistance because of its implication on the operational and
financial performance of the Corporation. It is an area where major improvements will be substantiallv rewarded
in terms of savings and reduction in revenue loss due to unplanned line outages. The benefits that will be reaped
from this undertaking are so substantial that even a 50% reduction in unserved energy due to transmission line
outages will lead to the realization of $7.5M in additional revenue over the next five years. The TA will be used
to acquire expert services to look into the current methods, practices and technologies being employed to maintain
and operate our transmission system will give us an opportunity to view the system from the vantage point of an
outsider. The consultant should be able to determine and identify factors which cause unserved energy levels way
beyond our counterpart in other countries. Moreover, he should be able to recommend appropriate solutions that
will result in the reduction of unserved energy to the level of other utilities. The recommended solutions should
also result in the enhancement of the present system as well as the T/L upgrading program under the PDP
masterplan.

(vi)   Investor Relations Services - Privatization and Restructuring External Office - (US$3 10.000)
Under this TA, NPC will commission a consulting firm to provide crossborder investor relations services in order
to build the value of its securities that will be sold to the public and thus maximize the proceeds for the
Corporation. While these services will be timed to coincide with the schedule of public securities/offering, other
services such as building NPC's in-house expertise in capital markets by conducting training programs/seminars,
research and identification of opportunities and obstacles related to NPC's public equity and debt securities
offerings, will also be undertaken by the consultant.
(vii)   Property Appraisal and Titling of the Land and Land Rights of NPC - (US$200,000)
NPC presently holds clear titles to only approximately twenty percent of the land it owns. Normally, this would
not present any difficulty to a government corporation. However, with NPC's privatization progran, proper
documentation of its properties becomes necessary. In addition, maintenance of adequate records of these
properties should be developed, specially if it pursues its plan of creating a separate real estate subsidiary not
only to manage these properties but likewise to cievelop the same. The TA will be used to pursue two main
objectives: (1) to have all NPC land and land rights properly surveyed, appraised and titled; and (2) to develop an
adequate record of the land and land rights of NPC. This project shall cover all land and land rights which NPC
owns all over the Philippines. Among the requirements needed in the pursuit of these objectives are the following:
(a) identify, describe, locate and measure the land; (b) determine the more expeditious approach(es) to
obtain titles to the land and land rights and pursue the titling of the same; (c) make an assessment of the
fair value of the land through recognized valuation procedures; (d) develop and maintain a continuous
property record for the land and land rights related to NPC properties.
(viii)  Environmental Management Program - (US$250,000)
Environmental management programs will provide a framework for operating NPC power facilities in
compliance with corporate environmental policies and applicable regulatory requirements. The TA will
provide guidelines for establishing an environmental management program.  It will identify key
components of a comprehensive environmental management program as identified and established by
NPC.  It also will provide human resource requirements which are essential to the effective
implementation of the program.  Although NPC  has established a corporate policy prioritizing
environmental compliance, there are numerous practical reasons for implementing a comprehensive
environmental management program. The program might consist of all or several of the following
components: (a) environmental Management Policies and Programs; (b) minimizing Environmental
Liabilities; (c) emergency Response and Contingency Planning; (d) environmental Auditing
Program/Preparing for ISO 14000. The objectives will be to (a) help NPC recognize and understand the
strategic and operational reasons for implementing an environmental management system; (b) look at the
various tools and approaches NPC can use to develop an environmental management system; (c) identify and
establish attainable goals that are acceptable corporate wide and integrate them into daily operations; (d) ensure
that the Program at a minimum achieves regulatory compliance; (e) create a mechanism or system designed to
control costs of the program; (f) emphasize long range planning versus crisis response; (g) integrate a systems
approach which allows for measurement of Program success
(ix)   Project Management Professional Program for NPC Personnel - (US$300,000)
The objective of this program to be financed under a TA program, is to prepare a select group of Project
Managers (i.e. 10 NPC personnel) in meeting challenges of managing projects, both from within and outside the
organization, using state-of-the-art tools and proven management techniques. The program duration will be three
months at an institute offering training for certification under the US Project Management Institute. The program
