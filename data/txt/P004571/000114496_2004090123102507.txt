Account shall be made as follows:
      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower

5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,
the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the FIRSC
Special Account:
      (a)   If, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
FIRSC Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
      (b)   If the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank,
within the period of time specified in Section 5.01 (b) (ii) of the
Currency Pool Loan Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit
of the records and accounts for the FIRSC Special Account;
      (c)   If, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower
of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower
to make withdrawals from the FIRSC Loan Account pursuant to the provisions
of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or
      (d)   Once the total unwithdrawn amount of the FIRSC Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of
the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the FIRSC Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the FIRSC Loan allocated to the Eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the
extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts
remaining on deposit in the FIRSC Special Account as of the date of such
notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible Expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment
out of the FIRSC Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in
an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii)
was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional
evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the FIRSC Special
Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount
equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further
deposit by the Bank into the FIRSC Special Account shall be made until
the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund,
as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in the FIRSC Special Account will not be required to cover
further payments for Eligible Expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly
upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank
all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the FIRSC Special Account.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the FIRSC Loan Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant
provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
