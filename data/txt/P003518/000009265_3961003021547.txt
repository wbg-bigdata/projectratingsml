HEMORANDUN AND RECOMMENDATION OP TEE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL MANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A GUANGDONG PROVINCIAL BTIHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent
of $240 million to help finance the Guangdong Provincial Highway Project. The
loan would be at the Bank'. standard variable interest rate, with a maturity
of 20 years, including five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be
onlent to Guangdong Province for 20 years, including five years of grace, at a
rate equivalent to 90 percent of the rate payable to the Bank by the Borrower
with a 0.75 percent per annum commitment fee on the outstanding balance.
Guangdong Province would bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Backaround.  Guangdong Province has a population of 63 million and a
land area of about 170,000 km'. While the province lacks raw materials and
energy sources, its proximity to Hong Kong, entrepreneurial propensities, and
extensive ties with overseas Chinese, combined with having three of the five
Special Economic Zones of Southern China--Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou--have
placed Guangdong at the cutting edge of the national cxport-led development
strategy, enabling it to supplant Shanghai as China's leading export center.
Annual growth in provincial gross output value of industry and agriculture has
averaged nearly 20 percent per year since 1980, and recent data indicate no
slackening in this pace. However, the growth has not been evanly distributed:
the central Pearl River Delta has benefited most and the more remote eastern,
western and inland regions have gained much less.
3.       Rapid development has put considerable pressure on the transport
system. To address transport issues in a systematic manner, the Bank collabo-
rated with central sad provincial agencies on the Guangdong Province Compre-
hensive Transport Study, which looked at the role and relative priorities of
all modes of transport in the province. A major conclusion from the study was
that the role of the highway sector must be expanded in order to satisfy the
burgeoning demand for faster, more flexible transport stemmir_, from the growth
of exports and light industry, and associated with rising incomes.
4.        The Eighth live-Year Plan '1991-95) for the province puts consid-
erable emphasis on highway development, wbich is set within the context of a
20-year highway development program. An important objective is to open up the
less developed eastern and western regions by upgrading existing highways in
the regions, and by constructing nem highway. linking them to the prosperous
Pearl River Delta region. Specific projects in this latter category include
the Poshan-Kaiping and Longgang-Tanxi Highways. In 1990, a nationwide highway
screening exercise carried out jointly by the Government and the Bank con-
cluded that these two highways were among the highest priority of projects
screened in terms of the expected economic internal and first year rates of
return. The two highways, together with support of the province-wide road
network upgrading program, form the main infrastructure components of this project.



-2-
5.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Onerations. China's highway
sector has received about $788 million in Bank Group financing under seven
projects. These projects provide for the construction of high-quality
national and provincial roads totalling about 1,276 km, and the expansion and
improvement of some 3,250 km of rural roads and major bridges. The projects
also provide foreign technical assistance and training of Chinese personnel in
highway-related areas and support studies on key issues of highway development
auch as pavement management and methods of financing the expansion, improve-
ment, and rehabilitation of the road network.
6.        Thr. first of these projects (Loan 2539-CHAICredit 1594-CMA) was
completed in mid-1991 and a Project Completion Report was issued June 29,
1992. The project clearly demonstrated the benefits accruing from improved
accessibility to communities deprived of adequate transport infrastructure in
economically less developed regions. The main lessons drawn from the project
include the need to complete engineering design during project preparation and
to more carefully matc1' the Borrower's requirements with the technical assis-
tance selected. With respect to tho ongoing provincial highway projects,
several major iasues have been identified. These include the relatively fre-
quent changes in design, insufficient experience of contractors leading to
slow start-up of contracts and poor overall planning and worksite mangagment.
These experiences were reflected in the design of the proposed project, which
devotes particular attention to: (a) the readiness and appropriateness of
design; (b) the criteria for the prequalification of contractors; (c) packag-
ing civil works into large packages to attract foreign contractors as well as _>
the larger Chinese contractors; and (d) the composition of tochnical assis-
tance components.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank Group's assistance strat-
egy for China involves support for implementing economic reforms, modernizing
and rationalizing productive sectors, and developing infrastructure. Specifi-
cally in the transport field, assistance focusses on eliminating bottlenecks
in the transport system, improving rural infrastructure, reform of transport
finanoes and operations, and promoting modal interaction.  The proposed proj-
ect is consistent with these assistance strategy objectives. Although China
has a fundamentally sound approach to highway development, it still lacks
experience in the construction of high class, limited-access, highways which
are needed to eliminate bottlenecks in economically more developed corridors,
and would also benefit from technological improvements in the construction of
lower-level roads. The Bank's assistance in these areas is well placed, par-
ticularly when combined with its catalytic role In promoting greater invest-
ment for rural infrastructure, as well as policy changes, Institutional devel-
opment and technology transfer.
S.        Proiect Obiectives. The project has the following objectives: (a)
to relieve congestion in two major traffic corridors by constructing highways
on new alignments to serve long-distance traffic and leaving the existing road
to carry local traffic, including bicycles and agricultural vehicles; (b) to
improve other national and provincial roads carrying substantial volumes of
traffic; (c) to promote the transfer of highway technology through training
and the provision of equipment; (d) to further develop institutional
capability in highway design, planning and prioritisation; and (e) to support
reforms of the highway financing systm.



-3-
9.        Proiect Desceiction.  The project includess  (a) construction on new
alignments of the four-lane divided, access controlled, Foshan-Kaiping Highway
(80 km) and Longgang-Tanxi Highway (146 km); (b) a Road Improvement Program
(RIP) for upgrading and rehabilitation of about 1,260 km of provincial sad
national roadst (c) consultant services for construction supervision of the
two highways; (d) technical assistance to support the analysis of highway
fioances in Guangdong Province and to formulate an action program for imple-
muting reformat (e) a road safety pilot project; (f) further development of
the Road Data Bank and Pavement Management System; (g) purchase of equipment
for road laboratories, environmental protection, road research, the Road Data
Bank, the Ptvament Xanagement System, road maintenance and highway operations;
and (h) staff training.
10.       Prolect Im1lementation.  The proposed project would be carried out
by Guangdong Province. The project cost is estimated at $795.1 million equiv-
alent, with a foreign exchange component of $300.0 million equivalent (38 per-
cent) and identifiable taxes and duties estimated at about $15 million equiva-
lent. The Bank would finance $240.0-million equivalent (80 percent) of the
foreign exchange and 30 percent of the total cost. The costs and financiug
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and dis-
bursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A time-
table of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations
in the People's Republic of China are given in Schedules C and D, respec-
tively. Two maps (IBID 24225, 23927) are also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 10799-CIA, dated October 20, 1992, is being distributed separately.
11.       Proiect Sustainabilitv.  The sustainability of highway projects is
closely linked to maintenance and pavement strengthening policies; China gen-
erally has a good past record in this respect. Because higher traffic volumes
and heavier vehicles are likely to stretch current pavement management tech-
niques, the RIP component has been planned to strengthen the capability of the
province to anticipate and program highway maintenance and pavement
strengthening. The two new highways will be important links in the Ministry
of Communications (HOC) network of high class highways for China, and as such
are likely to receive priority attention. With anticipated traffic growth,
they are both expected to generate significant revenues through user tolls.
The proposed highway funding component should provide guidance, both to the
province and to the country, on practical ways to finance highway operations
and investment, tbus also contributing to project sustainability.
12.      utrged Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Borrower regarding (i) the arrangements for the proceeds of the loan to be
onlent to Guangdong Province, and (ii) the conditions of disbursement for the
RIP component. Assurances were also obtained from the Guangdong Province
concerning: (a) the completion of about 1,000 meters of highway at Xieben;
(b) criteria and procedures for selection of subprojects to be included in the
RIP, and the organizational arrangements and staffing for RIP; (c) the execu-
tion of Environmental Action Plans (RAPs) satisfactory to the Bank for all
project roads; (d) the resettlement of individuals affected under the project
in accordance with plans satisfactory to the Bank; (e) monitoring of the
effectivenss and socioeconomic impact of resettlement; (f) the preparation
and taking of appropriate steps to implement highway financing reforms;
(g) staffing levels and training for project supervision of the infrastructure



-4-
components; and (h) recommendations on appropriate level of toll charges for
the loshan-Raiping and Longgang-Tanxi Highways. Retrvactive financing of
$3.1 million is recommended for eligible expenditurea made after March 31,
1992, to test uncertain 8oil conditions and start construction in one road
section of the Longgang-Tanxi Highway, accelerate work on hd.hway financing,
and review bidding documents.
13.       Environmental Aspects.  An Environmental Assessment (EA) for the
Foshan-Kaiping Highway was prepared by the Shanghai Ship and Shipping Ressarch
Institute, and for the Longgang-Tanxi Highway by the Highway Scientific
Research Institute of HOC. The EAe indicate that the highways would not
adversely affect ecologically sensitive areas and, if appropriate actions are
taken, should not have an adverse impact on the environment. Based on the
EA's findings and discussions between representatives of Guangdong Province
and Bank staff, an RAP has been prepared which specifies the measures and
organizational and monitoring arrangements required to mitigate potential
adverse effects on the environment during the construction and operation of
the highways. The main measures, which have been included in the bid docu-
ments for contractors, relate to social disruption, air quality, noise con-
trol, water management and control of traffic, and the operation of quarries
and waste disposal.
14.      With respect to the RIP, since most of the works would be directed
to the upgrading of facilities and rehabilitation and maintenance, they are
not expected to have a significant impact on the enviroment. Nevertheless,
the potential adverse effect of each subproject on the environment would be
fully assessed, and UAs and RAPs would be prepared as appropriate.
15.      Resettlement Issues.  Land acquisition and resettlement is well
regulated in China, and the procedures and compensation requirements outlined
conform to the Bank's policies on involuntary resettlement. Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs) have been prepared for the Foshan-Raiping and Longgang-
Tanxi Highways by the Guangdong Provincial Highway Design Institute and the
Guangdong Provincial Freeway Company, respectively. The plans have been
reviewed by Bank staff and found to be satisfactory. The Foshan-Kaiping High-
way would affect approximately 8,040 people through permanent land acquisition
and 1,100 people through temporary land acquisition; a total of about 890
persons would require new housing. The Longgang-Tanxi Highway would affect
7,760 people through permanent land acquisition and 980 people through
temporary land acquisition; a total of about 1,740 persons would require new
housing. The land acquisition and resettlement procedures for the
upgrading/rehabilitation of the provincial/national roads would be the same as
for the two major highways, and RAPs would be prepared for all subprojects of
the RIP which involve resettlment.
16.       Prolect Benefits.  Primary benefits from road construction under the
project and the Road Improvement Program will be in the form of road user cost
savings resulting from lower vehicle operating costs and time savings due to
improved pavements and reduced travel distances along the new highway. Other
benefits will stem from reduced congestion on the existing roads, including
better conditions for bicycles and agricultural traffic, and accelerated
industrial and agricultural growth based on improved transport facilities.
While tolling of the highways will result in additional costs for construction

and operation of the tolling system, and a potential lose of benefits as some
operators opt to use untolled routes, appropriate toll levels should result in
limited traffic diversion and produce revenues sufficient to cover at least
the operating and maintenance costs. Additional benefits due to the RIP would
accrue from maintenance cost savings on the impr wed provincial/county road
network. The proper design of all highways included in the infrastructure
componeuts of the project should reduce the number of accidents, and the Road
Safety Pilot Program can also be expected to result in a reduced number of
accidents due to more road-safety-conscious designs. Technical assistance to
be provided under the project to help introduce a revised highway financing
system is also expected to improve maintenance of the province's highway
system through augmented funding, and this would be bolstered by project
support for further development of the Road Data Bank and Pavement Management
System, and by the procurement of road maintenance equipment. The estimated
economic return for the project is 30 percent.
17.       Risks.  Because of the difficult subsoil conditions along the align-
ment of the Foshan-Kaiping and Longgang-Tauxi Highways, the major risk is
delay in the completion of the highway and the quality of construction. To
counter this risk, two test embankments are being built in advance of the main
vorks to investigate the extent and method of soft soil treatments. Since the
Implementing agency for the two highways is a first-time executing agency for
a Bank project, there is also a risk in implementing the major highway compo-
nents of the project in a timely manner. However, the preparation of the
project was assisted by the Bank's experience in five previous provincial
highway projects, and by a more active involvement of the HOC then usual; this
enhanced role of the Ministry is expected to continue into future projects.
Tio minimize the riskss the project was designed with the assistance of foreign
experts, prequalification of contractors was made particularly stringent, and
supervision arrangements were carefully formulated to ensure regular monitor-
ing and effective quality control.
18.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the SDR.
In some cases. therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fully disbursed.
Cc) Not yet effective.
