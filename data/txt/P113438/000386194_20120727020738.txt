About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Food Crisis Response
Development Policy Grant (Trust Fund 92552), which was issued under the auspices of
the Global Food Crisis Response Program.

The grant was approved on August 13, 2008 and closed, as expected, on July 31, 2009.
The grant was for US$10.0 million. The funds were released in a single tranche on
August 21, 2008, a few days ahead of the expected date.

The report presents findings based on review of the Program Document, the
Implementation Completion and Results Report, aides-memoires and supervision reports,
and other relevant material. IEG visited Burundi in August-September 2011 to interview
government officials, the staff of partnership agencies, project staff, beneficiaries, and
donor representatives. The mission included trips to schools in Ngozi province that were
included in the school-feeding program supported by the operation. IEG extends its
thanks to the Bank office in Bujumbura for logistical support and help in organizing the
mission itinerary.

The assessment aims, first, to serve an accountability purpose by verifying whether the
operation achieved its intended outcome. Second, the report draws lessons that are
intended to inform future emergency response initiatives of this nature. Third, the
assessment will contribute to a forthcoming IEG study on the global food crisis response.

Following standard IEG procedures, the report was sent to the Government of Burundi
for comment, but no comments were received.

Summary
Under the auspices of the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), launched in
mid-2008, the Bank prepared a budget support operation for Burundi involving a grant of
US$10.0 million. This food crisis operation was predicated on the assumption that the
spikes in world commodity prices in 2007-2008 had a major bearing on the extent of
poverty and hunger in Burundi.

The objective of the operation was ―to help the Government of Burundi in reducing
hunger, preventing an increase in poverty and social unrest, and ensuring the fiscal
stability needed to foster medium-term social and economic development.‖ The actions
linked to the operation can be grouped into four policy areas, involving tax policy and
expanded safety nets to mitigate short-term impacts; agriculture policy to enhance long-
run food security; and policies to ensure fiscal stability in the medium term. In support of
these objectives, the government adopted a revised budget for 2008 on July 15, which
provided for: continued exemption of 13 food items from customs duties and domestic
transaction taxes; expansion of school feeding programs in primary schools in vulnerable
provinces; and the allocation of additional resources to address the threat of famine. The
US$10 million was disbursed in a single tranche on August 21.

The objectives of the grant operation were substantially relevant. In addressing both
short- and long-term causes of the food crisis (drought and price spikes in the short run,
declining agricultural productivity in the long run), they were aligned both with the
FY09-12 Country Assistance Strategy‘s specific concern about the short-run impact of
food price increases and with the government‘s National Agricultural Strategy and
National Food Security Program.

However, the operation‘s design was not sufficiently adapted to the Burundi food
security context, weakening the relevance of the actions to the intended outcomes. The
operation‘s logic was that without appropriate intervention, domestic food prices would
escalate, reducing food consumption by the poor, increasing hunger, throwing more
people into poverty, and increasing social unrest. Although there was a sound case for
the expansion of school feeding, there was little evidence for assuming that extending the
existing transaction tax exemption for 13 food staples would have an appreciable impact
on food price increases and thereby reduce hunger. The staples targeted were not by and
large imported, and taxes did not significantly influence their price. The choice of staples
to exempt from taxes was also not well targeted to food primarily consumed by the poor.

The objectives of reducing hunger and preventing an increase in poverty were modestly
achieved, and the operation‘s contribution to preventing social unrest is assessed as
negligible. There are no nutrition surveys on the basis of which trends in nutritional
intake or status could be tracked over the time period of the operation. Available
evidence suggests that the impact of the transaction tax exemption on hunger would be
low, because the taxes mainly applied to imports and the foods in question were not
significantly imported, a large share of rural households produce and consume the food
items, and several of the exempted foods were not much consumed by the poor. The
expansion of the school feeding program was delayed and yielded equivocal results. The
results of agriculture investments sponsored under the 2008 budget to increase
agricultural productivity are unclear. For the same reasons, it is unlikely that the tax
                                             x

exoneration measures prevented an increase in poverty. The share of government
spending described as ―pro-poor‖ was higher in the revised 2008 budget than before, but
the incidence of public spending (particularly the province-by-province impact) still
awaits comprehensive assessment in Burundi. Since the price of food staples appears
not to have been much affected, nor were hunger or poverty, it is unlikely that lack of
food price-related unrest in 2008-2009 was due to the food crisis operation. On the other
hand, measures to rationalize taxes helped ensure that the objective of fiscal stability was
substantially achieved.

Weighing the substantial relevance of objectives, the modest relevance of design, and
modest achievement of three of the four objectives, the outcome of the operation is
assessed as unsatisfactory. The risk to development outcome is rated as significant; the
progress made toward the fiscal stabilization objective will probably be sustained, but the
short-run actions appear to have had limited effect. Bank performance is rated as
moderately unsatisfactory, mainly due to weak project design. Although it prepared the
operation with great speed, the project logic was not convincing and the design was not
sufficiently informed by the local context Borrower performance is rated moderately
satisfactory because, in spite of overall solid government commitment (particularly to
fiscal stabilization), there were delays in implementing the school feeding program.

IEG draws three lessons:

   The choice of instruments and policy measures for an emergency food crisis
    intervention needs to take into account the local causes of poverty and hunger.
    Recent sector work emphasized that long-run constraints to agricultural productivity
    were the root of Burundi‘s ―food crisis‖. Framed as a short-term response to spikes in
    world commodity prices, the operation‘s design could not address the fundamental
    problem of low agricultural productivity.

   For budget support as for other operations, it is difficult to assess results in the
    absence of a clear framework setting out links between policy actions, outputs, and
    outcomes and of baseline measures of the outcomes against which progress can be
    measured. The food crisis grant operation for Burundi did not clearly specify the
    links between the various actions that were supported and the outcomes underpinning
    project objectives.

   Scaling up of safety nets is a common strategy in an emergency situation, but
    expanding a program to new areas may take time. In the case of Burundi, not all
    schools had the necessary infrastructure to support the feeding program, and local
    management had to be put in place in the new areas. There were significant delays
    due to funding arrangements. Together, this resulted in a 7-month delay in expanding
    the school feeding to vulnerable provinces.

1. Background
1.1    This report assesses the Burundi Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant
(―food crisis operation‖), one of a series of operations funded through the Global Food Crisis
Response Program (GFRP). The GFRP was launched by the World Bank in mid-2008 to
mitigate and help countries adapt to higher and more volatile commodity prices (World Bank
2008b).

more than half of the items in the market basket used to estimate the consumer price index.

1.2     Food prices spiked in Burundi‘s capital city in 2008 (Table 1). In a report issued in
June 2008, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ranked Burundi 9th out of 18 countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa most hard hit by the food and fuel price increases that year (IMF 2008).
Burundi also featured in the FAO list of countries requiring external assistance and the World
Food Program list of countries highly vulnerable to increased food and fuel prices (World
Bank 2008b).The IMF report focused on the balance of payments impact for these countries,
suggesting that the source of the problem was the surge in commodity prices on world
markets: higher prices for imports would drive up inflation in countries that were net
importers of food and fuel. But in some countries—including Burundi—high food prices
were driven as much or more by factors internal to the country, calling for a long-term
strategy to boost weak agriculture productivity.

1.3     Agricultural productivity growth in Burundi has stagnated.1 Average crop yields have
not increased since the late 1980s; and, over the same period, the productivity of farm
workers has fallen steadily (Figure 1). In contrast, in neighboring Rwanda (whose civil war
paralleled Burundi‘s), agriculture value added rose from US$179 to US$221 per farm worker
between 1989-91 and 2001-2003.2 Also, with 257 inhabitants per square kilometer, Burundi
exhibits one of Africa‘s highest population density rates. Farm property is fragmented and
lacking in secure tenure. Consumption of own production by farm households accounts for
nearly three quarters of the average rural household‘s income (Baghdadli, Harborne and
Rajadel 2008). The prevalence of mini-parcels reduces the scope for producing a marketable
surplus. The requirements for raising productivity over the long term are well recognized
(Box 1).

Box 1. Priorities for Agriculture in Burundi
―With food demand increasing at an annual rate of 3 to 6 percent, it is urgent to improve the contribution of the
subsistence crops and livestock subsectors. The potential for improvement is great, and beyond the need for
reforms that will benefit all sectors, improvements will require public investments to enhance productivity and
better market access. Necessary changes in the short-run include fostering the use of high quality seed and
fertilizer, and improving the management of small livestock. In the long run, research-extension links should be
strengthened, producer organizations should be encouraged and supported, and sustainable land and water
management practices should be promoted. Investments in infrastructure and market intelligence will need to
meet demands generated by the development of urban centers and foster competitiveness of Burundian
agricultural commodities relative to those from the region.‖

1.4     The long-term decline in productivity has been aggravated by recurrent drought. The
rains regularly fail in 6 out of the 9 livelihood zones that make up Burundi (USAID 2009).
Weak productivity is also partly caused by the continuing fallout from an insurgency that has
displaced farm workers and dislocated production. Theft of farm assets and products has
discouraged investment in agriculture. The civil war of 1993-2000 uprooted over one million
people and killed 250,000.3 Since the Arusha peace agreement was signed in 2000, progress
toward demobilizing armed groups and restoring security has been slow. The United Nations
High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that there are 204,419 refugees in

  Mainly because of the lingering insecurity, Burundi‘s economy has performed poorly relative to other post-
conflict countries. Rwanda and Sierra Leone averaged economic growth rates of over 10 percent per year in the
seven years after peace was restored; over the same period, Burundi averaged only 2.8 percent (Nielsen and
Madani 2010).
                                                      3


Burundi, with a further 253,508 displaced persons of Burundi origin now living outside the
borders—many of whom may be expected to return (UNHCR 2011).

1.5     Another factor complicates Burundi‘s access to an adequate food supply. The
country is landlocked, making it expensive to import food. From Bujumbura the nearest
large seaport is at Dar es Salaam on the Tanzanian coast, 1,430 km distant, with a minimum
drive time of 19 hours.4 Informed observers in Burundi told IEG that, in practice, trucks
spend 3-4 days on the road to Dar or Mombasa, Kenya (the other port); but the total time
from door to door may be as much as two weeks, given the delays at customs, road blocks
and time taken loading and unloading.

1.6     Because Burundi is landlocked, most food is locally sourced. In volume terms,
average annual imports of food staples equaled less than 1 percent of domestic output in
2007-2009 (Annex B, Table B3). Nevertheless, the food balance of trade has deteriorated.
Burundi moved from being a net exporter of food in the early 1990s to a net importer. In
current dollars, the food merchandise trade balance averaged US$43.1 million in 1993-1995
and negative US$6.4 million in 2008-2010 (IMF 2008).

1.7    There is another balance of payments consideration. In 2008, the IMF estimated that
the adverse impact on the balance of payments of rising food import prices in Burundi would
be overshadowed by the impact of higher prices for imported oil: the trade balance change
was equivalent to negative 0.4 percent of GDP for food and negative 3.9 percent for oil (IMF
2008). Given the distance of Burundi from Indian Ocean ports in Kenya and Tanzania, it was
expected that rising diesel prices would significantly push up the price of imported goods.

1.8     Burundi‘s score on the Global Hunger Index—a composite measure of calorie
deficiency and the stunting and mortality of children aged less than 5 years—has worsened
since 1990 (Annex B, Table B1 presents Index values and explains how they were derived).5
Citing World Food Programme data, in 2008 the Bank reported that 82 percent of households
survive on between 1400 and 1900 kilocalories per day, against the 2,100 kilocalories that
are required to live a normal and healthy life (World Bank 2008d). Caloric intake varies by
location. The share of the population with a very low caloric intake is twice as large in rural
compared to urban areas. In the northern region of the country, almost one-half of the
population has a daily caloric intake of 1,400 kcal per person. In the south, less than one-fifth
of the population lives in a household with a very low caloric intake.

1.9     There has been slow progress in reducing poverty. Even with high levels of external
assistance—mainly composed of grants, collectively comprising an average of 21 percent of
GDP in 2006-2008—Burundi will not meet the 2015 Millennium Development Goal of
reducing poverty by half relative to the 2000 baseline (World Bank 2008c). The share of the
population living on less than US$1.25 per day has only inched downwards—dropping from

 ―Of the 119 developing countries for which the Global Hunger Index has been calculated, Burundi ranks last.‖
(Baghdadli, Harborne and Rajadel 2008).

86 percent in 1998 to 81 percent in 2006.6 In 2000-2008, 39 percent of children under age 5
suffered from malnutrition.

1.10 The pattern of development assistance to Burundi evolved during the 2000s. Between
2001 and 2007, emergency and humanitarian interventions (mainly food aid) accounted for
41 percent of all donor commitments.7 After 2005, as security in Burundi improved, these
types of aid declined as a proportion of the whole, while aid mapped more closely to long-
term growth objectives—including education, health, water supply and sanitation and
macroeconomic reform—increased proportionately in importance (World Bank 2011a).
Between 2004 and 2008, combined commitments for agriculture and rural development from
three agencies (including the Bank) amounted to US$78.6 million.8

1.11 The Bank launched several budget support operations, predicated on a comprehensive
package of policy reforms, including in some cases agricultural reforms. Between 2005 and
2010 budget support geared to macroeconomic reform amounted to a total commitment of
US$881 million (Annex B, Table B4). Development policy operations supported by the
Bank included measures to increase the efficiency of the agricultural export sectors—
principally, through privatization—but did not address the low productivity and limited
access to input and output markets of the majority of smallholders producing food staples.
These problems were tackled by the FY2005 Agriculture Rehabilitation and Sustainable
Land Management Project, and later through the FY2010 Agro-Pastoral productivity and
Markets Development Project (Table 2).


2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
2.9     According to the Program Document, ―The objective of the proposed Grant is to help
the Government of Burundi in reducing hunger, preventing an increase in poverty and social
unrest, and ensuring the fiscal stability needed to foster medium-term social and economic
development. The supported policy measures include suspension of custom duties and taxes
on basic food items and expansion of food aid, social assistance and related programs‖
(World Bank 2008d).9

 Excluding projects under US$10 million, three operations were financed: African Development Bank,
Watershed Management Project (2006, US$13.5 million); International Fund for Agricultural Development,
Livestock Sector Rehabilitation Project (2007, US$14.0 million); and World Bank, Agriculture Rehabilitation
and Sustainable Land Management Project (2004, US$51.1 million). (Source: AidData database, January 2011;

  The main text of the Program Document lists these four outcomes in the statement of objectives, while the
Actions Matrix that is annexed to the same document lists an ―overall objective‖ to ―mitigate the impact of the
rising food prices on the poor and vulnerable‖ and mentions only two of the four outcomes, worded differently.

Relevance of Project Objectives
2.10 The food crisis operation was relevant to the Bank‘s corporate strategy in response to
the 2008 spike in world commodity prices. At the 2008 Spring Meetings of the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund, Governors made clear that they considered alleviating the
short run welfare impacts of spiking food prices, and helping to ensure that countries could
be better prepared to cope with similar future crises, top priorities for World Bank Group
assistance (World Bank 2008b). The objectives of the Global Food Crisis Response Program
(GFRP) were to:

        Reduce the negative impacts of high and volatile food prices on the lives of the poor
         in a timely manner;
                                                       6


        Support governments in the design of sustainable policies that mitigate the adverse
         impacts of high and more volatile food prices on poverty; and
        Support broad based growth in productivity and market participation in agriculture to
         ensure an adequate supply response as part of a sustained improvement in food
         supply (World Bank 2008b).

2.11 The objectives of the grant operation were also in line with the FY2009-2012 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS, approved in July 2008), which emphasized policy-based budget
support operations, broad-based economic growth and increasing the access of the poor to
social services. The CAS discussed the effects of the rapid increase in food and fuel prices
since December 2007, noted that Burundi was one of fourteen hardest-hit countries in sub-
Saharan Africa by the recent increases in international prices (World Bank 2008b). The CAS
also observed that between December 2007 and April 2008, prices of basic staples rose on
average by 23 percent, threatening to exacerbate malnutrition and poverty, and calling for
financing of an additional US$15 million (about 1.5 percent of GDP) to offset budgetary
costs related to food and fuel price increases. The CAS further indicated that the government
had requested an increase in IDA budget support, noting that discussions were underway
about possible financing under the Global Food Crisis Response Program Trust Fund. The
objectives of the grant operation were also consistent with the strategy of the government of
Burundi, as contained in its National Agricultural Strategy of 2008 and the National Food
Security Program.

The relevance of objectives is rated substantial. Design
2.12 The operation was in the form of a development policy grant of US$10 million,
disbursed in a single tranche. The Program Document does not present specific policy areas
– groupings of actions to be taken before or during the life of the operation to achieve the
objectives – but they can be inferred from the Actions Matrix of the Program Document and
the government‘s Letter of Development Policy that highlights the actions linked to the food
crisis response within the revised fiscal year 2008 budget law (Annex B, Box B1 of this
report). These sources are inconsistent in their description of the operation‘s policy areas and
actions, complicating the retrofitting exercise that IEG was obliged to resort to (Table 3).
Four policy areas are construed—three of them associated with the objectives of reduced
hunger, preventing and increase in poverty, and an increase in social unrest, and the last
associated with ensuring fiscal stability for medium-term growth.10 The objectives were
appropriately articulated in terms of outcomes –reduction of hunger, preventing an increase
in poverty and social unrest, and fiscal stability – but the Program Document did not propose
specific outcome indicators.




10
  As is evident in Table 3, the Program Document lacks clarity on the policy areas and actions linked to the
operation. The Action Matrix lists only three actions, while the letter of development policy and some of the
main text of the Program Document point to additional measures included in the program.

2.13 The food crisis operation adopted interventions from a list of indicative interventions
supported by the Bank‘s Global Food Crisis Response Program (Box 2). The selected
interventions in the case of Burundi corresponded to approaches (i), (ii), and (v). Approach
(i) made sense because there was an existing school feeding program that could be expanded.
Also, targeting was sound: the three provinces included in the program were among the
poorest in Burundi and two were affected by drought. Approach (ii) was also, in principle,
valid, because it enabled the Bank to swiftly offset foregone revenue to the government, by
extending the exoneration of the transaction tax on key staples and reducing diesel taxes.

Approach (v) acknowledged that weak agricultural productivity was the longer-term
constraint that needed addressing; other projects complemented the food crisis operation by
seeking to boost productivity.

Box 2. Options Available under the Global Food Crisis Response Program
In the GFRP Framework Document, the following was proposed as an ―indicative but non-exhaustive‖ list of
the interventions that were eligible for support under the program:
―(i) Enhancing household food security by strengthening targeted safety nets and maternal and child health
and nutrition services and improving both availability of food and the ability of vulnerable groups to buy food.
Interventions might include cash transfer programs, self-targeted public works or feeding programs, provision
of subsidized food to poor households, and so forth. The Bank could also provide emergency financing for food
imports. These interventions could be financed through development policy operations, rapid response
investment lending, or a combination of the two.
(ii) Lowering domestic food prices in the short term. This includes financing the revenue losses to the budget
associated with lowering or removing import tariffs, removal of government monopolies over the import or
procurement of grains, and so forth.
(iii) Stabilizing highly volatile food prices and assisting governments to make better use of risk management
instruments in dealing with food price unpredictability. The Bank would also provide financing and risk
management tools and technical assistance with risk mitigation and commodity market hedging products.
(iv) Enhancing the consistency between emergency price policy measures and longer term measures required
for lasting solutions. This includes funding for rapid assessments, improved communications strategies and
removing policy distortions related to food pricing.
(v) Enhancing long-term food security by helping ensure that short-term supply responses are consistent with
and can transition to sustainable medium and longer-term responses to the changing world food situation. Thus,
by way of example, the GFRP might finance the immediate import and distribution of seeds and fertilizer. It
would also prepare the groundwork for longer term funding of technology dissemination and extension
programs, investment in irrigation rehabilitation and improved logistics (e.g., storage, handling, transport, other
infrastructure).‖

Relevance of the Project Design
2.14 The choice of a budget support operation made sense because it was quick, flexible,
and cost little to administer. Given the need for a rapid response, it was appropriate that
release of the grant was not made contingent on government completion of a wide range of
prior actions. The design specified the general areas that needed to be included in the revised
budget but it left the government considerable flexibility over the precise allocation of the
funds.

2.15 The project logic was not clearly spelled out in the Program Document but may be
construed as follows: without appropriate intervention, domestic food prices would escalate,
reducing food consumption by the poor, increasing hunger, throwing more people into
poverty, and increasing social unrest. A consolidated results framework was missing from the
design and legal documents, but the activities variously described in them can be grouped
into policy areas to address the objectives in the short run, through tax policy and expanded
safety nets, and in the medium-to-long run through agriculture policies and measures to
ensure fiscal stability (Table 3).
                                                          9


2.16 While the policy areas and actions make sense in principle, the relevance of the
proposed actions to achieving the outcomes in Burundi was modest at best, where most food
staples are locally produced and consumed and the main causes of hunger are of a more
chronic nature.

2.17 It was assumed that the transaction taxes on food and fuel imports – if restored --
would have an important impact on local food prices, particularly foods consumed by the
poor. But while the thirteen tax-exempt staples are often consumed by the poor in Burundi,
they are not commonly imported: imports of these staples individually accounted, in volume
terms, for less than 1 percent of average domestic output in 2007-2009 (Annex B, Table B3).
Beyond this, ninety-seven percent of the poor in Burundi live in rural areas (World Bank
2008a). The rural poor do not, by and large, consume imported food.11 A very large share of
many of the staples exempted from the transaction tax – beans, banana, sweet potatoes,
cassava (manioc), and maize – are both produced and consumed by rural households (Figure
2).

2.18 The choice of tax-exonerated staples was also not well targeted to foods primarily
consumed by the poor and included several items primarily consumed by the non-poor. The
2006 expenditure survey shows, at one extreme, that the poorest 60 percent of households are
more likely to consume maize, cassava flour, beans, and bananas (Table 4). At the other
extreme, only 11 percent of consumption expenditure on meat was by the poorest and 71
percent was purchased by the highest quintile households.

Note: According to estimates in World Bank 2008f, about two-thirds of the population fell below the poverty line. Therefore, the share of
expenditure corresponding to the bottom three quintiles approximates the proportion of spending on each food that is accounted for by
the poor.


2.19 Analytic work by the Bank in 2008 provided a sound base for concluding that
Burundi‘s food crisis was more the result of long-term constraints internal to the country than
short-term spikes in world commodity prices (Baghdadli, Harborne and Rajadel 2008). This
reduced the appropriateness of a crisis intervention. However, the food crisis operation was
embedded in a broader program that did address the longer-term problems. Through the
complement provided to this broader program, some progress could be made toward the
objectives of food crisis operation to reduce hunger —how much would be impossible to
assess.

2.20       The relevance of design is rated modest.


3. Implementation
3.1     Annex B contains a timeline for the operation, the most salient points from which
follow. The operation concept was reviewed on July 25, 2008 and preparation was swift, the
government signing a Letter of Development Policy that set out the broader program of crisis
response on July 30, as well as the Grant Agreement. The US$10 million was disbursed in a
single tranche on August 21. A revised 2008 budget had been approved on July 15, taking
into account the fiscal effects of a continued suspension of customs duties and domestic
transaction taxes on 13 food products (a measure that was expected to remain in force until
December 31, 2008). Two supervision reports were filed by the Bank, the first on May 15,
2009 and the final one on July 30, 2009, a day before the operation closed. An internal
review of the completion report was carried out at a meeting on January 19, 2010 and the
final version of the report was issued on January 31.

3.2    The main implementation challenge was to ensure a smooth expansion of the school
feeding program. There were delays and inconsistencies throughout. The government set up a
Steering/Monitoring Committee to oversee program expansion two months after the Grant
                                              11


Agreement was signed, by which time the 2008/09 school year had already begun. The
following month (October) the Steering Committee identified the three provinces (Muyinga,
Ngozi and Kayanza) where schools would be added, based on the consideration that these
were poor, densely-populated areas with a large target population, located in northern areas
prone to famine. (The selection principles were based on the approach already applied by the
World Food Program in Muyinga.) On October 4, the government and the WFP signed a
Memorandum of Understanding that set out the terms of the expansion. On October 16,
government and WFP officials organized orientation seminars for members of the
Steering/Monitoring Committee, participants including provincial education directors and
school inspectors.

3.3     On November 20, 2008 the government transferred the funds for school feeding
expansion to the World Food Program. The amount transferred was US$2.4 million,
someway short of the US$3.0 million that government had committed to transfer to WFP,
both in the Letter of Development Policy and in a Memorandum of Understanding signed on
October 4. The Ministry of Finance said this was not a shortfall because the revised 2008
budget (which the grant had endorsed ex post) specified that the transfer would be for F Bu
3,000 million, without any reference to a dollar amount. The Bank judged that the reduced
dollar value of the government‘s contribution to school feeding did not breach the Grant
Agreement because the agreement did not specify how much should be allocated to each
measure and, in any event, the government‘s overall spending on the food crisis was much
larger than the grant amount (World Bank 2010).

3.4     Nevertheless, the funding shortfall hampered cooperation between the government
and the WFP. Transfer of the reduced amount was made in November 2008. On December
18 the government requested WFP to begin the revised program. But startup was further
delayed until March 2009. WFP had to confirm that the schools identified by the authorities
had the required infrastructure. The agency also needed time to train inventory managers.
Start up was preceded in February 2009 by the launch of an information campaign in 12
communes and the establishment of management committees with parent, teacher and
student representatives. In June 2009, the school feeding cycle for that year was concluded,
having run for just 55 of the 190 days in the school year. Shortly before the grant closed the
government signed an amendment to its memorandum of understanding with WFP, allowing
for transfer in the 2009/10 school year of the 2008 shortfall, in addition to the 2009 budget
allocation.

3.5    The grant operation closed on July 31, 2010.


4. Achievement of the Objectives
Reduce hunger
4.1    At the heart of the operation‘s theory was that in the absence of intervention, higher
food prices would reduce food consumption by the poor, increasing hunger. The short-run
interventions to address the potential impacts on hunger involved extension of tax
exemptions, in place since 2005, and expanded social safety nets in the form of school
                                                       12


feeding and other short-term support. The operation also supported agricultural interventions
aimed to increase food production, reducing chronic hunger.

4.2      There are no nutrition surveys that enable an assessment of the extent to which
hunger was reduced as a consequence of the food crisis grant operation. Two Demographic
and Health Surveys, conducted in 1997 and 2010, are too far apart to shed light on possible
impact from the grant operation. The United Nations Children‘s Fund conducted multiple
indicator cluster surveys in 2001 and 2005; both fall outside the period of the grant operation
and the 2005 survey used different indicators from the 2010 Demographic and Health Survey
and is not comparable. The 2006 household welfare survey12 is also not comparable to the
other surveys. Thus, the assessment of the efficacy of the operations rests largely on
understanding the plausible links between the actions and hunger and the magnitude of any
effects.

4.3     The transaction tax on the 13 staples was not reinstated for the life of the operation.
Tariffs on imported diesel (the price of which was reflected in the price of imported foods)
were cut from 12 percent to 9 percent in April 2008. Also, the 17 percent transaction tax on
diesel was suspended until the end of 2008. Countervailing measures were applied to
imported gasoline, which fuels private cars rather than goods vehicles or buses: tariffs on
gasoline imports were raised from 12 percent to 16 percent.

4.4     Although the overall food price index leapt up in 2008 (Table 1), in the period before
and after approval of the food crisis operation, the price trend of the tax-exempt foods that
were staples for the poor (and were mainly produced in Burundi) was not at all uniform. In
the provinces, there was a price spike for sweet potato and banana in the last quarter of 2007
(Annex B, Figure B1). But in the same marketplaces over the same period, prices for
cassava flour, maize and beans were relatively stable. Paradoxically, in the capital,
Bujumbura, the price of banana (and also maize) actually fell in late 2007.

4.5      It can be argued that the domestic price of the 13 staple foods would nonetheless have
been higher had the transaction tax been reinstated. However, available evidence suggests
that the impact on hunger would be quite low for the reasons cited in the discussion of the
relevance of the operation‘s design: the taxes mainly applied to imports and the foods in
question were not significantly imported; a large share of rural households actually produce
and consume these staples; the predominance of local sourcing meant that fuel taxes
incurred through long-distance transport were probably not significant; and some of the
exempted foods were not much consumed by the poor so a rise in their price would have
little impact.13 While the transaction taxes on the staples remained suppressed for the life of
the operation, in July 2009 the government introduced a value added tax (VAT) of 18

13
  Regressions of monthly local food prices for bananas and maize in three locales—Bujumbura, Muyinga (in
the north), and Ruyigi (in the east)—on contemporaneous international banana and maize prices were run for
the period September 2005-May 2011. In only one of the six regressions was there a statistically significant
correlation between international food prices and local food prices—the price of bananas in Muyinga. These
results highlight the fact that the prices of locally grown food are affected by a number of local factors.
                                                    13


percent, replacing the 17 percent transaction tax. The relatively low impact of the VAT on
prices of most staples in provincial markets is readily apparent (Annex B, Figure B1, panel
a). The exception is the price of maize, which had a similar trajectory in both the provincial
markets and Bujumbura and historically exhibited erratic behavior, likely driven by some
other external factor.

4.6     The school feeding program had greater potential for reducing hunger in the short
run. The program was regionally well targeted. Poverty incidence in the three provinces
selected was as follows: Kayanza, 76 percent; Muyinga, 71 percent; and Ngozi, 75 percent.
This was higher than the national average (67 percent).

4.7     According to the Program Document the aim was to deliver 120,000 hot meals per
day to 60 schools in three northern provinces, assuming that each school would average
2,000 pupils (World Bank 2008d: Annex 7). The 60 schools were intended to be additional to
the 269 primary schools nationwide that were already covered by the World Food Program
(WFP). The target for the number of schools was exceeded (106 schools were covered) but
fewer than expected meals were supplied each day (around 82,000) because schools were
smaller than projected (averaging 770 pupils) (Annex B, Table B5). During the selection
process, school principals and local inspectors overestimated pupil numbers and tended to
favor rural schools with low enrollment rates.

4.8     In the 2008-2009 school year, the government transferred to WFP the equivalent of
US$2.4 million. The aim was to provide feeding for 190 days per year. But because of the
delayed start up—feeding did not start until March 2009—the program ran for only 81 days.
Around US$0.5 million of the 2008-2009 allocation was carried forward to the following
school year, where it was complemented by fresh funds from the government budget of
around US$4.4 million equivalent. The funds were transferred to WFP in September and
November 2009 and the new program started in October 2009. With the combined funding
for 2009-2010, 143 schools were covered, receiving around 145,000 meals per day (Annex
B, Table B5).

4.9     Thus, for the three provinces as a whole, a 96 percent increase in the budget between
2008-2009 and 2009-2010, translated into coverage of 35 percent more schools and delivery
of 68 percent more meals per day. This average masks major discrepancies between Ngozi
and Muyinga provinces, on the one hand, (where the total number of meals served more than
doubled relative to the previous year, with 153 days of feeding), and Kayanza province on
the other (where total meals served remained flat and days of feeding was lower on average
than in the previous year, ranging from 19 to 123 depending on the commune in which the
school was located).14



14
  IEG was unable to find out why performance in Kayanza dropped relative to the other two provinces. In the
Kabarore commune of Kayanza the data are particularly perplexing, showing that between 2008-2009 and
2009-2010, the number of schools served remained unchanged (10) and the number of meals per day more than
doubled, but the days of feeding went down from 81 to 19. This might indicate that there was a massive
increase in enrollment between the two years (from roughly 600 to 1500 pupils per school) which was not
matched by a comparable adjustment of the feeding program. However, of the eight schools listed that
                                                       14


4.10 School principals interviewed by IEG said the feeding program was effective overall;
but they made several recommendations about how to improve it (Box 3). Interviewees from
donor organizations reported that in general the feeding program was well run and there was
no recent evidence that supplies had been misappropriated, suggesting that the oversight of
the school management committees was effective.
Box 3. The School Feeding Program
IEG visited three primary schools in Ngozi province that had been included in the extension of the school
feeding program (Busiga I, Mihigo, and Mushitsi I) and, in each case, interviewed the principal. (Teachers,
students and parents were not available because the 2011/2012 school year had not yet started.)

More or less the same story emerged at each school. The School Management Committees set up by the
World Food Program (WFP) were operating at each school, headed by a parent representative. The daily
ration consisted of vegetable oil, maize flour, beans, peas and salt. These supplies were delivered direct to
the school and the steering committee (comprising headmasters, parents and pupils) managed the
preparation of hot meals and distribution to students. Parents took it in turns to prepare meals. The
infrastructure was rudimentary but adequate: at each school there was a locked store room, equipped with
measuring scales, kitchen utensils and feeding bowls; a covered, open-air kitchen served for food
preparation; some schools had gardens where vegetables could be grown to supplement the WFP rations.
The inventory was checked at least once each quarter by the WFP. There were no reports of supplies being
misappropriated. (External observers of the program interviewed by IEG said that there had been scattered
cases of pilfering at the outset; but the solidarity among Committee members had helped to stamp this out.)

The three principals each said that the feeding program had helped encourage parents to enroll their
children, as well as helping to lower dropout rates and raise completion rates. However, there was room for
improvement in the running of the program. The delivery of supplies by WFP was somewhat erratic, with
little or no notice given of when trucks would turn up at the school. The rations were insufficient in
quantity and variety, and some of the food supplied (locally-sourced beans, in particular) were of poor
quality. Following the one day of training organized by WFP, the contact between the Committees and
WFP was limited to inspections and so far WFP had made no attempt to organize roundtables with
Committee members to discuss ways of improving the program.

4.11 There are no data available for estimating the impact of the 2008-2009 school feeding
programs on pupils‘ nutrition. There is some evidence that an earlier WFP school feeding
program improved caloric intake. Based on a 2006 household welfare survey, the Bank
estimated the impact of the World Food Program‘s 2005 school feeding program, showing
that beneficiaries received added nourishment in the range of 229-612 calories per day
relative to non-beneficiaries (see Annex B, Table B2 of this report for further details). On the
other hand, although performing better than other public transfer programs, school feeding by
the World Food Program was not well targeted to the poor (Baghdadli, Harborne, and
Rajadel 2008).

4.12 A third step toward the objective entailed additional spending aimed to increase
food production in Burundi. Several parallel initiatives pushed in this direction and it is not

participated in the feeding program, Kabarore had a much lower (indeed, relatively negligible) increase in
enrollment.
                                               15


possible to isolate the difference made by the food crisis grant. The national strategy for
agriculture that government began to implement in 2008 included policies seeking to increase
productivity through increased use of inputs, better water management and soil conservation.
The Bank-supported FY2005 Agriculture Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land Management
Project pushed in the same direction. The Bank reported in 2011 that a government program
to strengthen the private sector–led distribution of fertilizer had been successful; and that
agriculture policy reforms had raised per capita agricultural income by 5.6 percent from 2006
to 2007 and by 8.0 percent from 2007 to 2008 (World Bank 2011a).

4.13 The revised 2008 budget included the following incremental amounts: F Bu 2.0
billion to cover food and subsistence cost of school boarders; F Bu 1.0 billion to build up a
strategic stock of fertilizer; F Bu 2.8 billion to rehabilitate the Imbo irrigation system; and F
Bu 4.4 billion to finance food and clothing for police and military personnel. Most of the
spending programmed under the revised 2008 budget was carried out. The Ministry of
National Solidarity, which implements the humanitarian relief program, spent 98 percent of
the budget allocated to it for 2008. A similar rate of execution (97 percent) was reported for
the Ministry of Agriculture which was responsible for the fertilizer purchase and irrigation
rehabilitation initiatives. The program supported by the grant helped address relief for famine
following the drought in the Northern provinces in 2007-2008, as well as contributing to the
ex-refugees support program. With the aid of grant funding, 96,000 refugees were fed in late
2008. IEG was unable to obtain information on the other outputs generated with the spending
pledged in the government‘s letter of development policy. Nor could any reports be found
describing the results of this spending.

4.14 In summary, the likely impact of exoneration of the transaction tax on food prices and
hunger, especially among the rural poor, is likely quite small. It is plausible that the support
to temporarily expand the school feeding program and other relevant expenditures, the food
crisis operation helped to reduce hunger to some extent, though perhaps not as a result of the
international food price crisis, since most locally grown staples were relatively unaffected.
The results of agriculture investments sponsored under the 2008 budget to reduce hunger
over the longer term are not yet apparent. Therefore, IEG rates achievement of the objective
to reduce hunger as modest.

Prevent an increase in poverty
4.15 In the absence of the relevant household expenditure surveys it is impossible to assess
poverty trends during and after the period of the food crisis grant operation, or to establish
attribution. Given that the causal chain runs from food price hikes to poverty (just as it runs
from food price hikes to hunger) and that the transaction tax exoneration probably had little
impact on the price of staples, it can be inferred that the tax exoneration measures also likely
had little impact on preventing an increase in poverty.

4.16 The expansion of the school feeding program as part of the operation may indirectly
contribute to reducing poverty in the distant future. IEG found some evidence that, in the
school year 2008-2009, admission to the first grade improved in the provinces where school
feeding was carried out under project auspices. The Program Document posited a link
between school feeding and school admission (World Bank 2008d). The school feeding
                                                                    16


program was expected to encourage parents to send their children to primary schools, with
girls being among the principal beneficiaries (World Bank 2010). Between school years
2008-09 and 2009-10, in the three provinces included in the school feeding program, there
was a sharp increase in the net primary school admission rate for girls (Figure 3)15. On the
other hand, the same upturn was observed Burundi-wide; and not all the provinces in the
nation benefited from school feeding. In any event, it would be unreasonable to expect a
small grant operation with a short-term focus to lead to a sustained improvement in education
outcomes; it could not be expected to influence dropout rates and completion rates.

4.17 Government spending has moved in a direction consistent with tackling poverty. With
the massive increase in grant funding from the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative and
other sources, the government increased spending on economic and social sectors from 4.8
percent of GDP in 2001 to 12.4 percent on average in 2006–08. This increase was mainly
driven by education spending. A recent public expenditure analysis prepared under the
auspices of the poverty reduction budget support program showed an increase in the share of
government spending that was described as ―pro-poor‖—including spending on education,
health and social protection (Figure 4). Taking government spending as a whole, the pro-poor
share rose from an average of 45 percent in the two years before the grant operation to 49
percent in 2008, 52 percent in 2009, and 56 percent in 2010; it was projected to reach 58
percent in 2011. However, these trends cannot be attributed to particular measures in the
revised 2008 budget that the food crisis operation supported.

  The upturn in admissions between school years 2004-5 and 2006-7 reflects a 2005 government policy to
abolish primary school fees.
                                                                    17


4.18 Trends in spending underpinned by the revised 2008 budget that the food crisis grant
supported do not furnish clear evidence that the objective of preventing an increase in
poverty was achieved. The data gaps in Burundi have so far impeded attempts to assess the
incidence of spending with any accuracy. The 2008 public expenditure review was unable to
show whether budget funds were targeted towards provinces with high levels of poverty:
―Burundi‘s highly centralized budget management system and lack of geographical budget
data make it virtually impossible to identify the regional distribution of public expenditure‖
(World Bank 2008c, p. 44) Improved primary school admissions facilitated by school
feeding may potentially have helped to reduce poverty in the longer run; but, as noted in the
previous paragraph, the evidence is equivocal. The exemption of the 13 staples from
transactions taxes likely had little if any impact on poverty. Therefore, attainment of the
objective of preventing an increase in poverty is rated modest.

Prevent an increase in social unrest
4.19 The project logic suggested that social unrest could be triggered by high food prices,
hunger, and increased poverty due to both. Since the price of food staples appears not to
have been much affected, nor were hunger or poverty, it is unlikely that lack of food-crisis
related unrest in 2008-2009 was due to the food crisis operation. Measures underway before
the food crisis operation was approved (and not contemplated in the project results
framework) may have helped contain social unrest. Chief among these measures was
demobilization of armed forces and rebel group combatants. The number of adults
successfully demobilized rose from 18,755 in 2006 to 29,527 in 2009. Also, the cohort of
20,000 ―guardians of the peace‖ was dismantled. All those demobilized received a payment
on discharge and (with mixed results) about half of them (around 25,000) were enrolled in a
support program providing training and other measures to help them rejoin civilian society
(IMF 2011).

4.20 Based on interviews in Burundi and a scan of the local press archives that are
available on the internet, IEG found no evidence of food riots in Burundi, either in the three
                                                18


years before the food crisis operation was approved, or during the period of project
implementation. Thus, although there was no social unrest associated with the food crisis
over this period, it is difficult to argue that this was in any way attributable to the operation.
Achievement of this objective is therefore rated negligible.

Ensure the fiscal stability needed to foster medium-term social and
economic development
4.21 The results framework includes actions to rationalize domestic taxes and foreign trade
and international transaction taxes to promote fiscal stability, with a view to fostering
medium-term social and economic development. The 2008 Public Expenditure Review
reported that tax exemptions, particularly on imports, were widespread and unsystematic: ―60
percent of imports entered Burundi in 2006 with partial or total exemptions, costing FBu
103.7 billion…equivalent to 10.7 percent of GDP and 65.6 percent of tax receipts‖ (World
Bank 2008c, p.11).

4.22 On 1 July 2009, the government introduced the Value Added Tax (VAT) at a
standard rate of 18 percent except for exports which are zero rated, and imports for
diplomatic and certain international organizations which are exempt. The VAT replaced the
transaction tax (Decree Law No. 1/04 of 1989 and 1/005 of 1994) which was levied at rate of
17 percent. The introduction of VAT was intended to raise the efficiency of tax collection,
and offset potential losses on customs revenue due to Burundi‗s accession to the East African
Community. It aligned the tax regime with international best practices and the Community‘s
partner states. The government prepared an action plan to phase out the transaction tax. The
Burundi Revenue Authority (Office Burundais des Recettes) was created and the systems
modernized. The government adopted the Community‘s Customs Union protocol for
common external tariffs, fostering regional integration and a better business environment
(African Development Bank 2010).

4.23 The fiscal position improved during the period covered by the project (Table 5). The
overall balance between government revenues and expenditures deteriorated by more than
expected from 2007 to 2008, but the deficit shrank substantially between 2008 and 2009,
excluding the effect of copious grant funding (particularly HIPC relief received in early
2009). In 2009, the deficit was projected to amount to 28 percent of GDP but in practice it
only reached 21 percent. This was partly the result of the dramatic increase in revenues from
the taxation of goods and services after 2005, a trend that was consolidated by the
introduction of the value-added tax. Progress toward this objective is rated substantial.

5. Ratings
Outcome
5.1     The objectives of the food crisis operation were substantially relevant, but there were
shortcomings in the design of the operation. Although there was a sound case for the school
feeding part of the operation, overall, design relevance was modest, owing to gaps in the
project results framework —particularly the weak connection between support for tax
exemptions and the objectives of reducing hunger and poverty. The design was not
sufficiently adapted to the Burundi food security context, weakening the relevance of the
actions to the intended outcomes. Achievement of the fiscal stabilization objective was
substantial, based on measures to rationalize taxes. On the other hand, achievement of the
objectives of reducing hunger and preventing an increase in poverty was modest, and of
preventing social unrest negligible. The extra spending on school feeding and famine relief
may have contributed to reducing hunger. More schools than expected were covered by the
feeding program. But the program delivered less than the projected number of meals and was
launched later than intended—seven months after the grant was approved, contrary to the
purpose of an emergency operation. The weak link between the exoneration of the
transaction tax and food prices feeding suggest little if any plausible attribution of short-run
                                                       20


containment in poverty to the operation. Attribution of containment of social unrest to the
operation is particularly weak. Overall, outcome is rated unsatisfactory.16

Risk to Development Outcome
5.2     The progress made toward the fiscal stabilization objective will probably be sustained
because this operation was part of a broader program of macroeconomic reform that is
proceeding largely according to plan, with a big commitment from government and
development partners. Tax collection has been rationalized, an achievement that is unlikely
to be reversed given Burundi‘s insertion in the East African Community. The risk to other
outcomes is harder to assess, partly because the outcomes themselves were modestly
achieved, and partly because the actions taken by emergency operations are, by their nature,
short-term in scope. The additional school feeding sponsored by the project was temporary,
as intended—although the participatory approach sponsored under the project (involving
local authorities and parents) may influence future approaches to such programs.17 At a cost
of about US$71 per student per year, it could be argued that the school feeding program was
too costly to warrant a long-term government commitment and that increasing agricultural
productivity was what was most needed. Some of the actions contemplated by the food crisis
operation bore on agricultural productivity; IEG found no evidence of the effect of
expenditures to create a fertilizer stock and to rehabilitate irrigation in the Imbo plain.

5.3      Risk to development outcome is rated significant.

Bank Performance
5.4     Quality at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory, owing mainly to weak project
design. The food price shock called for a timely and flexible response and in this respect the
Bank performed well. Less than a month elapsed between the concept review and Bank
approval of the operation. But the project logic was not convincing. Providing resources to
offset tax exemptions that had already been decreed was expedient. But there was no well-
explained linkage between tax exemptions (which bore mainly on imports), and consumer
prices. In Burundi, the hunger and poverty that the operation was intended to reduce was not
primarily driven by the spike in world commodity prices: the prices of foods most consumed
by the poor were driven by low domestic output rather than the rising cost of imports. This
dynamic was captured in Bank analytic work on rural growth that was published shortly
before the food crisis operation was approved (Baghdadli, Harborne and Rajadel 2008). The
underlying issue of low productivity was also reflected in the design of the FY2005
Agriculture Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land Management Project.

5.5    Supervision quality is rated satisfactory. There was good coordination with the
Bank‘s parallel operations on public financial management and macroeconomic reform,

16
  The criteria for rating the outcome of development policy operations such as this one are limited to relevance
and efficacy (achievement of stated objectives); efficiency is not assessed.
17
  Following the project, the budget for school feeding was halved, from F Bu 6 billion per year in 2009 and
2010 to F Bu 3 billion in 2011, and was limited to three provinces (Ngozi, Kirundo, and Muyinga)—but this is
not germane to assessing the risk to development outcome of an emergency cooperation like this.
                                               21


although less evidence of coordination with agriculture operations. The poverty economist
based in the resident mission played an important role in helping the government supervise
the school feeding program. There were, however, some shortfalls in the implementation of
monitoring.

5.6    Overall Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance
5.7      Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory. In an effort to address the
threat of higher commodity prices, the government was quick to introduce the revised 2008
budget. It was also strongly committed to the project‘s fiscal stabilization objective.
However, the urgency of the school feeding intervention was undermined by the seven-
month implementation delay, responsibility for which attached primarily to government‘s
failure to transfer to the World Food Program the amount agreed to in a memorandum that
the two agencies signed.

5.8    The performance of implementing agencies is rated moderately satisfactory.
Implementation was led by the Ministry of Finance, in concert with the Ministry of
Education (which provided oversight of the school feeding program) and the Ministry of
Agriculture. The Ministry of Solidarity also had a small role, limited to supervising the
humanitarian assistance activities. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of National
Solidarity each disbursed over 95 percent of the funds allocated to them under the revised
2008 budget.

5.9     The Ministry of Education‘s decision to run the feeding program jointly with WFP
helped reduce administrative costs and was one way to help build government capacity. The
Steering/Monitoring Committee established by the Ministry of Education played a useful role
at the planning stage of the feeding program (selection of schools), but it was less effective at
following up on implementation. In general, the implementing agencies did not monitor
project performance and results closely.

5.10   Overall Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
5.11 With respect to M&E design, monitoring was conducted at two levels. The Ministry
of Finance was responsible for tracking implementation of the grant. It received advice on
monitoring from the Bank's resident poverty economist. The school feeding program
involved monitoring by the WFP and through monthly reports from school district
authorities, complemented by reports from parent associations. These reports showed the
number of schools covered by the program, their names and locations, and the number of
pupils needing feeding. The selection of monitoring indicators was weak. At the concept
review meeting participants recognized that, by the very nature of budget support, it would
not be possible to trace the exact use to which grant funds were put; but the project team was
urged to explore with government the use of monitoring mechanisms (e.g. social
accountability mechanisms, spot audits) to ensure that the activities financed under the
                                               22


budget reached the intended beneficiaries. For example, an indicator capturing the actual
price of the 13 food items in selected markets could have been included—to assess whether
or not the tax elimination was passed through to consumers. This need not have entailed
detailed household surveys but could have entailed spot checks in marketplaces that attracted
a high proportion of poor people.

5.12 Progress with implementation of M&E was mixed. The Bank's resident poverty
economist provided regular support to the Ministry of Finance for monitoring. However, no
relevant household surveys were sponsored during or after the food crisis operation. With
respect to school feeding, most of the monitoring was performed by WFP inspectors and the
Ministry of Education's Steering/Monitoring Committee. But this Committee did not have
the resources necessary for systematic monitoring of program performance; it did not have
any budget for school visits. Program monitoring relied on local WFP inspectors who were
able to verify that the food was delivered and distributed adequately, but did not collect data
on school attendance before and during program implementation.

5.13 Utilization of M&E was also patchy. Feedback from monitoring does not appear to
have played a major role in guiding implementation. There were no detailed data generated
on nutritional status or poverty and in any event, the safety net activities supported by the
grant ran for only a year, leaving little scope for mid-course correction.

5.14   Overall, monitoring and evaluation is rated modest.

6. Lessons
6.1     The choice of instruments and policy measures for an emergency food crisis
intervention needs to take into account the local causes of poverty and hunger. In the case
of the Burundi food crisis operation, recent sector work emphasized the centrality of long-run
constraints to agricultural productivity to these problems, while the analysis in the Program
Document gave the impression that the main problem for Burundi was short-term in nature—
caused by the 2007-08 spikes in world commodity prices. This was presumably a necessary
expedient to justify application to the Global Food Crisis Response Fund. The Program
Document further created the false impression that the tax exemption program would
necessarily enhance food consumption by the poor and vulnerable. There was enough
available evidence at the time of grant preparation to demonstrate that the root cause of food
insecurity in Burundi lay in the lack of investment in agriculture following the civil war, and
the overall poverty trap resulting from failure to attain the levels of growth achieved in other
post-crisis countries.

6.2     For budget support as for other operations, it is difficult to assess results in the
absence of a clear framework setting out links between policy actions, outputs, and
outcomes and of baseline measures of the outcomes against which progress can be
measured. The food crisis grant operation for Burundi did not clearly specify the links
between the various actions that were supported and the outcomes underpinning project
objectives. There was a lack of agreement between the main text of the Program Document
and the Actions Matrix in terms of the number of objectives, and there was no indication of
                                              23


what actions would be taken in support of the objectives of preventing an increase in social
unrest and enhancing fiscal stability.

6.3     Scaling up of safety nets is a common strategy in an emergency situation, but
expanding a program to new areas may take time. In the case of Burundi, not all schools
had the necessary infrastructure to support the feeding program, and local management had
to be put in place in the new areas. There were significant delays due to funding
arrangements. Together, this resulted in a 7-month delay in expanding the school feeding
program to vulnerable provinces.

         The Global Hunger Index [GHI] is calculated by the International Food Policy Research Institute
based on three components: the proportion of all people in the country with calorie deficiency (based on
data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations) [PUN]; the prevalence of underweight
children, referring to the population aged less than five years (based on data from the World Health
Organization) [CDW]; and the proportion of children who die before the age of 5 years (based on data
from the United Nations Children‘s Fund) [CM].

                                GHI= (PUN+CDW+CM)/3

         All three index components are expressed in percentages and weighted equally. Higher GHI
values indicate more hunger. The Index varies between a minimum of zero and a maximum of 100, but
these extremes do not occur in practice. The maximum value of 100 would be reached only if all children
died before their fifth birthday, the whole population was undernourished, and all children younger than
five were underweight. The minimum value of zero would mean that a country had no undernourished
people in the population, no children younger than five who were underweight, and no children who died
before their fifth birthday.

          The following caveat should be noted.

          ―It may be that national food production has been underestimated in the GHI calculations for
Burundi, in particular because household self-consumption may be underestimated. Nevertheless, the
available data on national food production suggest a collapse. In 2005, the indicator of production per
inhabitant (in kilograms of cereal equivalent) measured only 55 percent of its 1993 level (the pre-war
level).‖ (Baghdadli, Harborne and Rajadel 2008: 36)

Notes:
     (1) These are partial data derived from the four (most important) customs posts: the lakeside port and the airport of the capital, Bujumbura, and the provinces of Gitega and Kayanza. Other
            customs posts are not yet linked to the OBR computer database.
     (2) The “tax? column in the table refers to the sum of customs duties and transactions tax collected at the four customs posts before July 1, 2009. From July 1, 2009 forwards “tax? refers to
            custom duties plus value added tax.
     (3) For reasons that OBR was unable to explain to IEG, tax revenues continued to be collected on food staples despite the official decree of exemption that was introduced in 2005 and
            extended annually, for the last time in February 2008.
     (4) The steep rise in tax receipts in 2009 reflects the introduction of the value added tax of 18 percent on July 1, applied to all goods, including the staples that were formerly (and de jure not
            de facto) tax exempt.

Box B1. Government statement of intended measures in support of the objectives of the
food crisis grant operation

"As regards the eventual additional budgetary support of US$ 10 million which Burundi could be granted from
the World Bank, the authorities will be allocating it to agriculture and food, to mitigate the threat of famine in
the country. The objective of the Grant is to address urgent food security needs, especially for pupils in primary
schools, through the establishment of school feeding and nutrition programs (cantines scolaires). Consequently,
the revised 2008 budget includes a budgetary line of about US$3 million to finance the expansion of these
school feeding and nutrition programs. The new budget line for primary school feeding with at least the same
amount of resources will be maintained in the 2009 national budget, and would be implemented if the food
prices situation continues to hit the country." (Letter of Development Policy, paragraph 12).

"More specifically, in the Revised 2008 Budget Law, this additional support will contribute to the financing of
the following measures:
On the revenue side : (a) suspension of customs rights and transaction taxes on certain food imports (green
beans, cassava, sweet potatoes, wheat, etc.) ; (b) suspension of 17% of the transaction tax on diesel products; (c)
reduction of tariffs on imported diesel products, to reduce the impact of rising oil and food prices on the poor;
(d) subsidies for diesel products for pro-poor sectors; (e) strengthening of tax revenue rationalization, with an
impact on domestic taxes and foreign trade and international transaction taxes.
On the expenditure side : (f) in agriculture: (i) the creation of a strategic stock of agricultural fertilizers; (ii)
rehabilitation o f the irrigation system in Imbo plain; (iii) increase in food output; (iv) contribution to rural
