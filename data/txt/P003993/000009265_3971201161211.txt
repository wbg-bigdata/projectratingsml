SUMMARY
A draft Preliminary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment' was submitted as Annex E
of the Phase I report in September 1996. For completeness, much of the material submitted in
the draft is repeated here, but at the same time there are substantial changes in this final
version, especially in the treatment of sociological issues and legislation, in the proposals for an
environmental screening methodology, and in the detailed preliminary screening of potential
sub-projects that has been carried out, as well as in formulating proposals for the handling of
environmental issues during the proposed Northem Sumatra Regional Road Project (NSRRP).
Chapter 1 gives an outline account of the existing physical and social environment, while
Chapter 2 summarizes the environmental implications of road development. The current
legislation in Indonesia is summarized in Chapter 3, and the implications for environmental
management are discussed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 proposes a methodology for the preliminary
screening of road projects, and provides guidelines on the costs of the ANDAL studies that may
be required; it also proposes a strategy to strengthen the management of the environmental and
social measures that are required. Finally the preliminary screening results of identified sub-
projects are presented in Chapter 6.
The Regional Roads Transport Priorities Analysis Study (RRPTA) is classified as a category
A project under the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.01, requiring full environmental and
social impact assessment. Not all proposed sub-projects, however, will require such full
evaluation (categories B and C). The Indonesian Government's environmental legislation for
analysing and managing the negative environmental and social impacts of development
(AMDAL) is actually more comprehensive than the Bank's, and compliance is mandatory.
However, the institutional capacity to implement the legislation is still undergoing development
and there remains much room for improvement. There are weaknesses in consultant capacity to
undertake the AMDAL studies, and in budgetary and institutional capacity to implement the
environmental and social mitigation measures recommended from the studies. Within Bina
Marga, it is envisaged that the on-gtoing ISEM  project fiunded by the World Bank will
strengthen the capacity of the AMII)AL. sections to supervise environmental management in the
roads sector.
Preliminary screening of proposed projects has been carried out (see Chapter 6). This estimates
the size and scale of the ANDAL that may be required, but this will be confirrned only after the
Initial Environmental Evaluation (Kajian Lingkungan) has been carried out. Systems of
sectoral evaluation are applicable in other cases, with mitigation measures incorporated in the
existing technical guidelines and standard operating procedures.
The Indonesian environmental legislation encompasses social issues as a component of the
environment, whereas the World Bank tends to treat them as separate issues. Both 'environmental'
and 'social' components form the subject of this report.



From the viewpoint of environmental management, proposed sub-projects can be divided into
three categories:
a) Capacity Expansion. This mostly concems the widening or in some cases realignment of
existing routes that carry heavy traffic, often in or close to urban centres. Such projects
may have major social issues especially concerning k nd acquisition, but the physical and
biological impacts can generally be handled by routine procedures. A proforma for
screening such projects based on analysis of 1:50,000 topographic maps is presented in
Table 5.2. Preliminary screening along the main national and provincial corridors is
presented in Table 6.2; an indicative classification has been applied of the size of the
ANDAL study that may be required, but this will depend on the degree of widening
proposed.                                                                               ,1
b) New construction, mainly of inter-kabupaten links (new construction of the requisite
provincial road network, mainly in Aceh and North Sumatra, is already on-going).
Considered to be very important for the agricultural development of the more remote areas,  I
most of these projects require the upgrading of existing poor quality kabupaten roads, but
with some new construction. There may be a variety of environmental impacts (physical,
biological and social), but the impacts are generally not severe. The screening proforma for  I
new roads is presented in Table 5.1. Table 6.1 likewise gives an indicative category of the
size of the ANDAL study that may be required. Some of the identified routes carry major
impacts and are included with the next category.                                           I
c) Major new corridors. These provide entirely new routes, generally inter-kabupaten, which
in most cases cross steep forested mountainous terrain. Roads which are planned to cross
the NW-SE 'strike' of the land are particularly steep. Most would have severe impacts and
clearly require full ANDAL studies, but it is uncertain whether the institutional capacity is
in place, in both the short-term and in perpetuity, to handle the impacts on the physical and
biological environment (such as damage to watersheds, forest clearance, illegal logging,  I
hunting or trade in wildlife etc.). In a few cases there may also be significant impacts on
vulnerable isolated communities. 
In general, the watersheds over most of the Project Area are still in good condition. However,
in order to protect these watersheds, upon which the welfare of the densely populated lowlands  I
partially depend, it is recommended that roads are not constructed in montane forests unless
exceptional social or economic justification can be established. Where constructed, high
priority must be given to the management, in perpetuity, of the land, forest and biological   3
resources along the route. In view of the fact that new provincial roads are being constructed in
such terrain (in Aceh and West Sumatra), either apparently without any enviromnental
evaluation or with ANDAL studies that sometimes fail to address adequately the main issues
(see Section 4.5), and in view of the concerns about the lack of sufficient local govemrnment
capacity to control negative impacts consequent upon the new access provided by such roads,
great concern is expressed here about this issue. Recommendations are made in Section 5.10 to
strengthen the institutional aspects of environmental management, with the establishment of an
Environmental Oversight Committee in each province (whose mandate would extend later
outside the transport sector), and with annual environmental workshops to address such issues.
Priority should be given to the need to mnanage the watershed forests along the provincial
roads already constructed, especially in Aceh Province.

There are varied interpretations, between regions and projects, of Keppres 55/1993 conceming
land acquisition and resettlement, although this regulation provides a framework for land
I               acquisition that is compatible with the Bank's resettlement policies and Operational Directive
4.30. However, it is considered that standard operational guidelines are required specifically for
the use of Bina Marga in road construction and widening projects, in order to ensure that
*               methods of compensation are fair and transparent. It is recommended that consultation and
community participation are made an integral part of land acquisition procedures. The GOI
must accord priority to the allocation of sufficient funds for the purpose of acquiring land
where necessary on capacity expansionlrealignment projects, and indeed Bank approval to
proceed will be conditional upon satisfactory resolution of such problems.
3   '           Likewise there are doubts concerning the institutional capacity for the handling of social
impacts in remote areas. Act No. 10 of 1992 on population policy has potential to assist
vulnerable isolated communities to develop at a pace in accordance with their socio-cultural
I               abilities, protected from the negative impacts of rapid development and outside pressures.
However, to date, no guidelines have been issued to facilitate the implementation of this law,
and such guidelines are considered urgent. Unfortunately this Act does not have provision for
guaranteeing inherited land rights, and so the legal anomalies of adat rights remain.
It is assumed that sub-projects proposed for implementation during the first year of NSRRP
will either not require AAIDAL studies or such studies will have already been completed and
accepted; it is further assumed that issues relating to land acquisition will have been resolved
satisfactorily. Other sub-projects will be postponed to the second or later years in order to
U               permit environmental and social evaluation to be carried out and arrangements for land
acquisition to be effected.
3               The AMDAL process is considered by some as a further bureaucratic constraint to
development, and the size of this volume might tend to support this viewpoint, particularly
when the screening tables in Chapter 6 appear to suggest that every project requires ANDAL.
3               In fact the process is designed to support development and to ensure that the negative impacts
that may result frormt projects are effectively managed in order to prevent them becoming
detrimental to sustainable development in the long term. The benefits of constructing an
expensive road across a high, steep forested watershed will be negated if the indirect impacts
result in an increase in the frequency and severity of floods and droughts in the densely
populated adjacent lowlands that are dependent upon that watershed.
*               Indeed the main constraints tend to be in planning and handling the AMDAL process. The
majority of road projects do not have significant negative impacts, and those listed in Tables
6.1 and 6.2 as having a NI or Cl ANDAL code may belong to this category (as would
probably some with N2 or C2 codes). This will be determiined only after the preliminary
screening and Kajian Lingkzungan. It is recommended that KL is carried out for every project,
but this need be neither a time constraint nor a budget constraint when planned efficiently on a
provincial basis.

The problems lie in:
+     recognizing those relatively few projects that carny really significant impacts especially
in terms of:
*      problems relating to land acquisition and resettlement
*      issues concerning the new provision of road access to isolated communities         I
*      damage to watersheds and the hydrographic regime
*      loss of forest and biological resources
*      conversion for non-sustain able use that results in irreversible land degradation
*     developing the capacity of the consultants undertaking the ANDAL studies, and those
responsible for reviewing and approving the studies, so that the studies focus on the
really significant issues, and
*     developing the capacity and commitment of the responsible authorities, especially those
outside the proponent agency, for ensuring that the resulting recommendations are fully
carried out.
The recommendations for technical assistance support for environmental management
presented in Chapter 5, in parallel with the ongoing ISEM project in Bina Marga and related
projects in other agencies, are designed to improve the overall capacity to deal with these      i
problems effectively at all levels in the development process.

1 THE EXISTING ENVIRONMENT IN THE STUDY AREA
1                1.1 Geography (Geology, topography, climate, natural hazards)
The four provinces of northern Sumatra that constitute the Project Area have a total land area
of some 268,0C; sq. km. No less than 29% of this area is mountainous, and indeed 54% of
Aceh and 46% of West Sumatra are classified as mountains (see Table 1.1 and Figures la-d).
The percentage is reduced in North Sumatra by extensive eastem  lowlands and central
plateaus, and Riau is primarily a lowland province. Indeed, peat swamps occupy 40% of Riau,
but elsewhere are confined to a narrow coastal zone.

- as measured by RePPProT (these totals differ sligitty from official figures)
Many of these mountains are igneous in origi, and there are active volcanoes in North and
West Sumatra. Lake Toba is the crater resulting from one of the biggest eruptive episodes in
the World's geological history. The highest Sumatran peak is Kerinci, on the West Sumatra -
Jambi border, at 3805 m. The mountains are part of the chain known as the Barisan Mountains
*               that run the length of westem Sumatra and give the island its distinctive NW-SE strike. A
major feature of this range is the fault-bound rift valley (the "Semangko fault zone") that runs
the length of the island, and which, together with the recent volcanoes, has had significant
impacts on human settlement patterns.
As typical of mountainous regions in tropical climates, slopes tend to be universally steep. One
I               of the most widespread land systems mapped by RePPProT (1988) is Bukit Pandan, which has
an average slope range greater than 60%. Indeed, according to the Ministry of Forestry's own
criteria for designation of Protection Forest (which includes slopes steeper than 40%),
I               RePPProT recommended that over 78,000 sq. km. should have this status, an increase of 70%
of the actual area classified as Protection Forest (see Table 1.5). Smoother landforms
accompany the fertile lower slopes of the recent volcanoes, and the tuff plateaus of North
I.              Sumatra. The rivers tend to follow the regional NW-SE strike, but then cut through the
adjacent steep ridges to the sea usually by means of deep gorges.
3               There is a narrow zone of coastal lowlands lying west of the Barisan Range, although locally
the hills drop steeply to the sea, creating an impedance to land conmmunication routes (Lamno
and Tapaktuan in Aceh, Sibolga in North Sumatra, and Padang-Painan in West Sumatra).
lI



There are also some narrow swamps behind the coast, often deep-water swamps that are
difficult to reclaim.
There is a much wider zone of lowlands on the east coast, from Lhokseumawe southwards, and
most of Riau lies in these lowlands. Particularly fertile are the Toba Tuff plains of the Medan
region, but elsi where the monotonous peneplain of low (but often steep) rolling hills produce  J
soils of somewhat inferior quality. The east coast of Riau is one of rapid accretion, and very
deep peats (up to 20m in places) occur in the inter-riverine zones.
The islands off the west coast, such as Simeuleuwe, Nias and Siberut, are mostly steep and
hilly, but non-volcanic. Those off the east coast, such as Batam and Bintan, lie on the
undulating graritic Sunda Shelf
Climate
The mountains and the west coast have annual rainfall exceeding 3000 mm, and wide areas
exceed 4000 mm. West-facing slopes behind Padang exceed 5000 mm. Rainfall is heavy at all
seasons and there are no dry months (months having less than 100 mm). By contrast, the
eastem coastal lowlands and some intermontane valleys lie in a rain shadow and annual totals
are less than 2000 mm. Parts of the NE coast of Aceh and some of the valleys record less than
1500 mm. A few localities have one or even two dry months, but the region as a whole is     I
spared the annual droughts which occur in southem Indonesia. Seasons of maximum rainfall
are somewhat ill-defined, but are generally very different from those occurring for example in
Java. Thus the driest months tend to be December to March, and the wetter months are April t
and October-November, but floods often occur on the Aceh west coast in June-July.
A characteristic feature of the climate of the eastem lowlands is the hot, dry fohn winds
descending off the mountains during the SW monsoon (especially June to August). Best known
is the 'Bohorok' which hits the Medan plains, but the winds which blow across Padang Lawas
(the Gunungtua region of North Sumatra) are particularly dessicating. Although not recorded
in the literature, there is evidence of the reverse situation, with fohn winds on the west coast
during the NE monsoon.
Most rain is high intensity. Over Indonesia as a whole, up to 1981 there were 212 recorded
events of daily totals exceeding 400 mm (see RePPProT 1990), and falls of more than 700 mm
are known. It would be unreasonable to design roads and associated small structures to
withstand major events of this kind, which have a return period of 40 to 100 years, but they
should be able to withstand the more typical short storms which have very high intensity. Falls
of over 100 mm in one hour have a return period of 5 to 10 years.
Natural hazards
Natural hazards are a way of life in tropical regions of high tectonic instability and high
rainfall. They can be classified into four types: volcanoes, earthquakes, floods and landslides.
The volcanoes that contribute so much to the fertility of the region are also a threat, althoughl
modem technology generally has the means to delineate the danger zones and provide adequate  I
warning of activity. Science has not yet found the means to predict earthquakes, and
2
2 



events in recent years serve to confirm that the Barisan region is a major zone of instability.
Tarutung in North Sumatra has had two major earthquakes in the past decade.
From the viewpoint of the road engineer, floods and landslides (which are often
contemporaneous) are a hazard that must be taken into account during design. Less
catastrophic than earthquakes, the accun.ulative impact is much greater. Both hazards are
exacerbated, to an unknown but probably significant degree, by the extensive deforestation that
is taking place in the watershed regions. This is one reason why such importance is attached to
the negative indirect impacts of road construction through the montane forests.
Road construction may contribute greatly to the risk of landslides, although sound engineering
practice should reduce this risk substantially. However, in the montane parts of the study area,
slopes are so steep and lithologically unstz ble that the costs of protection may be too high for
the road to be economic. This is an important consideration in the construction of roads across
the strike ridges of Aceh and North Sumatra.
Flooding is an annual event, and the indigenous inhabitants generally have a much better
knowledge of when to expect them than do road engineers and government officials from
outside the area. Two types of flooding should be considered, the high velocity flash-floods of
narrow inland valleys with their very damaging coarse sediment loads, and the medium velocity
over-the-bank floods of the lower valleys with their fine sedirnent loads. The former generally
rise and fall within a day, the latter may last a week or more.
1.2 Population
The population of the four provinces in 1994 was 22.2 million. The provincial breakdown is
given in Table 1.2, which also gives the 1986 figures of rural population density and rates of
growth as calculated by RePPProT (1990). Table 1.3 gives the 1994 population density by
kabupaten, which is illustrated in Figure 2.
Analysis of population distribution is revealing. The traditional zones of settlement are mnostly
in the fertile rift valleys, young volcanic footslopes and tuff plateaus of the montane interior, as
evidenced by the Minangkabau culture of West Sumatra (Agam, Tanah Datar) and the Bataks
of North Sumatra (Karo, Simalungun). If a land use map was produced for these highland
areas for 1896, it would not differ significantly from that of today. Indeed a description of the
Toba highlands in 1824 indicates that there had already occurred extensive deforestation, and
degraded grasslands were widespread even at that time (Whitten et al. 1984). Although the
Medan plains now carry some of the densest population, historically this was not the case. The
forests here were cleared early in the colonial era for high-value estate crops, which led to later
heavy migration into the region both from Java and from the Batak highlands.
The lowland province of Riau has the lowest population density, reflecting its inherent
infertility. However, consequent upon this, it also has the widest availability of land and the
highest growth rate, because of both sponsored and spontaneous in-migration. Traditionally,
the early settlements in Riau (other than forest-dwelling tribes) were almost entirely based upon
river valleys, benefiting from river transport and the more fertile alluvial soils. Subsequently,
roads (both government and logging roads) provided access to the forests of the inter-riverine
I                                                        3



l~~~~~
areas, and the modem era of forest clearance was then enabled to commence. The process is
reflected in the zonation that is repeated throughout lowland Sumatra, from old or mature
rubber near the road, through young rubber growing in dense secondary growth, to arable
crops and new clearance at the 'cutting edge', perhaps a day's walk from the road. Latterly, the
transmigration programme has tended to take over the forests that remain.
Not all of rural Riau is so sparsely populated. The highest density (apart from the offshore
islands) is in Indragiri Hilir, where there has been extensive settlement of the coastal region by
migrants, many from South Sulawesi. The soils here have only shallow peat, but they are        -1
potentially extremely acid when drained. Originally the settlers grew rice, but now most of the
land is under coconut plantations (and mapped as intensive land use, see below).

1.3 Land Use
Simplified land use is presented in Figures 3a-d and summarized in Table 1.4. It must be
emphasized that the source of this data is RePPProT (1988, 1990), which is based on satellite
imagery dated 1985. Furthermore, the mapped forest cover in the figures is believed to give an
I                 exaggerated picture of the actual forest cover in 1985, owing to factors of generalization to
accomodate the small scale. Extensive land use systems include areas of shifting cultivation,
but they also include the secondary bush and alang-alang grasslands that have resulted from
earlier usage. Intensive land use includes all forms of permanent cropping (estates, wetland
rice, permanent dryland arable crops, intensive smallholder tree crops).

Despite the reservations expressed above, forest was still measured to occupy 57% of the area
in 1985. It should be realized, however, that the forest mostly occurs in the mountains (29% of
I                 area - see Table 1.1), hills (12% of area) and peatswamps (18% of area). Lowland forest, ofther
than swamp forest, has been almost totally eradicated from the region.
3                 Deforestation
Nationwide, the estimates of annual rates of deforestation range from about 600,000 ha to over
I                 11.3 million ha (World Bank, 1994). In the Project Area, the most rapid deforestation is likely to
have occurred in Riau province, consequent upon the inferior quality of that province's soils
and hence the low rate of traditional utilization. Modem agronomic techniques, together with
I                 oil palm estates and industrial tree crops, permit much more extensive use of such soils. An
analysis was made of forest clearance in North Sumatra and Riau from the most recent
available cloud-free Landsat imagery, compared with the RePPProT land use maps based on
I                 mainly 1985 imagery. This is dated July 1994 - June 1995 for North Sumatra and March 1995
- June 1996 for Riau. For the mainland regions (only), the forest clearance over this decade is
estimated to have been over 4000 sq. km in North Sumatra and over 5,100 sq. km in Riau, or
1                 14.4% and 8.6% respectively of the 1985 forest cover (see Table 1.4). The implication is that
over 40,000 ha in North Sumatra and over 51,000 ha in Riau have been cleared each year over
the last decade. Rates are likely to be slower in the more mountainous Aceh and West Sumatra
provinces. The interpretation of the imagery was visual and rapid, and the figures are
illustrative only. Estate and industrial tree crop projects are responsible for the major portion of
the clearance in the lowlands, but most of the clearance in the highlands appears to have been
by smallholders (with some contribution from timber extraction for pulpwoods).
I                                                          )



The forest cover portrayed for Riau in Figure 3d is believed to bear little resemblance to that of
today (see also Figure 6).
Recent LANDSAT imagery (1995) has now been obtained for much of the Project Area. There
were delays in delivery, and it was not possible to analyze these during Phase I of the project.
An analysis will be made during Phase II, when the imagery will be used for environmental
screening of land use along priority sub-projects.
Isolated communities
The problem of isolated and vulnerable communities is discussed further in Section 5.5. Figure
4 shows the distribution of areas that are remote from road access. These areas are often under
forest, but it is within these boundaries that some isolated communities are found, practising
traditional forms of agriculture. Their traditional land rights are inherited, but the village may
also have communal rights for hunting and harvesting of natural products. The presence of a
remote village on the map does not necessarily signify a traditional agricultural community.
There will be cases where such villages were developed for small-scale gold mining activities,
or settled following the access provided by logging. Within the project region, communities
identified as named indigenous tribes occur only in Riau (although the Lubu occupy the borders
between Riau, West Sumatra and North Sumatra), and their distribution is shown on Figure 4.
1.4 Importance for biodiversity
Sumatra lies in the Sundaic biogeographical province, with elements of fauna and flora that are
shared with Java and/or Kalimantan and/or the Malay Peninsula. Perhaps the most famous
member of its fauna is the Orang Utan Pongo pygmaeus, shared with Kalimantan, but in
Sumatra restricted to Aceh and North Sumatra provinces. South of this, rumours persist of a
so-far undiscovered 'jungle-man', currently the subject of expeditions to the remaining wild
regions near the West Sumatra - Jambi borders. Other notable primates are the three species of
Gibbon occurring on Sumatra ( Hylobates agilis. H. lar. H. syndactylus). Another notable
mammal is the Asian Elephant Elephas maximus, increasingly becoming reported as a potential
danger owing to man-elephant conflicts resulting from the loss of the latter's traditional terrain.
There is considerable intemational concern at the depletion of Sumatran (and indeed Asian)
mammals such as the Tiger Panthera tigris and Sumatran Rhinoceros Dicerorhinus
sumatrensis. The Sumatran populations of these are now estimated at only 400-500 and 300
respectively (Species, 1996). Other mammals that might be mentioned would be the Dhole
(wild dog, Cuon alpinus), the Serow (wild goat, Capricornis sumatrensis) and the very poorly
known Sumatran Hare (Nesolagus netscheri). Best-known forest plants are the Rafflesia and
Amorphophallus.
Out of some 600 bird species, there are at least 12 that are endemic to mainland Sumatra, and
nearly all of these are montane in distribution. Particularly notable are the Salvadori's Pheasant
Lophura ignita in the south and west, and its close cousin Lophura hoogerwerfi in the north.
The latter is so poorly known that the male is still undescribed. The lowland avifauna, other
than in peatswamps, has been decimated by forest clearance, although pockets remain, such as
the newly established Siberida nature reserve in the south of Riau. One endemic taxon that has
not been observed for many decades is the Chestnut-necklaced Partridge Tropicoperdix
6

l
charltonii, which may be confined to the hills of SE Aceh. Critically endangered are the White-
winged Duck Cairina scutulata and Storm's Stork Ciconia stormi, both dependent upon
wetland forest of the coastal plains, and Sumatra has global responsibility for these species.
Probably Sumatra holds the largest population of the White-winged Duck in the world, with
key locations in Aceh Selatan and Tapanuli, and in Indragiri. Finally, the east coast from Aceh
Timur south to South Sumatra is now known to have extren..e importance for migratory
shorebirds in the East Asia - Australasia flyway, as well as for the protection of some large
waterbirds such as the Milky and Lesser Adjutant Storks Mycteria cinerea and Leptoptilos
Javanicus.
There is evidence of continuing illegal trade in or hunting of wildlife, in the form of.
* the export of animal parts for their supposed medical propert& s (rhino hom, tiger parts);
. the export of high value animal parts for omamentation or status (elephant tusks, tiger
skins);
*  the capture of wild birds for boti the intemational and especially (in the case of Sumatra)
the domestic bird markets;
. hunting other than for subsistence purposes,
* shooting for "sporting purposes", commonly by urban dwellers who are unaware of the
significance of their targets.
Without adequate controls, which are rarely available, it is inevitable that new roads provide
ready access for all these activities. Thus there is abundant anecdotal evidence that many
species of birds that were formerly comrnon in the mountain forests of northern Sumatra have
become rare in all the accessible areas merely because of the almost unlimited demand for these
birds on the domestic market. Just two examples would be the White-crested Laughing-thrush
('Boksai') Garrulax leucolophus and Straw-crowned Bulbul ('Cicakrawa') Pycnonotus
zeylanicus, while an example of a bird that has been hunted to near-extinction locally (eg
Brestagi) would be the Bronze-tailed Peacock-pheasant Polyplectron chalcurum.
Additional wetland areas of ecological significance
3n view of the emphasis on montane forests in the reserve network (see Section 1.5), and the
importance of the wetlands, the maps in Figures 5 (Protected Areas) also show areas
considered to have wetlands of ecological significance that are not currently under any form of
protection (source partly derived from the Wetland Inventory, Silvius et al 1987). Those in
Aceh and westem North Sumatra are believed to be fine examples of the west coast swamp
habitat, and as noted above important for such globally endangered bird species as White-
winged Duck. A nature reserve of 85,000 ha. has been proposed for Singkil Barat in Aceh
Selatan (the area south of Kluet), but on the spatial plan the area is proposed for development.
The deep water peat swamps of this region would be difficult to reclaim, and more attention is
urged to be given to the recommendation for a nature reserve. It should be noted that the
provincial west coast road runs through the Kluct extension, but its impact is not recorded; it
interrupts the coastal succession of vegetation types, and presumably provides access to illegal
activities.
On the east coast, several areas have been annotated as having significance. Mostly these are
(or were) surviving examples of good mangrove forest, but the strip of coast in the north-west

of Riau has special significance as possibly the last remaining breeding locality (unfortunately
not yet confirmed) of the Spot-billed Pelican Pelecanus philippensis in SE Asia, and also
important for the Lesser Adjutant Stork. The adjacent area of the Bagan Siapi-api peninsula     I
has been identified as important for the endangered Storm's Stork, but this probably applies to
all the remaining peat swamp forests of Riau, for which there are already several reserves.
Tanjung Datuk and Pulau Bakung, in the south-east of Riau, have been proposed for nature        I
reserve status (55,000 ha), primarily for the tidal areas which support large numbers of
migratory shorebirds, including the globally threatened Asian Dowitcher Limnodromus
semipalmatus.
1.5 Spatial Plans
Spatial plans have been prepared for each of the provinces, identifying areas for protection, for
forest management, and for agricultural or industrial development. The plans are available
either in book form or as large scale maps. In most cases, the protected areas do not differ    I
greatly from the TGHK forest categories. The spatial planning legislation is discussed in
Section 3.2.
Table 1.5 summnarizes the areas of Protection Forest (hutan lindung) and Conservation areas
(national parks, nature reserves, game reserves etc). They are portrayed in Figures 5a-d. The
more important gazetted conservation areas are tabulated in Table 6. These are based mainly     I
on the TGHK classification as depicted on the RePPProT maps, but in the case of West
Sumatra and Riau, some revisions have been incorporated based on the RUTRW maps. There
appear to be some anomalies, such as the boundaries of Kerinci-Seblat national park. These      I
uncertainties would only be significant where a proposed sub-project impacts a conservation
area, and this would be ascertained during Phase [1 of the study.

The Govenmient of Indonesia has set aside 19 million ha or 10% of its total land area as parks
and reserves, and a further 30 million ha as protection forests (World Bank 1994). Within the
Project Area, some 8% of the total area consists of parks and reserves, and 17% as protection
forest. Of major significance is the 790,000 ha Gunung Leuser national park in Aceh/North
Sumatra, and the 1, 485,000 ha Kerinci-Seblat national park that extends into the Project Area
in West Sumatra. Pristine montane forest is extensive in both of these, although there is
encroachment on most of the borders. Management projects are already in progress or
scheduled for both parks (Leuser - EEC funded, Kerinci-Seblat - IBRD funded); this includes
community development in the buffer zones.

For the other reserves, it is assumed that Govemment resources do not permit adequate
management or protection, and that encroachment and illegal harvesting of timber or wildlife is
widespread. Although the list of reserves in Table 1.6 may be quite impressive, the majority of  I
these are in the mountains, and lowland forests are inadequately represented. There are several
lowland reserves in Riau, but these mostly lie in peat swamps. Considerable importance is
attac hed, therefore, to the newly gazetted Siberida nature reserve, on the Riau-Jambi border,   a
which includes significant areas of low hills, and also to the Kluet extension of the Leuser
national park, which reaches the coast in Aceh Selatan.
It is noted that the spatial plan for Riau (Figure 6) includes development of major areas of peat
swamps, for either oil palm estates or industrial tree crops (also as a source of brickettes as an
energy source, while there is an experimental plot of melons in progress). It is reported that up
to 5 )0,000 ha have already been developed, and a further 500,000 ha are destined for
conversion, with some adjustments being made to the existing spatial plan to accomodate these
developments. It is not clear which of these blocks is covered by the activities of PT Multi
Gambut International (MG1), as a contractor to central government, currently opening up
500,000 ha in Kecamatan Keteman, Kabupaten Indragiri Hilir. A regional transport study is
not the place in which to comment on the wisdom of such activities, but strong arguments have   I
been presented elsewhere for the preservation of the natural functions that peat swamp forests
provide. Indeed in some project areas in Malaysia, crop failures and secondary  negative
impacts of peat swamp reclamation have necessitated expensive efforts to restore the original   I
hydrological balance and to regreen the peatwamps. The only comment made here is to
question the justification for constructing roads to serve these projects, in view of the river
network that already exists and the 40 km of lOOm wide drains that will be dug in the project   |
area.
One of the products of the RePPProT mapping was the identification of 'Recommended
Development Areas' (RDAs), areas of between 10,000 and 25,000 ha that were under-utilized
but which have agricultural potential. It should be remembered that the primary focus of the
RePPProT study was the identification of land suitable for transrngration. Within the Study
Area, a total of 54 such areas were identified, as shown in Table 1.7.

The distribution of RDAs strongly reflects the land availability as discussed earlier, especially
in Riau province. However, almost by definition, RDAs will consist of land that requires a
rather high level of management, including heavy fertilizer treatment, because the better quality
land has already been occupied. The concept of RDAs has never been widely accepted by the
provincial planners, despite the fact that they have mostly accepted the data-base (land systems  |

and mapped land use) on which the RDAs were based, and RDAs are now mainly of historical
interest. Land allocations within the spatial plans have in many cases already proceeded beyond
the stage of identifying RDAs. However, their distribution has been taken into account in the
transport planning programme where still relevant.
*                1.6 Existing road network
From Table 1.8, it is seen that some 30,400 km of motorable road exist in the Study Area,
including 2,686 km of National roads, 9,513 km of Provincial roads, and 18,204 km of
motorable Kabupaten roads (asphalt roads, and gravel roads in good condition). Road lenghis
are analyzed by ratios of total area and of population to kilometre of road. Over the Project
I.               Area as a whole, there is one kilometre of motorable road for every 731 head of population.
The most favourable ratio is in Aceh (1:431 people), and the least in North Sumatra (1:972
people), the province with the highest density of population. In terms of area, there is one
U                kilometre for every 880 ha The highest density is in North and West Sumatra equally (1:640
ha), and the lowest is in Riau (1:2120 ha), reflecting the most fertile and least fertile provinces
respectively.
At kabupaten level (Table 1.9), there are some unexpected variations. Generally, those
kabupatens with the highest density of population have the lowest ratios of roads to people, for
I                example Pidie and Aceh Utara in Aceh, Deli Serdang and Asahan in North Sumatra. It is
surprising to see that the population of the highland Aceh Tengah kabupaten appears to be as
well served by roads as that of Aceh Besar.
In terms of ratio of land area to roads, obviously those kabupatens with the lowest intensity of
land use, owing to reasons of mountainous or swampy terrain or low inherent fertility, have the
I                lowest ratio, for example Aceh Tenggara, or the four mainland kabupatens of Riau. Bengkalis
(Riau) has the lowest ratio of one kilometre of road to 27,600 ha, but this reflects the fact that
a large proportion of the area is peat swamp, while much of the population lives alongside
I                rivers or estuaries and relies on boat transport. In general, the most intensively cultivated
kabupatens have the highest ratio, with more than 1,000 ha served by one kilometre (Tanah
Datar in West Sumatra is the extreme with 280 ha/km).

Asphalt roads that are classified as good to poor, and stone/gravel roads as good to fair, are assumed to be motorable. All earth roads  U
are assurned to be non-motorable. because they do njot provide all-year access (manay are little more than footpaths).

2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF ROAD DEVELOPMENT
2.1 General Impacts of Road Projects
Routine impacts that are specific to road construction include, inter alia, the following:
 issues of compensation where the road traverses intensive agricultural or settled areas;
* some building relocation/resettlement;
* some potential displacement of traditional cultural areas such as burial sites;
* potential major imnpacts through inappropriate material removal from unplanned quarry
sites;
* riverbed or coastal erosion resulting from removal of building materin Ls;
* disruption to communities during transport of materials as a result of noise and dust;
*  contamination of drinking water supply through careless storage and placement of bitumen
drums,
*  indirect impacts associated with increased accessibility such as uncontrolled clearance or
harvesting of forest products in conservation areas, protection forest, and sensitive
ecological habitats, hunting and trapping of wildlife etc;
* possible disruption to indigenous communities.
Besides the routine aspects of environmental impact analysis of road development, specific
types of impact are associated with different classes of road and construction type. The lists are
indicative only, and obviously not exclusive.
New construction projects
New road construction involves opening an area to access, often for the first time. Commonly
some form of access already exists (such as an earth road or footpath) and the induced impacts
resulting from access may have already occurred. However there may be major environmental
and social implications from new construction, and it is anticipated that almnost all proposed
new construction on national and provincial roads, and major inter-kabupaten links, will
require full environnmental assessment. Negative impacts specific to new construction include:
*  damage to fragile ecological habitats such as montane forest, mangrove swamps etc;
. increased exploitation of natural resources along the new road;
.  illegal logging and firewood collection in protected forest areas adjoining the new road;
* illegal hunting of endangered and protected wildlife in protected forest areas;
*  the negative effect of the barrier imposed by the new road, and habitat fragmentation;
* disruption of traditional land use practices;
* disruption to indigenous and isolated communities along the road;
a  competition for limited land resources as a result of spontaneous in-migration;
* impacts induced by altering land use pattems as a result of increased access;
*  impacts caused by land speculation by outside investors;
*  land acquisition/resettlement in agricultural areas and in village/urban areas.

Capacity expansion projects
Capacity expansion projects for national and provincial roads are generally located in areas     |
where any natural environment has already been transformed into one characterized by
intensive land use or settlement, and commonly also rapid economic growth. By far the most
significant environmental impacts in this situation are predicted to be social, although there   I
may still be significant negative impacts on the physical environment  New urban by-pass
projects would be similar in terms of type of impacts.
  disruption to and displacement of roadside activities and businesses, industrial facilities,
and road frontage development;
*  displacement of community facilities, and disruption to communities through displacement     1
and resettlement;
*  disruption to agricultural activities;
*  potential land speculation;                                                                   I
*  increased barrier effect;
*  disruption to natural watercourses and/or irrigation systems;
*  impediment to traffic access and existing pedestrian networks; -
disruption to traffic during construction activities;
*  increased air pollution;
*  aesthetic issues during various phases of construction.
Urban roads: new construction or ma?jorwienn
The most significant impacts of urban road development are social and economic, and
generally a relatively large number of people and businesses are affected.
  displacement of significant numbers of people and the need for resettlement plans;
*  land acquisition and associated issues;
*  pedestrian severance and associated impacts on businesses and other economic activities as   I
a result of the barrier effect;
*  increased levels of air and noise pollution;-
*  disturbance to traffic and increased congestion during construction activities;              I
* damage to neighbouring roads and bridges during the transport of heavy building materials.
2.2 Project-specific Impacts of Road Development                                                I
In environmental assessment, it is customary to analyze the predicted impacts in the context of
the physical, biological and socio-economic environment. While many of the impacts listed       I
above are routine to any road development, a number are specific to the Project Area. The
impacts that have played the greatest role in the preliminary assessment of sub-projects (see  -
Section 6) are listed below.
l
iA                                      ~~~~~~I



I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A). Impacts on the physical environment.
Any new road through forested terrain in the hills or mountains is likely to have major negative
impacts, due to:
.  the physical damage of road construction in very steep terrain;
*  increased potential for erosion and landslides;
* the provision of access for illegal logging or other exploitation of natural resources;
*  the provision of access to spontaneous settlement and land clearance for unsustainable
formns of agriculture;
* the downstream impacts of any consequent forest clearance on the hydrological regime.
The importance of the role of mountain forests in protecting dov nstream river regimes is
paramount. It is for this reason that these forests are accorded protection status in the kawasan
hutan of the spatial plan, and that permission is required from the Minister of Forestry before
road construction in such areas can proceed (see Section 3.6). Planners should also consider the
guidelines on maximum longitudinal gradients, which are 6-10% according to class of road
(Standard Specifications for Geometric Design of Rural Highways, Peraturan Perencanaan
Geometrik Jalan Raya, No. 13/1970). Costs of road construction in steeplands will be an
important consideration. Whereas new construction of a 6 metre road to asphalt stage might
cost Rp 500 million/km, the same road in steep terrain might cost at least Rp 2,500-3,000
millionlkm (assuming 15-20 m of cut, in material that is 30% rock and 70% overburden).
Retaining walls are not included in this total.
The physical impacts are also considered to be serious in swamplands, particularly peat
swamps, but the incidence of planned new roads in such terrain is relatively low.
B). Impacts on the biological environment.
in this case, interest is mainly focussed on the indigenous fauna and flora. Thus, any new road
through the remaining forests of the region, whether in the mountains or the swamps, is likely
to have major negative impacts, due to:
- damage to fragile ecological habitats;
. illegal hunting of endangered and protected wildlife;
.  the negative effect of the barrier imposed by the road, and habitat fragmentation.
In section 1.4 it was noted that there is still widespread hunting or capture of wildlife for a
variety of purposes, and clearly any improvement of access into the remaining forests is likely
to increase such activities.
C). Impacts on the socio-economic environment.
Two very different situations are envisaged here. In already intensively used terrain, such as
fertile agricultural areas or on the outskirts of towns, there may be problems of land acquisition
wherever a new road is constructed or an existing road is widened. Some of the major social
impacts caused by road projects are:
*                                                         15



* compulsory acquisition of land, property and business;
*  economic losses for affected individuals and farm families;
temporary or permanent loss of income for subsistence;                                        I
* people with fewer resources and skill become more vulnerable;
*  social and family disruption due to displacement and relocation;-
*  loss of community benefits and social disintegration .
Following construction, the new road may provide opportunities for new settlement, and there
is commonly appreciation in real estate values. These issues require proper management by     -
local government to prevent ribbon development.
In more remote areas, the issues are very different:                                             I
*  disruption of traditional land use practices and impacts induced by altering land use
pattems;
 disruption to indigenous and isolated communities, who may be disadvantaged by land
speculation, in-migration, or allocation of concessions.
These problems are discussed more fully below and in Section 4.6.
2.3 Isolated Communities                                                                        ;
Both the World Bank and the Govemrnment of Indonesia (GOI) have a special concern for
communities who have been disadvantaged, or left behind, in the development process, but their
views differ in the identification of these peoples. The World Bank focus of concern has been
"indigenous peoples", while the GOI's has been "isolated peoples" (suku (erasing). In some
cases the two are synonymous, but they are not identical.                                       I
The World Bank identifies "indigenous peoples" as ".,.social groups with a social and cultural
identity distinct from the dominant society that makes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged   j
in the development process" (Operational Directive 4.20). The concern of the World Bank is
that peoples so identified share in the development process, but in a manner which does not
disrupt or damage their unique socio-cultural heritage.                                         I
"Isolated peoples" in the eyes of the GOI are not necessarily culturally or ethnically different
but are physically residing in remote areas having poor communications. Hence Javanese 3
communities in mountainous regions of Java which are accessible only by footpaths are
"isolated" but are not socially or culturally distinct from lowland Javanese communities (i.e.
not "indigenous peoples" according to the World Bank definition),
The focus of transport planning is to provide, as far as economically feasible, equitable
transport access to all communities. Thus as previously discussed in an earlier review of the
Kabupaten Roads Program (IBRD 1994), it is more appropriate to use the Indonesian concept
of Masyarakat terasing as defined by the GOI Dept. of Social Welfare:
16



The Masyarakat ferasing are the people who have the same physical, social and
cultural characteristics, live in areas that are difficult to reach, remote (terpencil),
scattered (terpencar) so that they experience a social and cultural gap (kesenjangan)
that has caused their welfare to be very low and disadvantaged (terbelakang).
I                       The term terasing for this use has the meaning as a static condition (kondis, statis) and
remote or isolated from outside groups of people who are more advanced so that there
is little interaction with and influence from outside groups. The condition of the
masyarakat terasing is still well below national socioeconomic averages,
The only addition is special attention to peoples who are not only "isolated" but as a result of
their isolation have developed unique cultural characteristics, such as a distinct, language,
religious beliefs, or other distinct socio-cultural forms. Improvements in tratnsportation
infrastructure linking these peoples to a more dominant, or the national, culture should take
I                care not to disturb unduly the existing socio-cultural values of the peoples. Undertaken with
proper precautions, development of an integrated transportation network should be able to
serve the GOI purposes of equitable development of national transportation infrastructure while
maintaining cultural diversity.
To achieve the latter, regional transportation development should be based upon informed
participation by all affected groups and communities. Preferences of local communities,
especially those with unique socio-cultural attributes, should be carefully weighed with
economic, political and environmental factors in the development of a regional integrated
I                transport network. In the case of transport links affecting distinctive cultures, special
development plans may need to be considered, but in all cases community consultation should
be the norm for transportation planning (see Sections 3.5 and 5.6).
No fixed procedure for dealing with unique cultural groups with respect to regional integrated
transport development is proposed herein. Instead a sensitivity to the needs and unique situation
of indigenous peoples should be instilled within the planning system as a whole. Identification
of indigenous peoples, recognition of the unique nature and aspects of their culture, and fluid
conmmunication with communities from the planning stage through post-construction are what
is needed. In particular transport planners need to identify specific components of the culture
of indigenous peoples which might pose issues of conflict in development of transportation
links, such as land tenure practices, and then work with the communities to deternine equitable
3                options before conflicts arise.
The general guidelines of World Bank Operational Directive 4.20 provides a solid starting
point for dealing with indigenous peoples. Refinements of OD 4.20 specific to Indonesia should
be included in the first irnplementation phase of the regional transport project. For the four
provinces of the project region, it appears that only in Riau are there unique cultural groups
distinct from the dominant ethnic population. Thus the first regional transport project should
be able to develop and test in applied situations procedures for dealing with indigenous peoples
on a limited trial basis. Hence tested and refined procedures will be in place when subsequent
regional transportation projects are begun in areas such as Kalimantan and Irian Jaya which
are inhabited by numerous distinct cultural groups.

2.4 Cultural resources
Cultural resources can include a range of sites, structures and practices that have unique          |
archaeologic, historic, religious or social value. Procedures governing the chance discovery of
such artifacts during project construction are governed by Act UU 5/1992 and included in
standard Bina Marga tender documents.

3 LEGISLATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES IN INDONESIA
3.1 AMDAL Legislation
The general direction for environmental management in Indonesia is embodied in the Guidelines
for State Policy, which is the basis for the national policy on the management of natural
resources for each Repelita (Five-Year Development Plan). There are a number of general
regulations relating to environmental management, the most important being the Environmental
*.          ~ Management Act No. 4 of 1982, called the 'Basic Provision for the Management of the Living
Environment'. This act specifies responsible institutions to carry out the broad mandate of
sustainable environmental management, including the Ministry of Public Works. The AMDAL
*.              (environmental) legislation was formerly embodied in Government Regulation (PP) No. 29 of
1986, but this has now been replaced by PP No. 51 of 1993. The Regulation aims at
controlling and mitigating environmental impacts arising from any development activities.
X               AMDAL is now required to be an integrated project assessment process to coordinate the
planning and review of development projects, including all ecological, socio-economic, and
cultural components.
PP 5111993 outlines the revised AMDAL processes. For example, the Preliminary Evaluation
Report or PIL is no longer required, although often some form of field screening is necessary.
I               Procedures are now available for integrated/multisectoral evaluations (AMDAL Kegiatan
TerpadulMultisektoral) under the authority of more than one technical agency (for example a
transmigration project integrated with conservation of the adjacent forest resource), area
I               evaluations (AMDAL Kawasan) such as an industrial estate, and regional evaluations (AMD)AL
Regzonal) which would include various interrelated activities under the jurisdiction of more
3               than one agency, lying in one zone of a regional development planning area.
Development activities that are predicted to have significant impacts are described, together
with the types of impacts that are considered to be significant. It is categorically stated that the
I               AMDAL process shall form part of the feasibility study for a proposed activity. It stipulates
that the expenses to prepare AMDAL documents shall be included in the budget of the proposed
activity and shall be borne by the proponent, and also that the environmental management and
I               monitoring costs shall be charged to the operational budget of the relevant activity.
KEP-]]/MENLH/3/]994 Appendix I lists the development activities that require AMDAL
|               studies. In the highways sector, full EIA studies (ANDAL. RKL, RPL) are required for:
* new construction of toll roads;
|               .  fly-overs;
interurban roads greater than 25 kmn in length;
*  urban roads greater than 5 km; and
I-              .  betterment outside the right-of-way (DAA4JA) for urban and metropolitan roads greater
than 5 km in length.
3               For kabupaten roads, and road projects of smaller dimension than listed above, including
capacity expansion projects, a preliminary level of screening is required to determine the
l
*                                                      '9



possible extent of impact on fragile/sensitive areas and/or the need for resettlement and
compensation. All activities bordering a protected area as listed in Appendix 11 of KEP-
11/1994 also require AMDAL. The AMDAL screening process in Bina Marga lists 20                 I
categories of sensitive areas as listed in the screening flow-chart as shown below.
Clearly the list of sensitive areas is comprehensive, and it mnight be interpreted to includle 
almost any terrain. It does, however, emphasize the commitment of Bina Marga to address the
environmental legislation. For project purposes, it is assumed that steep slopes refer to slopes
>40% (or to RePPProT land systems that are classified as having slopes in this category). Area  I
of significant social impact is taken to include urban and 'peri-urban' areas (the latter term is
used to describe both the outer fringes of towns and the ribbon development that has often
occurred along main roads), but a distinction is made in the preliminary evaluation (section 5)  I
between intensively used land (productive land, especially arable land) and extensively usi d
land (tree crops, shifting cultivation etc.).                                                  I
For new construction projects which traverse sensitive environments, an environmental field
study will be completed (Kajian Lingkungan or KL). Where this study determines that
significant impacts are expected, a full EIA (ANDAL) will be required. The KL will provide    I
inputs for the preparation of the Terms of Reference for the ANDAL study. Environmental
management and monitoring plans (RKL and RPL) shall be prepared as separate documents
together with the ANDAL.
The developing agency is responsible for imnplementing and providing the budget for the RKL
and RPL, although it is generally required to work together with associated institutions for the  |
post-construction management. However the supervision and reporting on the implementation
of the plans is the responsibility of a team that is set up either by the responsible Minister for
national projects, or the Governor for provincial projects. Supervision costs are borne by the
institutions comprising this team.
Guidelines for the compilation of AMDAL studies are contained in Kep-14/MENLH13/1994.         3
Where the construction activity is considered to have negligible environmental impacts, or have
significant impacts that can be handled through standard technical procedures, environmental
management shall be covered by standard environmental management and monitoring
procedures (UKE and UPL) as directed by Kep-12/MENLH13/1994. UKL and UPL are not
subject to evaluation by the AMDAL commission, but are the responsibility of the concerned
agency. The guidelines issued by Bina Marga for the preparation of UKL and UPL are general
in nature, but the Central Technical Consultancy (CTC) for Kabupaten roads has prepared
sectoral environmental studies (see Section 4.2) that have been adopted generally as guidelines
for the management of minor environmental impacts (Hoff & Overgaard et al 1992).              3
Guidelines for the deterrnination of significant impacts are contained in BAPEDAL Decree
05613/1994. In summary, these relate to criteria of number of people affected, areal extent of  -
impact, duration of impact, intensity of impact, number of other components affected by 3
impact, cumulative nature of impact, and reversibility/irreversibility of impact.

3.2 Spatial Plans
In February 1990 a Spatial Planning Team was formed on the authority of Keppres 57/1989 to
develop a set of guidelines for compiling spatial plans (Pedoman Penyusuan Rencana Tata
Ruang, 1990). The result of this was the national Spatial Planning Act No. 24 of 1992
(Undang-undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 24 Tahun 1992 tentang Penataan Ruang).
The Spatial Planning Act specifically incorporates the environmental management principles
set forth in the Basic Law of the Living Environment No. 4 of 1982 (Preface) and the 1990
Basic Law on the Conservation of the Living Environment and Ecosystems No. 5 of 1990
(Elucidation Preamble, part 5). Within the Act the conditions of spatial use management are
given as the integrated, environmentally sound and sustainable utilization of natural and man-
made resources in an efficient, effective and appropriate way, to improve the quality of human
resources, to embody the protection function of space, and to prevent as well as overcome
negative environmental impacts (Article 3).
Spatial use management is based upon the primary functions of the area encompassing the
protection area (kawasan lindung) and the cultivation area (kawasan budidaya) (Article 7). In
addition to land space, spatial use management includes sea and air space to the extent as
provided for in applicable legislation (Article 9). Spatial use management may be ecosystem
based, and as such may overlap administrative boundaries. The same is true for transport
planning. Where spatial use mnanagement covers more than one kabupatenlkotamadya (Dati-Il),
it is to be coordinated by the Govemor as head of the province (Dati-)). Spatial use
management covering more than one province is to be coordinated by a Minister assigned to
such duty by the President (Articles 8 and 29). Spatial use management is to be implemented in
stages with identified strategic and prioritized areas (Articles 10 & 11).
This Act has introduced spatial planning and spatial use management as central concepts
within government planning. Spatial use management is to be undertaken through a process
and procedure of preparing and adoptinrg a spatial plan based on provisions in applicable
legislation (Article 13). According to the Act, spatial planning and spatial use management are
to be undertaken at the national, provincial and kabupaten levels. The process of spatial
planning is top down from macro to micro level planning.
The National Spatial Plan is prepared in the perspective of the next 25 years, with elaboration
in five-year space utilization programs for incorporation within the cycle of the Five-Year
Development Plans (REPELITA). Subsequently, each five-year space utilization program is
further elaborated into annual development activities in line with the fiscal year (Elucidation,
Article 20). Broad national spatial plans are prepared using a territorial map of the country at
the minimum scale of 1: 1,000,000 (Elucidation, Article 19, para. 2).
Within the framnework of the National Spatial Plan, each province prepares its own Spatial
Plan with a fifteen-year perspective. T'his plan is further elaborated into five-year space
utilization programs to be incorporated into the PELITA of the province. Elaboration into
annual development activities is subsequently prepared in line with the fiscal year (Elucidation,
Article 21). Somewhat more specific than national spatial plans, provincial spatial plans are
prepared using a map at the minimum scale of 1: 250,000 (Elucidation, Article 19, para. 2).
22



In line with the directions and policies in the spatial plans at the national and provincial levels,
each kabupaten and municipal district prepares a Spatial Plan for a time period of ten years.
I                Further elaboration is on a five year basis of space utilization programs for incorporation into
the kabupaten/kotamadya PELITA. Annual development activities are further elaborated for
inclusion in the annual fiscal year plans and budget (Elucidation, Article 22). Kabupaten
I                spatial plans, while still somewhat general in scope, are prepared on the basis of a map at the
minimum scale of 1: 100,000, with spatial plans for municipal districts being based upon a
map at the minimum scale of 1: 50,000 (Elucidation, Article 19, para. 2).
Although Dati I and II spatial plans only cover periods of fifteen years and ten years
respectively, they are to recognize rights agreements which exceed these periods. In particular
are the cases of individuals who possess 20-year Building Rights (Hak Guna Bangunan, or
HGB) or 30-year Exploitation Rights (Hak Guna Usaha or HGU (Elucidation, Articles 21
and 22). This has implications with respect to land acquisition for road widening and
I                construction of new roads.
Use rights for forestry, mining or fisheries, whether based on legislation or traditional law and
common practice, are to be acknowledged within the spatial plans, but they are not immutable.
Spatial plans can include spatial use management other than that currently existing. In cases
"          ~~~~where they can prove that they are directly harmned as a result of the implementation of
development activities in accordance with spatial plans, rights holders of the land and of
natural resources management are to be given fair compensation. Rights over space means
rights to utilize land, sea and air space (Elucidation, Article 4, para. 2).
hndividual and community participation in the spatial planning and spatial use management
processes are clearly considered to be central since references to them are found throughout the
Act. According to Article 4 it is the right of every person: a) to know spatial plans; b) to
participate in the preparation of a spatial plan; and c) to receive fair compensation for any loss
arising from the implementation of development activities complying with the spatial plan. It is
further stated that spatial use management shall be undertaken by the Government with
community participation (Article 12). The Government is to announce and disseminate the
spatial plans to the people, along with creating and developing awareness and responsibility of
3               the people through extension works, guidance, education and training (Article 25).
Public participation is further reinforced in the Elucidation of the aforementioned Articles. It is
the right of every person to participate in spatial use management through expression of ideas,
recommendations or objections to the government concerning spatial use management
(Elucidation, Article 4). Communities have the role as partners to the government in spatial use
management, and should express their ideas as a means to carry out public participation in
I               order to achieve the objectives of spatial use management (Elucidation, Article 12).
Dissemination of information regarding spatial use management to the community is to be
undertaken openly through the media. Furthermore, there should be development of community
participation and improvement in the quality of space undertaken through extension programs,
guidance, education and training in a continuous manner for every level of the government and
community strata (Elucidation, Article 25).

Spatial plans are general so do not require extreme details of exact management activities for
specific areas to be included, but rather a set of goals and programs to achieve these goals.
Further details should be forthcoming in annual workplans and budgets addressing these goals
and programs.
Unfortunately there is a serious lack of understandi.ng of the concept and objectives of spatial
planning. The current so-called spatial planning documents are barely more than a continuation
of the old sectoral planning strategy which has proven unsatisfactory for integrated transport
planning. Hence there is a need for both provincial and kabupaten training to improve       .1
understanding of what spatial planning and spatial use management mean, and how to organize
and implement integrated spatial management plans. This training should iniclude:             |
1)    Clear explanations of the concepts "sf atial", "spatial planning", "spatial use
management" and "natural and human-use regions" (kawasan lindung and kawasan
budidava).
a)     Explanation that spatial planning is not based upon administrative boundaries,  3
but upon appropriate natural or human-use regions.
b)     Explanation that spatial planning is not sectoral planning, but looks at the role
of each sector in sustainable management of identified spatial regions.         I
2)     Discussion of the importance of using a spatial planning approach to obtain
sustainable use management of natural and human resources. 
3)    With respect to the transport planning component of spatial planning:                   3
a)     Transport planning should be integrated multi-modal, not sectoral.
b)     The present transport network should be superimposed upon the map showing       i
the identified natural and human use regions. Subsequently an assessment
should be made of the degree to which the existing network serves the
objectives of the identified spatial regions. 
c)     Future transport network development should be planned keeping in mind the
objectives of the spatial plan.                                                 3
The Spatial Planning Act contains a good set of principles embodying the concepts of spatial
use and management of the environment. Weakness with regard to the legislation lies primarily  3
with its practical implementation at the local  levels of government.  From the macro
perspective spatial planning is top-down. A national spatial plan is drawn up, following which
an individual provincial spatial plan is prepared within the framework of the national plan.
Subsequently, each kabupaten prepares its spatial plan within the framework of the provincial
plan. Unfortunately mechanisms for information to go upward do not function very smoothly.

I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the same time that the spatial planning process is top-down, the legislation calls for
individual and community participation in both its planning and its management. This is a
commendable principle, but it is doubtful that it has been carried out in practice. The text of
the legislation provides no indications of how public involvement is supposed to occur.
|               Directives call for Dati-I and Dati-JI to undertake integrated spatial planning, which in
practical terms means BAPPEDA Dati-I and Dati-Il calling together local representatives of all
the sectoral agencies to assist them. Within the government structural system there is no
U.              tradition of public forum to provide community input into what is perceived to be government
planning. Similarly the iegislation calls for public announcements of spatial plans, although it
is doubtful that any non-government official has ever seen a copy of a spatial plan.
The Spatial Planning Act calls for the development of community participation in spatial use
management through extension programs, guidance, education and training in a continuous
U               manner. However, again the legislation does not provide any instructions for accomplishing
this. Development of community participation in spatial use management is an important role
which can be played by this project for integrated regional transportation. Further discussion
I               of community participation is discussed in Section 3.5.
3.3 Land Acquisition
Road expansion (widening) and network extension requires acquisition of land Where the land
is government owned (tanah negara) this involves obtaining a release from the appropriate
3               governnent agency responsible, usually either the National Land Board (Badan Pertanahan
Nasional - BPN) or the Forestry Department (Departmen Kehutanan), but does not require
any monetary compensation. Problems arise when the land to be acquired is privately owned
3               (tanah milik).
The national Basic Agrarian Law of 1960 (Undang-undang Agraria No. 5, 1960) contains the
principle of "eminent domain" under which private land can be expropriated by the govermnent
"for the good of the public". But until Presidential Decree Number 55 of 1993 (Keppres 55)
there was no formal mechanism for land acquisition. Previously land required for the "public
interest", such as for physical infrastructure development, was through compulsory acquisition.
Keppres 55 now requires conimunity consultation and consensus agreement on "fair"
compensation for land and other immovable properties expropriated. Keppres 55 complies with
|              the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30.
Keppres 55/1993 revokes previous ministerial decrees, and the process is elaborated in
Implementation Directive 1/1994 of the State Minister for Agrarian Affairs/Chairman of BPN.
Only if the required area is less than 1.0 ha may the developing agency acquire the land
directly. The basic procedure is as follows:
I              i. The developing agency submits a request to the governor/bupati/mayor (as appropriate) to
release land.
ii  This official issues a decree announcing that the land is to be released for the project, and
*                  instructs the Land Acquisition Committee (commonly known as the 'committee of nine')
through the Bupati or Mayor to prepare an inventory of land, buildings and trees.
I
31                                                    25



iii. The committee is required to inventorize land, buildings, crops, investigate legal status,
assess and advise amount of compensation, give information to the land right holders, and
as an internediary to arrange direct consultations (musyawarah) between land holders and
the developing agency, to reach agreement on form/amount of compensation, and to
recommend to the Govemor rates of compensation for various classes of land. These are      3
supposed to be based on current prevail ng values.
iv. The governor issues another decree stating the rates of compensation for various classes of
land and other properties. The proportion of the amounts paid depends on the actual rights
held.
v. The property owners are offered their compensation, although they may decide not to
accept the rates offered. There are procedures for grievances.
vi. If the owners accept, they are given tims to vacate. Farmers may continue to cultivate the
land until such time as it is required for mplementation.
On a major project, this may be a lengthy procedure. An estimate was made of six to seven     I
months for the North Java Road Improvement Project (Indro Djarwo 1995).
Keppres 55 specifies compensation rates for land held under formal govermment rights (hak) in  I
accordance with the Basic Agrarian Law of 1960. Compensation rates are:
1)    HakMilik (Right of Ownership)                                                           l
- 100% valuation - with land certificate
- 90% valuation - without land certificate
2)    Hak Guna Usaha (Right of Exploitation)
- 80% valuation - if rights still valid and well cultivated
- 60% valuation - if rights expired but land still cultivated                   I
- 0% valuation - if rights expired and land not well tended
3)    Hak Guna Bangunan (Right of Building)                                                   3
- 80% valuation - if rights still valid
- 60% valuation - if rights expired but land still used by rights holder
4)    Hak Pakai (Rights of Use)
- 100% valuation - if unlimited period of validity and land used
- 70% valuation - if utilization rights are up to 10 years                       |
- 50% valuation - if rights expired but land still used by the holder
5)     Wakaf (Religious/Community Use Land)                                                    |
- 100% valuation - with the provision that compensation shall be given im the
form of land, building and equipment.
Unfortunately compensation rates for land held through customary (adat) tenure are not
stipulated in Keppres 55, just as adat tenure is not fully recognized under the Basic Agrarian
Law of 1960. Ministry for the Environrment Act No. 10 of 1992 (Undang-Undang Nomor 10
Tahun 1992) on Population Development and Building Prosperous Families calls for a
26



guarantee of generational development of indigenous areas according to adat but does not make
any clear or specific reference to guaranteeing continuation or inheritance of land rights
according to adat.
Adat tenure includes parcels of land held by individuals, families and descent groups (extended
aimilies holding group land rights), as well as communal land (hak ulayat) owned by a
community as a whole. This is of critical importance as much of land ownership or rights
3               outside Java and the major urban areas, if the not the majority, are based on adat.
Many parcels of rural land in Sumatra have never been formally surveyed and issued with an
ownership certificate (Sertifikat Hak Milik) or any other form of government land rights issued
I. -by the BPN. Hence there needs to be a more comprehensive mechanism to cover compensation
fir adat tenure lands, as well as government tenure lands, acquired for road works. This will
require community consultation in adat land areas to develop an acceptable procedure and set
I               rates (most likely a percentage of valuation) of compensation for adat lands similar to those in
Keppres 55 for government tenure lands.
3               Under Keppres 55 there is a general system for determining the value of land, buildings and
other immovable property, such as productive trees. Each kabupaten forms a nine person Land
Release Committee headed by the Bupati or Mayor (Walikota). The basic price of land (harga
;               dasar) is determined periodically by the committee and is intended to be based on actual sales
prices during the preceding three months for 42 different types of land use and locations
(Peraturan Menteri Dalam Negeri 1/1975). Based on this, district governments prepare official
|               land price tables for their districts. The establishment of basic land prices has not been changed
significantly by Keppres 55/1993, which stipulates that the actual or real value of land should
take into account the latest Sale Value as assessed for the purpose of determining Land and
3               Building Tax (Nilai Jual Objek Pajak or NJOP). However, these prices are generally well
below market value. It has been estimated on projects carried out on Java that market value is
commonly at least 50% higher than taxable value. hn some cases, the market value was up to
four times the taxable value. NJOP is determined according to some 50 classes of land use,
ranging from high value urban and industrial properties, through intensively cultivated lands to
low quality rainfed farming land. However, the system of classification varies between regions.
I               Actual experience from urban infrastructure development projects shows a trend towards more
realistic rates of compensation, but systems vary. The amount paid is further modified
according to tenure status (see above), and also according to the proportion of the land holding
*              that will be acquired. Those without rights occupying land in rural areas would expect to
receive only a 'settlement' (santunan), and they are at risk of receiving nothing. However, strict
observance of Law No. 24/1992 on Spatial Use Management should ensure that no group goes
uncompensated.
Compensation entitlements for loss of buildings are based on building values established by
Cipta Karya, with an allowance for depreciation of 2% per year from date of construction.
Assessments for partial loss are very complex, and also vary between districts and projects.

It is assumed that the prices in Table 3.2 correspond to the NJOP prices listed in Table 3.1. It
is interesting to observe that the price of agricultural and housing land is significantly higher in
Bukittinggi than it is in Padang, presumably owing to the generally higher levels of fertility in
the interior plains. Even unused land in Bukittinggi seems to be almost as expensive as             3
agricultural land. As expected, by contrast the price of commercial land is higher in Padang.
Another recent study in a rural area on the North Java coast gives NJOP values for buildings
as Rp 98,000/m2 for permanent houses, Rp 71,000 for semi-permanent houses and Rp 50,000
for temporary or non-permanent houses. It is interesting to note that these are significantly
lower than those quoted for West Sumatra in Table 3.3. Unit costs for trees ranged from Rp
15,000 for banana to Rp 35,000 for coconut and Rp 75,000 for kapok. Total land acquisition
and resettlement costs on this project are Rp 2,236 million, including Rp 1,750 m for
acquisition of 25 ha, Rp 270 m for purchase of 53 houses to be demolished, Rp 13 m for trees,
and Rp 203 m for adrninistrative and other costs (SMEC 1995).

Cropland is separated into cultivated and "uncultivated", but compensation rates are mostly the
same (in two cases lower). It is not exactly clear what is intended by the two categories.
Likewise, the rates for buildings are listed as per m2 or per unit, and again the meaning is not
clear (rate per sq. metre is assumed). Again it is observed that all rates are significantly higher
I               in Bukittinggi than they are in Padang, where they compare with those current in the province
generally.
3               The Comniittee is responsible for making an inventory of the land, investigating the legal status
of the land and supervising negotiations between the land owners and the agency wishing to
acquire the land. Keppres 55 also provides general instructions for conducting negotiations
with land owners, although the Committee has the right to set compensation rates if
negotiations fail. Should land owners still be dissatisfied, they may file a complaint with the
Governor, as head of the provincial government. At this point the provincial Land Release
3               Conmmittee, headed by the Governor, reviews the matter and makes a final binding settlement.
Compensation may be made in the form of money, land for replacement, relocation, or any
combination of these or other agreed forms. In practice the regulations do not specify how
compensation other than in monetary form will be effected. In particular, no procedures are
specified for relocation and resettlement.
I               In the past, monetary compensation has rarely been paid for the acquisition of land for
kabupaten road widening projects, as it is argued that the improved infrastructure is sufficient
compensation. While small farmers apparently often accept this, it can nevertheless be a major
source of dispute.
While areas of less than 1.0 ha may be handled directly by the developing agency, it is not clear
how this would apply in the case of a road widening project that perhaps involves many small
parcels of land of a few square metres each. There would clearly be logistical and
administrative advantages in permitting the project to handle land acquisition, provided that the
process is as transparent and equitable as intended by Keppres 55/1993.

In addition to the issue of rates of compensation for land held under adat tenure, there is the
issue of actual financing of compensation payments once rates are agreed upon. Other than for  3
urban road works, road project budgets have not included funds for land acquisition
compensation. Typically there has not been any compensation paid for rural and village land
taken for road works. Where it is determined that compensation must be paid for land
acquisition or loss of irmmovable property, it is left to th 3 local government to finance it. Such a
procedure poses serious problems. Local government sources of funds are limited so financing
the cost of land acquisition for road works is difficult. A further complication is the
identification of which agency of the local government should be responsible for obtaining and  -1
dispersing compensation funds. Finally there is the question of how the local government is to
determine the funds needed for an activity undertaken by a sectoral agency. 
Keppres 55/1995 is clearly still open to interpretation Very recently, there were protests in
Tangerang (West Java) over the lack of compensation tor land in a road widening project, but
the land holders were informed that the "rule of not compensating residents is based on a 1993  I
presidential rule on plots affected by the public interest" (Jakarta Post 22 August 1996). They
were informed that they were only entitled to corpensation for buildings and plants. The
situation in Tangerang is presumably a result of inadequate funds being made available in the  I
original development budget, because under the Spatial Planning Law (No. 24/1992),
everybody has rights to reasonable compensation if the development activity is in accordance
with the spatial plan.
In summation, it is recommended that Bina Marga needs to:
1)    address the issue of compensation for acquisition of land held under adat tenure,
2)    refine the consultation procedure for determination of land acquisition rates, and       ;
3)    include the costs of land acquisition, loss of immovable property and moving buildings
in road works project budgets, or assist the local government in obtaining adequate     |
funds for this purpose.
Finally it should be noted that the total emoluments to the Commriittee to cover fees and costs  i
amount to 4% of the total estimated compensation; this is charged to the agency requiring the
land.
In certain cases land acquisition for road works will require relocation, or resettlement, of
people who have been displaced. The cost of resettlement may become another financial
consideration. The broader issue of resettlement is discussed in the following section.        |
3.4 Resettlement
The World Bank has particular concern for people displaced by development activities. It has
established an Operational Directive (OD 4.30) to provide guidelines for what is referred to as
"involuntary resettlement". Any project that involves land acquisition should be reviewed for
potential resettlement requirements, hence all road projects must review the possibility of
resettlement early in their project cycle.
30



l
The OD 4.30 guidelines provide a good set of principles as a starting point for managing
resettlement. They include policy considerations in project design and preparation:
1)    Involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized through exploration of all
viable alternatives, including realignment of roads.
2)    Where displacement is unavoidable, resettlement plans should be developed which
provide displaced people with sufficient resources and opportunities to share in the
benefits of the project. This should include adequate compensation for losses,
assistance in relocation and assistance in re-establishing their lives in the new location.
3)     Community participation is required ir planning and implementing resettlement.
4)     There must be social and economic integration of resettlers into host community.
5)     Land, housing, infrastructure and other compensation must be provided to resettlers.
3               Where road works projects will result in forced relocation of displaced peoples, Resettlement
Actions Plans (RAP) will need to be prepared. Guidelines for preparing RAP in Indonesia are
available already (ADB 1995) so the discussion herein will focus on specific issues of who are
f               likely to be displaced by road works projects and when there is likely to be a need for a formal
resettlement plan.
Road development (particularly widening) typically displaces single families or individuals,
rather than whole communities. In such cases formal resettlement plans should not be required,
but there should be a guarantee that compensation is adequate to allow the displaced people to
3               find suitable replacement homes and land by themselves. Adequate compensation should be
defined as that which allows the displaced family to build or purchase an equivalent home or
land within the same community. The displaced family should not be forced to move to another
community or area simply because it is cheaper, although the displaced family should be
allowed the option to use the compensation payment to relocate to another community should
they so desire.
To ensure that a displaced person or family is able to obtain in the same community a
replacement home/land equivalent to that lost, sometimes compensation might best take the
form of a property exchange, or property and cash, rather than a wholly cash compensation
paymnent. In such cases there will need to be a procedure through which an appropriate piece
of available property is located and an assessment made to determine if it is equivalent in
quality and value to that lost. Selection of replacement property should be done in open
I               consultation with the displaced parties to ensure their acceptance of the identified replacement
property. Subsequently there will need to be a clear procedure for purchase of the replacement
property and orderly legal transfer of this property in exchange for that needed for transport
purposes.

Post-construction settlement
Following construction, there should be separate consideration of people who have resettled:
1)    "illegally" along the new links in restricted areas,                                   3
2)    in an uncontrolled manner along the new links and whose settlement subsequently has
become a problem, and
3)    along new links that provide access to environmentally sensitive areas, leading to such
deleterious activities as forest clearance, illegal logging and wildlife poaching.    3
All thr e of these are due to lack of proper spatial planning and management by local
govermment authorities, rather than being caused directly by development of the road. This
places resettlement responsibility in these instances with the provincial or kabupaten       I
BAPPEDA as the local government agency responsible for management within the
determiination of the region's spatial plan. Hence any Resettlement Action Plans for these post-
construction settlers should be developed and implemented by the local government rather than  I
Bina Mlarga.
3.5 Community Consultation                                                                   |
There are a number of aspects of community consultation which are of concern to this project
and integrated transport planning. First among these is community participation in the spatial  I
plan. According to Article 4 of the Spatial Planning Act No. 24 of 1992 it is the right of every
person: a) to know spatial plans; b) to participate in the preparation of a spatial plan; and c) to
receive fair compensation for any loss suffered arising from the implementation of development  I
activities complying with the spatial plan. It is further stated that spatial use management shall
be undertaken by the Govermnent with community participation (Article 12). In practice, it is
questioned whether community consultation has been carried out regularly in road development
projects, and there are no indications within the text of this legislation of how public
involvement is supposed to occur.
One mechanism for community consultation which exists within the Ministry of Home Affairs
administrative planning structure is that of P5D (Pedoman Penyusunan Perencanaan dan
Pengendalian Pembangunan di Daerah or Guidelines for Preparing and Managing                  I
Development in the Regions). This is supposed to be the first step in the annual govenmment
development planning cycle, but it appears to be often forgotten. Theoretically the annual cycle
has six steps as follows: 
1. First Step:      Discussion on development projects by the people at the village level
(Musyawarah Pembangunan Tingkat Desa/Kelurahan or                        |
MUSBANG).
2. Second Step:     Meeting on development at the kecamatan level (Temu Karva
Pemnbangunan Tingkat Kecamatan).
32                                                    3



3. Third Step:       Meeting on development coordination at the kabupaten level (Rapat
3                                   Koordinasi Pembaingztnan (Rakorbang) Daerah Tingkcat If).
4. Fourth Step:      Meeting on development coordination at the provincial level (Rapat
Koordinasi Pembamngunan (Rakorbang) Daerah Tinglalt I).
5 Fifth Step:        Consultation on regional development (Konszdltasi Regional
Pembangunan) at the national level.
6. Sixth Step:       Consultation on national development (Konsultasi Nasionvi
Penmbangunan) at the national level.
If this were implemented correctly, the P5D planning system would appear to be an ideal forum
for comnnunity participation and consultation, but with respect to integrated transport
I              development planning there is an inherent weakness in the P5D system. The system is strictly
bottom up and assumes that project ideas originate with and are planned by the Institution for
Village Resilience (LK;D) and then submritted upward to kecamatan authorities. While
|              community consultation is desirable, it can not be expected that villagers have this capacity.
Kabupatens are the lowest fully functional level of govemment, meaning the lowest
administrative level which has sectoral agencies and technical staff such as road engineers and
regional planners. Likewise, it is the lowest level for which spatial planning is undertaken.
Integrated transport planning, which is a component of spatial planning, thus can not be
coordinated below the kabupaten level. Hence transport planning and project proposals must
begin at the kabupaten level and go down to the kecamatan and village level for community
consultation, not the other way around.
1              3.6 Utilization of Forest land
In accordance with the Decision of the Minister of Forestry Number 495/kpts-I 1/1989. release
of protected forest areas (protection or consen.ation forest) for non-forest purposes requires the
express permission of the Minister. For purposes of road construction, this will nornally
consist of permission to use, or izin pinjam pakai. The process is from the project proponent
via the Bupaif to tboe Ka-nwil Kehuitanan and finally the Governor to the Milister. Permission in
principle (izin prinsip) may be released quickly but it is dependent upon a full ANDAL study
|             being carried out and approved, prior to permission to construct being granted.

4 MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES
I.              4.1 General Considerations at the Different Phases of a Project
Environmental and social impacts due to road development can be divided into those impacts
directly caused by development of the road, which need to be managed as part of transport
planning and secondly those impacts which occur only as an indirect cause of transport
development. The latter must be taken into consideration during planning but will need to be
managed not by transport agencies such as Bina Marga, but by the local govemment.
Environmental and social issues can be divided into three planning and management phases - 1)
*               Pre-Project Planning, 2) Projecf Construction and 3) Post-Project Management. The first
phase should be the joint responsibility of the planning section of government transport
agencies and local govemment. The second phase is predominately the responsibility of the
technical section of transport agencies, and the third is primarily the responsibility of local
governmetit.
|               Pre-Project Planning
Selection of capacity expansion and network extension projects should start with the spatial
plan. Long and medium term development plans must first be synchronized with the general
priorities of the ten year (Dati-1I) or fifteen year (Dati-D) spatial plan. Subsequently transport
links selected for the annual work plan are required by law to be in agreement with the spatial
I               plan, meaning that they should be in keeping with the five year spatial use management
program of the region.
Further selection of routes and alternatives should be based upon broad social and
environmental considerations. Environmental examples would be avoidance where possible of
routes through steepland, swamp regions, forests or any designated conservation areas
identified on the spatial plan. Permission from the Minister of Forestry is required should
construction in protection or conservation forests be unavoidable. Routes through steepland
should respect the 6-10% maximum gradient of Bina Marga's own regulations. Social
examples would be the design of routes which best serve significant population centres, areas
of present and future industrial development, and areas of present or potential important
agricultural production.
Evaluation of the planned link works then needs to determine all of the specific identified social
and environmental impacts arising from the route selection. The negative impacts of
development of a particular link must be weighed against the expected positive impacts. Where
the outcome is strongly negative (i.e. there are more negative impacts than the expected positive
gains), serious efforts should be given to seeking an alternative route or construction design, or
deletion of the works from the list of proposed projects.
Communities to be affected by proposed road projects should participate in the planning of
those projects. Proper consultation in the pre-project planning stage will ensure community
acceptance of the project. Commnunity members can often provide guidance to transport
planners in choosing the best route and design to serve the local social-economic needs.
53z



l
Likewise, continued community consultation during project construction and the post-project
management of the area will lessen the likelihood of unexpected social impacts arising during    3
these phases.
Project Construction                                                                             3
During the construction phase environmental impacts are those resulting from direct physical
construction activities, such as earthworks. In addition there are the minor short term impacts
such as dust and smoke raised by construction activities. Mitigation of the former impacts
should have already been covered within the project design. Careful planning and scheduling of
implementation of physical construction activities should minimize the short term impacts.       3
The most important social impacts occurring during this phase are social-economic
displacement. Loss of land or other property is the most significant long term social impact.
Short term social impacts include inconveniences during the period of construction, as well as   I
possible health problems. For residents this may mean merely temporary difficulties in access,
and minor health problems caused by dust or disruption of water services. For shop keepers,
offices and factories this could mean a decrease in business, and subsequent loss of economic    I
opportunities, due to difficulty of access to their place of business.
Mitigation of property loss should be achieved through equitable and adequate compensation       |
and resettlement where necessary. Mitigation of short term social impacts comes from careful
planning and timely implementation. Mitigation of the disruption of access to homes and places
of business through careful timing of construction activities, and providing temporary           I
alternative routes, should minimize social-economic impacts. Likewise, careful timing of
construction activities should minimize the health hazards caused by physical construction.
Post-Proiect Mananement
After a road project has been completed there are a number of social and environmental           3
impacts which rnight arise as an indirect result of the project. These impacts arise due to poor
post-project management rather than directly as a result of the project itself.
Where projects provide new or improved access to environrnentally sensitive or protected
regions, such as conservation forests or steeply sloping land, poor post-project management of
the region can result in serious negative impacts such as                                        |
* illegal conversion of forests for agricultural uses,
* human settlement of environmentally inappropriate or restricted areas, |
*  erosion of steep slopes,
*  illegal logging and uncontrolled harvesting of forest products,                              1
*  poaching of endangered species, etc.
Such negative impacts are ongoing and may spread and increase in severity if uncontrolled.
I

l
Even in areas which are not environmentally sensitive, poor post-project management of the
region can lead to serious negative impacts. Uncontrolled ribbon development along new or
nimproved road links can lead to environmental problems. Even more important in such
instances are the unintended social impacts. Unplanned and uncontrolled human settlements
along new or improved road links can result in negative health impacts due to inadequate water
I                and sanitary infrastructure, and dangerous traffic conditio is affecting both pedestrians and
vehicles, among other potential social-economic impacts.
Responsibility for negative post-project impacts is generally not the fault of the agency which
implemented the improvement, but rather it lies with the local governnent. Local government
has responsibility for spatial use management within the region under its administration.
I          ~    Planning and controlling development of the lands adjacent to new roads is primarily the
management responsibility of the BAPPEDA as the administr tive arm of the Bupati/ Govemor
who heads the local government.
Secondary responsibility for post-project management also falls within the duties of the
National Land Board (BPN) and the Forestry Department. The former is responsibile for
I               issuance of permits for non-forest land use and as such must be held partially accountable for
allowing uncontrolled development of human settlements along new or improved roads.
Likewise, the Forestry Department is responsible for management of all lands within the
official Forest Region (kawasan hutan) and hence is partially accountable for allowing illegal
or uncontrolled activities to occur in forests near the roads.
Reduction in post-project environmental and social impacts will only come about through co-
operative spatial management on the part of local government, BPN and the Forestry
Department, with participation by members of local communities. The role of transport
agencies such as Bina Marga will be to maintain good communications and planning links with
these three agencies and local communities so that all parties have full advance knowledge of
upcoming projects. The Forestry Department must be made fully aware at the planning stage of
any proposed road through regions under its jurisdiction, especially protection or conservation
forests, and of the expected negative impacts for which it must make definitive plans for
control. With advance knowledge of proposed transport project activities and community
participation, BAPPEDA, BPN and the Forestry Department should be able to prevent serious
post-project social and environmental impacts from arising.
4.2 Projects having No Significant Environmental Impacts
A large number of road projects are small-scale and do not have significant negative
environmental or social impacts. They fall outside the criteria of projects requiring full EIA
*               studies as determined according to KEP-] 1/MENLH1/3/994 (see section 3.1). A methodology
has been prepared to handle the environmental management of these through the IBRD-funded
Rural Roads and Kabupaten Roads Development Projects (ref Hoff & Overgaard 1992,
1993), and this has become accepted practice for road projects at kabupaten level. The
methodology involves Sectoral Environmental Assessment ("Umbrella PILs') and
Management. Six types of sub-projects are covered:
l



* Type Dw (direct impacts only, with widening - these cover upgrading and widening of
roads that are already open to 4-wheel vehicles);                                         1
Type Dnw (direct impacts only, with no widening);
Type Db (bridge construction projects on roads already open to 4-wheel vehicles);
Type IDnr (new road construction involving both direct and some indirect impacts but not  |
passing through an area listed as sensitive according to the legislation);
Type IDw (upgrading with widening of existing roads that were not previously open to 4-
wheel vehicles, and which therefore may have some indirect impacts, but the roads do not
pass through sensitive areas);
Type IDb (bridge construction on existing roads that were not previously open to 4-wheel
vehicles).                                                                             .5
The management measures required to handle the minor negative impacts of these types of
projects are mostly incorporated into the existing Technical Guidelines and Specifications for
Kabupaten roads, namely:
Technical Guidelines for Engineering Survey and Design for Betterment of Kabupaten        |
Roads;
i  Technical Guidelines for Design of Kabupaten Bridges;
*  Standard Specifications for Kabupaten Road Betterment and Maintenance Works;              5
-  General Specifications for Kabupaten Bridges;
* Technical Guidelines for Site Supervision and Quality Control of Kabupaten Road and
Bridge Construction.                                                                      |
Extracts from these documents are included in Hoff & Overgaard (1992) and clearly
demonstrate that environmental matters are included. Likewise, the environmental monitoring
will be part of the normal supervision activities, by ensuring that the guidelines are correctly
followed.
The Sectoral Assessment methodology is applicable to, and under the current legislation serves
as the UKL and UPL for, all road sub-projects that are screened as having only minor impacts,
that do not require any further assessment (i.e. do not require Kajian Lingkungan). Although
designed to be applicable to kabupaten roads, it is of course equally applicable to village roads,
and there is no reason why it cannot be applied to small-scale betterment projects on national
and provincial roads providing that the criteria are confornable. Indeed interim standard
environmental mitigation measures for national and provincial roads have been drawn up in     X
draft (Seksi AMDAI Bipram 1993), based on the kabupaten roads model, and it is
recommended that the ISEM project will ensure that these are finalized and issued as Standard
Operating Procedures.
However, while the guidelines cover all aspects of sound engineering practice, the sectoral
assessments do not cover management of negative impacts on the biological and social        I
components. By definition, these are classified as minor on such projects, but the impacts may
still require management.
l
l
3x 



In the case of the biological component, careful screening should ensure that the impacts
consist of no more than the direct loss of flora and fauna caused by land clearing, while
I                 impacts on the biological composition of water bodies will be covered by proper
implementation of the technical guidelines (culverts, pollution avoidance etc.). Where more
significant and indirect impacts are predicted (such as improved access into forest areas), the
I                  sub-project is not covered by the sectoral approach, and a KL will be necessary (leading either
to ANDAL or to project-specific UKL/UPL).
In theory, the minor social impacts of these small projects are covered by the legislation for
land acquisition (see Section 3.3). In practice, compensation has very rarely been paid for land
acquired in the kabupaten road programme, because the affected people have been encouraged
to accept that their minor losses are for the benefit of the community in general. This is an
unsatisfactory situation, and it is recommended that under RRPTA there should be full
observance of Keppres 55/1993. If widening is involved, although the individual pockets of
land along the length of the road may be very small, it is unlikely that the total area required
will be less than 1.0 ha (which would permit acquisition to be handled by the developing
agency). It might however be argued that the land required lies within the existing Right-of-
Way (Damija), and that therefore there is no necessity to compensate for the land. This is
clearly a source of potential dissatisfaction. Even if no compensation is made for land, it is still
required to be paid for loss of crops, buildings or business facilities.
It is recommended that the Ministry of Public Works should prepare guidelines or an
operational directive for the implementation of Keppres 55/1993 on projects under its
5                 jurisdiction. This might, for example, become an output of the current ISEM project. It is also
recommended, in view of the importance of the issues concerned, that adequate implementation
of Keppres 55 might become a condition of any future loan funding.
4.3 Projects having Significant Environmental Impacts
Many of the identified sub-projects listed in the tables in Section 6 are classified as having
significant impacts in at least one component, in at least one segment of the proposed corridor.
For these, the reconmmended procedure is for a preliminary field screening (Kajian Lingkungan
or KL). This will determine whether a full ANDAL is required, in which case the data collected
will assist in the preparation of the Terms of Reference (KA). If an ANDAL is not required, the
negative impacts can be handled by project-specific UKIJUPL. These documents will be
prepared based on the findings of the study, and thus they will differ from those covered by
sectoral assessments discussed in the previous sections. Even where the criteria dictate that an
ANDAL is mandatory, this preliminary KL is still recommended as a general procedure.
Enviromnental assessment is required as early as possible in the project development cycle.
Ideally the phasing should be as shown below. A factor to be considered in the phasing is the
requirement for permission to be obtained from the Minister of Forestry before road
construction can proceed in Protection or Conservation Forest (see Section 3.5). All such sub-
projects are identified as requiring ANDAL.

4.4 Significant Impacts not req. iiring full ANDAL.
There may be circunstances in which the preliminary assessment may confirm that although         I
the predicted impacts are significant, a fMll evaluation is unnecessary. Examples are given
below:
a) Steepland. Where the only significanct impact that has been predicted is related to steep
terrain, and the terrain is already cleared of forest, it is expected that the standard
guidelines for road construction in steep terrain will be sufficient to handle the affects on  I
erosion, watershed protection etc. This would apply to the construction or upgrading of
roads in mountain areas that have already lost their forest cover for several decades, and
no longer provide a watershed protection function. Project-specific UKL would be drawn       I
up that focus on implementation of the appropriate guidelines. Full ANDAL would
however be required where the steep terrain still has a forest cover, or where there may be
impacts on vulnerable isolated communities living within the mountains.
b)  Areas still having a protective forest status (protection or conservation forest) but which
have long lost the vegetation cover for which this status was originally applied. There are  I
many areas classified as Hutan Lindung or even Cagar Alam but which are totally
deforested, even farmed, and which no longer serve any protective function. In these cases,
it would be appropriate for application to be made to the Provincial Government for         I
revisions to the Spatial Plan. In the meantime, however, even if no ANDAL is conducted,
Minister of Forestry pennission is still required.
c)  There may be cases where the planned road is associated with major developments in
another sector, either on-going or imminent, although under a different development
agency. An example might be a road through a planned oil-palm estate or pulpwood             |
concession. It would be pointless to conduct an environmental study on a planned road
through peat swamp forest, because of its impact on the flora and fauna, if the entire
forest is scheduled for early clearance for an estate. In such a situation, a multisectoral
assessment is required, but the concessionaire would be the pnrmary project proponent, not
DG Highways.
40



In each of these cases, the preliminary assessment would be submitted to the Environmental
Cornmission in the usual way, and the recommendation must be accepted that no ANDAL will
I                be executed. One objective of this will be to conserve the limited resources of manpower and
funds for those detailed environmental studies where they are really required.
|                4.5  Problems in Environmental Management
The environmental legislation is concise and practical, but experience to date indicates that
many problems remain in its implementation. It is for this reason that two separate projects are
focusing on strengthening the institutions concemed with environmental management, namely
ISEM for the environmental units within Bina Marga, and SPEM for the concemed provincial
institutions (with pilot projects in Central Kalimantan and Irian Jaya). Repeatedly it is seen that
the ANDAL reports and subsequent implementation follow "the letter but not the spirit of the
law". Comments will be made on one recent ANDAL report in illustration of this. Only the
I                Executive Summary of this report has been studied, and of course more detailed explanation of
some of the issues will have been given in the other volumes. Nevertheless, the summary is
assumed to provide a valid precis of the entire contents.
ANDAL report
The ANDAL report in question was approved this year. The proposed road of over 66 km will
have a Right-of-Way of 12 m, with a surface of 4.5 m width. It crosses 33 km of steep,
forested mountain terrain, and approximately 40 km of the route lies in a national park. The
I                summary acknowledges that the terrain is very steep, the existing footpath being difficult to
follow because it is sangat terjal, and that there is a major risk of erosion and landslides.
However, there is nowhere a description of what the actual slopes are (under the section on the
I                existing environment, slopes in the montane area are merely described as exceeding 10%, but
this presumably refers to the road gradient, not the in situ slope). Furthermore there is no
statement on highest altitude along the trace, so the reader cannot judge the magnitude of
ascent. The road begins near sea level, while spot heights along the watershed, including one
very close to the trace, exceed 2000 m On the RePPProT land system map, average slopes are
41->60%. The required forest clearance has a width of 25 m. The planned maximum gradient
of the road is 15%, with bends having a radius not smaller than 10-15 m. In addition, one of
the quarries is proposed to be sited within the park.
The significance of the wild fauna is acknowledged, but in generalities. Taking the avifauna as
an example, it refers to 140 species of birds known from the national park, of which 26 are rare
and protected. It then lists 12 species that were observed during the survey, but 8 of these are
widespread species of open country; for an expert this list is meaningless. Ornithologists know
that there are at least 12 single-island endemic bird species on Sumatra (Marle & Voous 1988),
all of them montane, and two of these are currently well-known from the region of the ANDAL
survey: Salvadori's Pheasant Lophura ignita and Schneider's Pitta Pitta schneideri. These are
two out of some half-dozen species in the region listed as threatened (Collar et al. 1994). It is
not necessary for the ANDAL consultant to have detailed knowledge of every sub-component,
but the consultant should know where to get the information (such as the Indonesian
Omithological Society, BirdLife Intemational-Indonesia, Wetlands International-idonesia,
World-wide Fund for Nature Indonesia Programme)
441



Several pages are devoted to the socio-economic and socio-cultural environment, but inevitably
this refers only to the settled areas at the start and end of the route. Clearly there is need for
infrastructural development in these areas, but the relevance to road construction through the
park is not clear. As is customary, the local population is in favour of the project.
The report structure
Overall, it is not very easy to ascertain what are the really serious impacts of the proposed
road, because the report is constrained by the official guidelines that dictate the structure, and
the procedural requirement to analyze the impact of every activity on every environmental
component. In this particular situation, it barely seems necessary to spend limited resources on
measuring pre-project levels of dust and decibels of noise, and similar components, only to
conclude that the predicted impacts will be a temporary increase of "5% or 10%" in air and
noise pollution during construction.
A result of following the official guidelines and directives is that every ANDAL report will be
very simnilar to any other, reporting on and analyzing impacts that are common to all road
projects, while the impacts which are really significant, and the substantial measures that will
be required to deal with them, tend to become lost in the body of the report. Impacts that would
normally be covered by UPL/UKL are given as much space as those that are important. Even
the Executive Summary is but a mere precis of the entire report, and fails to provide a real
summary of what is really significant. At least one summary section should be prepared that
focusses only on the major, proiect-svecific impacts and their mitigation measures.
The RKL/RPL
The recommended treatment to control erosion in the RKL is to construct retaining walls. While
more details are presumably provided in the full report, the fact appears to be overlooked that
such structures in very steep terrain would be likely to create scars in the national park
considerably greater than 25 m wide, with very large volumes of cut-and-fill. Walls are likely
to be needed both above and below the road. Besides other implications, there would be major
negative impacts on the scenic value and integrity of the park.
TIhe recommendation to reduce disturbance to the fauna and flora during construction is to
control the working hours and to lirnit the space required by the road, but the significance of
these recommnendations is not clear. In practice, project workers from outside the region are
commonly the worst offenders in taking back 'wildlife souvenirs'.
The report recognizes the potential for damage to the national park, and the recommendations
for control are quite sound: 100 m buffer zone of cultivated trees on both sides of the road,
strict supervision of the activities of people inside the park, guard posts at the park entrance
and centrally to control illegal logging or clearance (and presumably wildlife capture also
although this is not stated), and development of the economic facilities of the surrounding
communities in order to reduce the need to find work opportunities in the forest. Presumably
this is discussed in much greater detail in the RKL document. The buffer zone concept is a
l
42                                                        3



good one, although it is not clear why it needs to be much wider than the cleared trace
(supposedly only 25 m). The cultivated trees would necessarily belong to the Ministry of
I                Forestry, although the local people might be given rights to harvest their products, if this is in
accordance with the zonation system of the park.
I                The main problem is finding the key to ensuring that the recommendations are followed.
Measures proposed during construction are under the direct control of the developing agency,
and systems of monitoring are in place to ensure adherence. However, many of the most
*I *             significant measures concem the forest resources and status, which are beyond the control of
DG Highways. In this instance, a management plan for the national park will soon commence
operations, and the recommendations therefore have a chance of succeeding, but it is difficult
to envisage successful implementation in other circumstances. The implementing agency for
forestry measures would be the Dinas Kehutanan, but the budget must be provided by the
project. It is easy to construct three guard posts, but extremely difficult to ensure that they are
staffed full-time, with personnel having sufficient incentive and integrity to carry out their
tasks. The road will surely facilitate illegal wildlife trade, which is almost impossible to
control, both inside and outside reserves. Even with guard posts, there will almost certainly be
I                rampant illegal logging, harvesting of rattan etc, consequent upon the new access.
The concept to develop the economy of the surrounding communities, to be implemented by
I                PEMDA, in order to reduce the pressures on the forest, is a global concept and is far too
general to have any meaning. Presumably the road itself would contribute to this target,
although it is not always the present residents who benefit the most.
The budget for the implementation of both the RKL and the RPL must be provided by the
developing agency, but the budget for the supervision and reporting is provided by the
institutions responsible for these tasks. The source of such budget requires clarification.
In summary, even with proper implementation of the engineering guidelines and environmental
recommendations, it is doubtful whether significant physical damage to the watershed can be
avoided. The doubts concerning the capacity to preserve the integrity of the forest and the
national park are even more serious. The justification for improving the infrastructure for the
communities outside the park is apparent, but the justification for constructing the road through
the park must be balanced against the enormous environmental costs.
It is for these reasons that there are strong environmental grounds to reject any
recommendations to construct new roads in mountain forests, especially across the NW-SE
strike of the land, even where the social or economic justification exists, until there is the
institutional capacity to ensure that mitigation measures can be effectively implemented, and no
further damage to this unique heritage will occur.

4.6 Costs of ANDAL studies
The cost of an ANI)AL study should be proportional to the type of project (whether new
construction or widening of an existing road) and the degree of environmental impacts
predicted by the preliminary screening. Assuning the use of Indonesian environmental
consultants only, the cost of a full ANDAL is likely to range from between Rp 70 million up to
as much as Rp 200 million.
Costs should always be reduced as much as possible by focusing the Terms-of-Reference in   -I
order to avoid unnecessary man-months on disciplines that are peripheral to the study, that is,
issues that could equally be handled through UKL/UPT. Many environmental impacts and their
mitigation measures are common to all road projects and do not require project specific studies. 
It is to be hoped that one result of institutional strengthening (such as thi cugh the ISEM
project) will be facilitation for focusing and streamlining of ANDAL studies. As always, costs
can also be reduced by grouping studies in packets, based for example on all projects proposed  I
m one year for one province.
As a general guide, the cost of an ANDAL should not exceed 5% of the total cost of the        |
engineering design for the project (which is about 5% of the total project cost) (Suratmo 1985).
These costs refer to the study costs only. Costs proposed for environmental management and    3
monitoring, including resettlement where required, are of course additional to this. Costs are
based on conditions as prevailing at the present time, and no allowance is made for inflation.
Further discussion on scale and costs of ANDAL studies is presented in Section 5 under the
methodology proposed for the project.

5. MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES IN THE
|                PROPOSED PROJECT
5. I Methodology for Environmental/Social Screening of Proposed Road Projects
For all network extension and capacity expansion sub-project, to be implemented under the
project, a preliminary environmental and social impact screening will be required, i.e.Kajian
Lingkungan or KL. This will be done inl two stages, first through the collection of secondary
data and secondly by ground truthing.
A rapid first stage screening (desk study) will first be carried out for every proposed link on the
most up-to-date 1:50,000 topographical maps, as well as othe- mapped sources (RePPProT,
INTAG, spatial plans). Estimates will be made on the types )f terrain, land use and forest
status traversed by the link, and other parameters that can be identified from secondary
*                sources. For links through difficult terrain, preliminary alignment studies will be made, based
on the 1:50,000 maps.
The proforma illustrated in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 can be used for screening, respectively for
network extension (new construction) and capacity expansion (widening) projects. These are
preliminary forms that require to be tested during the first year of the project, and it is likely
I               that modifications will be made as a result of testing. For each item on the form, the estimated
distance in kilometres is entered. The first column is for use during the preliminary desk study,
and the second column for use during field study.
Different forms are used for network extension and capacity expansion projects because the
environmental and social parameters differ. Many criteria will be the same however. For
3                capacity expansion projects, the road already exists, and it commonly lies in already settled
terrain. The most irnportant criteria are the proposed degree of widening, and the density of the
population and land use. Social impacts predominate, and in the North Sumatra region, few
i                instances of capacity expansion will have negative impacts on restricted forest categories.
However, the widening of some roads may be constrained in highland areas by topography. By
contrast, few network extension projects will be in densely populated or intensively used areas,
I                and topography, forest cover and forest status are much more significant issues (physical and
biological impacts predominate). In some cases, there may be social impacts where new roads
are built to or near isolated villages that previously lacked road access.
The information on the profortna is intended to be indicative only, and flexibility is permitted in
the analysis. The main objective is to scope projects to determine whether an ANDAL is
required, and the likely scale of the study. Section xx below examines the scale and costs of
ANDAL studies.
The provincial transport co-ordinator would have the responsibility to ensure that the
secondary data have been collected and analyzed for each proposed project. Tables 5. 1 and 5.2
represent only a very rapid desk-bound screening carried out in order to estimate the scale of
ETA/SIA problems that may be encountered. A more careful screening would now be required
for each proposed sub-project, and a field study (KL) then canied out to confirm and expand
on the findings of the desk study. It is essential that the 1:50,000 topographic maps
45



l~~~
produced for Sumatra in the 1980s (based on 1974 air photographs) by BAKOSURTANAL
and/or JANTOP are purchased and made available for the desk study.
Screening for Network Extension Projects
In the proforma (Table 5.1) for screening network extension projects, the primary fo,.us is the
impact of new road construction, and the possible physical and biological impacts that may
result. Therefore landform is considered first, and prominence is given to forest cover and
status.
Under landform, the very steep category is based first on slopes in excess of 40%/o, but this
category is concerned mainly with mountainous terrain. In practice, commonly the summits
would exceed 1000m altitude and slopes exceed 60%. The distinction between the first two
categories ('mountainous' and 'hilly') is interpretative. Routes that follow valleys through such
terrain are evaluated as a separate category. The undulatingfrolling category is designed mainly
to encompass such terrain in the lowland plains; in practice, slopes in low rolling terrain often
exceed 40% but the irnplications for erosion are much lower than in the hills and mountains.
The topography classes were originally based on the RePPProT land systems, but to a certain
extent these have been superseded in North Sumatra by the availability of good quality
1:50,000 scale topographic maps. Percentage slopes are provided for guidance only, and
clearly the categories are open to interpretation.
Forest status analysis is measured independently of actual forest cover, and makes allowance
for not only the forest status of land that still carries a forest cover, but also for land without
forest cover that is technically under MoF control (land that has forest status according to
TGHK - 'kawasan hutan rusak'). If the analysis under land use identifies 10 km of forest, then
under forest status this 10 km sector will be classified according to three categories of forest
(which include conversion forest or 'HPK' and land with a non-forest classification). Where
land having forest status extends into deforested terrain, this is entered under the 'damaged
forest' category.
The land use categories reflect both biological and social impacts. For network extension
projects, the more important negative impacts are likely to be in forested terrain, and this is
listed first. The intensively used categories include not only the main rice-growing areas, but
also other areas of intensive cropping, such as transmigration settlements and dense stands of
tree crops. It is acknowledged that the categories may be somewhat diffuse, particularly
between the categories of 'intensive' and 'extensive' use, and between bushland (which may
include secondary forest) and forest (which includes primary undisturbed and logged forest).
Densely settled urban or suburban land is not usually encountered in network extension
projects.
For isolated villages, a proposed criterion would be that the village is separated from non-
forested and settled terrain by at least 10 km of predominantly forested, roadless terrain. This is
an arbitrary criterion and would require testing. Criteria would vary in different regions of
46



I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Indonesia, and other transport modes must also be considered. A village on a navigable river
would not be considered isolated, perhaps even if it is navigable only by canoe from the nearest
I                larger settlement. Settlements that are served only by light aircraft may or may not be
considered isolated, according to the criteria that may apply in that region. In particular, the
issue relates specifically to indigenous communities that might be vulnerable in the
I                development process, and recent settlements that have developed as a result of present or
previous logging or mining activities would not be included.
It is also required to ascertain the length of existing (motorable) road, and the land
use/settlement density of the terrain traversed. Very simple categories are used, mainly to
highlight the possible social impacts where widening is required. Where the project requires
substantial widening along a significant length of existing road, it would be better to use the
proforma for capacity expansion projects for that segmnent.
3                Screening of capacity exMansion projects.
In the proforma in Table 5.2 for screening of capacity expansion projects, slightly different
I                criteria are used. Information is required for each proposed link on:
* widening category,
I                *  present land use/vegetation cover, including 'population density',
* forest status, and
a                *  topography.
The widening categories (WI-WI 1) are those adopted for use in the project. For purposes of
environmental/social screening, these are grouped on a scale of 1 to 5 as follows:
WC 1. no widening or widening by less than l metre,
WC2. widening by 1 - 2 metres,
I               WC3. widening by 2 - 3 metres,
WC4. widening by 3 - 5 metres,
WC5. widening by over 5 metres.
The land use/settlement density categories here reflect a scale of likely social impacts according
to numbers of buildings or crops that will be displaced or destroyed. At the top end of the scale
are the purely urban locations, not only in the major cities such as Medan or Padang but also
the smaller towns. Any widening scheme in urban areas will require substantial land acquisition
and resettlement. The 'peri-urban' category is also very important, as it includes not only the
semi-urbanized surroundings of many towns, but also the 'ribbon development' that so often
occurs along existing highways. It sometimes also includes roads traversing densely populated
rice-growing areas where villages occur very frequently along the road.
I               Under capacity expansion  projects, the main criterion for topography is the extent that
widening of existing roads may be constrained by the slopes, and the need for extensive cut-
and-fill, with the environmental implications that this entails. Roads that follow the base of
steep narrow valleys are included in the steepest category.

5.2 Size and costs of AMDAL studies
Kaiian Lingkungan studies
Existing kabupaten roads that are not proposed for widening are covered by sectoral KL
studies. In project terms, this may be taken to mean that an existing road in widening category
1 (W6, W8 and W9) that traverses rural terrain in gentle topography, without restrictive forest
status, would not require any further KL study, and standard environmental/sociological
management procedures would apply. In all other cases, a field KL would be recommended,
and in most cases would be essential. The product of the KL would be either standard
management procedures (UKLIUPL) or the Terms of Reference for the ANDAL study.                3
Hoff & Overgaard (1995) give some provisional estimates of the cost of KL and ANDAL
studies. These assume the use entirely of Indonesian Consultants. For a KL on a kabupaten
road, the cost was estimated to be Rp 11,000,000, derived as follows:                         I
Senior Environmentalist @ 1 month               Rp. 6,900,000
Travel costs                                     Rp. 2,000,000
Field costs (survey, vehicle hire etc.)          Rp. 1,600,000
Incidentals                                      Rp.   500,000
Total                                            Rp. 11,000.000
The assumption is made that the one person is competent to analyze all components, including
the social issues, and to prepare either the UKL/UPL or the Terms of Reference for the        |
ANDA<. The single expert is likely to be an environmental engineer, but the primary discipline
would vary according to the nature of the project. A sociologist may be more appropriate on a
widening project. For a major project, the required professional inputs could be doubled,
allowing for more than one discipline, and the cost would be ca Rp. 18,000,000.
These figures are based on a single study and are considered to be unnecessarily high. It would
be appropriate that a consultant environmental team be engaged to undertake all the KL studies
for projects in, say, each province each year, as a single package. Where possible, consultants
for KL studies should be engaged from within the province.                                    3
Collection of secondary data assumes availability at the proponent's office of 1:50,000
topographic maps. Following the collection of secondary data, using the profonna illustrated in
Tables 5.1 and 5.2, the amount of time required for fieldwork will vary according to
circumstances. On a capacity expansion project, there is already good vehicle access, and one
day per 10 km may be sufficient to register the various environmental and sociological
parameters; if some preliminary discussions with affected people are required, this could rise to
two days. Where there is new construction required, there may be no existing access. However,
at the KL stage it would not be necessary in every case to traverse the entire route, assuming
the availability of good 1:50,000 maps and providing that adequate confirmation of the
secondary data can be gathered from the starting and/or end points. Allowance should be made
for not more than two days fieldwork per 10 km.

If we assume that an annual programme in one province consists of 10 projects [comprising: 1
capacity expansion project (significant widening for 20 km on a national/provincial road), and
9 new construction projects (20 km on one national/provincial road, and 80 km on kabupaten
roads with 10 km each)], then the time required is estimated as follows:
8 days for collection of secondary data at provincial level;
4 days for collection of secondary data at kabupaten level;
30 days for collection of primary data on site;
I  .                    8 days for travel (within province);
20 days for reportiug (following standardized formats)
5 days for contingencies
75 days total, say 2.5 months.
The estimated cost for the 10 KL studies might be:
Senior environmentalist @ 2.5 months            Rp 17,250,000
Professional @ 2.5 months                        Rp 12,500,000
Support staff                                    Rp 2,000,000
Field costs (survey, vehicle hire)               Rp 7,500,000
Incidentals                                      Rp 2,750,000
Total                                            Rp 42.000,000
Tfhus the cost per sub-project would be only Rp 4,200,000. If the consultant team is not hired
3                locally, there would be additional costs for interprovincial flights etc. Even this figure may be
an over-estimate, It is assumed that the team would consist of two professionals, one each to
assess social and physical/biological impacts, but in practice, five man-months of professional
time may be excessive. Indeed one all-round experienced environmentalist should be competent
to handle the entire study at the KL stage. The allowance for days on site and for reporting may
also be generous. The figures are illustrative only.
I                 WANDAL studies
The Hoff & Overgaard (1995) estimate for an ANDAL study on a kabupaten road would be Rp
83,500,000, which allows for 5 months for a Senior Environmentalist at Rp 6,900,000 per
month, and five months in total for less senior professionals at Rp 5,000,000 per month. For a
3                national or provincial road, with up to 8 months for the latter professionals, the estimnate would
exceed Rp 100,000,000, derived as follows:
Senior Environmentalist (team leader) @ 5 months:  Rp. 34,500,000
Professionals @ 8 man-months:                    Rp. 40,000,000
Travel costs (mobilization etc.)                 Rp. 10,000,000
Field costs                                      Rp.  3,000,000
Laboratory analysis etc.                         Rp-  2,500,000
Report                                           Rp. 10,000,000
Incidentals                                      Rp.  5,000,000
Total                                            Rp. 105,000 000
I                                                        51



In this case, it is assumed that national level consultants may need to be hired, and mobilization
costs (interprovincial flights) are included in these figures. The budget for the report is high,
but it must be remembered that 15 - 25 copies are required at both the draft and final stage, and  I
furthermore an allowance is included for administrative costs for the presentations, which are
usually charged to the consultant. No allowance is made here for inflation during the course of
the RRPTA project-
ANDAL on Network Extension Proiects
It is useful to analyze ANDAL study costs in greater detail. We can assume that a basic
ANDAL team on a new road construction project would have four professionals, covering their
respective disciplines as follows:
*  Physical Environment (earth sciences, including geology, geomorphology, soils,
hydrology);                                                                                  I
*  Biological Environment (land use and agriculture, forestry, fauna and flora, ecology);
*  Sociological Environment (anthropology, sociology, rural sociology, agricultural
economnics, land tenure/land acquisition, resettlement), -
*  Environmental Engineering (geotechnical, civil engineering).
On a larger project, these would be the section heads, and there will be requirements for        I
additional inputs from more specialized experts. For example, the biologist would rarely be
proficient in both agriculture and forest ecology. There might need to be specialist inputs from
experts in, say, land acquisition or isolated communities). The emphasis would change,           I
according to the findings of the KL and the Terms-of-Reference prepared from this. The basic
team above includes the team leader, but his/her discipline may likewise vary.                   3
The number of predicted man-months required for ANDAL study is based on length of new
road construction (regardless of road status) and terrain type. This assumes that access on foot
is the main time constraint in surveying a new alignment, and this will be heavily influenced by  I
terrain type and land use/forest cover. Easy terrain means that it is neither steep nor swampy,
and does not have a forest cover, whereas difficult terrain would include steepland, swamps,
and/or forest. Conservation and Protection Forest qualify as "difficult terrain", as would the   I
presence of isolated villages, because these categories may increase the number of man-months
for study. Five broad categories of size of study are proposed in Table 5.3, which also gives an
estimate of man-months required, and approximate total cost for the ANDAL study, but it must     |
be emphasized that these are only guidelines. Category N signifies study for new construction
project.

N5                      >30        up to 30    up to 200
As in the case of KL studies, it is recommended that costs are reduced by issuing contract
packets for groups of ANDAL studies. Thus two studies might be done for, say, 150% of the
I                cost of one study, or three studies for 200% of the cost of one.
ANDAL on Capacity Expansion Projects
In capacity expansion projects, the emphasis would in most cases be mainly sociological (land
acquisition, possibly resettlement issues), with perhaps just one other discipline required,
preferably an environmental engineer, to handle other impacts. Total number of man-months
required for ANDAL study should generally therefore be lower than on a new road study. The
number of predicted man-months would be based mainly on length of road affected and
3                settlement density, but the degree of widening also has relevance. Five broad categories of size
of study are again proposed, shown in Table 5.4. Category C signifies ANDAL study for
widening project.
U                Table 5.4a. Criteria for determining size of ANDAL studies for capacity expansion
projects                           (illustrative only)

Table 5.4a is based on widening of less than 5 metres (widening categories WC2 to WC4).
Where widening of 5 metres or more is proposed (WC5), then the ANDAL category is
increased by one (e.g. Cl becomes C2, C4 becomes C5). Significant lengths of steepland or
conservation/protection forest may also raise the ANDAL category.

The legislation presents some anomalies in terms of inputs. PP 51/1993 states that the decision
on acceptance of the report should be issued within 45 days of receipt, or within 30 days of    3
receipt of a revised report if the first draft does not meet requirements. Normally at least the
key members are required to attend the two presentations (to Tim Teknis and to Komisi Pusat),
which means that the team must be held available for this purpose after completion of their     3
draft report. Again, costs can be reduced if contracts are awarded in packets, and the
presentations made together. There should also be a penalty clause in the contract to cover the
consultant's fees if the presentation meetings are not held within a stipulated number of days
after submission of the draft report. Only the team leader would be called upon for any further
presentation required after revisions.
5.3    Social Impact Issues                                                                     i
Several significant issues related to social impact assessment have been covered in the report.
These include spatial planning, indigenous/isolated peoples, resettlement, land acquisition and
community consultation. These issues have been identified and some approaches for dealing
with them have been discussed, but there have not been definitive solutions to handling all the
issues within the context of integrated transport planning and management.  During
implementation of the forthcoming NSRRP it is recommended that these issues be addressed in
more detail on an applied level.
An important objective of the Project should be to design and test in practical applications the
formats and procedures for addressing each of the identified social irnpact issues. When
satisfactory and workable solutions are derived, efforts should be made to codify them in the   I
legal and administrative structure as standard operating procedures. Subsequent actions should
be oriented towards assuring that appropriate agencies and personnel within the Northemr
Sumatra Region, and later nationally, clearly understand the objectives of the procedures and   I
how to implement them in a timely fashion.
A brief discussion of each of the key social impact issues and a list of tasks which should be |
assigned to Project personnel is provided in the following sections. Determination of which
consultants are to be responsible for which tasks, and when each should be undertaken, can be
made when once the final project design is known                                                I

5.4 Spatial Planning
I                In 1992 spatial planning was adopted by the central govemment as the key principle for
development planning at all levels of govemment. Short term spatial use management planning
at all levels is in a five-year time frame to match the cycle of Five-Year Development Plans
(PELITA). Integrated transport plans should be a component of the spatial plans.
The spatial plans of the four provinces comprising the project area, as elsewhere, show a lack
of understanding of the true principles of spatial planning. An important objective of the
NSRRP should be to improve spatial planning and the transport component contained therein.
A list of consultant tasks is provided below to achieve this objective.
1)    Present a short seminar (1 day) for all spatial planners from BAPPEDA Dati-I and
Dati-II to clearly explain the principles of spatial planning and spatial use
I                       management. Hold a group discussion on how a spatial planning approach differs
from a sectoral planning approach. Provide examples of spatial planning, including
identification and plotting of spatial regions on a topographical map, a sample of a
good long term spatial plan and a sample of a good five year spatial use management
plan (using a fictional rather than a real place so that "ideal" examples can be shown).
3                2)     Provide support in the development and implementation of the system of Regional
Transport Planning Coordinators proposed in this report. Assist in preparation of clear
and precise job descriptions for the RTPC at each level (national, provincial and
I                     kabupaten). Job descriptions should include both duties and responsibilities of the
RTPC, including coordinating integrated transport planning with transport planners
from the four transport DG (Highways, Land Communications, Sea Communications
I                     and Air Communications) and preparation of descriptive and integrated transport
network map materials to be incorporated in the spatial plan.
3)     Provide special training for the RTPC and planners from each of the four transport DG
in integrated transport planning. Supervise and monitor the same group's activities
during annual integrated transport planning activities. Monitor spatial planning
i                       activities of BAPPEDA Dafi-IlDati-Il to ensure incorporation of integrated transport
planning.
3                5.5 Indigenous/Isolated Peoples
Social and economic equality in development is a concern of both the GOI and the World Bank.
With respect to planning and development of an integrated transport network this means taking
special efforts to reduce the physical isolation of communities, thereby allowing them to more
equitably share in the social and economic gains of development activities availablc to other
|                conununities. At the same time efforts need to be made not to unduly disrupt the social values
and distinct cultural traditions of indigenous peoples.
l
I                                                        5



It is difficult to make a fixed procedure for dealing with indigenous or isolated peoples. What
is required is a sensitivity to the unique needs and concerns of each group. Transport planners
must exercise judgement in identifying which communities and groups will require special       I
attention. In the project area, distinct indigenous peoples have been identified only in Riau but
isolated conmmunities occur in the other provinces. During the first year of the project the
consultant should select examples as test cases. 
For the identified communities the consultant's tasks should include:
1)    Corrmunity consultation on integrated transport planning should be more extensive,
and will need to explore a wider range of issues to determine potential additional social
impacts arising from the isolation or cultural characteristics of the community. The  -
consultant should begin by using the general guideline; of World Bank Operational
Directive (OD) 4.20, and during the first year should develop a checklist guideline for
future community consultation meetings along the principle of Rapid Rural 5
Appraisal/Participatory Appraisal (RRA/PA) techniques. Once a satisfactory
technique is developed, the consultant should train transport planners in its use.
During subsequent years the consultant should monitor transport planners utilization of  5
RRAIPA techniques in isolated/indigenous community consultations.
2)     Once the consultant has a reasonably complete picture of the community, he should
design a development plan to address its unique nature and the distinctive social
impacts expected to occur. Again, OD 4.20 should be referred to as an initial
guideline. The consultant should work closely with the integrated transport planners    5
from the relevant government agency on this activity so that in the future they can
undertake this activity themselves. In subsequent years the consultant should
increasingly play the role of supervisor, monitoring these activities as they are carried
out by integrated transport planners.
It may prove very difficult to provide any form of security of tenure to such communities.
However, under the Spatial Planning Act, 'every person has the right to receive fair
compensation for any loss suffered arising from the implementation of development activities
complying with the spatial plan'. Furthermore, Act No. 1011992 on population policy provides
equal rights to every citizen, and protects the land and cultural rights of traditional       I
communities. The descendants of such communities are guaranteed the right to develop their
inherited lands in their own manner, and not to be disadvantaged by new arrivals. When their
land is subject to development, they should have priority to benefit from the increased value of  I
the area, for example in employment opportunities.
Act No. 10/1992 clearly has important implications where new roads are constnicted throLgh    I
lands traditionally occupied by isolated communities. However it is uncertain whether this
legislation has ever been fully applied in practice, and certainly no implementation guidelines
have yet been issued. In view of the increasing expansion of the road network into areas      1
fonnerly remote from centres of population and intensive land use, throughout the Outer
Islands, it is recommended that urgent priority be given to the issue of the requisite guidelines
in order to facilitate implementation of Act No. 10/1992.
56



5.6 Community Consultation
According to the Spatial Planning Act No. 24 of 1992 all people have a right to be involved
with the preparation, and have knowledge, of the spatial plan. However, mechanisms for
implementation of community consultation are not set forth within the Act, nor have they been
included in local operational guidelines (Peraturan Daerah or Perda) for the Act. Hence
public participation or community consultation has not been a functional component of spatial
planning at any level,
For road transport planning, SK No. 77 of Bina Marga also calls for community consultation
through the P5D procedure (see Section 3.5), but often this procedure is not followed.
Furthermore, as discussed earlier there are logistical and operational problems in using the P5D
procedure for integrated and regional transport planning. An important objective of the
NSRRP will be to devise, test and refine a workable procedure for community consultation.
There are three variants of community consultation which are needed for integrated regional
transport. The first is for general community consultation on planning for an integrated
regional transport strategy and network. The second will be for land acquisition and
compensation for land, buildings and itrmovable property. The third type of community
consultation will be for the special case of resettlement. The project should focus on these three
types of community consultation in this order since this is the sequence in which these issues
will be faced by integrated transport planners.
Community consultation for transport planning
Accepting that transport planning and project proposals originate at the kabupaten level (see
section E3.5), then all communities should have an opportunity to participate annually in
discussions on the proposals, but this presents many difficulties. Having many villages within a
kecamatan, some difficult to reach, it would be physically demanding for kecamatan planning
officials to hold MUSBANG type meetings in every one. Time is another constraint as all
village level meetings have to be held by May and the results compiled into the kecamatan
development plans during June/July. Subsequently the Rakorbang Dati-II (third step) has to be
completed in August so that planning process can continue upward to the provincial and
national levels. Thus kecamatan officials often overlook the community consultation step
(MUSBANG) of the P5D process altogether.
When village level consultation does occur it is likely to be a group meeting between kecamatan
officials and official village leaders (kepala desalhtrah) and not with the general public. Even
the official MUSBANG meetings of the P5D system are managed by the LKMD, consisting of
the village headman (kepala Desa/Lurah) and infornal village leaders, and are not a public
forum. This system precludes true community and representational consultation. Village heads
are govermnent emnployees (pegawai) so they cannot be considered to be fully objective and
unbiased and may not truly represent the wishes of the community. As government employees
they may tend to agree with any development proposals put forward by govemment officials, or
be subject to subtle pressures to do so.
l
*                                                       57



A workable solution to the lack of community consultation for the planning of a regional
integrated transport network needs to be addressed in the forthcoming Project. This should be
considered a test case in the development of a suitable procedure for use throughout the
cotntry  Keeping in mind the difficulties in holding transport planning meetings in every
village, it is recommended that alternatives to current MUSBANG (Step 1) of the P5D system
be devised and tested. One )ossibility is for each village to select one or two people, other than
the kepala desa, to represent them in an annual kecamatan-wide transportation planning
meeting. Another possibility is for kecamatan planners to hold group meetings with clusters of
four to six adjacent villages, in order to reduce the total number of annual meetings they need
to hold.
Once a community consultation system has been developed which kecamatan transport
planners consider to be woi kable, and which is acceptable to villagers, it should be officially
incorporated into the legal administrative structure of local government. This will necessitate
formal legislation by the Ministry of Home Affairs, followed by issuance of appropriate Surat
Keputusan (Letter of Decree or SK) by each Bupati. Camats do not have legal legislative
authority so local regulations must be issued by the Bupati and Kabupaten Government. Once
a new planning procedure has been officially decreed, care should be taken to ensure that all
kecamatans fully understand and actually imlement the stem.
Community consultation for land acquisition and compensation
A separate, but similar, system of community consultation needs to be devised for land
acquisition and compensation.  The present system  of the nine member Land Release
Committee needs an improved community consultation component. There should be a
transparent forum and format for community discussion and agreement on compensation
valuation for land, buildings and other immovable property for specific cases of land
acquisition. Particular emphasis needs to be given to recognition of land and other property
held under adat tenure and development of equitable valuation and compensation rates.
Within the Project area forums and procedures for conimunity consultation on land acquisition
and compensation should be devised, tested and refined. Once a suitable system has been
developed it should be formalized through the aforementioned procedure in the Ministry for
Home Affairs and in the individual kabupatens- Again, it is important that all the parties
involved clearly understand the objectives of the procedures and actually utilize them.
Community consultation for resettlement
A third community consultation forum which needs to be developed is that for the special cases
where resettlement is required. There needs to be a clear agenda for transport planners to meet
with the peoples who will be affected.
I
~~~~~~~I



The first requirement is constructive discussions between the community and transport planners
on possible alternative routes which will eliminate or reduce population displacement. If there
is still a need for resettlement, there should be a consultative forum which allows for the needs
of each displaced individual or family to be addressed. Transportation development is linear,
thus it displaces individuals and families, not whole communities. Subsequently regional
I                transport consultation procedures for resettlement need to be tailored to the unique needs of
individuals and families. Some displaced people may, choose resettlement in the same
community, others may choose resettlement in another community and still others may opt for a
lifestyle change (i.e. a fanner who loses his house and land using a cash settlement to go into
business in town).
3                As with the previous two types of community consultation, the Project should experiment with
various possible forums and procedures for community and individual consultation for
resettlement. Once various options have been tested and a suitable format devised, a
3                resettlement consultation (community and individual) operational procedure should be
formalized under the Ministry for Home Affairs and the kabupatens.
|                Proposed tasks
A strong emphasis on community consultation should be included in the first year of the
3                NSRRP so that subsequent years can be devoted to refining formats and procedures,
legislatively formalizing the final procedures, training of integrated transport planners from
appropriate government agencies in good techniques, and monitoring the implementation of
3              community consultation procedures. Consultants tasks include:
1)    Devising and testing forums, formats and procedures for community consultation for
integrated transport planning. This should include informing the public of the regional
and multi-modal nature of integrated transport planning and network development.
Likewise, the consultant should check to see that proposed transport plans are in
agreement with the spatial plan and ensure that the spatial natulre of integrated
transport network development is understood by the public.
2)     Detennination should be made of whether instead of consultation meetings in every
village, a representational or multiple community forum would be feasible and
efficient. A suitable fornat for consultation meetings should be designed and tested
which allows fair and equitable input from all sectors of society, and from individuals
I                       as well as groups which will be affected by transport network development. Finally,
community consultation procedures should be refined and submitted to the appropriate
government authorities to be formalized through legislative action.
3)     Once the above has been accomplished during the first year, during the second year the
consultant should begin a program of training integrated transport planners from
*,                      appropriate government agencies in the approved procedures.  Subsequently the
consultant should supervise implementation of these procedures in field situations.
Monitoring of comrnunity consultation should continue through the third and fourth
years of the project.

4)     Simnilar to the format and procedures developed for community consultation for
integrated transport planning, the same needs to be done with respect to land
acquisition. To a degree this will be incorporated in the aforementioned community
consultation in that at the planning stage the community should be consulted about
expected land acquisition and be allowed to voice their opinions on options such as
altemative and bypass routes.
5)    Once the project link has been set there will need to be a review of the existing
"committee of nine" system used for determination of land and property compensation
rates. The current system should be discussed in consultation with communities and if
it is decided that changes should be made, the consultant should work with appropriate
government authorities to devise a system more responsive to the needs and concems
of the public.
6)    Special attention needs to be paid to the situation of land held under traditional (adat)
tenure. The consultant should meet with community leaders (both formal and
traditional) to devise a system for clarification of adat ownership rights and
determination of equitable compensation. If possible a system of adat land rights
categories and valuation percentages for compensation should be established similar to
that in force for land held under government tenure. Once tested and refined in a form
acceptable to the public, efforts should be made to legislatively codify this system.
7)    The consultant should provide training in any new procedures which are developed and
supervise implementation of these procedures during subsequent years of the project.
By the fourth year of the project the consultant's role should be simply monitoring of
the activities of others carrying out these activities.
8)    The special case of resettlement will necessitate development of special procedures for
public consultation. Where it is expected that involuntary resettlement will occur, this
matter should be first discussed in the general integrated transport planning community
consultation meetings. Public opinions on altemative routes which would eliminate or
reduce involuntary resettlement should be discussed and weighed before the route of
the project link is finalized.
9)     Should resettlement still be required by a transport link project, a special set of
procedures needs to be devised for consultation with those who will be displaced.
Since transport development is linear, displacement will be of individuals and families,
not communities.  Hence there needs to be a case by case, or individualistic,
consultation procedure devised and tested to handle this matter. 
10)   Once an appropriate resettlement consultation procedure has been devised, the
consultant should train the appropriate officials who will be responsible for this
activity. The consultant should also supervise and monitor the activities of the trained
personnel during the latter years of the project.

l1)   If the resettlement procedure which is developed proves to be successful, the consultant
should make efforts to legislatively codify the procedure to ensure its continuity and
use elsewhere.
|                5.7 Land Acquisition
The most imnportant aspect of land acquisition is that of recognition of traditional (adat) tenure
and the subsequent compensation for land which is held by adat tenure- This has been covered
*   --            under task #5 immediately above. A second important aspect of land acquisition is actual
financing of compensation payments. Currently this is supposed to be done by the local
government but this poses two problems. The first is whether or not the local government has
the financial resources for compensation and the second is communication between the agency
implementing the development project and the local government. A third issue is monitoring of
land valuation and payment of compensation.
Tasks of the consultant would include:
1                 1)    Work with local governments to determine ways to finance land acquisition necessary
for transport development projects. Should it be determined that local governments do
not have adequate sources of financing to cover such land acquisition, alternative
I                       sources of financing should be sought.
2)     Consultant should work with the implementing transport agencies and local
|                       government to devise a forum and format for improving communications between them
so that local govemrnents have better advance knowledge of the amount of financial
resources which will be needed for upcoming projects.
3)     Consultant should devise a system to monitor the "committee of nine" to ensure fair
and equitable determination of land rates and percentage valuations for compensation.
Furthennore, the consultant should devise a system  for monitoring actual
compensation payments to land owners to ensure they receive all of the allocated
funds.
I                According to World Bank procedures, the proposed road development plan must include a
detailed programme for land acquisition and resettlement, with full budget provisions, and
approval to proceed would be conditional upon the land acquisition process being close to
satisfactory completion.
*                5.8 Resettlement
Involuntary resettlement should be avoided whenever possible. Community consultation should
be the first step in attempts to find altematives to involuntary resettlement. Displacement of
people by road development projects is linear, thus any resettlement would concern individuals
and families and not communities. Thus a case by case or individualized consultation
procedure needs to be devised. The main issue of resettlement which has not already been
covered by consultant tasks described above is that of monitoring:
*                                                        61



1)    The consultant should devise and test a monitoring system to follow the resettlement
process to ensure that resettlement is equitable. He should determine who within the   |
institutional structure of local government should be responsible for undertaking
monitoring of resettlement. A system of adjudication should be developed should
disputes arise.                                                                        3
5.9 Supporting actions to the proposed methodologies                                          3
Topographic maps
Hitherto, planimetrically accurate contoured topographic maps were a rare luxury in Indonesia,
but now 1:50,000 maps are available for all the project area from either BAKOSURTANAL
and/or JANTO1, compiled by photogrammetry from the 1974 Sumatra-wide air photography.
Indeed, accurate topographic maps are becoming available for all of the Republic. 1:250,000   I
maps have also been compiled from the larger scales. It is now timely to maxirnize the
utilization of such maps for planning purposes, and to introduce them widely in the provinces
and even the kabupatens. The environmental screening carried out during Phase II was based    I
on the 1:50,000 maps, and their availability is basic to the system proposed in section 5. 1.
The proposal is made that the project would supply a complete set of 1:50,000 and 1:250,000 ;
maps to the BAPPEDA Dati-I of each province to support transport planning. To facilitate
procedures, the central office of Bina Marga would arrange the purchase and distribution. The
purchase price is currently not more thaTi Rp 20,000 per sheet. Including the off-shore islands,  I
the total number of map sheets is shown in Table 5.5, and the cost should not exceed Rp
11,000,000. It is imperative that adequate provision is made in the BAPPEDA office for the
proper storage and handling of maps.

Large-scale air photographs (not smaller than 1:20,000 but preferably 1:10,000) should be
made available as a matter of course to facilitate the planning of major capacity expansion  
projects in urban/pen-urban areas (widening category WC4 or WC5, or by-pass projects).
These are required especially to assist in ascertaining the social impacts and land acquisition  |

requirements. Existing photographs up to five years old (flown, say, since 1990) could be used,
provided that the age limitation is realized and subsequent changes are entered on the photo-
I                map from field survey. It is likely that such air photography already exists for the majority of
these areas, and it should rarely be necessary to incur the cost of new flying.
Smaller scale piotography (say 1:25,000 to 1:40,000) should also be sought for planning the
alignments of new roads to be constructed through mountainous terrain.
Where the decision is taken to obtain new air photography, every effort should be made to
reduce costs by combining project areas into a single contract package, because mobilization of
u                the plane is a major component of the total costs.
5.10 Environm, ntal Oversight Committee.
The provincial govemment via BAPPEDA Tk I is responsible for environmental management as
part of their regional planning and development function, while Biro Bina Lingkungan Hidup
(BBLH) provides the organizational framework for execution of this. The Badan Pengelola
1                Dampak Lingkungan (BAPEDAL) has established a regional office (Kantor Wilavah) at
Pekanbaru to supervise environmental management in the Northem Sumatran region, but this
office is still in its infancy and its more immediate tasks are likely to be concerned with
industrial pollution.
It is proposed that an environmental screening committee be organized in each province, to be
named the Environmental Oversight Committee (EOC), with the responsibility of reviewing
and approving sub-project screening and environmental management and monitoring plans, and
general oversight and  evaluation  of these  activities in  NSRRP. The  consultant
environmentalist(s) (see Section 5.11) would report and make recommendations directly to this
committee. The EOC of each province would comprise members from the following
institutions:
1                .  BAPEDAL TVilayah
e BAPPEDA Tk I (head of physical planning section)
.   ?Biro BLHPropinsi
a Kanwil Bina Marga
e Biro Bina Penyusunan Program.
*                It is also proposed that the EOC, assisted by the TA consultants, will conduct an annual
workshop in each province that will bring together the project proponents and principal
stakeholders, in order to discuss the environmental and social issues arising from the NSRRP.
NGOs would be included as representatives of the affected communities. The workshop would
seek inputs from all participants on the handling of any negative impacts, and would also seek
to ensure that the local government institutions responsible for the management and monitoring
of different environmental/social components are made fully aware of the duties expected from
them and the budgets required to undertake these duties.

One of the most important functions of this workshop would be to emphasize the importance of
the roles of the provincial offices of BPN and Forestry in long-term management of the impacts
arising from  road development projects. BPN has the mandate to prevent uncontrolled
settlement (ribbon development) that tends to occur along new roads in regions of rapid
economic development, which so often negates some of the benefits that the road is intended to  3
supply.
Management of Protection and Conservation forests lies under the jurisdiction of the Kanwil
Kehutanan, but routine policing of the forest areas is the responsibility of the Kepala Resort
Pemankuan Hzutan (KRPH) at the Dinas Kehutanan Tk II, which has its RPH staff in the
kecamatans. The NSRRP should give urgent attention to the strengthening of the management     3
activities of the provincialVkabupaten forest offizes in those regions where new roads are
traversing sensitive forest zones, especially in the mountains. These issues, along roads newly
constructed already in the mountain forests, might well become subjects for study at the annual
workshops.
In this context, it is recommended that priority be given to the management and monitoring of
the mountains forests of Aceh Province that are traversed by newly constructed provincial     I
roads. Preliminary screening was carried out on these, before it was learnt that the roads were
already constructed or under construction, and the screening indicated major ANDAL
requirements. These links have been retained in the screening table (Table 6.1), because it is  I
feared that in some cases the requisite ANDAL studies have not been made. Negative impacts
along these roads have the potential to be very severe, and the Kanwil Kehutanan of Aceh has a
heavy responsibility to prevent ensuing damage. Protection of these forests is considered to be  3
of paramount importance.

Sociologist (Strategic Planning.z BAPPEDA)
In view of the importance attached to community consultation m the planning process and
environmental management, it is proposed that a Sociologist be engaged to assist in setting up
the consultation programrnme outlined in Sections 5.5 - 5.7. Because capacity expansion projects  I
will predomninate in NSRRP, especially during the initial years, most sociological issues are
likely to relate to land acquisition and resettlement, and it is felt that this should be the main
concem of the sociologist. There would be a heavy programme of consultations to be set up    I
(although initially these are unlikely to affect remote locations), and one sociologist is proposed
for each province during the first year. Subsequently, a single sociologist would be sufficient to
oversee that proper consultation processes are operating in all four provinces. The sociologist  I
should have experience in dealing with the more isolated communities, as issues relating to
these may arise during the later years. 
The sociologists will work with the provincial BAPPEDA and Bina Marga to:
*  review identified issues related to social impact assessment as discussed in Section 5.3;|
*  design and test procedures for addressing identified social issues;
*  review procedures for conmmunity consultation of various types (road planning, land

6. PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL/SOCIAL SCREENING OF POTENTIAL
ROAD PROJECTS
6.1 Phase II level screening
I                A rapid first stage screening (desk study) has already been carried out during Phase II of
RRPTA, namely the examination of each link on the most up-to-date 1:50,000 topographical
maps, as well as other mapped sources (RePPProT, INTAG, spatial plans, recent satellite
I  .             imagery). This has been done both for network extension projects and for capacity expansion
projects that require significant widening (see Section 5.1). Estimates were made on the types
of terrain, land use and forest status traversed by the link. For new construction projects
through difficult terrain, preliminary alignment studies and recommendations were made, based
on the 1:50,000 maps. This screening is reproduced in Tables 6.1 and 6.2. Maps are presented
(Figures 7 to 14) where altemative options have been studied for proposed links through
I                difficult terrain. A bnref summary for every screened road is given m this chapter.
The primarv objective of this rapid screening is to make a general assessment of the volume of
1                ANDAL studies that may be required during the project. It is must be stressed that more
thorough initial map-based screening would be required for each selected project. The ANDAL
codes given in the final column in each table refer to the size of ANDAL studies estimated in
I                Tables 5.3 and 5.4. These are intended to be indicative only, and will be conditional upon the
results of the Kajian Lzngkungan (KL) which, it is assumed, will be carried out in every case.
It is likely that the KL will substantially revise the prelimninary proposals for size of ANDAL,
i                while in many cases those projects marked as NI or C I will require merely UKL/UIL.
In some cases, projects remain listed in Table 6.1 although it was later leamt that the roads are
I                already constructed or undergoing construction. This is true especially for Aceh (see Section
5.10). The size of ANDAL studies indicated is a guide to the importance of post-construction
management and monitoring of the mountain forests.
6.2. Envirornmental Screening of Proposed Roads: Aceh.
P 10. Geumpang - Tutut. Links P025.1 and P025.2. This is ongoing project is nearing
completion. The route crosses mountains with slopes that range to above 60%. From Tutut,
which lies at 50m altitude, the route either has to follow extremely deep, steep, narrow valleys,
or altematively very steep climbs, first to 400m, then to >800m, and eventually to about
1000m, before dropping to the Geumpang riceplains which lie at 500m altitude. The terrain is
tnder forest, but except perhaps for a short section of Protection Forest, is classified as
Limited Production Forest (Protection Forest status would be more appropriate). The road is
likely to have impacts in all three environmental components and an ANDAL should have been
completed. A major effort is now required to protect the steep forest resources along the road.

P 12. Seuliman - Jantho - Keumala. Road P029.1 and P029.2. Construction is reported
completed on this strategic link with the final 30 km scheduled for asphalting during the next
two years. Most of the mountains have already been deforested, and the biological impacts
would be minor. Nevertheless a portion is still officially classified as Protection Forest.
P 12/NS 104. Genting Gerbang - Pameu - Geumpang. The route crosses mountainous
terrain with slopes commonly exceeding 60%. From Genting Gerbang, there is a relatively easy
route along a valley, rising from 900m altitude at Genting Gerbang to 1300m, then descending
to 500m at Pameue. The surrounding mountains reach altitudes of 2000m. From Pameue
westwards, the route is very difficult, because the mountains are 1500m to the north and
2000m to the south, while the Pameue valley down to Rumahbaru becomes very narrow, deep       1
and steep. One alignment would be to try and follow this valley (which may be very difficult),
from whence there is a relatively easy strike route to NW, rising to 75 Om before descending to
450m at Geumpang. Alternatively, from Pameue the route must climb due west, across very
rugged terrain, reaching 1300m before descending very steeply to Geumpang. Neither route is    I
an obvious choice. The forests mainly have Protection Forest status. This road is likely to have
major environmental impacts in all three components, possibly including the social impacts of
opening up isolated villages such as Pameue and Rumahbaru. It may prove very difficult to      I
manage the mitigation measures that are required to control the negative impacts.
It is reported that 6 kmn are under construction at the Geumpang end (Abri Masuk Desa          3
programme), and the first 50 km from Genting Gerbang are constructed and scheduled for
aphalting. Thus the remaining difficult sector has yet to be built. It is recommended that an
ANDAL is given priority if one has not yet been conducted, giving priority to route selection in  I
this difficult terrain, and to protection of watersheds and forest resources.
P 13. Jeuram - Lhokseumot - Beutong Ateuh (Atas) - Takengon. Road P022 and P049.
Beutong Ateuh is believed to correspond to Blangpuuk on the topographic maps. Beutong was
previously an isolated village in a montane valley with no road access. From Lhokseumot to
Jeuram there is an alluvial plain. Beyond this, the route ascends the Barisan scarp with       I
extremely steep longitudinal gradients. Within 18 km it rises from 100m to a col at 1850m
(following a ridge top route), then descends to 600m within 8 km to Beutong. The lower
portion of the route was visited m 1992, and longitudinal gradients on the cleared traverse were  |
considered to be too steep for non 4-wheel drive vehicles. The forest status is Limited
Production Forest (Protection Forest would be more appropriate). From Beutong (600m) to
Genting Gerbang (900m), the 25 km alignment must cross very rugged terrain, rising to
1500m. Most of the route is forested, incorrectly assigned as Production Forest west of
Beutong, but as Protection Forest east of Beutong. This road is likely to have major negative
impacts in all three components, but it may prove very difficult to manage the mitigation
measures that are required to control these.
P 14. Babah Rot - Trangon - Blangkejeren. Road P030. The sector from Babah Rot to the          |
Aceh Tenggara border is very steep initially, and there is no obvious alignment, but it is
reported that a gravel road has already been constructed. From sea level, the route must climb
to at least 1000m altitude, perhaps 1250m. The first 15 km lies through dissected hilly country,
rising to 300m, but all alignments from  300m to the watershed are extremely steep.
70



l
The route then falls steeply to Tongra or Malejang at 400m in the Tripa valley. From here, the
direct route, rather than following the Tripa valley, would be over a 950m pass, rising gently
I               but dropping very steeply, to Kala Keruh and the Rampong valley at Trangon, at 75 Om. There
is an existing road from Trangon to Blangkejeren. All the mountains are forested, the steep
initial portion is incorrectly allocated as Production Forest, but beyond this there is Protection
I               Forest. It is not known whether an ANDAL study has bek n conducted, but there may be major
environmental impacts along the Babah Rot-Trangon sector and it may prove very difficult to
manage the mitigation measures that are required to control these.
P 14. Peureulak - Lokop - Blangkejeren. Road 027. There is an existing route through
comparatively gentle terrain from Peureulak to Peunaron, Pangguh and Bulutan, and there is
I.              assumed to have been rapid agricultural development in this zone. From Bulutan to the
kecamatan town of Lokop, there is an existing road of s )me 12 km, along nrce valleys and a
low col at 350m. It is reported the Peureulak to Lokop is already asphalted, and from Lokop to
Blangkejeren is gravel. The 50 km sector from Lokop to Pining follows the base of deep
valleys, with a 700m col, and the terrain is difficult because the valleys are narrow,
increasingly so southwards. The 23 km sector from Pining to Gajah follows a very narrow
3               valley floor, then widens into the rice plains at Gajah. The 18 km from Gajah (lOOOm altitude)
to Blangkejeren climbs over a very steep 1800m col; this is the steepest segment of the route. It
is not known whether the villages along the route should be considered as 'isolated, vulnerable
|               communities'. Parts of the route lie in Protection Forest. It is not known whether an ANDAL
study has been conducted, but the sector from Lokop to Blangkejeren may be causing major
environmental impacts, and it may prove very difficult to manage the mitigation measures that
3               are required to control these.
P 15. Kr. Raya - Laweung - Gronggrong. Road P054. This is an alternative north coast
route to Pidie, and already exists (10 km asphalt, 50-60 kmn gravel). The terrain is undulating to
moderately steep, and the entire route is deforested, without forest status.
IK 101. Uleeglee - Samalanga. Pidie to Aceh Utara. These are existing asphalt links of 3.5 to
6.0 m width, in agricultural terrain, and no project-specific environmental impacts arc
predicted in their upgrading provided that there is no widening.
*               NS 101. Jantho - Lamno. Aceh Besar - Aceh Barat. The mountains lying west of Jantho and
Indrapura reach 1500-2000m altitude, and therefore the alignment would need to run south
from Jantho, initially through gentle terrain. From there, there is a very steep climb to 1250m
cols in a 1400-1950m ridge, and a very steep descent to the Kr. Lambeuso/Inong valley, which
the route would follow to Lamno. The route rises and falls from 500m to 1250m and back to
500m altitude in 7 km (or 750m to 1250m to 750m in just 3.5 km). Slopes here would exceed
*              60%. Most of the route is forested, and the middle portion is Protection Forest. The route
cannot be recommended, as there would be major environmental impacts. However, it is
reported that 20 km have been constructed already, while 25 km are scheduled for 1997-99. If
an ANDAL has not been carnred out, one is required urgently, paying particular attention to
minimizing damage to the watersheds and forest resources.

NS/IK 102. Pondok Baru - Samar Kilang- Aceh Tengah - Aceh Timur. See Figure 8. This
could be a strategic route linking Takengon via Peunaron to Langsa. Pondok Baru to Samar
Kilang is kabupaten link 61, which has 25 km gravel (to approximately Tembolan), open year
round, and 56 km earth, closed to traffic (on the map, distances are ca.18 km and 18 km
respectively). The new construction crosses land systems having >60% slopes, but a map
study shows that slopes are not excessive. From Tembolon (altitude 400m) the rout, climbs to  I
a 500m col and then descends the Air Putih valley to Samar Kilang (lOOm). Much of the
terrain probably still has a forest cover, and the route possibly skirts the northem boundary of
Lingga-Isaq conservation area. The environmental impacts could be significant in all       *I
components, but nevertheless this is considered one of the more viable cross-country proposals.
Extension of this route to Peunaron, however, is difficult (see NS103). It is reported that
construction is ongoing, but it is not known whether an ANDAL study has been condu cted.
NS 103. Peunaron - Samar Kilang. See Figure 8. From Peunaron the first 24 km to the NW
is through quite gentle terrain, which has probably now been developed. Any alignment due     J
west from this point would be extremely steep, crossing a ridge that climbs to 1000m (locally
2000m), and therefore the preferred option would be to continue NW for a further 12-15 kmn
through fairly gentle terrain to Sarah Raja or Tanah Merah, on the Jamboaye river. (From here,  I
it is only 12-15 km through to Cot Girek, see 1K 107). However, the only route from here to
Samar Kilang would be over some 30 km of difficult terrain along the Jamboaye. Forest status
is Limited Production Forest. It is reported that the proposed route follows a former logging  I
road.
IK 103. Pante Breuh - Paya Naden. Aceh Utara to Aceh Timor. There are existing roads         |
(asphalt or gravel/telford of 3.5 to 5.0 m width) lying in irrigated riceland inland of the
mangroves, and no project-specific environmental impacts are predicted in their upgrading,
provided that there is no widening.                                                           I
IK 104. Aceh Timur - Langkat (North Sumatra). A number of altemative routes east of the
national highway might be considered, linking Kuala Simpang and Tangsilama in Aceh Timur      I
to Langkat Tamiang in Langkat- They all cross agricultural terrain, and present conditions
range from earth to asphalt roads, width 3.5 to 6.0 m. Options would be from Tangsilama or
the Pertamnina complex in Aceh south to Damar Condong (Langkat), through to Limaumungkur      I
and Salahaji (Langkat), thence back to the national highway at either Langka Tamiang
(Langkat) or Sungai Liput (Aceh). There would be no predicted environmental impacts in their
upgrading provided that there is no widening.                                                 5
NS/IK 105. Kedataran - Gelombang. Aceh Tenggara to Aceh Selatan. The route follows the
Alas and Simpang Kiri valleys, along the eastern boundary of Gunung Leuser National Park. It  |
would therefore have very major impacts, and should be considered only in the context of the
management plan for the park. There may already exist an earth track which is not motorable,
and any development would be considered as new construction. Land systems are all steep,
with slopes commonly exceeding 60%, but actual slopes will depend on whether or not the river
valleys are incised. However, it has been reported that an ANDAL study has already been
made, which recommended rejection of the route.

l
IK 107. Cot Girek - Peunaron. (Aceh Utara to Aceh Timur). See Figure 8. This route is
discussed under NS 103. There would be some 50 km of new construction required, through
fairly gentle terrain that is believed to have good potential for agricultural settlement or
intensification- The forest status is Limited Production Forest.
6.3. Environmental Screening of Proposed Roads: North Sumatra
P 21. Batang Toru - Batu Mondum - Tabuyung - Natal. Road P099-101. This is an on-
going project that will form part of the west coast route through North Sumatra. From Batang
Toru to Batu Mondum, it follows the river of the latter name ( a former course of the Batang
Toru), and then for most of the rest of the route, it follows the beach zone, which is backed in
most places by deep water peat swamps- Although there are small settlements along the route
(and large transmigration settlements in the Batang Toru and Natal areas), this has been up to
now one of the last remaining 'wild corners' of the province. It is considered to have major
ecological significance as an example of the deep west coast wetlands. For example, it is likely
to be an important habitat for the White-winged Duck Cairina scutulata, but no surveys have
been made yet. Danau Siais in the Batu Mondum valley could be particularly important.
Although the route is depicted as a required main route in the structural plan (RUTRW, 1993),
the coastal strip is delineated as a protection zone (kawasan lindung), and the hinterland,
between agricultural areas at Batu Mondum and Natal, is allocated as permanent forest. Thus
the route is presumably planned for through traffic rather than to develop agricultural potential,
and its justification is questioned. If an ANDAL has not yet been carried out, one is required,
to focus on measures to conserve the wetland ecology.
P 21. Natal - Batahan - Pasaman/Natal - Sp Gambir - Pasaman. See Figure 7. There is
presumably an existing track along the coast between Natal and Batahan, although Batahan
also has separate access from inland. New construction along this section of the coast would
have minor impacts. If the west coast arterial route is to be developed, the preferred route to
Pasaman in West Sumatra might be to follow the Batahan valley inland from Batahan to
Sukorejo and Silaping, a distance of 38 km in total. The alignment may be able to utilize some
logging roads. This route may be preferable to the present interprovincial route which lies
inland from Simpang Gambir (onl the Natal - Muara Soma road) to Taming and Silapuig (this
road already exists, and is not merely planned as shown on Figure 7). The proposed new route
is believed to have relatively mninor environmental impacts, although full AMDAL studies
would be necessary. A more direct alternative than the Batahan - Silaping route would be to
follow a more southern alignment to Air Runding on the Silaping - Air Bangis road (see map),
although this would require an additional 11 km of new construction: the saving in distance
would be about 23 km.
NSIIK 301. Gunungtua - Kotapinang. Tapanuli Selatan to Labuhan Batu. See IK329 and
Figure 13.
IK 302. Kota Lama - Hamparan Perak (Karang Gading). Langkat to Deli Serdang. This
link consists of existing roads through an intensively cultivated area of rice and villages, and
improvements may be justified. Kota Lama to Karang Gading would not be the appropnrate
73



route, however, because the kabupaten boundary at Karang Gading is an estuarine river. A
better route would be from Kota Lama (or nearby) south to Kota Datar in Deli, and then south
to Pacitan. This may require some 7 km of new construction along existing village tracks. A
KL/ would be required if there is new construction or widening.
NS 302. Siabu - Sibuhuan. Tapanuli Selatan. The route cuts across a high mountain ridge
with >60% slopes, climbing from 200m to at least 1150-1250m altitude. A major section lies
through montane forest, which has Protection Forest status and has been recornmended as a
game reserve (SM Barumon). While the strategic importance of this route is recognized, the
potential for environmenial damage would be very high, and there is no obvious altemative
alignment. It cannot be recommended.
NS/IK 303. Pakat - Parlilitan - Salak - Sukarame. Tapanuli Utara to Dairi. (See also IK
320). This strategic link would present fbw environmental problems if the correct aligmnent is
selected. However there seems to be little agricultural potential along the route, except perhaps
on the Dairi side. Pakat to Parlilitan is asphalt. From Parlilitan, K072 has 9A4 km of asphalt
(3 .5m wide) and 11.6 km of telford (3 .Om wide, severely damaged), while the remaining 4.2 km
is an earth track. On the Dairi side, Sukarame to Ulu Merah consists of 13A4 km of asphalt
road.
There are two alternatives for the K072 route of 25.2 kn. The first option is to follow NNW
up an occupied (and probably degraded) valley to Sitapung, Hutagalung (820m altitude) and
Sindostar, and then over Dolok Semponan, with a col at 150Om. This col has an extremely
steep southern slope but the northern slope is more gentle. Dolok Semponan has forest with
Protection status. The second and preferred option is to NNE around the east side of a ridge,
through Sitapung, Sosorkiling, Siduanbilik, Ambala and Sigumnpar. There are no steep slopes
on this route, which rises gradually to 1 400m, but the terrain is acid heath forest, probably with
limited agricultural potential.
IK 304. Kutalimbaru - Namno Ukur.- Bekancan - Kutarayat. See Figure 9. Deli Serdang -
Langkat - Karo. The IK 304 corridor is proposed as an altemative route from Medan and
Binjai to Kabanjahe, to replace the Medan-Brestagi route which is occasionally closed by
landslides, and periodically busy owing to tourist traffic as well as the Kabanjahe agricultural
traffic. It is already defined as a provincial road (P105).
Kutalirnbaru to Namo lJkur would not necessarily be the selected route from Medan to
Bekancan. There appears to be an earth road from Kutalimbaru to Berdikari, but from
Berdikari to the Langkat border may require new construction. The undulating terrain supports
estates and well-developed smaliholder tree crops, and a Kl. would be required on this sector in
view of the compensation issues. Should the Bekancan - Kutarayat road be built as an
altemative route to Kabanjahe, there may be justification for a direct new link from
Kutalimbaru to Bekancan. The terrain is undulating to rolling, under intensive use, but there
would be no serious environmental issues other than compensation.
From -Namo Ukur south to Bekancan (kabupaten roads K041 and 039) and beyond to either
Pamah Semilir (K077) or Liang Lebah (K187), there are existing 4.0 or 3.5m roads, mostly
l
74                                                      I



asphalt. Widening would be required, however, and the land use is mostly rather intensive.
From Bekancan southwards, there is an extremely steep climb from 850m to 1400m, within a
I               distance of about 3 km. From the distribution of contours, it would be recommended that a new
alignment be planned due south from Bekancan that does not utilize the existing K077 or
K187. The alignment is considered to be notably steeper than the Medan-Bekasi road. The
*               watershed forms the Langkat-Karo border, and beyond this, the route could follow the contour
through an undulating area and there would be no major environmental problems.
|   -           The RePPProT/INTAG maps indicate a forest cover over the unbuilt sector of the route, and
Conservation Forest on the Langkat side. Unfortunately the 1995 Landsat image available to
the project has cloud cover at the critical point, but it is reported that there has been widespread
*'              conversion of forest on the Karo side. It is assumed that forest still remains on the steep slope
on the Langkat side, and that the Conservation Forest is actually an arm of Gunung Leuser
national park. Thus there would be major environmental impacts, and full coordination with the
ongoing Gunung Leuser management plan is essential.
NS 304. Sibolga - Pahae Julu. Tapanuli Tengah to Tapanuli Utara. See IK 330-331 and
Figure 10.
NS/IK 305. Ujung Batu - Kampar. Tapanuli Selatan (North Sumatra) to Kampar (Riau).
I               This appears to be an altemative route between the two provinces besides the main route
(P024) via Dalu-Dalu. In Tapanuli Selatan, K034 is a 23.8 km asphalt road to Pinarik. Any
attempt to link Pinarik eastwards to Papaso (on K 141) is not recommended, as the Rokan Kiri
I               river cuts deeply through precipitous strike ridges, although these are only 400m high. There
seems no justification for such a difficult route. There would be good potential, however, to
upgrade K141, which is 3.5m wide, of which 14 km is gravel and 17 km earth road. The
I               condition of the link on the Kampar side, through to Pasir Pengarayan, is not known.
NS306. Padang Sidempuan - Aek Godang. This direct route is designed to reduce the
I               distance between the two tow^ns by 9.3 kmp.. The route crosses a hill ridge, rising steeply from
300m to at least 650m. There is a forest cover with Protection Forest status The route is
considered feasible, although difficult to justify and may cause unnecessary environmental
I               damage.
IK 306. Sp. Deras - Bandar Khalifah. Asahan to Deli Serdang. This is an intensively settled
coastal area. The existing roads are asphalt or gravel, 4.04.5m wide, except for 6.9 km of
earth road (also 4.5m wide). It needs to be determined whether there is a bridge across the S.
Pagurawan on the Asahan side. A KL would be required only if there is widening.
IK 307 - 309. Three routes from Sondi Raya in Simaltngung to the Tebing Tinggi region in
Deli Serdang (respectively to Negeridolok - Sarang Ginting, Sindar Raya - Pondok Song, and
Sindar Raya - Sipispis). All lie in intensively used tmdulating terrain, and are already asphalt
or in some cases gravel roads. Most are also associated with estate roads, and there seems to be
little justification for strengthening these links. KL studies would be required only if tiere is
widening.
1                                                      75



IK 310 - 311. Tongkoh and Tigapanah - Gunung Meriah. See Figure 9. Karo to Deli
Serdang. Existing roads on the Karo side are asphalt, 3.0 or 4.5m wide (from Tigapanan/
Tigajumpa) or asphalt/gravel! telford, 3.Om wide (from Tongkoh), as far as Serdang (altitude
1250m) near the kabupaten border. From here to Gunung Meriah (altitude 700m) in Deli
Serdang there would be some 12 km of new construction over a very steep forested ridge at
1500-1750m. Slopes are likely to exceed 60% and the forest has Protec ion Forest status. On
environmental grounds this link cannot be recommended. IK311 appears to be an existing
kabupaten road to Serdang and is not further considered.
IK 312. Sinaman (Tigapanah) - Sp. Cingkes (Paribuan). See Figure 9. Karo to Simalungun.
There are existing 3.0 or 3.5m wide links through an intensively used undulating to rolling
area. There are two options, through Sinaman/Talimbaru 11 or through Semangat/ Rumamis.
Both options are suitable, or if a major corridor is proposed, it might bf more appropriate to
construct 3 km of new road from Sinaman to Cingkes.
This route has potential to become an alternative for the KabanjahelBrestagi to Medan road,
via Gunung Meriah and Tigajuhar, when necessary. There are 21.3 km of kabupaten roads
(K036/K090) that would require upgrading between Gunung Meriah and Tigajuhar (width
4.0m, mainly asphalt/ gravel/telford except for 2 krn of earth road).
IK 313. Laukidupen - Sarintonu- Karo to Dairi. On the Karo side, there are existing roads as
follows: Kutambelin - Juhar (K158, asphalt), Juhar - Sp Jandi (K048, telford), Kelabangen -
Ketawaren (K047, telford), and Ketawaren - Laukidupen (K049, gravel). The terrain is not
very steep. On the Dairi side, K158 (Sp Tigalingga - Sukadame) and K075 (Sarintonu - Batas
Karo) are earth tracks, but K060 from Sarintonu to Kedai Berek is asphalt. The probable route
would be from Laukidupen to Sambungan, Sarintonu and Kedai Berek. Laukidupen lies at
800m altitude, and the route climbs to a 11 75m ridge before dropping to Sambungan at 600m.
The ridge is very steep, but it is unclear whether it carries a forest cover, heath forest, or
scrubland. There seems to be very little agricultural development potential, and little
justification for the new construction.
IK 314 - 316. Three routes from Simalungwi to Asahan, respectively Pematang Tanah Jawa -
Prapat Janji, Pematang Tanah Jawa via Pasar Baru, and Perdagangan via Pasar Baru. All
three routes lie in intensively used undulating terrain. IK314 appears to be a complex of estate
roads, and roads of variable quality through smallholder rubber, and there seems to be little
justification for developing this link. Likewise IK315 and 316 appear to be existing roads
through rubber growing terrain.
IK 317 - 318. Two routes are proposed to Asahan (S. Kepayang/S. Sembilang) from
Guntingsaga (Aek Naetek and Aek Kanopan) in Labuhanbatu, but they effectively fonn a
single link. This is an intensively used area of swampy estuarine soils, mainly sawahs on the
Labuhanbatu side and coconuts on the Asahan side. From Guntingsaga to Teluk Binjai, KO 17
has 24.4 km of asphalt and 5.2 km of earth track. K037 from Teluk Binjai to Tg Leidang is
40.2 km of earth track, while K038 is a further 6.8 km of earth track to the kabupaten border.
l
76 



On the Asahan side, there are some 6 km of earth tracks (K057) This route would appear to be
important in order to support the agricultural production of the area, but there would be a river
I                crossing at Tg. Leidang. As there would be extensive new construction along existing earth
roads in wet terrain, a KL1 would be required to determine any further ANDAL requirements.
IK 320. Pusuk - Sukarame. This is another route vi.t Parlilitan in Tapanuli Utara to Dairi See
IK 303 for comments
IK 319. Parsoburan - Damuli.
IK 321. Garoga - Simangambat - Kpg Pajak.
IK 322. Garoga - Rianiate - Damuli.                                See Figure 12.
I. ^These are three proposed links from Tapanuli Utara to Labuhan Batu. Both IK 319 and 322
would need to pass Gonting, and follow the same route to Damuli. Gonting lies at lOOOm
altitude, while Damuli is in the coastal lowlands, and it is very difficult to find a route down.
I               However, in view of the deforestation and severe environmental degradation that is believed to
have occurred in these steeplands through unimproved agricultural practices, road development
is considered important in order to facilitate smallholder tree crop development. The corridor
I               also appears to have strategic importance, as a new route between the Toba plateau and the
Labuhan Batu plains (including east coast ports).
There is an asphalt road from Porsea to Parsoburan and Gonting. From Gonting, K030 runs
east to Janji and Sipogu (= Pangarambangan?). 18 km are asphalt/telford, while 6.5 km are
earth track (requiring new construction). As Janji lies at 700m and Sipogu at only 300m, this
route provides an easy means, possibly the only means, to drop gently from 1000m to 300m
altitude. [An alternative might be K029 to Pagar Gunung, at 450m; this is 4.5 km asphalt and
14.6 km earth track, but the onward route from the latter location to Damuli is less favoured].
From Sipogu, the route would follow the Kualo valley. The best alignment is likely to be to
follow the tributary A. Gonting, which lies west of the Kualo, and then finally either to cut
across low hills from the Kualo to Hasang or Damuli, or follow the Kualo down to
Gwutingsaga. These routes avoid further climbs to 500m in the hills east of the Kualo. The new
construction would be 6.5 km to Sipogu, and then sorne 25 km from Sipogu to Hasang.
Although there has been extensive deforestation in the region, the middle section of the Kualo
valley still appears to have a forest cover (Landsat, July 1994), and there are major risks that a
new road along the valley would encourage further deforestation. Very strong management
must be enforced to prevent this, and no plans to implement such a road should be permitted
until such management can be guaranteed. Owing to inappropriate allocation of forest status,
only a small section of the route actually crosses Protection Forest.
There is also potential to connect Garoga to the Parsoburan - Damuli corridor via Rianiate and
Gonting, although the IK326 option might be preferred for a Garoga - Labuhanbatu link, from
the viewpoint of forest conservation (see below and Figure 13). K093 northwards from Garoga
has 15.5 km of asphalt road, and then 13.9 km of earth track to Rianiate. There is an asphalt
road from Rianiate to Gonting (K176/028, 24.7 km). The asphalt road from Garoga to
77



Sibalanga and Gontingsalak climbs to 800-1000m altitude. The earth track either then climbs
from  Sibalanga to 1250m  before dropping to Rianiate (1200m), or goes NW  from
Gontingsalak climbing to 1400m before dropping. The former route is preferred. However, in
view of the fact that there is still a forest cover on the Sibalanga-Rianiate sector, this route is
not recommmended.                                                                             3
Simangambat lies on a 1000m plateau, and would be easy to access from Rianiate-Gonting,
but from Simangambat to Rambisan (and thence to Kampong Pajak in the Labuhanbatu plains)
would require 18 km of new construction through very steep and difficult terrain. If routed  I
here, IK 321 would have very high environmental costs and little justification. However, an
easier alternative is considered below under IK326 (vii) below (see Figure 13).
IK 323 - 324. Sp. Sisomut - Panipahan - Sp. Tengki. Coastal route from Labuhan Batu (IK
323) to Bengkalis in Riau (IK 324). There appear to be no physical or biological constraints to
developing IK 323, which lies wholly in North Sumatra. This comprises the following           I
kabupaten roads: 023, 087, 046, 106, 096, 095 and 097. The total distance is 93.4 km, of
which 23.2 km is either asphalt or telford, and the remainder is unmotorable earth road. There
could be good justification for upgrading, which assumes new construction for 70.2 kin, and no  I
major negative impacts are predicted.
By contrast IK 324, in Riau, runs along a swampy coast that is barely settled. The link       |
numbers are 128-137, which include 60 km of maintained earth road, 15 km of asphalt, and 51
kIm of unmotorable earth track. Inland there is forested Protection Forest (peat swamp), but the
coast is unclassified, and the forests appear to be much disturbed (recent Landsat data).     I
However, the mangrove swamps on the coast should preferably also have protection status.
The coastal sector follows a zone of estuarine alluvium between the coastal mangroves and the
peat swamp forest inland. The area is ecologically sensitive, for example Sungai Daun might   I
be the only suspected breeding location in all SE Asia for the Spot-billed Pelican Pelecanus
philippensis (unfortunately not yet confirmed). There may be justification to give this entire
coastal zone protection forest status, and not to permit any development. Certainly the road  I
should be accorded low priority, although it is observed that the route would be in accordance
with the existing spatial plan.
A full ANDAL would be recommended to determine what the impacts on the physical and
biological environment would be. The total length of new construction of the interkabupaten
link would be approximately 120 km, all in more or less swampy terrain.
IK 325. Sorkam - Silangkitang. Tapanuli Tengah to Tapanuli Utara. This route follows the
Sibundung valley up from Sorkam, and then passes through a col at Hajoran on the kabupaten
boundary, thus avoiding the steepest and deepest section of the valley. The route through
Tapanuli Utara then returns to the main valley again, but there may be steep sections here.
There is an existing road for at least part of the route, K06 from Sorkam has 16.2 km of
asphalt but then 8.4 km of either earth road, or non-existent. On the Tapanuli Utara side as far
as Hajoran, KI 17 is 38 km, only 2.5m wide, earth road, and probably only a track. Thus there
may be some 46 km of new construction. This may be hard to justify, although the Sihaporas
valley near Hajoran may have some potential for agricultural development. The forest status is
Protection Forest, although little forest is believed to remain.

IK 326 - 328. Tapanuli Selatan to Tapanuli Utara.
NS/IK 301 and IK 329. Tapanuli Selatan to Labuhanbatu.         See Figure 13.
IK 326-328 are three alternative routes from the Sipagimbar/Sipiongot region of Tapanuli
Selatan to the Pangaribuan/Garoga region of Tapanuli Utara, while IK 301 and 329 are links
from the same region into Labuhanbatu. Much of this hilly region has been deforested, and is
being subject to environmental degradation due to unimproved agricultural systems and a
moderately dense population. There may be good justification for improving the access into this
region, in order to support agricultural development, poverty alleviation, and watershed
management. Some areas have Protection Forest status, but this has little relationship with
actual existing forest cover Land systems vary, but 26-40% slopes are widespread, but there
are also very steep land systems locally. However, several of the proposed routes follow
valleys. A regional review follows of potential links and their constraints.
The starting points for this review will be Sipagimbar and Sipiongot in Tapanuli Selatan (with
available access from Sipirok and Gunungtua respectively), Pangaribuan and Garoga in
Tapanuli Utara (with access from Tarutung or Siborongborong via Sipahutar), and
Langgapayung and Rantau Prapat in Labubanbatu.
i. Sipagimbar - Sibiobio - Sipiongot - Simundol - Hatiran (Rantau Prapat) (IK301)
K126 from Sipagimbar to Sibiobio has 11.4 km of asphalt or telford, and 18.2 km of earth
road (which would presumably require new construction). Sipagimbar lies at 900m, and the
route follows a rolling plateau at 1150m, but there is a series of very steep steps down to
Sibiobio at 400m. K140 from Sibiobio to Sipiongot is 20.2 km of mainly telford road. From
Sipiongot to Simundol, K232 is 16 km of probably new construction, while Simundol to
Hatiran K139 is reported to be 23.6 km (3GOm wide) of telford road. Hatiran has links to
Lingga Tiga and thence to Rantau Prapat. Both Sipiongot and Simundol are at 1 00m altitude,
but the link between them crosses steep rugged terrain, rising to 450m, of which 5 km may be
very steep. It is assumed that the body of the road already exists. Thus Sipiongot to Hatiran
requires 16 km of new construction, but Sipagimbar to Sipiongot would require a further 18.2
km.
ii Sibiobio - Simundol (aK301)
There would be potential for a direct link between Sibiobio and Simundol, requiring some 8
km of new construction, but the terrain is steep. It would link up with K232 (Sipiongot-
Simundol) and thence to Hatiran.
3iii. Sipiongot - Hutagodang (Lang&apayung) (IK3 29)
There would be a very easy link along the A. Kanan valley from Sipiongot to Hutagodang.
K026 and K041 from Hutagodang to Marsonja and Binangatolu have 7.4 km of asphalt and
15.3 km of earth track. Bimangtolu lies on the kabupaten border and presumably close to the
Gunungtua-Sipiongot road. Thus the link requires some 15 km of new construction in gentle
terrain. The alternative, K292 from Pijarkoling (Sipiongot) to Janjimanahan is not
reconmmended, as being more rugged. Janjimanahan also lies on the kabupaten border, and may
benefit from a new link to Hutagodang (4 km).

iv. Pangaribuan - Parurean - Sipagimbar (IK328)
There is an existing route in Tapanuli Utara (K020, 3. Om wide) from Pangaribuan to Parurean,  X
39.6 km in length, of which 18.0 km is asphalt, and 21.6 km is earth road. K137 is a short
asphalt/telford link in Tapanuli Selatan from Parurean to Sipagimbar. The route follows a
strike valley, with numerous villages, and there would be good justification for upgrading, with
no serious negative impacts predicted.
v. Pangaribuan - Parinsoran - Sibiobio (IK327)                                              I
In Tapanuli Utara, K 155 from Parinsoran to Pangorian is 10 km, of which 1.5 km is asphalt,
but the remainder is an earth track. From Pangorian to Sibiobio there is no named kabupaten
link, but the maps indicate a path through the villages of Simatorkis, Sibargot, Tolang,
Sigolang, Tapus to Sibiobio. This would require some 40 km of new construction, of which 30
km would be through rolling terrain and 10 km steep. The route as outlined above minimizes  I
the number of deep valley crossings. The area is a rolling plateau at 500-900 m altitude, in acid
tuffs (Batuapung land system in RePPProT), and although mostly deforested, the population is
rather low, suggesting that the region has low fertility. The justification for building this  I
proposed link would depend on determination of the agricultural potential of the region.
vi. Garoga - Pearaja - Sibiobio (lK326)                                                     3
Similar reservations apply to this proposed link, depending upon determination of agricultural
potential. In Tapanuli Utara, K092 from Garoga to Pearaja is 12.8 km in length, of which 9.0  |
kin consists of asphalt or telford, and the remaining 3.8 km is an earth track. From Pearaja to
Sibiobio would require some 23 km of new construction across a rolling plateau, the easiest
route being to link up with IK327 at Sigolang.                                              I
vii. Garoga - Pearaja - (Rantau Prapat) (IK321).
An alternative route from Pearaja that requires further study would be a direct link down the
Bila valley towards Rantau Prapat. This would be a preferred route for the IK321 link which
was considered above and rejected. The route would be across the rolling plateau from Pearaja  |
to Hutatonga, Hasahatan and Sipagobu, to the Bila valley, a distance of some 18 km. The route
down the Bila valley may present problems, however, the valley perhaps being too narrow and
steep, the distance is approximately 12 km. From this point, in Labuhanbatu the route would  3
veer north through Pinarik or Tanjung Beringin (KIOI or 102) to Padanglaut on the Air
Ketiak, from where there is an asphalt road (K04) to Rantau Prapat. The total new
construction would be some 40 km, and the middle section in the Bila valley is classified as
Protection Forest, although much of the forest has been cleared.
IK 330. Sibolga - Sarulla. See Figure 10. Tapanuli Tengah to Tapanuli Tengah. IK 330 is  ~  1
taken to be synonymous with NS 304. There is an existing road from Sibolga to Hutanabolon,
from where an asphalt road continues for 8 km (KG17). From the end of this road to Sarulla
would require new construction for 28 km through montane forest, with a very steep climb to
>500m, and then through rolling montane terrain eventually climbing to ca 1000m, and
80



finally a very steep drop to 600m (Sarulla lies at 450m altitude). For some reason the
mountains are mostly not classified as Protection Forest. The route would be very difficult to
I                justify and there may be severe environmental damage.
If it is really desirous to link Sibolga with the Tarutung - Sipirok road, the only practical
I                alternative would appear to be from Adian Koting, midway from Sibolga to Tarutung, to Onan
Hasang. The distance is 14 kn, and rises from 850m to 1100m before dropping to 700m. This
route would save some 50 km via Tarutung, but it will not alleviate problems on the narrow,
3                winding Sibolga - Tarutung road, which are most severe below Adian Koting.
(IK 331). Sipeuggeng - Sipirok. See Figure 10 and 11. Tapanuli Tengah to Tapanuli
SelatanlUtara. Similar to IK 330, IK331 would likewise require 30 km of new construction
through simnilar terrain, rising from 100m to >900m elevation, and then dropping to Sarulla. It
cannot be justified. Other options from the Lumut - Batang Toru road to Sip ifrok are considered
here.
One proposed route is Sipenggeng - Pasar Marancar - Bulumario - Sp Bulumario - Sipirok.
K019 from Sipenggeng to Ps Marancar is a 14.5 km asphalt road. From Sp Bulumario to Ps
Marancar, K017 has 9.9 km of asphalt or telford, and then 8.9 km of earth track. However, the
8.9 km of new construction around the NW slopes of Dolok Sibualbuali would require
3                crossings of three 150m-deep valleys, in forested highlands with Protection status, and there
could be serious environmental damage.
|                A better altemative is to construct a direct route from Ps Marancar to Kilangpapan, between
Dolok Sibualbuali and Dolok Lubukraya. From Ps Marancar, K079 runs east for 5 km (part
asphalt, part telford) and then continues south towards Padang Sidempuan. From this tum, 4
akm of new construction would connect to Labuhanrasoki, from which there is an existing track,
apparently not a kabupaten road, for 5 km to Kilangpapan. Although this route also crosses
some forested terrain with Protection status, slopes are not very steep.
Sipenggeng to Sipirok via Ps Marancar and Kilangpapan is a total distance of ca. 38.5 km.
The same distance via Padang Sidempuan is 56 km. There may be some potential for
agricultural intensification along the new section of road.
Sp Nagasaribu - Portibi. Near Gunungtua, Tapanuli Selatan, North Sumatra. There is an
existing 16 km link K29 (Sp Nagasaribu to Nagasaribu) said to be in good condition although
*                mostly earth road. Nagasaribu to Portibi would appear to be new construction. The route lies in
open savanna cotutry (16-25% slopes) and no serious impacts are predicted.
6.4. Environmental Screening of Proposed Roads: West Sumatra
*                Kambang - Muara Labuh. Road P073. Pesisir - Solok. The route crosses forested mountains
with slopes up to or exceeding 60%, and the northem arm of Kerinci-Seblat national park. The
route requires substantial new construction in very steep forested terrain. An ANDAL has been
completed (PT Akurat Supramindo Konsultant), and this is believed to have been approved in

February 1996, thus satisfying one of the requirements for obtaining pennission from the
Ministry of Forestry, although it is not clear whether this has actually been processed.
However, it would be recommended that no construction proceeds, or continues, until the       I
Kerinci-Seblat park management project has commenced, and then only if the route is
considered strategic in the context of the park's management plan. The ANDAL  report
indicates that the alignment lies, from sea level, up a ridge west of the Batan Lengapayang   I
river, which would bring it to a maximum elevation of 1750m or higher (then descending to
Muara Labuh at 500m). It is difficult to visualize how the negative impacts can be managed
successfully.
NS/IK 601. Angge - Pua Datar - Mangkirai. Agam to Limapuluh Kota. Most of the 33 km
route appears to exist, and requires upgrading. However the terrain is very steep (perhaps
>60%), although it is possible that a major section follows a river valley. Much of the route
appears to be forest, and a portion has Protection Forest status.
IK 602. Sp. Andilan - Muara Pungkut. Pasaman in West Sumatra to South Tapanuli in
North Sunatra. On the Tapanuli side, K062 from Muara Pungkut is 24 kmn (3.0-3.5m wide,
asphalt and telford) and serves a narrow valley to Hutagodang and Sp Banyak at I 100m. On     I
the Pasaman side, K025 from Sp Andilan to Sp Dingin is 12.5 km (3.5m, asphalt), and serves
existing villages and ricefields. Sp Dingin lies at 800m. There may be good justification to
upgrade these existing roads, but to join them would require some 10 km of new construction   I
along montane valleys and across a watershed at 1400m altitude. The route is not excessively
steep, but crosses montane forest with Protection status, and there would seem to be little
justification. Certainly it would be difficult to justify on environmental grounds.           I
IK 603. Gelugur - Muara Sei Lolo. See Figure 14. Limapuluh Kota to Pasaman. The two
locations lie in the deep Kampar valley, connected by a 30 km earth track (K168). Gelugur on  i
the Limapuluh Kota side is connected to Durian Tinggi by kabupaten roads KI 13 (gravel, 6.3
km), and K69 (24 km, earth road, may be new construction). On the Pasaman side, K012 runs
from Tingkarang (near Rao) to Muara Sei Lolo, of which 26.5 km is said to be asphalt or       i
gravel, while 24.7 km is an earth track. The alignment is difficult to locate, but is believed to
follow initially the Ciranting (near Rao) - Muaratais road (KO 16). The probable route would be
Tarnbang - Ranahbatung - Rumahbatu - Sopan, which ascends to over 800m, with very steep
slopes. There may be a northerly alternative via Pangean - Hululayang - Matundak -
Batukambing. In view of the considerable distances of new construction through steep and
sometimes very steep terrain, the corridor cannot be recommended. Although only part of the   3
route is likely to be still forested, nearly all the route has Protection Forest status. However,
upgrading of the road from Muara Paiti to Gelugur and Sungailolo may be feasible.
IK 604. Koto Tinggi - Bonjol. Limapuluhkota - Pasaman. There appears to be an existing        I
road through most of the route,, following a settled river valley through Koto Tinggi but
latterly crossing a steep mountain range (unless the route follows valleys); it also intersects  1
Malampah Alahan Panjang nature reserve which appears to have been newly gazetted. There
may also be some new construction, but there are uncertainties of precise location and forest
status.                                                                                       3
l

IK 605. Muara Paiti (Lubuk Alai) - Siberuang. See Figure 14. Limapuluh Kota to Kampar
(Riau). This route would require some 10 km of new construction (Muara Paiti to Tabing),
across a strike ridge which, although only 400m high, has very steep slopes. The route would
also require two major river bridges, across the Batang Kapur and the Kampar Kanan. The
ridge no longer carries a forest cover. The route may be difficult to justify.
NS 605. Lingkar Maninjau. Agam. This apparently consists of upgrading of the existing
kabupaten roads around the shores of the south side of the lake. The 28 km road, 3 .Sm wide, is
reported to be asphalt but broken. A KL would be required if widening is proposed, especially
in view of the impact of physical damage on the aesthetic (tourist) attraction.
NS 606. Kayu Tanam - Padang Panjang. Pariaman - Tanah Datar. This would be a new
alignment to relieve congestion on the Padang - Bukit Tinggi nationa' road. Realignment or
widening along the existing main highway is difficult because of the constraints of steep slopes
and deep valley sides, therefore a complete new route is proposed from Kayu Tanam over
Bukit Rangkang to Padang Pariaman via Kandangtasiar. It is assumed that the width will be at
least 12m, and the road will carry heavy traffic. A reconnaissance survey (undated) has already
been carried out by the provincial Bina Marga. Kayu Tanam lies at 150m altitude, and Padang
Panjang at 850m. The proposed route is over 21 km, including over 11 km of existing links
(some of which will need realignment) and over 10 km of footpath which takes the road over
lOOOm altitude on Bukit Rangkang. The westem slopes are very steep, and the forested hills
have Protection Forest status (it might also lie within Lembah Anci nature reserve). Clearly a
road with the geometric requirements of a primary artery would have major physical impacts in
such steep terrain.
IK 606. Bukit Limbuku (Payakumbuh) - Lipat Kain. This the first of two altemative routes
linking Payakumbuh to Lipat Kain in Kampar (Riau). Some 54 kmn appears to be new
construction, with some of the route in very steep terrain (>60%). This is mainly forested on
the West Sumatra side but under scrub agriculture on the Riau side. The West Sumatra side
lies either in Protection Forest or in a nature reserve (Lembah Harau); the status on the Riau
side is partly Protection Forest, partly Production Forest, although little forest remains. In view
of the major lengths of new construction through steep terrain, half of which is still under
forest, the environmental damage could be very high. The status of the nature reserve needs to
be confirned.
IK 607. Labuh Gunung (Payakumbuh) - Lipat Kain. This, the second of two altematives
between Payakumbuh and Lipatkain, has very similar conditions. In view of the very steep
terrain along the provincial border, neither can be recommended.
NS/IK 608. Pasar Baru - Alahan Panjang. Pesisir - Solok. There is an existing asphalt road
covering the 24.2 km from Pasar Baru to Muara Air. Beyond this there is a gravel road for 5.1
km, but the rest of the route is an unmotorable earth road (or non-existent). The new
construction would be across a steep mountain ridge (41-60%). This appears on the RUTRW
to be a northem extension of Gunung Kerinci national park. Regardless of forest status, new
construction across this forested mountain ridge would have major physical and biological
impacts. This corridor should only be developed in the context of the Kerinci-Seblat
management plan.

IK 609. Sp. Baso - Sp. Padang Tarap. Tanah Datar to Agam. The route crosses a narrow but
steep forested ridge, and there seems to be little justification.
NS[IK 610. Alahan Panjang - Pulau Punjung (Kiliranjo). Two routes (IK 610 and 620)
have been proposed across the wide, forested, mountainous area between Alahan Panjang
(Solok) and the Trans-Sumatra Highway (Corridor N3) in Sawahlunto. For both routes, there
may be strong justification to upgrade the earth roads that serve a network of villages,
especially on the Solok side, but the environmental costs of constructing links across the
kabupaten boundary would be very high.The mountains are steep (41->60%) and under a
forest cover, although there may be opportunities to make maximum use of valleys. Forest
status in the mountains is Protection Forest on the Solok side, but Production Forest on the
Sawahlunto side. The routes follow the same earth road to Batu Bajanjang, where they split  - 3
(IK 610 to Garabak, and across to Silago and Pulau Punjung, and IK 620 to Lubuk Tarab and
N3 at Tanah Badantung). For IK 610, there would be some 80 km of new construction (either
existing unmotorable earth tracks or footpaths) on the Solok side, but there are 45 km of    |
mainly gravel road along the valley through Silago to Pulau Punjung. The maximum altitude
on this route is believed to be about 900m, through a col, and this is believed to be the more
favourable route. However, new construction across these mountains would have major          I
physical and biological impacts. If a corridor from Alahan Panjang to Kiliranjo has high
priority, then it would be recommended that only one of the routes is developed (although, as
stated above, there could be good justification for developing the kabupaten links, in order to  |
intensify the agriculture of the region and avoid further degradation). Ideally, air photos would
be required to plan the alignment.
NS/IK 61 1. Talao - TKA. Solok to Bungo Tebo (Jambi). This link would apparently serve a
private estate on the West Sumatra - Jambi borders. No obvious negative impacts are
predicted. The precise location is not clear.
IK 612. Kumanis - Panmusian. Sawahlunto to Tanah Datar. On the Sawahlunto side, there are
existing gravel roads, and some short sections of asphalt, but the final 12 km from Sumpur to
Unggan have an earth road of 3.5 m width. The route through Tanah Datar from Unggan to
Pamutsian is also an earth road, and may be unmotorable. Thus up to 23 km of track may be
classified as new construction. Sumpur to Unggan lie in a flat-floored valley with sawahs, but
the route from Kumanis to Sumpur, and from Unggan to Pamusian, lie in steep terrain (41-
>60%1/o), which is mainly forested and under Protection Forest status. There may be good
justification to upgrade the kabupaten links to Sumpur and Unggan, but the justification for the
Unggan - Pamusian sector is questioned, in view of the steep forested terrain and forest status.
IK 613. Kumanis - Tigo Jangko. Sawahlunto to Tanah Datar. This seems to be an alternative
route along the Sijunjung - Payakumbuh road. The 10 km links are either asphakt or telford,  I
3.5-4.5 m wide, in rolling (16-25%) agricultural terrain with rubber estates, and no significant
negative impacts are predicted from upgrading.                                               1

IK 614. Lubuk Basung - Sei Garingging. Agam to Padang Pariaman. This is an existing road
(3.0-4.Om wide) through intensively cultivated terrain on mid-slopes (9-40%) of volcanic
origin. There would be no environmental restraints to upgrading provided that no widening is
required.
|1               IK 615. Malalak (Again) - Padang Pariaman (Koto Mambang or Ulubandar). There are
two options, both of existing kabupaten roads- The first optioni is K236 from Malalak to
Ulubandar (asphalt and gravel, 14.8 km, 3.5m wide), and then K064 which leads to Pariaman.
I.               The second option is K106 (16.6 km, 3.0-3.5m, asphalt and gravel) to Paladangan, and then
K091 (10.2 km, 4.Om wide, asphalt) to Kotomambang. The first option crosses less steep
terrain and is preferred. As the region is presently rather isolated, and may be subject to major
traffic increases, a KL is recommended, and would be essential if there is widening.
IK 617 - 618. Solok - Batusangkar (Tanah Datar). Two routes are listed north from Solok,
IK 617 emerging west of Batusangkar and IK 618 to the east. They are both mainly existing
asphalt roads (3.5-4.5 m wide) through agricultural terrain that is quite steep (generally 41-
60%). There could be significant negative impacts in widening (possibly on IK 617), or new
U                construction (1K 618 has 7.5 km of unmotorable earth road on links 2 and 233, plus a short
segment of Telford road), in view of the terrain, although it should be feasible to handle these
through standard UKL/UPL.
IK 619. Solok - Sumpur (Tanah Datar). This is an existing asphalt road (3.5-4.0 m wide)
along the west shore of Danau Singkarak. If widening is required, there could be serious
J                damage to the tourist environment in view of the steep terrain and consequent need for cut-and-
fill.
3                IK 620. Alahan Panjang - Tanah Badantung (Tg Gadang, Kiliranjo). (See IK 610). The
same comments apply as for IK 610. On the Sawahlunto side there are some 12 km of existing
ashalt road, but most of the 50 km on the Solok side are unmotorable earth tracks or paths. The
i                route from Batu Bajanjang to Sumiso and Tubuk Taroh rises to perhaps well over I 000m, and
this is the less favoured of the two routes.
3                IK 621. Teluk Air Putih - Abaisiat. Solok - Sawvahlunto. The alignment of this route is not
clear, and data sources cannot be reconciled. There is a nctwork of kabupaten/ transmnigration
roads on the Sitiung plains on the Sawahlunto side. On the Solok side the route apparently lies
|                in forest, but this requires checking. Slopes are in the range 16-25%. Further checking of the
alignment is required before AMDAL requirements can be determined.
IK 622. Hilalang Panjang - Sontang. Pesisir - Kerinci (Jambi). There is an existing road for
the 11.4 km to Kampung Dalam, partly asphalt and partly gravel, but the remainder of the
route to Sontang and into Jambi province is non-existent (possibly up to 50 km). The route
3   4            crosses a high and very steep mountain ridge, most of which is forested, and a large section lies
through the Kerinci-Seblat national park. This route would have very severe physical and
biological impacts, and cannot be recommended on environmental grounds, unless required in
3                the context of the Kerinci-Seblat management plan.

IK 623. Lubuk Minturun - Paninggahan. Kodya Padang - Solok. Paninggahan lies on the
shores of Danau Singkarak. This is an existing road across the forested mountains (41-60%
slopes), of which 20 km have status of nature reserve (Lembab Anai) and Protection Forest. A
Kajian Lingkinan has already been carried out and approved, and apparently the impacts of
upgrading the existing road are considered sufficiently minor to be handled by UKI.'UPL,
despite the mountain forests and restricted forest status.
IK 624. S. Tarab - Payakumbuh. Tanah Datar to Limapuluh Kota. This is an existing 11.4
km asphalt road. It crosses some steep terrain which appears to still have a forest cover.
IK 625. Ujungbatu - Rokan - Muaratais - Rao. See Figure 14. (Kampar in Riau to Pasaman
in West Sumatra). This newly identified alignment could become a major new corrido- from
Dumai to Duri, Tandun, Ujungbatu, Rokan, Rao and Bukit Tinggi. It appears to be th- only
feasible route across the strike ridges between the Ujungbatu region and West Sumatra. There
are existing kabupaten roads from Ujungbatu to Rokan (KO18 - 29 km, 4.Om wide, gravel),      I
and Rokan to Tandikat (K048 - 27 kin, 4.Om wide, gravel). The latter sector is the most
difficult of the entire route, because the Rokan valley is deep and steep, and the road must
climb to a 400/500m ridge, before dropping down to the Tandikat valley. On the Pasaman side,  I
K016 is under construction from Ciranting to Muaratais (the section already built, along the
Sumpur valley, was monitored by the CTC Environmental Team in 1995). It is proposed to
construct a new link from the Rokan-Tandikat road down to Lubukingo, which lies 6 km north   I
of Tandikat. From there, some 25 km of new construction would be required along the
Tibawan valley to Muaratais. The terrain is not notably steep, and the existing land use is
likely to be smallholder rubber. This major new corridor provides not only through access, but  I
also supports considerable potential for agricultural intensification in the strike valleys along
the West Sumatra - Riau border. A link from Rokan to Tandikat and Gelugur would also be
feasible.
Duku - Ketaping - Pariaman. Pariaman. This rerouting for the Padang - Paniaman road is
mainly designed to serve the planned new airport at Ketaping. It will involve widening of     I
existing kabupaten roads through cultivated alluvial terrain (coconuts and rice), as well as new
construction. It is reported that a KL has already been completed, and presumably a full
ANDA L will be required.                                                                      I
Bukit Tinggi by-pass. Major social impacts are predicted due to the intensity of land use. It is
reported that a KL has already been completed.

P 43. Tembilahan - Enok - Batas Jambi. Road P045. This route consists of existing
kabupaten links, crossing rather intensively occupied terrain, mainly under coconuts, on
estuarine soils. Environmental impacts are predicted to be not significant.

P 44. Sp Beringin - Buatan - Siak Sri Indrapura - Mengkapan. Roads P024/033/035.
Mostly this route consists of existing roads, perhaps mainly earth roads (including Caltex
roads). Indirect impacts may therefore have already occurred, for example hunting and
trapping in the peat swamp forests of the lower Siak region, and further impacts from
upgrading may not be significant.
NS 901. Dumai - Lubuk Gaung. This 10 km link along the coast west from Dumai is
presumed to exist already.
NS 903. S. Akor - Bagan Jaya. Indragiri Hilir. This is a proposed link (P054) from the N6
Pekanbaru - Jambi highway towards the Kuala Enok developments. The route would be new
construction across shallow to moderately deep peat, which was formerly under forest. The
June 1996 Landsat imagery shows that a road of some form already exists for at least part of
the length, and the forest has been cleared along this road, while the latter sectors of the route
are under swamp agriculture. For the present time, it is assumed that this is entirely new
construction, but AMDAL requirements cannot be determined without further information on
the site conditions.
Dalu-Dalu - Sp. Manggala. Bengkalis (Riau). The route (PO47), at least 75 km in length,
mostly lies in somewhat swampy and peaty terrain, but not deep peat. There are transmigrant
settlements in the initial sections; the remainder was formerly logged forest but recent satellite
imagery shows that most of the area has now been cleared or is undergoing clearance. There
are extensive oil palm estates in the region. Enviromnental impacts are predicted to be minor,
but initial surveys are required if there is new construction.
Tembilahan - Teluk Pinang - S. Gunting. Indragiri Hilir (Riau). Kabupaten roads exist as far
as Teluk Pinang. From there to S. Gunting, there would be rnew construction. Depending on the
route taken, there could be up to nine crossings of tidal rivers/estuaries, or else the route will be
further inland in which case it would cross forested deep peat swamps. In either case, there are
some 20-25 km of deep peat swamp forest before reaching S. Gunting. However it is possible,
that the region has now been cleared. or is undergoing clearance, for a peat swamp
development project (see Section 1.5 ofthis volurme), and Bina Marga would not be the proper
authority responsible for carrying out the AAMDAL studies for roads that would be only one
component of the p-ioject.

GLOSSARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL TERMS
AMDAL         Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan - the process of environmental
analysis, management and monitoring.
ANDAL         Analisis Dampak Lingkungan - the detailed environmental and social impact
analysis (EIA/SIA). It provides an analysis of the potentially significant
environmental effects, both positive and negative, generated by a project, and
serves to identify and evaluate possible solutions.
KA            Kerangka Acuan - Terms of Reference for ANDAL. Project-specific
guidelines and criteria which define the scope of studies and analyses that
should be undertaken by proponents in their preparation of an ANDAL.
|                KL            Kajian Lingkungan - initial environmental study. A preliminary level of
environmental studies that describes the existing conditions of an area, and
types and magnitude of predicted project impacts. The KL further serves as a
J                              ecision document' that supports a determination of the project's need for a
detailed ANDAL study. For projects that do not require further study (and are
thus considered as exempt from the AMDAL process), the KL guides the
preparation of the related UKL and UPL.
RKL           Rencana Pengelolaan Lingkungan - environmental management plan. A
specific guide derived from an ANDAL that sets out the design and operating
requirements for mitigating environmental effects caused by proposed
projects. The RKZ may specify operatig procedures, compliance standards,
activity responsibilities and schedules.
RPL           Rencana Pemantauan Lingkungan - environmental monitoring plan. A
specific guide derived from an ANDAL that describes the means for
monitoring project compliance with requirements and procedures provided in
the RKL as well as with established environmental standards.
UKL           UJpaya Pengelolaan Lingkiungan - an environmental management action plan.
This is derived from the KL which has determined that predicted project
impacts are not significant and can be managed by standard operating
procedures. The UKL is operational in scope and serves as a binding
instrument for the proponent with regard to environmental management. UKL
and UPL documents do not form part of the AMDAL process, as they are not
subject to evaluation by the responsible AMDAL commission but rather are
under the direct responsibiity of the technical agency responsible for
|: ^supervising the proposed project activity.
UPL           Upaya Pemantauan Lingkungan - environmental monitoring action plan.
This is the monitoring counterpart to the UKL.
