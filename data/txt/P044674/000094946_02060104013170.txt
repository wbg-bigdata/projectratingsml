ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
MAIN REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
Any segment of our natural environment such as water, soil, forest, wildlife, rangeland
minerals, marine organisms domestic animals, microorganisms, or human populations
that the human-being can utilize to promote his welfare may be recorded as a natural
resource. These resources vary in' quantity, quality renewability, mutability and
reusability and the efficiency in management for a given resource will depend on how
deep these characteristics are understood. In broader terms, they are classified as
inexhaustable and exhaustable. Human-beings continue to improve their socio-economic
welfare within the context of the finite physical resources of the ecosystems. In the
process, the ecosystem is subjected to environmental disturbances where the issues could
be climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, loss of biological diversity, soil erosion
and land degradation, desertification, deforestation and so on. Environmental
management is required to address these issues at global, regional, national and local
levels. At global level, these issues are contained by the environmental conventions of
climate change, stratospheric ozone, biodiversity and desertification.
More than any other issue in Eritrea today, environmental concem on land and water
degradation, soil erosion, desertification and environmental health is cutting across all
socio-economic sectors. At every level, efforts must be made to halt the acceleration of
destruction of the environment in the country. Any significant abatement of the pressing
environmental problems will require efficient streamlining by sectors and substantial
political, social, technological, cultural and economical adaptations. For instance, the
young people in Eritrea which make over 60% should be on the forefront because they
are more flexible and adaptable than their parents and because they are not responsible
for the current environmental crisis.
In Eritrea, the vast majority of the population (84%) thrives in rural areas and its
livelihood is based principally on agriculture, pastoralism and artisanal fishing. These
populations have the land, fresh-water and sea-water as the only capital to use for their
sustainable livelihoods, henice the maintenance of their productivity and adequate access
to them becomes crucial to their survival.
The hydrological regimes of rivers or streams depend on the variability and
characteristics of rainfall and oni the properties of catchments such as slope, soils and
vegetation. Under torr-ential rainfall, a rocky, impervious upper catchment will give a
moderated flood and easier sub-surface flows and groundwater recharge: In arid areas
such as Eritrea where surface water is poor, grounidwater- management is crucial to avoid
negative environimental impacts such as salinity and permanent reduction of the natural
capacity of the undergrounid aquifer to store water. In Eritrea, these experienices havc
I



been already appreciated in the coastal underground reserves such as Wokiro and Gahro
and in the valley bound water reserves such as Ala.
Eritrea needs also an integrated coastal resources management where fishing, urban,
industrial and tourism development are carried-out. It should ensure environmentally
sensitive coastal land use; preventing coastal pollution; avoiding uncontrolled trawling so
as to prevent rapid depletion of fishery resources or long-term environmental damage to
coral reefs and other bottom environments are some of the essential measures required. It
also requires establishing and preservation of norP- fishing reserves for replenishment to
the steadily fished areas. Establishing environmental assessment and management system
to promote environmentally sustainable development of Eritrea's fishery resources is
crucial.
To address the overall environmental problem, the GOE has launched the National
Environmental Management Plan for Eritrea (NEMP-E) in 1995 with the main objective
of providing a framework for coordinating the protection and enhancement of Eritrea's
natural resources base so that optimal social and economic development could be
achieved.
The approach taken by the Consultant (T. Consult) was to ensure adequate treatment of
the subjects under study. For-this purpose, three sub-teams were organized where each
has to handle a component. The first step taken was to determine the ERP area and the
contents of each component; determine the list of stakeholder and the guidelines of the
World Bank and National Environment Authority. Following this, the present practices in
agriculture; rural housing and the private sector development were firmly established.
After analysing the practices with focus on the ERP designated areas, the potential
environmental impacts were identified. Discussions were carried-out with the relevant
stakeholders and subject matter specialists and their views were considered throughout
the study. The ERP contents, the existing practices related to the three components and
the requirements of the Bank and the DOE were compared for drawing the negative
impact mitigation measures and recommendations.
This report is about an Environmental Assessment for the ERP components of
Agriculture, Housing and Private Sector Development. It consists of three volumes,
namely: Executive Summary (Vol. 1), Main Report (Vol. II) and Annexes (Vol. III).
In the first part of this volume, the background has been given to establish the conceptual
setting. In the second part, each component has been treated where the present practices,
ERP activities, potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures have been
discussed and a brief review of the NEAGP was made. In the last part, the Environmental
Management Pan has been presented.

2. GENERAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Country
2.1.1. Physical and climatic feature
Eritrea, located at the northem part of the Horn of Africa, has a landmass area of
about 125,700km2 or 12.57 million hectares. The total Eritrean coastline is,
inclusive that of the islands which are mainly the Dahlak Islands Archipelago,
1720km of which the mainland coastline is approximately 1155km. The different
land uses in Eritrea consist of approximately 3.42% rainfed cultivated; 0.18%
irrigated; 0.08% forest; 57.16% grazing/browsing land; 5.52% woodland and
scrub woodland; while 33.21% is barren.
Eritrea is climatically of high diversity where 70% of the total landmass receives
less than 400mm annual rainfall, while about 30% receives less than 200mm and
only about 9% receives more than 600mm. About 72% of Eritrea has an annual
mean temperature of 25°C; while 14% is cool to mild with annual mean
temperature of 180C. On the basis of altitude, soil, rainfall, climatic features,
landform and vegetation, Eritrea is divided into six Agro-Ecological Zones
(AEZs). The climatic characteristics indicate that water is permanently scarce and
the natural resources (land, vegetation) are highly degraded in most parts of the
country. Soil fertility is low and the country is highly drought sensitive, hence
environmentally fragile.
2.1.2. Socio-economics
Eritrea has a population of about 3.5 million with an average annual growth rate
of 2.9%. Population density is high in the highland area where 60% of the total
population occupies 19% of the total country's landmass area. About 84% of the
total population resides in rural area and the main livelihood is traditional or
subsistence agriculture, pastoralism and artisanal.fishing.
The overall social services available are poor where for instance there is
lphysician for about every 23,000 people. Infant mortality is about 116 in 1000
births, and the average life expectancy is about 50 years. Food insecurity is high
where the prevalence of malnutrition and disease among young children is among
the highest in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). The average daily water consumption per
household is 10 litres in rural area and 20 litres in urban area. Access to education
is about 51 %. The average national illiteracy rate is about 80% and among women
it is 90%. Housing and sanitation standards are extremely low.
The GDP share conisists of about 50% services and distribution; 17% industry;
21% agriculture and 12% others. The average GDP income per caput was, at least
before the 1998 war, about USD 200 whicih is less than 60% of the SSA average.
The economic growth rate has fallen to less than 1% per annum from 7% in 1997
3



which is largely due to the conflict with Ethiopia. The country is currently highly
dependant on food aid.
2.1.3. Policy on environment
Eritrea places the issue of environmental management and protection as one of its
highest policy priorities. The country's policy emphasises conservation and
rehabilitation of natural resources and maintaining environmental quality with
maximum rationality in their use to ensure sustainability. To achieve this,
govemment has established the Department of Environment within the MLWE to
be an authority on the subject. The National Environmental Management Plan
(NEMP) was prepared in 1995 which was adopted in 1997 and this document
provides the basic policy guidelines on environmental management. Eritrea is
signatory of the major intemational conventions and summits on environment.
These include the Rio-Earth Summit, Convention to Combat Desertification
(CCD) (1994); the Convention on Intemational Trade of Endangered Species
(CITES, 1995); the Framework Convention on Climate Change (April, 1995) and
the Convention on Biological Diversity (1995).
2.1.4. Agricultural and Livestock Sectors
The system is rainfed traditional type featured with low productivity and high
vulnerability to drought due to the high variability in rainfall within and between
years. Livestock, in the form of pastoralism, is practised mainly in the lowland
areas and the crop/livestock mixed system is mainly practised in the highland and
parts of the southwestern lowland. Spate irrigated crop production is common in
the eastern lowland area; while irrigated horticulture is carried out principally in
the highland and the major river basins of the western lowland. The agricultural
intensification level in agriculture is low where the rainfed crop system is based
on extensive land use. The use of agrochemicals is insignificant as compared even
to the SSA standards where the average fertilizer and pesticides applications in
Eritrea are 0.05 and 0.023kg/ha, respectively. Their use is principally in the
irrigated farming system and against insect pest swarms such as locust and army
worm. The use of agricultural machinery is also very limited where traditionally
oxen are used for crop cultivation.
The country is chronically vulnerable to drought and domestic crop production
has always been far below the dietary energy supply (DES) requirements. During
the last years, considerable pails of Anseba, Northern Red-Sea and Gash-Barka
Regions have been affected by drought and the cycle goes on by locations. As a
sequel to this, about 275,000 persons are under emergency food aid.
2.1.5. The Housing sector and fuel-wood supply
There is a severe housing problem in Eritrea where availability of housing and
associated sanitary facilities and water supply are far below standard. This affects
both the poor urban and rural populations where in urban areas, the availability of
4



even the poor housing facilities is far below the demand. There is no adequate
policy on housing and housing programmes for developing residential facilities
directed towards the economic capacity and needs of the poor. The minimum
national standards on habitat requirements have not been defined. The private
sector and individuals have poor access to land for housing development and the
problem in urban areas is principally associated with the land admninistration.
Housing conditions in rural areas are not only of poor quality standard, but the
negative environmental' effects created by the current practices of house
construction are major causes of devegetation. The cause is that house
construction demands large amounts of wood.
The country has poor energy supply availability and in rural areas the only source
is biomass. In the past, even most of the urban people were using biomass energy
for cooking. This practice has been a major cause for devegetation and it is still
one of the main factors of environmental concerns.
2.1.6. The private sector
Generally, the private sector in Eritrea is too small to influence any significant
economic development in the country hence environmental issue from industrial
activities is minimal. It is mainly involved in small-scale services and low level
manufacturing activities which are mostly centred in Asmara. Industrial activities
are largely based on agriculture of which the main are textile, tanneries and food
processing. There are few but still small-size initiatives of manufacturing in some
of the small towns. The principal cause is lack of enabling environment for the
private sector to participate. Its presence in rural areas is absent due to the poor
economic infrastructure including power supply, water and access to land.
In the past, the market for manufactured goods was principally Ethiopia and this
has been lost since the onset of conflicts. The local market is minute where people
are too poor to consume. The environmental issues in respect to the current
private sector activities is rather insignificant. Industrial emissions to cause
serious air pollution are almost non-existent. However, the drainage systems and
sewage treatments are inadequate which are of environment health concern in
urban areas. This is associated with the low water supply which can not
adequately dilute effluents, poor solid waste management and poor sanitary
services.
2.2. Eritrea Emergency Reconstruction Programme (ERP)
Eritrea-has been always very sensitive to drought. This chronic food insecurity
problem has been recently worsened by the huge acute food insecurity created by
the border conflict with Ethiopia which covered the 1998-2000 period. The war
has resulted into extensive material and human loss in most parts of Debub and
Gash-Barka Administrative Regions. Prior to the third round of fighting (May
2000), the number of IDPs was 270,000 but this figure was raised to aboutl.1
million by the end of the war. About 61,000 of the IDPs were placed in relief

camps; while about 40,000 had crossed to the Sudan and the remaining were
dispersed among host communities within and outside the affected regions. To
this tragic situation was added the old problem of drought which affected about
275,000 people in parts of the coastal lowland area, Anseba and part of Gash-
Barka Regions.
The two war affected regions are the major cereal and livestock producers in this
country accounting for about 70% of the total national production. The effect of
this insult was that the IDPs have lost all their means of production, houses and
the social services infrastructure. The area has not been in production since the
war erupted in 1998 and national production in the year 2000 was only about
85,000 (t). The cummulative effect of war and drought; the huge size of the IDPs
and the low economic capacity of Eritrea to respond has made the situation to take
the dimensions of disaster calling for massive humanitarian aid.
Government reaction to this has been to initially organize emergency relief and
subsequently to introduce reconstruction and rehabilitation process of the affected
areas. Since the problem was beyond the capacity of the country, government has
made an appeal to obtain international assistance to address the humanitarian
problem (May 2000). In coherence with this, the World Bank has assisted Eritrea
in preparing the ERP for the affected area and to present it to the international
community for financial support.
The reconstruction and rehabilitation process consists of two stages. The first is
directed to address the immediate needs involving the rehabilitation of
infrastructure and to enable the productive sector to restart operation. The second
is directed towards achieving self-sufficiency which will be addressed by the
individual sector programmes and financed in collaboration with the partners in
development.
The objectives of ERP are to assist the country in.(i) addressing the problem of
the IDPs due to the war and drought so that they resume their normal life and (ii)
strengthening the national balance of payment.
The components of the ERP are:
(a) agriculture;
(b) infrastructure;
(c) private sector development;
(d) social protection; and
(e) balance of payment support.
The programme is expected to have both positive and negative environmental
impacts; hence environmental assessment of the impacts that are likely to occur
becomes a requirement. The three ERP components under study have been
classified within Category B and Category C projects in respect to environmental
assessment requirement. .

3. TERMS OF REFERENCE (TOR)
The TOR supplied by the Client (PMU, ERP) to the Consultant (T. Consult) was
to carry-out environmental assessments on the:
(a) agriculture and pesticides use;
(b) private sector development; and
(c) housing programme (part of the social protection).
The details of the TOR are given in Annex I to this report.

4. REQUIREMENTS OF THE WORLD BANK AND GOVERNMENT ON ENVIRONMENTAL
ASSESSMENT (EA)
4.1. The World Bank
The Bank is involved in financing the ERP and one of the requirements for this is
that such Bank financed projects would be subject to Environmental Assessment
(EA). The objective of this requirement is to ensure that such projects are
environmentally sustainable. EA evaluates the potential environmental risks and
impacts in its area of influence; examines project alternatives; identifies ways of
improving project selection, citing, planning, design and implementing by
preventing, minimizing, mitigating or compensating for potentially adverse
environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts. It includes the process of
mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts through project
implementation.
EA takes into account the natural environment, human health and safety; social
issues and global environmental matters and it considers natural and social aspects
in an integrated manner. It considers also the country's policy, legislation,
institutional capabilities; country obligation in respect to project activities under
intemational environmental protection agreements.
The Bank has "Operational Policies Maniual OP 4.01" for the purpose of
carrying out EA in which the requirements, procedures and responsibilities are
generally laid out. However, it takes into account variations in project and country
situations, hence flexibility is permitted. Based on this manual, the borrower is
responsible for carrying-out the EA and for projects that are environmentally of
high risk or that they involve serious and multidimensional environmental issues,
the borrower is required to engage an independent advisory panel. The Bank
reviews the EA prior to processing of financing to ensure that it complies with
requirements laid out in the manual specified above.
Depending on the nature of the project, a set of EA instruments are used to
comply with the Bank's requirement. These may include EIA, regional or sectoral
EA, risk assessment and environmental management plan (EMP) and EA applies
one or more of these. The Bank requires that, through environmental screening,
the proposed project is classified into one of four Categories, depending on the
type, location, sensitivity and size of the project and the nature and magnitude of
its potential environmental impacts. The Categories are A; B; C and Fl. The
Bank's requirements for each of these categories are specified.
Special project types are subject to EA requirements as per the Banlk's operational
policy. These include:
*  Sector Adjustment Lending (SAL);
* Financial Intermediary Lending (Fl); and
* Emergency Recovery Projects (ERP).
8



The policy set out in OP 4.01 applies to emergency recovery projects such as the
ERP. However when compliance with the requirements of this policy would
prevent the effective and timely achievement of the objectives of an emergency
recovery project, the Bank may exempt the project from such a requirement.
However, the Bank requires that (i) the degree to which the emergency was
precipitated by inappropriate environmental practices be determined; and (ii) any
corrective measures be incorporated into either the emergency project or a future
lending operation.
The Bank's requirements include also that the adequacy of the institutional
capacity (legal Administrative and technical) of the borrower to carry-out EA
related functions complies with the policy specified in OP 4.01. For all Category
A and B projects, the Bank requires that the borrower carries-out public
consultation which includes project affected groups and local non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) about the environmental aspects of the project. Such views
are required to be taken into account. The borrower is required to provide relevant
materials to the groups. During implementation, the borrower is required to report
on (i) compliance with measures agreed with the Bank including EMP; (ii) the
status of the mitigatory measures and (iii) the findings of monitoring programmes.
The Bank procedures to be followed by the borrower to carry-out the EA are
detailed in the policy. Set out in the OP 4.01. Thtese procedures involve
environmental screening; EA preparation; review and disclosing; project
appraisal; supervision and evaluation; role of the Department of Environment;
financing EA and special applications. In accordance to the Bank Policy
contained in the support components under study are categorised as B and C.
Hence, they are subject to the EA requirements specified in OP 4.01.
4.2. National Environmental Assessment Procedures And Guidelines
(NEAPG)
This environmental assessment document consists of two sections and four
appendices. The first is "Procedures and Guidelines for Environmental
Clearance of Projects" and the second is "Monitoring and Evaluation of
Projects". The Appendices to these sections are given as "Appendix A" (Project
List for Environmental Screening); "Appendix B" (Proposed Environmentally
Sensitive Area); "Appendix C" (Environmental Assessment Forms); and
"Appendix D" (Checklist for Project Screening).
The procedures aim to:
*  assess the significance of potential environmental impacts that may
occur upon the implementationi of the project;
* reduce delays in project approval due to EA requirements;
*  improve project design and perfomnance; and
9



* promote economic development without unnecessary decline in
environmental quality.
In the Manual, the responsibility for implementation, the users and the conditions
for using the procedures are only generally mentioned. The EA requirements for
clearing projects and procedural steps are provided. Screening of projects, level of
environmental assessment requirements by the various categories (Category A, B
and C) and the responsibilities for carrying-out the EA are specified.
For clearance, Category A projects are required to be subjected to full EIA; while
Category B projects are required to carry-out EE; and those in Category C are not
subjected to EA. The procedural steps in carrying-out full EIA, the requirements
on reporting and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) have been stated. The
requirements on reviewing EIA and EMP reports and final project clearance have
been outlined.
In section B of the manual, the requirement and procedures of monitoring and
evaluation of projects during implementation have been specified.
In respect to the use of pesticides, the operational policy the World Bank's
operational policy onz pest management 4.09 emphasises to promote
environmental control through the implementation of integrated pest management
(IPM) hence minimum pesticide use. Under this policy, crop pest control through
the use of IPM that includes biological control, good agricultural practices, use of
pest resistant varieties and institutional capacity building such as staff and
regulatory framework development have the highest support. The Bank does not
support the sole use of pesticide for pest control unless it is warranted. The
Department of Environment has similar policy. In the environmental guidelines,
pesticides are placed under category B. This means, projects which intend to use
pesticides and aerial spray in particular have to pass through an Environmental
Evaluation Questionnaires (EEQ) in order to get environmental clearance.
However, under the present situation, the ERP is emergency by nature which aims
to rehabilitate the internally displaced and drought affected people and probably
few returnees. The main aim of the project is to enable the IDPs to start normal
life.
Agricultural production in the project area can increase by, inter-alia, effective
pest control hence the use of pesticides is warranted. To achieve this, selective
and effective pesticides must be used with a minimum negative environmental
impact but it should be also flexible and practical to reflect local realities. Eritrea
has neither adequate technologies in pest management nor has it developed the
approach of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).

4.3. Classification of projects based on the requirements of the Bank and
NEAPG
(a) Category A: A proposed project is classified as Category A if it is likely to have
significant adverse environmental impacts that are sensitive or unprecedented.
These impacts may affect an area broader than the sites of facilities subject to
physical works. Environmental Assessment for a Category A project examines the
project's potential negative and positive environmental impacts, compares them
with those of feasible alternatives (including the "without project" situation) and
recommends any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate
for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance. For a Category A
project, the borrower is responsible for preparing a report, normally an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).
(b) Category B: A proposed project is classified as Category B if its potential adverse
environmental impacts on human populations or environmentally important areas
including wetlands, forest, grasslands and natural habitats are less adverse than
those of Category A projects. These impacts are site-specific, few if any of them
are irreversible; and most mitigatory measures can be designed more readily than
for Category A projects. The scope of Environmental Assessment for a Category B
project may vary from project to project, but it is narrower than that of Category A.
Like in the case of Category A, it examines the project's potential negative
environmental impacts and recommends any measures needed to prevent,
minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental
perforrnance.
(c) Category C: A proposed project is classified as Category C if it is likely to have
minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. Beyond screening, no further
Environmental Assessment action is required for a Category C project.
(d) Category Fl:  A proposed project is classified as Category Fl if it involves
investment of Bank funds through a financial intermediary, in sub-projects that may
result in adverse environmental impacts. For financial intermediary (FI) operations,
the Bank requires that each proposed sub-project classified as Category Fl is
screened and ensure that sub-borrowers carry out appropriate environmental
assessment for each sub-project.



5. AGRICULTURE COMPONENT
5.1. SITUATION
5.1.1. Agricultural and livestock practices in Eritrea relevant to the
ERP activities
5.1.1.1. Pesticides
The use of pesticide in Eritrea is low as compared to many African countries. Its
use is limited to the large commercial irrigated fanning systems and against large
insect swarms in the smallholder rainfed system. The large-scale commercial
farmning system such as Alighidir Agro-industry, Elabered, Sawa and Afhimbol
Agro-industries, which are all operating in the western part of the country and the
irrigated small-scale horticultural production are the major users of pesticides. In
the rainfed cropping system, pesticide is applied mainly to control insect pests of
the main staple cereal crops such as sorghum, maize and pearl-millet. The most
important pests of these crops are pachnoda, stem-borer and grasshoppers. In the
production of pulses, pest control is used mainly against African bollworm and
aphids. Most of the pesticides used on vegetables are to control aphids, whitefly
and diseases such as blight and powdery mildew (Table 1). Considerable amounts
of pesticides are used to control large swarms of migratory pests (locust
arrnyworm) covering large areas, and causing severe damage on food crops and
natural vegetation. The use of herbicides and rodenticides is rare, hence
environmentally insignificant. Herbicide in Eritrea has been introduced very
recently and on limited scale through the Integrated Farming System (IFS)
designed in response to the low farm labour supply availability due to the 1998-
2000 war.
The chemicals used as pesticides in Eritrea are mainly organophosphates,
followed by organochlor-ines, carbamates and pyrethroids (Table 3). Large stocks
of chlorinated hydrocarbons are available in stock in the country, but their use has
been discontinued, except for Thiodan which is used for the control of cottoi
pests. Most of the pesticides used to control migratory pests in Eritrea were
provided through donations, hence an issue of total dependency and not choice.
The pesticide chemicals most commonly used for the control of locust and
arTnyworms are Feniti-othion and Malathion. Dimethoate is used to control
sucking insect pests such as aphids, white fly and scale. Fenthion is used
principally to control crop attacking swarm birds (Quelea quelea). Dursban,
Endosulfan and Cypermethrin are also widely used to control cotton pests (Table
1). Thiram, Mancozeb and Redomil are commonly used to control blight and
powdery mildew (Table 2).

5.1.1.1.1 Crops and Pests
Eritrea   is highly    dependent on      agriculture    and   it is the    main   soui-ce   of
livelihood for the vast majority of the people. In uplands, the most commonly
grown crops include barley, wheat, taff, cool season legumes and linseed. In
the lowlands, sorghum, pearl-millet, sesame and cotton are the major crops.
Vegetables and fruits are produced both in the highlands and lowlands. Crop
yields are generally low and the main factors are inadequate soil moisture, soil
infertility, pests and overall poor cultural practices. However, in an average
agricultural production year, the produce is enough to feed the population for
about six months.
13



Different types of pests (insects, diseases and weeds) affect crop production in
Eritrea. African bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hub)is, a polyphagous pest
that attacks many crops like cereals, pulses, tomato and cotton, but it is
economically more important pest of cotton and legumes. Stem borers are
major pests of sorghum, maize and pearl-millet. Aphids and whiteflies limit
the production of cotton, tomato and other crops. Late blight is a severe disease
of tomato and potato and because of this such crops are not grown during the
rainy season as higher humidity promotes the disease incidence. Scale insects
are also serious pests of citrus. In addition, migratory pests such as locusts,
armyworm and birds (Q.quelea) affect crop production during outbreak years.
Striga hermontica is a parasitic weed of sorghum, maize and pear-millet where
yields are heavily reduced. Broad leaves and grasses are also important weeds
in all crop production areas of the country. In general, crop pests are
economically very important by limiting crop yields and total production in
Eritrea.

5.1.1.1.2 Nature and properties of pesticides
In Eritrea, the range of chemical compounds used as pesticides in agriculture
has been always large. Traditionally, pesticide use has been usually related to
the severe affects of desert locust. However, this indiscriminate accumulation
and use of pesticides was probably due to the less awareness on the potential
negative environmental impacts associated with at least some of them. Another
factor could be also because their source is donation. The common insecticide
groups used in Eritrea are organochlorines, hydrocarbon, organophosphates,
carbamates and pyrethroids. Each of these groups has advantages and
disadvantages. Their use, mode of action, efficacy and negative impacts are
variable.
The organophosphate compounds are highly toxic and of less persistence.
They are highly liposoluble but are also water soluble to a certain extent,
unlike chlorinated hydrocarbons. Their mode of penetration is more by
ingestion rather than through contact. The group has no property of being
accumulated in the adipose or parenchymnatous tissues of the warm-blooded
animals because degradation is fast. Currently, they are widely used as
pesticides and have replaced the organochlorine group. The main disadvantage
of the group is that they are unstable. This means that the action time is short
and for this reason they have to be applied at short intervals to achieve efficacy
in pest control and this increases cost of crop production.
15



Organochlorine (chlorinated hydrocarbon) compounds are highly persistent
and their use may cause level negative environmental impacts. The property of
high stability and cumulative effect makes this chemical group to be of
significant environmental concem. As a sequel to this, the use of the group has
been prohibited in most countries. Biochemically, they are involved in the
inhibition of cytochrome oxidase that is either rapid (DDT, toxaphene) or slow
(BHC, chlordane). They are of broad spectrum action on pests and the main
route of introduction is cuticular or cutaneous and leads to nervous symptoms.
They can kill all insects by contact and as stomach poison. They are
liposoluble and this makes them soluble,in the lipids of the cuticle and body of
insects. These pesticides, being persistent by nature, may easily enter into the
food chain of animals and they accumulate after repeated intake mostly in the
adipose tissue where they remain fixed. Under normal conditions, the thus
accumulated pesticide may not affect the animal, however, when such an
animal is starved, its body demands energy and the fat is demobilized. The
amount of pesticides released into the blood from such depots may reach
critical levels or lethal. The organochlorine group has a long-term
contamination capability to the environment and some insect populations may
develop resistance to this group of pesticides.
Carbamates are stable chemical with low vapour pressure, low water solubility
and stability. They have low leaching rates in soils and their bioaccumulation
in different food chains is little or none, but they have bioaccumulation effect
in fish due to its low metabolism. Carbamates are moderate to highly toxic to
fish and soil organisms. Carbamates are generally considered of low health
hazard as food residue and at the time of application. However, at higher
concentrations they may cause carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. The chief
danger to mammals is that the chemical is absorbed cutaneously and deposited
on the surface of human forearm faster than any other pesticide compounds.
Pyrethroids are highly toxic, unstable, wide spectrum action and very effective
in controlling of pests. Repeated applications of these pesticides tend to build
up resistance of the pest and it affects the natural enemies. Because of this they
should be less used. They are safe to higher animals, but toxic to fish.
Recently, a list of selective pesticides has been approved for use in Eritrea
(Table 6), and importation of pesticides is regulated accordingly. It includes
one chemical compound belonging to the organochlorines (Thiodan) which is
used against pests of cotton.

5.1.1.1.3.Pesticide management
(a) Procurement
The public and private sectors are both involved in the importation and
distribution of chemical pesticides in Eritrea. The major pesticide importers
include MOA, Alighidir Agro-industry, Consorzio Agrario dell Eritrea, Ageca
and the Union of Agricultural Input and Services. The functions of the
Ministry of Agriculture in respect to pesticides are taken as traditional to fill
the gap left by the private sector. There are also six local agents in Eritrea
facilitating importation of pesticide chemicals where they represent the
manufacturing companies in Europe and America. Pesticides are also imported
into Eritrea through international donations such as from Japan and USA for
the control of migratory pests.
Import permit for pesticides is obtained from the MOA, however there is no
legally supported body in Eritrea that permnits or regulates pesticide
importation and use. When a licensed agency applies to obtain an import
permit, the following information have to be contained in the application.
*   trade name, common name, chemical group;
*   formulation and active ingredients;
*   year of manufacturing,
*   packing and labelling;
*   safety precaution;
*   shelf-life;
*   chemical and physical properties, disposal method; and
*   information (Brochure etc.) on use.
(b) Storage
Usually imported pesticides are directly transported     from  the seaport or
Massawa to Asmara or to the Administrative Regionis. However, when the
pesticide consignment is in large quantity, it is stored at the seaport. There is
no adequate and sepcialized storage facility at Massawa designed for pesticides
17



and ensuring safety. The pesticides are usually stored in the open air without
any protection.
The MOA, Consorzio Agrario dell Eritrea, Ageca and Union Agriculture Input
and Services have chemical stores in Asmara but they may not have been
designed for such special products. The MOA has pesticide stores in Asmara
(Menaharia), Merhano and Daero Kaulos, which are managed from the head
quarter. It has also additional stores in some of the sub-regions such as Tsaeda
Christian, Serejeka, Segheneity, Hamelmalo, Adi-tekelezan and Debarwa. In
each of the Administrative Regions, the Ministry of Agriculture has general
stores where all types of agricultural inputs (pesticides, seeds, fertilizer, spare
parts, fuel and farm tools) are stored together.
The smallholder farmers do not have a separate store for pesticides in their
homes which situation cannot be expected under the Eritrean conceptual
setting which is featured with extreme poverty and unawareness. They simply
keep all their goods inside the single room home where all household activities
including cooking and eating are carried-out.
(c) Distribution
Once the pesticides are imported into the country; there is no quality control
testing, or monitoring and evaluation requirements. The MOA distributes the
pesticides to the user in the regions and sub-regions. Most of the chemicals are
imported in large containers of 200 liters size each. The distribution practice
from the stores of the MOA to small-scale and smallholder farmers is that such
farmers come with a 1-5 liters capacity container and purchase the pesticide. In
most cases, the containers for such use are emptied edible oil containers or
small plastic jerricans. Consorzio Agranro dell Eritrea, Ageca and Union
Agriculture Input and Services also distribute pesticide chemicals to farmers
from Asmara. There are no approved methods for retail distribution.
(d) Application methods
The most common methods of pesticide application are knapsack spray, tractor
mounted spray and aerial spray. The smallholders use hand operated knapsack
sprayers of 10-15 liter capacity; while tractor mounted sprayers are used in
commercial farms. Aerial spray is used on large scale cotton farms and for
control of migratory pests such as locust, bird and some times armyworm. In
general, the use of protective wear during pesticide application or handling
operations is not strictly followed by the regulators, employers and users. The
smallholder is the most exposed person to the effects of pesticides as he does
not afford to use such protective equipment at all because he cannot purclhase
it. The MOA distributes a limited number of these equipment to such farmers
only during a campaign against swarms of desert locust or armyworm. Even in
the commercial farms, ihe use of adequate protective wear is seldom.
18



The MOA collects empty pesticide containers from its offices in the regions
for safe disposal. Most of the containers are collected at different places each
year but it is not yet known hdw they are disposed. In Alighidir and Elabered
commercial farms, there are large quantities of empty pesticide containers. It is
not clear how smallholder farmners dispose their small containers used to
purchase pesticides. Some farmers have been observed to use pesticide
containers as grain or water containers which practice is serious in respect to
health.
(e) Safety period
Plants retain some pesticide residue after having been sprayed. The level of
chemical residue, its persistence, toxicity and hazard varies with the length of
the period between the dates of spraying and consumption and the properties of
the chemical used. Organochlorine chemical residues are stable and they
persist for long period on the treated plant which may be over six months.
Chemical residue on crops from organophosphates, carbamats and pyrethroids
may persist for about 7-15 days from the date of application. Sprayed
vegetables, fruits or animal forage plant may contain toxic effects on the
consumer if consumed immediately after pesticide application. Determination
of a safety period interval between pesticide application and harvest for
consumption by human-beings and animals is essential for any pesticide in use.
In Eritrea, there is neither adequate guideline nor regulatory mechanisms on
safety period requirements and the overall potential pesticide residue in foods.
Extension agents of the MOA advise farmers not to sell or use sprayed
vegetables or fruits up to 14 days after the date of the last pesticide application
but there is no monitoring.
5.1.1.1.4. Existing pesticide monitoring and evaluation
system
At present, there is no information, monitoring and evaluation systems on
environmental impacts from pesticide use in Eritrea. The country does not
possess adequate laboratory facilities, trained personnel, procedures and
protocols for the control of pesticides and their potential residues on foods or
animal feeds. There are no regulations on monitoring and evaluation
requirements or standards on tolerant residual limits and safety periods of
pesticide treated food commodities. All pesticides imported into Eritrea are
directly distributed to users without any evaluation tests on the formulation,
chemical properties including efficacy of the active ingredients.
5.1.1.1.5.1nstitutional Set-up
The MOA is the main institution to import and distribute pesticides in Eritrea
by virtue of the mandate given to it to promote agricultural development. The
Ministry distributes pesticides to its regional and sub-regional centers and
finally to farmers through its extension network. It also distributes pesticides to
the large commercial farms and other small-scale irrigated farms. It is
19



responsible to collect and dispose empty pesticide containers and obsolete
chemicals. Alighidir Agro-industry is the second largest importer and user of
pesticides for cotton production. It also distributes pesticides to its out-growers
in Tessenei areas. The five pesticide procurement-agents in Eritrea, namely
Saba Trading, Hamasien Trading, Dej. Gonafer Health care Eri-Medical and
Erifin (P.L^C) are not involved in pesticide distribution.
The "Plant Quarantine and Pesticide Proclamation" has been drafted and
submitted to the Ministry of Justice for further action. Although not approved
under this legislation, a Board of Pesticide Control under the MOA will be
formed and its mandate will be to control pesticide import and management on
behalf of the Minister. The Department of Environment of the Ministry of
Land, Water and Environment has developed a procedural manual for EA
which includes also the subject of pesticides. In accordance with this manual,
pesticides, except chlorinated hydrocarbons, are classified under category B.
The line Ministries and other government agencies are responsible to
implement the guidelines and the function of monitoring. For example, the
MOA is responsible in the implementation of the environmental protection
guidelines on natural resources base for agriculture, use of pesticides and other
related inputs. Although there is good cooperation between the DOE and MOA
for environmental management on those related to agriculture and its natural
resources base, but there is no clear functional linkage and delimitation,
supported by law and this may pose problems for the DOE.
The number of qualified staff working in crop protection in Eritrea is very low
as compared to the economic and environmental importance of pests and
pesticides. Most of them are in the MOA assigned at the headquarter and
regional offices. The Ministry has a team of eight crop protection specialists
divided in equal parts between the Department of Research and Human
Resource and the Extension Unit. The basic degree holders are plant science
graduates and others are diploma holders in general agriculture while most of
the technicians are school leavers. The University of Asmara has one
entomologist.
The main activity of the crop protection unit (MOA) is to organize train
farmers, monitor pest population dynamics, advise farmers on pest
management, and recommend pesticide application to farners in their
respective areas of responsibility.
The country lacks physical, human and financial resources to manage
pesticides. The MOA, the Department of Research and Human Resources and
the University of Asmara have crop protection laboratories, but these
laboratories have no capacity to satisfy the requirements of the proposed
legislation on pesticides or for monitoring and evaluating purposes to assist the
DOE.

The private sector such as the commercial farms have inadequate crop
protection personnel most of them    are plant science graduates with limited
crop protection specialization. None of the farms in the private sector have
field laboratories for monitoring and evaluation of pesticide efficacy and their
residues. These farmers practice safety measures-but it is limited to follow only
safety periods.
5.1.1.2. Fertilizer
In Eritrea, the use of commercial synthetic fertilizers on a national basis is
minimal. However, the use of organic fertilizers such as farm animal manure
and fallowing of fields have been always in practice as a method of soil
fertility maintenance. The synthetic fertilizers commonly used at present are
diammoniam phosphate (DAP) and urea. The rainfed system covers about 0.47
million hectare of land every year, while the irrigated land is only about 0.02
million hectare. Attempts are being made to intensify agriculture through the
use of inputs and irrigation. To this effect, the MOA has been promoting the
introduction of fertilizer application in the rainfed crop system at least in tllose
areas where rainfall is favourable. The application rates are not based on
adequate scientific grounds which may result into higher or lower doses as
compared to the nutrient intake of the plant and soil fertility status. The
recommended application rates of fertilizer are 100kg and 50kg per hectare for
DAP and urea, respectively irrespective of the soil types. This practice may
result into excessive fertilizer presence in the soils in some areas.
In the irrigated system, the use of commercial fertilizer is more intensivc
because it is cost-effective. These include the large scale commercial farming
21



systems based on combined rainfed and seasonal irrigation and those which are
specialized in horticulture. The irrigation water source in the latter system is
mainly shallow hand-dug wells, but in the highland area, exist also some small
dam reservoirs for the purpose. Almost all of these water sources are open,
hence exposed to contamination with fertilizer and pesticides, and they have a
combined use for irrigation, human and livestock consumption. In some of the
dam reservoirs, the land located immediately upstream is cultivated and
fertilizers are being used. This is one of the major environmental concerns in
respect to silting and fertilizer contamination. However, the land area covered
under irrigation in Eritrea is currently very limited.
These commercial fertilizers involve, being imported by sea, handling at the
port, storing and distribution to users in the same lines that it was described for
pesticides. In most cases, storage facilities throughout the cycle of fertilizer use
are inadequate and the overall handling and distribution systern is poor which
may result into spillage of fertilizer.
5.1.1.3. Restocking
Under normal conditions, farmers purchase animals from the primary domestic
markets where the exchange is usually farmer to farmer. However, the
experience gained in resettling returnees from the Sudan was that the local
supply was inadequate and some breeding animals were imported for
restocking from the Sudan. Generally, animal importation for breeding
purposes is not a very common practice in Eritrea. However in recent times,
some illegal importation practices are in progress to restock animals which
were lost during the last war with Ethiopia. In the process, some serious
environmental impacts such as the spread of diseases or disease vectors were
observed.
5.1.1.4. Seed importation
Since independence, cereal and pulses seed importation has been a common
practice in Eritrea. In the past, Ethiopia and the Sudan were the most common
sources, while now the list of sources has increased to include some Asian and
European countries although Ethiopia as a source does not exist any more.
Some of the vegetable seeds are imported from Europe. The causes for this
dependence on seed supply is the inability of most farmers in Eritrea to stock
seed requirements for the next year. The practice to stock seed has been
disturbed because -the producing households eat all of the annual harvest before
the next harvest season.
The capacity of the country in respect to phytosanitary and plant quarantine
requirements, quality control standards, appropriate storage and chemical
treatment of imported -seed, is generally poor. The phytosanitary certification
has not been fully developed and the legislation on this subject has not been
published. The practice of seed importation (cereals, pluses) is affected mostly
by the MOA with the aim of assisting the smallholder. These seeds include
22



sorghum, maize, barley, taff, chickpeas, vetch, horsebeans and almost all the
vegetable species cultivated in this country. Some of the latter are imported
also by the private sector.
The main crops grown in the war zone include sorghum, barley, wheat, finger
millet, pulses, sesame, cotton and vegetables under irrigation. Some of the
imported seed varieties within a given crop species are different from those
indigenous to Eritrea. The country does not possess adequate regulatory
mechanisms to control imported seeds. The environmental issues on seed
importation activity are mainly crop diseases and insects and genetic erosion.
In addition, the problem associated with the importation of undesirable plant
species such as weeds may also occur.
5.1.1.5. Veterinary drugs and biologicals
In Eritrea, all of the drugs and biological products and clinical instruments for
veterinary use are dependent on importation which is usually carried out by
government. The most common drug groups include trypanocides, acaricides
antihelminthics and microcidals. The main biologicals include vaccines for
FMD; PPR; CCPP; anithrax; HS and NCDV. The instruments include those
which are used for animal inoculation and bleeding operations. The veterinary
service centres are distributed throughout the country. The control mechanism
and legislation in respect to environmental protection is yet to be published.
5.1.1.6. Machinery
The use of agricultural machinery in Eritrea is very limited, but it has been
increased by many-folds during the last three years. The increase was mainly
due to the introduction of the Integrated Farming System (IFS) and partly
because expansion in cropping to increase production was desired. The reason
for the introduction for the IFS was to cope with the shortage of labour and
oxen during the 1998-2000 war. The main mechanized operation is crop land
preparation involving tractors and earth moving machinery. Most of the
machinery are imported by the MOA which has the responsibility of assisting
the smallholders. There are also private tractor operators for use although they
are very limited in number. Some of the operators have been trained in land
preparation while most of them have no training. In the past, utilization of
marginal dry land for cropping using machinery has been experienced resulting
into severe land degradation.
The ERP has an activity of importing agricultural machinery of which some
are heavy. These are intended to replace oxen and labour in land preparation
because most of the oxen were lost during the 'war. In the ERP area, there is
extreme variability in land forms, soil type, top-soil depth and rainfall. The
climate is, with the exception of small pockets, generally semi-arid and
considerable part of it is marginal land. In the ERP area such as the Debub
region, the top-soil is, in most cases, shallow due to severe soil erosion and the
23



land form is predominantly hilly. It is unlikely that selection of farm
machinery is being made to suite dryland farming practices.
5.1.1.7. Water Pump
Water pumps are used to harvest 'underground water. This ERP activity is
planned to rehabilitate and possibly to increase production in irrigated
horticulture. The sources of water pumps are both the public and the private
sectors.
5.1.1.8. Natural Resources Conservation
The MOA and the MOLG are the main public organizations in the country
which are directly involved in the conservation and regeneration of natural
resource particularly those which affect agriculture and drinking water supply.
The approach taken is through community involvement where food or cash for
work had been used as an instrument for conservation and job creation work.
In addition, students and the army have been also used occasionally.
The activities in soil/water conservation being carried-out include establishing
nurseries, tree planting, terracing, closing areas and constructing check dams
and dam reservoirs. Other organizations involved in some aspects of
conservation activities include the MLWE, MOD and MOE where the former
has the responsibility for the administration of land, water and environment,
while the latter two contribute labour for natural resources conservation
activities. Currently, the legislation on environment and the control of water
supply and demand is absent, while that on land resources exists but not
effectively enacted.
5.1.2. Agricultural and Livestock Activities Under ERP
5.1.2.1. Pesticides
The major crops grown in Debub Region are barley, wheat, taff, sorghum,
maize, pulses, vegetables and fruit trees. -Gash-Barka Region produces mainly
sorghum, pearl millet, sesame, cotton, vegetables and fruits. In both Regions,
pests are economically important in crop production. In these regions, aphids,
whitefly, and blight attack vegetables; while sorghum; maize and pearl-millet
are heavily damaged by stem borers, chafer (Pachnoda interapza), midges and
shooflies. Pests such as scale insects, fruit fly, codling moth and leaf minors
are seriously affecting citrus plants. To alleviate the crop pest problem, the
ERP will supply about '92,000 litres of pesticides-, 1800 sprayers and sets of
protective wears (gloves, mask, overall, boots...).

5.1.2.2. Fertilizer
The ERP Agricultural Component will supply about 1517(t) of fertilizers
consisting of urea and DAP (Diammonium phosphate) to the project area. The
fertilizer will be distributed through the MOA to the smallholders and irrigated
farming systems. Debub Region where soil infertility is high and the irrigated
horticulture in both affected regions are the main fertilizer users.
5.1.2.3. Restocking
Restocking activities of ERP will consist of both breeding and draught
animals. They include cattle, small ruminants, camel, donkey, poultry and bee-
colonies. The plan is to purchase animals from domestic and external markets
and it is very likely that considerable number of animals will be imported from
the Sudan as the local source,is inadequate. Poultry and exotic dairy cattle are
likely to be imported from Europe.

ERP will also supply 750 (MT) of poultry feed and 375 (MT) of concentrate
feed for dairy animals. The source is to be external as there is an acute shortage
in animal feed in the domestic market.
5.1.2.4. Seed importation
Supply of crop seed materials to the farmers in the war and drought affected
zones is a major activity. They consist of cereals, oilseeds, pulses, fibber crops
and vegetables. The list prepared by the MOA on the planned seed
procurement is very long, however the main types will be sorghum, sesame,
barley, taff, maize, chickpeas and a range of vegetable seeds. Considering the
current shortage of seed supply in Eritrea, most of the items are likely to be
imported from the Sudan and other countries including Asia and Europe.
5.1.2.5. Veterinary Supplies
The project area affected by war and drought is traditionally a major livestock
producer and its productivity affects the livelihood of the population.
Infectious diseases and parasites constitute a serious constraint in livestock
productivity of the region. The main supplies include drugs such as
trypanocides, acaricides and vaccines against sheep/goat pasteurellosis CCPP,
FMD, fowl cholera, antihelmintics, antimicrobials, poultry preparations and
those directed to treat metabolic disorders. The animal health package contains
also considerable clinical and surgical instruments such as disposable syringes
and needles.
5.1.2.6. Machinery
The provision of agricultural machinery to the project area is a major activity.
It aims to strengthen the IFS where the MOA organizes the smallholders into
groups to prepare their crop fields and in some cases machinery are used to
seed, harvest and thresh cereal crops. There are also activities involved in
water conservation through stream flood diversion. However, the main activity
is land preparation, hence more tractors will be used.
5.1.2.7. Water pump
In the irrigated small-scale agricultural system, production has been disrupted
due to insecurity and destruction of water pumps. To redress this, the ERP has
the water pump supply activity where 25,000 pumps with accessories will be
distributed to farmners.
5.1.2.8. Natural Resources Conservation
This activity will strengthen the already existing programme. The inputs will
be mainly tools for communities to prepare bunds, and tree-holes.

5.2. POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND SIGNIFICANCE
5.2.1. Pesticides
Different types of pesticides are to be used in the project area to increase crop
yields which is positive impact. However, they have also potential negative
environmental impacts. They are directly toxic to human-beings, animals,
pollinators, natural enemies, soil bacteria and wildlife at certain concentration
levels. Potentially, pesticides are also carcinogenic, tetratogenic and may also
disrupt the endocrine system. The potential contamination of pesticides start
right from the port of entry and continues up to the harvested crop or its
residues entering the food webs and chains. Pesticides have potential negative
impacts at the different points of handling, which include storing, distributing,
transporting and application.
The pesticide unloading and loading operations at the port of entry (Massawa)
may cause damage of containers if handling is poor. This may lead into
leakage of pesticides hence contamination of the sea-water. The potential
negative impact is the toxicity to fish and other marine organisms.
Transporting of pesticides requires great care to avoid the physical damage of
containers and subsequent leakage of pesticide. Leakage of such chemicals
during transportation may cause negative impact on the environment due to
toxicity to plants, animals and soil bacteria. There is no security that pesticides
are not loaded or transported in the same carrier together with food, animal
feed or general consumer goods which may also result into negative
environmental impact.
The MOA has general stores in the regions where pesticides, seeds, fertilizers,
spare parts, fuels and farm tools are stored together. This type of storage
system may cause negative environmental impact in case of pesticide leakage.
Spilled chemicals may contaminate seeds, fertilizer or tools that would be toxic
to users. In addition, pesticides are flammable and they can be dangerous in
cause of fire accident in the store. Most of the subsistence farmers in the
project area do not have a separate store for pesticides. This may cause a
serious health hazard to the family and in particular children. It must be
recognized that such operators and farmers do not possess the minimum
awareness on pesticides.
Most of the pesticides in Eritrea are imported in large containers, such as the
200 liter capacity barrel. The pesticide is distributed to farmers in small
containers of 1-5 liters capacity each which containers are brought by the
farmers. This operation of transferring pesticides from large to small
containers may cause contamination of operators and there is no guarantee that
such containers are not -used for other purposes after the pesticide is used.
These may cause negative environmental impacts of toxicity to pesticide
handlers and household member-s of farmers.
27



Most farmers especially vegetable producers use knapsack sprayer for pest
control. During spraying, most farmers do not use approved protective wears
and they may be exposed to pesticide contamination. Under this condition,
pesticide may easily penetrate into the body of the operator through oral,
cutaneous or respiratory routes. The last two routes are the most risky to
human health, because the chemicals may penetrate to the body of the user
without awareness of the farmer and because farmers usually don't have
regular medical check-ups. The chemicals such as the chlorinated
hydrocarbons (CHC) may accumulate in the body fat or liver which can be
fatal in. later years when the fat is reused by the body. This is the most
significant negative environmental impact from the use of persistent pesticides.
In the project area, aerial spraying may be used to control swarms of insect
pests and birds. jUses of aerial or tractor spray is less directed to the target crop
and has more drift than the manual knapsack spray method. The drift can be
carried away by wind covering considerable distances and may contaminate
untargeted areas or objects such as pastures, soil, water points and villages.
This could be of health hazard to animals feeding on contaminated grazing
area or by drinking contaminated water. The chemical residues in such waters,
crops or grasses may cause chronic poisoning in mammals if chlorinated
hydrocarbons are used. Any living things in the area including soil bacteria
may be affected. Aerial spraying needs special care to minimize the negative
impact from chemical drift.
Empty pesticide containers may produce a negative environmental impact as
they are contaminated with toxic chemicals. In some places, it has been
observed that smallholders use pesticide containers for water and food storage
purposes.
Pesticide residues on food grain or crop straw/stover are toxic to animals and
human-beings if the levels are beyond the approved " Minimum Residual
Level" (MRL). The consumption of vegetables and fruits or animal feeds
immediately after pesticide application has been carried-out on them may
result into negative impact of toxicity on consumers.
In Eritrea, there is no information on the subject of pesticide residue on foods
as there are no legal requirements or capacity to verify. There is no point to
expect immediate export of horticultural products without complying with
such requirements as contained in the Codex Alimentarius.

5.2.2. Fertilizer
The synthetic fertilizers to be used in the project area include diammonium
phosphate (DAP) which contains 40% (P205) and 18% nitrate (NO3). The
positive impact of these fertilizers is the increase in crop yield provided that
other conditions and in particular soil moisture availability are optimal.
However, the potential negative impacts of concern include toxicity to human-
beings and livestock. They may contaminate water bodies including the ground
water reserves. The nitrates and nitrites are toxic in nature. although nitrate in-
se is usually 10 times less toxic than nitrite. Their significance as a cause of
poisoning is due to the conversion of nitrates into nitrites in the feed or
digestive tract. This conversion is of particular significance in ruminant
animals.
The presence of excess phosphorus in animal feeds may alter the calcium
phosphorus ratio. When this occurs, the blood contains abnormal amounts of
assimilated phosphorus. To balance this at 2:1 ratio (Ca:P) within the blood,
excessive amounts of calcium are drawn upon from the reserves in the body of
the affected individual resulting into decalcification (osteomalacia) of the
skeleton. Phosphorus may cause parenchymatous disturbances in cell
metabolism, principally in the liver, kidneys and heart.
If crop plants or weeds are fertilized with liberal amounts of nitrate fertilizer,
such plants may take excessive amounts (1.5% DM) of nitrate. The use of
herbicide 2,4-D causes some weeds which are normally unpalatable to be
palatable for animals and accumulation of higher levels of nitrate. When such
plants are ingested, they are converted into nitrites. Nitrite interferes with the
transport of oxygen in the blood. The nitrites oxidize ferrous haemoglobin to
ferric haemoglobin (inethemoglobin) which cannot cany oxygen. Death is due
to hypoxia and it occurs when about 75% of the ferrous haeinoglobin has been
converted into methemoglobin. The nitrate contaminated feed or food may
develop potentially lethal methemoglobinemia.
29



The chemical fertilizer compounds applied on the soil to improve plant
nutrition have to be dissolved and absorbed by the plant roots in their ionized
form. However, the fertilizer applied may not be absorbed totally by the plant
roots either because they are in excess or not being dissolved. The fertilizer
that remains in the soil may be washed by run-off and end up in water bodies
or percolate through the soil. The translocation rate of the fertilizer will depend
on rainfall intensity, soil type, distance between point of application and water
bodies and topography.
The adverse environmental impact of chemical fertilizers besides the direct
toxic effects when they contaminate the water bodies is due to the increased
soil fertility in the bottom of water bodies such as lakes, or ponds. This
promotes the production of excessive phytoplankton and other water
vegetation and this provides food for herbivorous insects, fish and crustaceans.
When this organisms die, they settle as sediments and are decomposed by the
action of bacteria to increase the fertility of the bottom of the water bodies
which process is known as eutrophication. This process is accelerated by the
intensive use of organic nitrogen and inorganic soluble phosphate when the
concentration of ions exceeds a certain level (nitrogen = 0.03ppm and
phosphate = O.Olppm), the algae population may become high. Some of the
potential negative impacts are:
(a) release of hydrogen sulphide gas (H2S);
(b) release of substances toxic to human-beings and fish by some
species of blue algae;
(c) reduced water quality due to bad smell and taste;
(d) reduction of dissolved oxygen by bacterial action, hence death of
fish by asphyxia; and
(e) increase in costs of cleaning the affected water bodies.
5.2.3. Restocking
The ERP area has lost considerable number of livestock during the war. The
war coincided with the time where most of the livestock in the pastoralist
system were concentrated in their' dry season grazing area which is the war
zone. Provision of these animals will produce positive impact in the area by
increasing income and food supply availability. The source of some of these
animals is expected to be mostly the Sudan. The animal breeds within species,
especially cattle, are different from those indigenous to Eritrea. The main
environmental issues associated with the importation of exotic animals are
genetic. erosion, biological vectors of diseases and transboundary disease.
Currently, there are no livestock quarantine facilities or livestock movement
control practice in Eritrea. Sudan is endemic to major animal diseases.
The most important- potential negative environmental impacts through the
importation of livestock include introduction of tranboundary diseases and
disease vectors such as ticks and tsetse flies. In the Sudan, animal diseases
such as CBPP, ECF, typanosomniasis (,tagana) transmitted by species of the
30



sub-genus Glossina are endemic. Eritrea is free from these diseases except
T.vivax maintained without Glossina. In the past, CCPP has been introduced
into Eritrea from the Sudan through imported goats and it is causing heavy
economic losses. Their introduction into Eritrea means heavy costs on their
control, high death rates, reduction in productivity and.limiting trade. The most
serious vectors are Glossina and Theileria parva infected Rhicipecephalus
appendiculatus. In the case of dairy cattle imported from Europe there is the
problem of diseases such as BSE; and ECF in the case of Kenya. The same
negative impact may occur through animal movement within the country by
spreading endemic diseases when such animals are purchased in endemic
regions and taken to areas free from such diseases.
The second potential negative impact is genetic erosion of farm animal breeds
leading into loss of the naturally selected indigenous gene pool. The
indigenous breeds of cattle, sheep and goats in Eritrea, although they are non-
descript, have been evolved through generations and producing populations
which are well adapted to the local conditions of feed, climate, disease
resistance and production system. The potential negative impact may be
expressed by lowering these genetic traits hence productivity performance of
the indigenous breed. The Barka cattle breed in Eritrea is one of the prominent
tropical breeds for dual purposes and conservation of this indigenous genetic
resource is essential.
5.2.4. Seed import
The seeds to be imported under ERP include most of the common cereals,
pulses, oil-seeds and vegetables. It is likely also that the origins would be
several countries which complicates the environmental issues. The activity will
produce positive impact by increasing food supply availability. The most
potential negative environmental impacts depending on the plant species and
country of origin, is the introduction of plant diseases and insect pests. The
diseases could be viral, bacterial or fungal and the insect pests could be of
various species and severity. The immediate impact may be due to the
reduction of crop yield for the IDPs, but the impact may become more
significant when the diseases establish themselves in the country causing
heavy economic losses by decreasing yields and increasing control costs.
The second potential negative impact is genetic erosion. The indigenous strains
of a given crop species have been passing through natural selection to be more
adapted to the local conditions such as resistance to pests and adverse climate
and other factors influencing crop yield performance.
5.2.5. Veterinary Drugs and Related Supplies
The livestock activity of the ERP includes provision of various drugs,
biological products and clinical instruments. Provision of these inputs will
reduce economic loss due to diseases and parasites, hence a positive impact.
The potential negative environmental impacts are varied depending on the
31



nature of the drugs or biological products in use. However, drugs are poisons
by nature, hence their faulty use may result into contamination of foods of
animal origin. The most significant impact is health hazard to human-beings
deriving from the use of acaricides or insecticides where hosts are treated
against external and at times including intemal parasites. These include
arsenous  compounds   (arsenious  oxide),  chlorinated  hydrocarbons,
organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids. The second group which is
currently prohibited in most countries has the property of being highly
liposoluble, stable under different conditions and cumulative effect.
In the process of acaricide application using a hand-operated sprayer, the user,
the host and the surroundings are exposed to chemical contamination. The user
who is not wearing adequate protective clothing and usually unaware on the
effect of the acaricides on health is likely to take-up part of the chemical being
applied (contact, inhalation, or ingestion). The spraying operation being
carried-out in the open will contaminate the grass and soil affecting the
biodiversity and water bodies in the proximity. The animal being treated
especially with chlorinated hydrocarbons will absorb part of the chemical
being applied.
The pesticides used to treat animal hosts against ticks, mange mites, insects
and skin diseases are likely to produce negative environmental impacts. The
most important is the cumulative effect of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which
results into chronic poisoning. When absorbed by the skin of mammalians or
ingested they are stored in many parts of the body but in the adipose and
parenchymatous tissues in particular. They are also eliminated through milk
secretion immediately after application. Such products may have also negative
impacts on the health of farmers during application on the coat of the animal
without the use of approved protective wears and awareness.
In respect to biological products, the potential negative environmental impact
is associated with either contaminated or live vaccines which may revert to be
pathogenic. An example of the latter is anthrax, live spore vaccine. The impact
is mainly economic through the loss of affected animals, but it could also kill
human-beings through the mutation of the B.anthracis. The contaminated
vaccines may cause suppurative lesions such as abscess at the point of
injection which rmay cause systemic infection leading to death due to pymia or
may render the meat of the affected part inedible.
The creation of drug resistance on populations of vectors, parasites and
pathogenic microorganisms is also a potentially serious negative impact. This
can occur particularly in respect to acaricides, trypanocides and some
antimicrobials.
5.2.6. Mlachinery
The use of tractors will facilitate land preparation for crop production hence
more food will be produced which is a positive impact. The deep ploughing
32



practices in parts of the project area where the land is marginal, soils are light,
top-soils are shallow and rainfall is low, may have a negative environmental
impact on the soils due to disturbance in respect to nutrient, moisture,
bacteriology and structure. The practice may expose the soil nutrients to be
depleted within a short period of time, hence after one or two successive
cropping seasons, application of fertilizers will be essential. The deep
ploughing at the first operation in land preparation will give positive impact
due to higher penetration of water, but if deep ploughing is repeated for
seeding, the loss of soil moisture through evaporation would be at a faster rate.
The repeated ploughing at the same level of the soil depth will result also into
the formation of pancake type layer which can hardly be penetrated by water.
The deep ploughing also disturbs the soil bacteriology hence ammonification
and nitrification bacteria will be affected. There is also a tendency to plough
more marginal land simply because of the availability of tractors. In the past,
through the IFS, it was observed that wrong direction of ploughing (along run-
off) was practiced which resulted into soil erosion. The use of farm
implements not selected in accordance with the soil types may also cause
negative impact by exposing the land to soil erosion.
5.2.7. Water Pumps
The water pumps in the project area will be used for inigation. The positive
impact is that production high value crops will restart and the farmers will gain
income and the increased food supply availability in respect to fruits and
vegetables in the country will have also a positive impact on nutrition.
The use of pumps or irrigation may result into potentially negative
environmental impact of which salinity is the most significant. It is caused by
repeated irrigation or overpumping where water withdrawal is more than
replenishment. As the water table drops, salts may be continuously deposited
in the soil and if the water level joins the salt level, the salts will move upward
to the plant through the capillary system which will interfere with the
performance of the crop. This will also make the continuous pumping too
expensive. Over exploitation of individual wells or the underground aquifer
reserve in a given area using too many wells sited close to each other may have
negative impact by drying some of the wells, hence destruction of existing
crops due to lack of water. By digging the wells further deep, the impact will
be salinity and depletion of water supply which will permanently reduce the
capacity of the underground aquifers affect also the natural vegetation in the
area.
5.2.8. Bee colony importation
This activity has positive environmental impact by increasing the incomes of
the smallholder farmer-s througLh the sales of honey. Imports of bee colonies are
likely to be made because the supply availability of the local wild strain (Apis
mellifera) is low. In this case, the importation of exotic bees may have
33



negative environmental impact on the indigenous strains through exotic
disease spread.
Additional potentially negative impact is inifant botulism or death due to
contamination of honey with spores of Clostridium botulinunm. The spores are
omnipresent in the environment and they do not affect adults and children but
infants. The reason is that very young infants have less acidic digestive tracts
and less competition from bacterial flora as it has not been yet developed. The
spores may develop into vegetative forms in the intestines of children who
consume such products. The effect of the bacterial toxin is irreversible
paralysis of the motor nerve endings of the affected infant. This problem is
usually associated with bad storage and handling conditions of honey.
5.3. REVIEW OF TIHE NEAPG IN RESPECT TO AGRICULTURE
The introduction of the NEAPG has marked an important progress towards the
subject of environmental protection in Eritrea. However, it becomes imperative
to think that such documents are reviewed periodically to ensure reflection of
local realities or applicability. They should be also continuously updated to
respond to new changes. They must accommodate new activities and
advancement in knowledge or local experience gained on environmental
issues. Environment is multidisciplinary, hence it should involve participation
of all actors in a given ecosystem and specialists in various fields rather than
being dominated by groups of limited knowledge. The notion that of a single
person to be specialist on environment is the duty of only selected people will
dwarf the science of environmental management. This is reflected by the crude
treatment of the subject of animals and their products.
The major issues which require attention are of technical and institutional
nature. From the technical point of view, the bredth and depth could be
improved to cover as wide subjects as possible and the depth must ensure
scientific grounds as much as possible. It lacks also some local considerations
probably because it was prepared by people who may not know the local
realities in great depth. This is justified by the high emphasis given to urban
issues and less on those of rural issues.
From the institutional stand point, there are issues to be addressed. First, the
legislation must be gazetted. Second, the DOE must not have only the legal
powers but capacity to enforce the laws and regulations. Since its function is
only policy formulation and regulatory, it should be able to prepare by-laws,
regulations and directives; while delegating its technical duties to competent
authorities on a given subject within the public sector.
Third, the responsibilities of the various public sector agencies and associated
requirements should be legally delimitated where all have to be linked to the
DOE. Fourth, the legislation of authority on environment should ensure
34



coherence and not overlapping of powers with other existing national
legislations.
There are animal species used as food sources supplying meat, milk or eggs.
Animals and their products are also subject to processing. Hence any chemical
or biological contamination of these animals or the raw products and by-
products or processed products or by-products may produce negative
environmental impacts on the health of consumers. In the process of external
parasites or vector control such as ticks, mange mites, lice, and fleas,
chemicals  such  as  acaricides  are  used. These  products include
organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids and chlorinated hydrocarbons
which can contaminate milk, meat or egg of the treated animal. They may be
deposited in the adipose and prenchymatous tissues of such animals and some
may be excreted through the milk of a treated lactating animal. The negative
impacts on human-beings is the consumption of such contaminated products
which may produce lethal toxicity. Most of the drugs used to treat animals are
potentially toxic depending on the amounts deposited or excreted. There are
standards such as the Minimum Residual Level (MRL) and "Acceptable Daily
Intake "(ADI) to indicate safety levels or thresholds of drug residue on foods of
animal origin.
Food products may be also contaminated at the production site or where they
are stored handled or processed. Such premises require minimum
environmental health quality standards. Animal feeds produced or processed or
stored in places of poor environmental standards may cause health hazards on
livestock directly and on human-beings indirectly.
These potential environmental impacts are of high significance and they should
be included in the NEAPG without overlapping with the draft legislation titled
"Animals and Animal Products Proclamation ". The monitoring and evaluation
function on matters of animal products could be delegated to an approved
institution. The compliance of this is crucial for the trade of livestock and their
products. This is an example that the document has to be redirected to local
realities.
The NEAPG should contain the approved list of pesticides and the associated
standards such ag the MRL and ADI on each compound. The standard
requirements on storage and application should be determined and the testing
function can be given to designated institutions, which are proved to have
capacity.
The list of prohibited and restricted pesticides seems to be a copy from that of
the advanced countries. In the guideline, Malathion and Fenitrothion are listed
"under strict condition" of use whereas, these chemicals are approved for use
in Eritrea by the MOA    without restrictive requirements. At present,
Dimethoate and Fenitrothion chemicals are widely used in the countiy for
control of pests and locust respectively. DDT is also used by the MOH under
the same context of "unider strict coniditions ". The document does not define
35



the meaning of the strict conditions and does not indicate monitoring and the
threshold. It should not be forgotten that the developing countries are taken as
places for disposing dangerous substances by some firms in the developed
countries.
The guideline mentions the need of monitoring and evaluation of pesticides
and pesticide sprayed areas. In the manual, it is written that the monitoring and
evaluation methods should be prepared by the project owner. However, this
may face a problem because the project owners may not have capacity to
carry-out in accordance with the requirements. It is not realistic and safe within
the present objective realities of Eritrea to delegate such technical
responsibilities even when the DOE does not have the capacity. The DOE
should prepare technical monitoring and evaluation guidelines and it should be
attached to the manual.
The functions of the other public sector organizations in respect to
environmental management are not clearly specified and their physical, human
and financial resources capacity are not ensured. For instance, the MOA may
be delegated for regulating pesticides in respect to environmental safety when
used for crops and livestock, but the Ministry has no adequate means of
monitoring and evaluating on the use of such chemicals. The functions,
protocols, procedures and standards must be specified by the DOE. The results
of such activities must be reported to the DOE for documentation. The manual
does not clearly state on the powers, administrative procedures and technical
requirements, for instance, on the importation of agrochemicals, their
distribution and modalities.
5.4. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MITIGATION OF IMPACT
5.4.1. Pesticides
5.4.1.1. General
Damage of pesticide container at the seaport should be prevented through safe
procedures in unloading and loading by using efficient techniques and strict
supervision of the operations. To minimize spills or leaks of chemicals at the
port, chemicals must be stored in safe place. Leakage of pesticides during
transportation could contaminate the land and soil organisms. Adequate guide
and training must be given to truck drivers carrying pesticides on the hazard of
chemicals and their safety to avoid the damage of pesticide containers during
transportation. The labelling on containers and the transporting truck must
have the sign of "health hazard".
Availability of safe pesticide storage at eveiy level must be ensured and their
management system must be provided in writing at the regional and sub-
regional centers. Farmers in the project area should be trained on how to
manage pesticide and the respective empty containers.
36



In Eritrea, most of the pesticides are packed in large containers and they have
to be distributed into small containers for distribution. In this operation,
contamination may occur affecting the operators. The impact from pesticide
distribution operation could be reduced by packing pesticides in small original
containers reflecting the need of the individual farmers.
Pesticide containers have a negative environmental impact because such
containers are at times, used for water or storage of materials. The
contamination from empty pesticide containers to human-beings, animals and
other organisms can be prevented through approved methods of disposal of the
containers after use. Under the project, all pesticide suppliers and distributors
must be responsible and required to collect all used containers from users to
minimize hazards.
Lack of pesticide residue analysis on food of plant and animal origin has an
impact particularly on fresh vegetables, fruits and animal feeds. There is need
to establish an analysis laboratory with all the necessary facilities, equipment
and trained staff. Such laboratories will help to determine the efficacy of
pesticides; pesticide resistance and toxicity levels. The active ingredient of all
pesticides must be determined before the chemical is widely distributed to the
regions.
Most of the small-scale vegetable and fruit producers do not use protective
wears during pesticide application. To minimize the risk of the hazard from
pesticide contact, farmers must use all necessary protective wears. The farmers
need to be trained on techniques of spraying, hazard of pesticide and use of
protective wears.
All pesticides should be imported according to the approved list, import permit
specifications and labelled in local languages. Selecting of pesticides must be
done according to the National Environmental Assessment Procedures and
Guidelines of the Department of Environment, Eritrea.
The guidelines include:
a) Common name, Trade name, active ingredients and formulation,
b) Is the proposed chemical approved for use in the country or
prohibited because of its toxicity or persistence in the environment?
c) Does the proposed chemical comply with the safety measures
according to the regulation of the country?
d) What precautions should be taken during the use of the pesticides
(hazard to human and animals, water sources) and
e) Was the pesticide in use in the country before or has the chemical
been tested in the research centre?
37



5.4.1.2. Integrated pest management
The current pest control practice in Eritrea is based on the use of pesticides.
Although the annual total use of pesticides in Eritrea is low, intensification of
these practices would lead into serious environmental impacts. These include
toxicity to mammals or other useful organisms such as those of soil bacteria
responsible for ammonification and nitrification. It may also establish pest
species resistant to the existing pesticides. The presence of pesticide residues
on foods will also affect the much desired export trade of the country on
agricultural products. The use of pesticides has also the impact of increasing
cost of production and forex demand.
The long-terrn strategy of the country in crop pest control should be to develop
Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Insect pests, diseases, and weeds can be
controlled without the, use of pesticides or at least with their minimum use. The
altemative strategy to the sole reliance on pesticides is to use low level of
external inputs and focus on organic farming and integrated pest management
(IPM). These systems have been used successfully to eliminate or reduce the
use of pesticides in many countries. IPM is an approach that combines
different pest control techniques and integrates them into the overall fanrning
systems. It includes the use of good agricultural practices, physical methods,
resistant varieties, biological control, pheromones and minimum use of
pesticides that are selective and biodegradable to have less ecological damage.
The approach is environmentally, technically and economically sustainable.
The ultimate goal of an IPM program is cost-effective crop protection, which
is within the capabilities of the users and does not harm humans or the
environment in general. IPM is based on monitoring of pest population
density; development of economic and safe threshold levels in pesticides and
adoption of this method reduces over 50% reliance on pesticides. IPM has
created a great awareness among policy makers, politicians and farmers in
Eritrea. The MOA is promoting IPM and it has requested the partners in
development to increase their support for the approach so that it can' be
extended to all farmers in Eritrea. Accordingly, the MOA with the assistance
of Danida is formulating a policy on IPM. Once the policy is formulated, IPM
will be the main strategy for controlling crop pests in the country but it is also
true that it demands time and investment to be fully established.
(a) Basic work plan of IPM
*  farmers will be encouraged to use good agricultural
practices such as timely sowing, seed rate, weeding and
proper crop husbandry to reduce pest population in their
respective fields.
*  use physical methods such as hand picking, traps, and
trenches.
38



* intensify biological control that includes conservation and
augmentation of biological control agents both in perennial
and annual crops.
* develop and release of seed varieties proved to be resistant
against diseases and insect pests.
* use minimum amounts of selective pesticides that are easily
degradable and safe to the environment and their use should
be as a last resort.
* provide regular training to extension workers and farmers
on integrated pest management.
* in cooperation of farners, conduct periodic monitoring of
pests, which will help to strengthen the IPM programme and
to take early action against crop pests.
(b) Action
Under the IPM programme farmers must be provided with farrner field schools
on major insect pests, plant diseases and weeds which are common in their
respective areas. They should be trained on the basic identification and
recognition of crop pests and beneficial insects, their monitoring system,
control strategies, equipment use and maintenance. Some of the enlightened
farmers of each village could be assigned as village brigade to work as crop
protection specialist such as monitoring of pests, pesticide identification,
handling and lead the pest management of their respective villages. The village
brigades will work very close with the extension workers in combating pests in
each village. Pest control programme should be carried-out after proper
monitoring and understanding of the ecological and biological properties of the
pests. With this (IPM) programme many trainers and training centres should be
established in the country to further disseminate the IPM programme and
reduce the high dependency on pesticides.
(c) Pesticide selection
Pesticides should be selected in accordance with the list of the approved
pesticides for use in the country, the guidelines of the Department of
Environment and the type of pest intended to be controlled. In IPM
programmes, the use of chemicals must be minimum; they have to be selective
and easily degradable.
Selecting of pesticides should be done according to the Environmental
Evaluation Questionnaire (EEQ) of the National Environmental Assessnlent
Procedures and Guidelines of the Department of Environment, Eritrea. The
guidelines require information on: identity, toxicity, persistence, safety
measure, application, test results, active ingredient and fonnulation.
39



5.4.13. Fertilizer
The potential negative impacts by contaminating water bodies with synthetic
fertilizers can occur at the port of entry and at the point of fertilizer application
or the farm. The risk of fertilizer spillage and polluting the sea-water at the
port of entry can be prevented by strict inspection of fertilizer containers and
appropriate care in the use of machinery during unloading and loading
operations to prevent damage of the fertilizer containers. Adequate stores must
be provided to prevent damage of containers at every level. At the farm level,
the impact can be mitigated by determining the needs of fertilizer for a given
field or crop on a scientific basis or using the exact rate of application so that
excessive amounts that are not taken up by the plant are not present in the soil.
Use of fertilizer on fields located immediately upstream of water bodies such
as dams should be avoided to prevent water contamination by run-off and
percolation. Water bodies and particularly those which are the sources of
drinking water for human-beings or livestock must be protected from being
contaminated with nitrites or nitrates in particular. The use of fertilizers where
soil moisture is low should be prevented so as to avoid their accumulation on
the soil from where underground aquifer.may be permanently contaminated or
creating salinity. The key mitigatory measure is to introduce good agricultural
practices and water management system.
5.4.1.4. Restocking
The impact on farm animal genetic resources erosion can be prevented by
preventing importation of animal species that are likely to genetically erode the
indigenous breeds. These indigenous breeds have been evolved through time to
be well adapted to the local conditions. The alternative to prevent this negative
impact is by organizing breeding centers of the local breeds and distributing to
farmers starting with priority areas and households.
Introduction of serious transboundary diseases or vectors can be effectively
prevented by establishing veterinary checkpoints at the expected entry points
along the boundaries, establish control zone, surveillance, quarantine, chemical
treatment of animals to be free of vectors, vaccination (if applicable) and
testing of animals to detect circulating antibodies (if applicable) specific to the
pathogen of the disease being prevented to enter into the country. In causes
such as CBPP, test and slaughter method could effectively prevent the disease
entry.
5.4.1.5. Importing of exotic seed
The potential negative impact by eroding the genetic make up of indigenous
seed varieties can be prevented by not allowing the entry of exotic varieties of
the same plant species indigenous to Eritrea. An alternative for this could be
multiplication of the local seed varieties commercially or through the famiing
communities in each region. Such prepared seed should be distributed and seed
should be stored every year for the next cropping year. The negative impact
40



deriving from the entry of insect pests and diseases of plant into Eritrea can be
prevented by subjecting the imported seed and containers to strict
phytosanitary and quarantine requirements and to chemical treatment or
fumigation or by carrying-out specific tests at the port of entry to ensure that
the seed is free of disease and insect pests before distribution.
The potential impact of undesirable plant seeds that may enter the country in
mixture with the imported crop seed can be mitigated by visual examination of
adequate number and size of samples taken from the seed containers. If such
seed consignments are heavily contaminated, they should be destroyed or fed
to animals but only after grinding.
5.4.1.6. Veterinary Drugs and related
The potential negative impact of acaricides on the user can be prevented by
procuring and using safe products; using correct application rates wearing
approved protective wear during application; training the user on the handling
and application procedures and the toxic nature. The impact of chronic
poisoning on human-beings through cumulative depositions of the acaricide
residue in the tissues of the animal body such in fats and meat of food animals
can be prevented by avoiding the use of chemicals of high persistence property
such as the chlorinated hydrocarbons. To prevent the impact on health from
acaricide residue being present in foods, such as milk originating from treated
animals, the use of persistent acaricides should be avoided. Even if the other
acaricide groups are used, safety period must be determined and instructed
following the use of the drug. The (MRL) and (ADI) must be established.
The negative impacts of drug residue from the use of other veterinary drugs on
food of animals must be based on the (MRL) and (ADI) results on each drug as
compared to standards. These drugs could be also used for treatment or
prevention of diseases by giving them through feeds. There are international
standards on most of the drugs and the food control authorities must follow the
requirements to mitigate the negative environmental impacts due to drug
residue on foods of animal origin.
The potential negative environmental impacts on livestock or human-beings
from using biological products on food animals could be prevented by
subjecting such products to standard purity, safety and innocuity tests as
prescribed for each product before distribution. In the case of handling
infective microorganisms or disease vectors for experimental purposes, the
negative impacts can be minimised by practising approved labelling,
packaging, storing, handling, application and safe disposing of drug residues
and containers.
The negative impacts from the disposal of clinical instruments, drug containers
or opened but unused drugs can be prevented by using approved methods of
disposal. These materials, depending on nature, should be decontaminated or
41



neutralized by physical or chemical methods and should be either burned or
buried at the end.
5.4.1.7. Machinery
The potential negative environmental impacts from the use of the agricultural
machinery is land degradation and changes in attitude of the farners towards
abandoning the use of oxen for crop cultivation. The impact on land
degradation can be mitigated by (i) not using machinery on marginal land so as
to prevent exposure to soil erosion through destabilizing the already fragile
land; (ii) selecting the right type and size of machinery such as plough for the
soil types and (iii) to apply the techniques in arid-land farming systems, or zero
tillage. When deep ploughing is practised on land with deep soils, it should be
limited to only the first ploughing while the subsequent operations should be
shallow. This will mitigate the loss of soil moisture by evaporation. To
mitigate the tendency of farmers to replace oxen by tractors research and
extension service on the use of small hand-driven machineries, depending on
conditions, should be strengthened.
The potential negative impact due to faulty ploughing by tractors such as
leaving of pockets or strips of unploughed land, wrong direction of ploughing
in respect to that of run-off which may result into soil erosion can be mitigated
by training tractor operators.
5.4.1.8. Bee colony importation
The negative environmental impacts are associated with the importation of bee
colony and storage and handling of honey. The first impact can be minimized
by importing bee colonies only from countries known to be free from serious
bee diseases The second impact of poisoning infants due to the ingestion of
honey contaminated with C.botulinum toxin can be rnitigated by training
honey producers and consumers on better storage and handling of honey.

6. HOUSING COMPONENT
6.1. INTRODUCTION
Any human being should be entitled to have a habitat or shelter to live in, and
such a habitat must ensure the minimum required standards of protection from
the environment. Basically, the requirement is safety from predators, diseases
and adverse climatic factors and that a minimum comfort is secured. The
potential predators could be dangerous people or wild animals. Diseased
conditions due to poor housing could derive from insect vectors such as
mosquito, or glosina and rats or poisonous vernins including snakes. The
other aspect of disease condition that occurs from inadequate housing is that
the house could be constructed in such a manner that it does not allow to carry-
out adequate hygienic practices and sanitation. It may be also poorly designed
to allow adequate ventilation or it may be too small to cause overcrowding of
the household members promoting spread of diseases through infected aerosols
or that comfort is compromised.
The present housing standards in Eritrea are generally low to satisfy the
minimum requirements on health and comfort and the problem is more
accentuated among the populations of all the rural and the urban poor. In rural
areas, considerable amount of wood is used for house construction and this
practice results into serious environmental impacts. The causes include poverty
and lack of housing policy that promotes creating an enabling environment for
housing development through individual and private sector initiatives.
In respect to fuel-wood use, the rural population is totally dependent on wood
gathered from the scanty vegetation available and farm animal manure which
is becoming scarce progressively. This practice has been and it is still in
progress causing severe land degradation. The urban demand for fuel wood is
also high, but cost is becoming prohibitive and its use is in decline.
The ERP Housing Component in the designated areas of Debub and Gash
Barka Regions involves reconstruction and rehabilitation of rural houses
destroyed or damaged by the 1998-2000 war. In implementing the component,
the IDPs are expected to cut plants for house and farm implement construction.
They will continue as they were doing before to collect fuel wood for cooking
and in some cases they may increase land under cultivation, which could be
only marginal: All these activities may potentially cause negative and positive
environmental impacts and the negatives will demand due attention.
43



6.2. BACKGROUND
6.2.1. Natural Resources
6.2.1.1. Land degradation
In Eritrea; the secular absence of land use policy has led to the indiscriminate
destruction of natural resources. The records of the degradation process
indicate that at the beginning of the colonial era (1889), from the total area of
the country (12,570,000 ha), about 30% was covered by forests and this figure
fell down to about 11% by 1952. Within a period of 8 years (1953-1960), the
forest cover declined to about 5% (UN Commission to Eritrea, 1960) and by
1986 it reached about 0.4% which is approximately the present status.
The massive destruction of forests in Eritrea and the recurrent droughts has
made soil erosion to be the most serious environmental problem in the country
and particularly in the highland zone. Soil erosion activated by the force of rain
and wind has been the cause for the present status of soils featured with low
fertility and less resistant to subsequent erosion forces. This secular process
was further accelerated by the 30 years of war and recurrent droughts. In most
of the cultivated upland areas, the humus contents of soils have already
declined to less than 1% and this reduces the soil moisture storage and
infiltration rate capacity during rainfall. Parallel to the soil degradation
process, the other natural resources such as wildlife and water also came into
severe degradation. Estimates of soil loss due to water erosion is as high as 50-
100 tons per hectare per year in the highlands. In the dry lowland areas, the
estimated rates is 6 ton/hectare per year while in the moist lowland and the
eastem escarpment it is about 4.7 and 37.6 ton per hectare per year,
respectively (FAO, 1984). This is the principal factor for the present poor crop
and livestock productivity and vegetation cover in Eritrea.
Although some measures to conserve natural resources are being implemented,
the tendency is that severe land degradation is continuing to occur at a high
rate of speed in most parts of the country. The absence of appropriate land
management, the continuously growing population pressure on land as a sequel
to low crop yield and the introduction of heavy machineries and commercial
fanning systems in marginal land are the major causes of the on-going land
degradation.
6.2.1.2. Soil and Water Conservation
In Eritrea, there hias been an exploitation of natural forests with too little or no
conservation  and  replacement  measures  for  very  longtime.  Since
independence, attempts are being made to redress the situation. Afforestation
and soil conservation measures are being carried out on degraded catchments
and crop lands by mobilizing the local communities. Trees and shrubs have
been planted on hillsides to conserve soil and water- and to serve as modest
sources of fuel wood and farm implement construction materials. On the
44



cultivated land, bench terraces, soil and stone bunds have been constructed.
Along water ways, check dams have been placed to slow down siltation and
run-off, and on the lower part of the watershed gullies are being treated by
minimizing the slope of their sides, and planting them with grasses and bushes.
However, this intervention, being too little and of questionable efficiency, has
not made a palpable significance to arrest the process of natural resources
degradation which is the focus on the subject of environment in Eritrea.
The Ministry of Agriculture is currently implementing a new policy
concerning communal forest plantations. Under this policy, trees already
planted or to be planted on communal lands are shared among the households
of the respective villages or communities and each household has the right to
harvest trees for household use or for sale, but under the control of community
based organization. The aim of this policy is to encourage farmers to grow
more trees and to take care of them being motivated by benefits and full
participation. In the long-term, this approach of communal forest development
ownership is expected to enhance the improvement of the existing forest cover
of the country. Kitmoulie village is an example of this approach of community
established and owned tree plantation.
6.2.2. The general conditions of natural resources in the ERP
- project area
The principal perception of the environmental management in Eritrea cannot
be but the acute state of natural resources degradation. The country is highly
dependent on agriculture and livestock from which the vast majority of the
population earn their livelihood. Land and water are the only resources they
have and the highest attention must be made to conserve these. In the ERP
designated areas, the issue of natural resources degradation is the focus in
respect to the immediate and long-termn intervention.
6.2.2.1. Gash Barka Region:
The Region comprises southem and southwestem parts of the country. It is
mostly lowland terrain where the altitude range is between 500 and 1600
meters above sea level. The average annual precipitation is between 500 and
800mm and the annual mean temperature is between 32 and 280C. The length
of growing period ranges from 90 to 120 days and the potential
evapotranspiration is about 2000mm. The natural vegetation are savanna
woodland and bushland dominated by Acacia seniegal, Acacia nmellifera,
Acacia seyal, Ziziphus spinia chiristi, Balan ites aegyptiaca, Adansontia digiiala,
Dalbergia melanoxylon. The dominant soil types are: Cambisols, Vertisols,
Luvisols, Litlhosols, Fluvisols, and Regosols. This zone has relatively high
potential for crop production and livestock due to its favourable rainfall
pattems and soils. The livelihood of the people depends on agropastoralism
and pastoralism.
45



The natural resources are under heavy pressure by crop cultivators and
environmental destabilization is in progress in many parts. In this area, most of
the returnees are being resettled. A major problem is the quasi-free access to
land and there are no clear procedures and institutional set-ups governing land
distribution for commercial farming. There is an acute competition between
cultivators and pastoralists for land and water. Land degradation is not yet as
bad as in the highland zone, but if the present laxing in environmental
management continues, the process of land degradation is likely to move at a
faster rate than it did in the upland areas.
6.2.2.2. Debub Region
This region comprises southeastem and southwestern parts of the country. The
altitude in the area has a range of 1600-3018 meters above mean sea level, and
the annual average precipitation is between 450 and 500 mm, while the
average temperature range is between 15°C and 200C. The length of growing
period is 60-110 days and the average annual evapotranspiration range is 1600-
1800 mm. The dominant vegetation cover consists of: Juniperus procera,
Olea africana, Euclea schimperi, Euphorbia abyssinica, Acacia etbaica,
Becium grandiflorum, Dodonaea angustifolia etc. The dominant soils are:
Lithosols, Cambisols, Luvisols, and Vertisols. Lithosols are found on steep
slops where soil erosion is high, while Luvisols and Vertisols are found mostly
on flat areas. The population density is high when compared to other regions in
the country. The livelihood of the population depends on subsistence mixed
agriculture although cropping is of high intensity. Land availability is scarce
and many areas are fragile due to decades of erosion. It must be reckoned that
only traces of the vegetation cited above are found and the soils are mostly
poor. The area is environmentally fragile and any investment must be
conservation oriented.
6.3. POLICY AND INSTITUTION
Currently, there are no clear policies on housing and fuel wood energy, which
issues are vital to the subject of environment. However, there are guiding
principles which include recognition of the strategic importance of conserving
natural resources and maintaining environmental quality as part of the national
economic development strategy. They emphasize also for a sustainable,
integrated and multiple use of natural resources. They support local
community involvement with equity in the use of natural resources with
environmental management. It promotes research where alternatives to fuel-
wood energy sources are under investigation but with a very limited scope to
make any significant advancement in reducing devegetation.
Draft Proclamation documents on biodiversity aiid environmental management
have been prepared and they are expected to be approved. The Department of
Environment of the Ministry of Land, Water and Environment is responsible
for the implementation of the Proclamations governing environment. However,
their absence has weakened the authority of the Department.
46



Although the draft Proclamations pertaining environment have not been
gazzetted, the DOE is using sonie practical directives and instructions based on
theses drafts to be able to respond to some of the pressing environmental
issues. It is collaborating with some public institution such as the MOA. In the
absence of approved proclamation, the Ministry is applying practical directives
in regulating the most pressing issues in natural resources conservation.
The directives of MOA include:
(a) issuing of agricultural land concessions or title deeds is not permitted
on land with >25% tree cover;
(b) no removal of doum palm and other important trees, as defined by the
MOA, from concession granted land is allowed;
(c) prohibition of cutting trees without license from the MOA;
(d) issuing of agricultural concession or title deeds in riverine areas is
permitted only beyond about 100 meters from the river banks and this
distance can be more restrictive in areas of doum palm trees;
(e) prohibition of starting fire inside a forest land for any purpose; and
(e prohibition of wildlife killing or capturing without a license from the
MOA.
6.4. HOUSING AND FUEL-WOOD USE PRACTICES
It must be reckoned that the IDPs of the project area are retuming to their
former villages where crop fields already exist and that the use of fuel wood as
energy source for cooking and livestock rearing will continue as it was
practiced before the 1998-2000 war. However, most of the houses were
destroyed by the war, hence new houses are to be constructed. The focus of
the environmental management are housing and fuel-wood; while those
involving cropping and livestock production or other activities should be
looked from the overall conservation oriented development strategy to be
adopted.
6.4.1. Construction of rural houses
6.4.1.1. Rural Housing practice
Rural house construction in Eritrea requires considerable amount of wood and
the practice has not been challenged at least in perception. The amount of
biomass used for the purpose may vary by area, but this activity is the major
single factor that is continuing to cause land degradation.
In the upland areas, typical rural houses are built of stone walls with mud as
binding material and wooden roof and pillars and such houses are called
"Hidnto". Conservative estimates indicate that about 100 big size trees are
felled to construct a house of this type. The "Hidino" has basically four
compartments and one animal shed. In the past, Juniperous procera trees were
47



mainly used as pillars for such houses, but as the availability of these trees
grew scarce other trees started to be used. The roof construction operation
requires wooden beams, purlines and tree branches. In the process of selection
for the most appropriate structure, many more trees are cut than necessary. The
roof needs also to be repaired annually hence more plant material is used.
However at the present time as wood and wood products for the construction
of houses are becoming scarce in the highlands, the trends for construction of
houses is drastically shifting from the traditional "Hidmo" to a house with
galvanized corrugated iron sheet roof. In some areas where hard granite rocks
are abundant, the wooden pillars of "Hidmo" are being replaced by stones.
This transformation is however greatly hindered by the low economic capacity
of the rural households. This is an area for support to fight environmental
problems from the roots.
In areas where there is scarcity of stones, houses are built from stabilized earth
block walls which are plastered by rough cement and sand mortar on the outer
surface for protection against rain but the roof is of wood and grass. This is the
typical housing strategy in the lowland areas and such houses are known as
"Agdo ". Such houses are at times built from stone walls where these materials
are abundant. However, because of the hot climate, roofing is made of wood
and grass. As there is relatively less scarcity of wood and wood products in the
western lowland, the traditional way of housing may persist to exist and it may
remain to be one of the major factors for deforestation.
6.4.1.2. Rural fuel wood energy
In Eritrea, there is no reliable data on energy consumption. However, it is
estimated that 82% of the demand is met from biomass; 16.8% from mineral
oil products and 1.2% from electricity (MEM, 1996). All rural communities, as
well as most of the household families in the semi-urban and urban areas
including some commercial enterprises, are highly dependent on biomass fuel
(fuel wood, charcoal, farm animal manure and crop residues) for energy. The
Ministry of Energy and Mines conducted a nation-wide household biomass
energy consumption survey in 1996 and it revealed that the annual fuel wood
consumption was the highest followed by farm animal manure. From the total
biomass fuel consumption, the share of the central highland area, which is
partly under ERP, was about 60%.
Most of the firewood consumed in the highland, especially in the urban areas,
is collected from the eastern and westem lowlands, as fuel wood availability is
very low in the highland. This situation has created large-scale deforestation in
the acacia woodland area of the lowlands.
In a survey carried-out by the same Ministry in 1998 showed that the share of
biomass, mineral oil products and electricity were 65.8%, 33.1% and 2.1%,
respectively. The survey reveals the fuel wood per capita per year consumption
was 250 kg or 11 5kg per household per month which means the country
consumes a total of 882,000 tons per year and it indicates there has been
48



decline of fuel wood use during the last years. This decrease of fuel wood
consumption is likely to be attributable to the more effective enforcement of
the law to protect forest and inrcrease in fuel wood prices. This involved strict
control on fuel wood marketing and prohibition of charcoal making.
As fuel wood becomes scarce, many households in urban areas are shifting to
kerosene. About 20% of the population of the country is believed to have
access to electricity. All electricity in Eritrea is thermally produced from diesel
hence it is expensive. The electricity generating capacity has improved from 35
MW in 1991 to over 70 MW in 1999. Similarly the per capita electricity
consumption increased from 16 KWH in 1991 to 53 KWH in 1997. It must be
recognized that the process of improving electrification did not involve the
rural areas. This shows that the country is still heavily dependent on biomass
fuel, and this is a major environmental problem that needs adequate and urgent
intervention.
6.4.1.3. Other Activities
In the designated ERP area, the need to clear new areas for cropping is
unlikely to occur because the retuming IDPs are sedentary for the most part;
hence they had already the fields for cultivation. However, due to the
availability of tractors, they may tend to include ploughing of some marginal
land especially in Gash Barka Region. The ERP includes also restocking but
even if this is carried-out, the livestock population will not exceed the pre-war
situation. This being the case, pressure on land due to overstocking is unlikely
to occur. The activities may involve also cutting trees to construct traditional
farm implements. It must be however kept in mind that the problem has always
existed and it should be viewed from the standpoint of long-term natural
resources conservation approach.
6.5. THE POTENTIAL ENV'IRONMIENTAL IMPACTS
6.5.1. Housing and fuel-wood
The practices briefly described above reveal that housing and fuel-wood were
and they are still the major factors for the degradation of natural resources
through deforestation. The potential negative environmental impacts of the
ERP activities are that:
* fuel wood collection and charcoal making will aggravate
deforestation resulting into soil erosion, flooding and desertification;
* diversion of farm animal manure and crop residue to be used as fuel
wood deprives the soil of its source of organic matter, and lowers
productivity of the land.
49



In urban areas where supply of wood for fuel wood energy is inadequate and
because the price is high there is a trend of shifting from consumption of fuel
wood to kerosene, bottled gas and electricity.
6.6. RECOMMENDATION ON MITIGATION OF IMPACTS
6.6.1. Traditional Housing
The focus on mitigation of negative environmental impacts in respect to the
housing and fuel-wood issues should be principally through developing
alternatives that are sustainable economically and environmentally. This
implies that serious investigation works and commitment are necessary.
Environmental issues in respect to both of them are signs of severe
underdevelopment or incapacity on elementary research. There are several
types of local construction materials available for housing that could
effectively replace wood but due to lack of research initiatives, nothing has
been so far perceived. It applies also to the problem of fuel-wood. This leads
into the wider concept of environment where its problems are deeply rooted in
poverty and underdevelopment. Irrespective of the immediate problems of
housing and fuel-wood, the basic causes are the same to the problems of
development and environmental disturbunces.
6.6.1.1. Gasih Barka
There are two altemative methods for the construction of traditional houses in
the lowlands. In the upper Gash and Barka area where the rainfall is not heavy,
the walls of the "Agdo" could be made from clay or stones varying with the
type of raw material supply availability in a given locality. The roof, due to the
hot climate hence the need to cut solar radiation, can be made from woven
doom palm tree leaves or tall grasses and treated wooden poles. The roof of the
woven leaves should be painted with white wash to reflect sun rays.
In the lower Gash Barka area where the rainfall is relatively heavy the walls of
the "Agdo" can be made from masonry or mixture of tall grasses such as those
of the genus Hyperlienia and clay plastered with rough concrete to resist
against wash by the rain. The roof should be made of corrugated iron sheets
and the ceiling with woven doom palm tree leaves.
6.6.1.2. Debub
In the highland areas, earth and stone walls with a roof of corrugated iron can
be used to construct houses. Stone, sand and suitable earth are available widely
and  corrugated  iron  sheet roof is more  much   cost-effective  and
environmentally sustainable than the usual roof of' "Hidno ". This process is
already in progress spontaneously. In housing, there are also environmental
health issues such as sanitary standards and any interventioni must consider this
basic issue. In a crude form, an altcrnativc to initiate further study on housing
has been given in volume 111.
50



6.6.2. Household Energy for cooking
Energy consumption in rural Eritrea is totally dependant on biomass and there
is over exploitation of this commodity. The issue is not only the scarcity of
biomass but also the inefficiency of the traditional stoves in energy
conservation. There are a number of alternatives available totally or partially
replace the use of fuel-wood and the main issue to be addressed is economic
sustainability or cost-effectiveness.
6.6.2.1. Improved fuel wood stove
The Ministry of Energy and Mines has carried-out some preliminary studies on
how to improve the traditional stove efficiency in utilizing wood or dung.
Some promising results have been obtained by improving the design of the
traditional stove in respect of energy saving and the new product is known as
"Adhanet" at least in the literature. It is claimed that there is about 21% energy
saving as compared to the traditional stoves which means a saving of fuel-
wood by the same magnitude. The production cost of the improved stove is
about (Nakfa) 290 which is equivalent to (USD) 29. The cost of 100kg fuel-
wood is about (Nakfa) 125 and the new stove would be saving about (Nakfa)
26.25 every 100kg of fuel-wood used.
The Ministry of Energy and Mines was responsible for the research to produce
a sample stove to be distributed to the Ministry of Agriculture and other
concerned agents for its reproduction. However this Ministry has participated
for the reproduction of the stoves by giving instructors to the rural community
under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture to produce the stoves. So
far, about 2000 stoves have been constructed and distributed to the rural
communities in Maekel and Debub Regions at the cost of (Nakfa) 100 for each
stove. All the rural communities in both Regions have accepted the initiative
and the price. The estimated cost of production for a single household stove
and the cost of each component of the stove is given below:
Item                                   Cost (USD)
Clay cooking plate                        -     3.00
Ceramic fire crate                              1.50
Galvanized iron chimney                   -     9.00
Skilled artisan labour per Mogogo         -     12.00
Valve tube and top cover of the chimney   -     2.00
Galvanized iron door                      -     1 .00
In case of damage for ceramic fire crate  -     0.50
Total                       29.00
51



The introduction of the improved fuel wood stove has the following
advantages:
* efficiency of fuel energy use up to 21%;
* save women's time and effort to collect wood;
*  reduce smoke related hazards to women and the children;
* create improvement for environmental mitigation of forest
resources;
* decrease destruction of forest and woodlands as less fuel wood
collection will be required;
* can save the animal dung from fuel of soil fertilizing;
The acceptance of the improved stove by the rural community is positive but
the present cost of production of the stove should be lowered to a level that the
rural community could afford to buy it and this lowering of cost may be done
by mobilizing the community to construct the stove themselves through
intensive training programmes and by conducting further research. The
introduction of the improved stove may not have easy acceptance by the rural
community of the lowland regions where there is less accentuation in wood
supply scarcity. However it should be introduced gradually to reduce the
negative environmental impacts from forest degradation. Production of the
improved stove in a large scale may require substantial investment that need
financial support from within the national development strategy programmes.
The urban demand for biomass energy could be reduced through maintaining
adequate kerosene, oil gas and electricity availability at economic prices.
6.6.2.2. Kerosene
The use of kerosene energy for cooking can reduce the use of fuel-wood
consumption of the urban households considerably. On the other hand, the
rural population which depends totally on fuel energy from unpaid biomass
may not afford to buy the kerosene. The consumption of kerosene per
household per year is estimated to be about 180 litres, or (Nfa) 540. The stove
for using kerosene costs about (Nakfa) 45. It could be an altemative in the
urban and semi-urban areas to replace fuelwood completely and in most of the
rural areas. This alternative is likely to be viable in rural areas in the long-temi
provided that household incomes increase to a reasonable level and that
kerosene supply is consistent. The issue is economic sustainability where the
cost is too high and it is imported hence the need of constant supply of forex.
However, the only solution for fuelwood provided some investment is made on
environment to lower the cost of kerosene and to ensure forex supply.
6.6.2.3.Village tree plantation'
The community controlled tree plantation in the village can partly solve the
need on fuel wood demand of the community. Such programme should be
introduced in the highland areas, but high initial investment is required to
52



establish the forests. Implementation of this programme requires organization
and training of the village communities to implement and manage the forest
plantation.
6.6.2.4. Area Closure
Another method for mitigation of negative environmental impact on forest
resources is area closure. This could serve as a source of fuel wood to satisfy at
least partial demands of the rural communities. Area closures need to be
agreed by the concemed community as a precondition to success. The
community should appreciate the cost and the potential benefits.
As long as cost effective and environmentally sustainable energy source to
substitute fuel wood is not made available through research and investment,
the use of fuel wood is inevitability to continue for some time to come. In the
present situation, the most viable way to mitigate environmental impacts due to
fuel-wood in rural areas is by introducing the kerosene stove method at lower
price; improving the present supply availability of fuel-wood through village
tree plantation and closure of areas for regeneration. This can be further
enhanced by the introduction of improved stoves.
6.6.3. Other activities
In the ERP area, the IDPs are retuming to their former village sites with
already established crop fields. Thus, new land clearing activities are not
expected. The potential impacts and mitigations are directed to the existing
fields and to protect invasion of marginal lands by cropping. However
inclusion of environmental management measures within the national
development context would be essential to produce positive impact.
The mitigation measures to protect the potential environmental effects on farm
land include the design of proper land use plan on the basis of land capability
classification, which will include implementation of proper farm layout and
proper farm management. Such activities should be supplemented with
physical and agronomic soil conservation measures such as terracing, cut off
drain, strip cropping and contouring. The mitigation measures should be
integrated with the soil conservation and land use planning program of the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Land, Water and Environment,
respectively.
The ERP will restock at least some part of the war lost animals, but it is
unlikely that this activity will produce negative impacts higher than what they
were before the war. Overstocking can be avoided by conducting an initial
survey of range conditions and detemline stocking rates within the potential
carrying capacity. Livestock off-take can be encouraged by stimulating thc
development of markets and marketing systems for livestock and livestock
products. Range quality can be maintained or improved by implementing
53



appropriate management and controlled grazing systems with drinking water
points.
6.6.4. Institutional coordination
The need of close coordination between the Ministry of Agriculture and the
Ministry of Land, Water and Environment is very crucial to mitigate
environmental impacts during the implementation of the ERP activities.
The Ministry of Agriculture could provide guideline for sustainable
implementation of the agricultural component such as soil conservation
practices, afforestation, retention of vegetation strips, border planting and
hillside terracing. However, the extension service capacity of the Ministry
should be strengthened.
Similarly, the Ministry of Land, Water and Environment can contribute to the
mitigation of negative environmental impacts in the rehabilitation area through
identification and land classification in relation to its potential for sustainable
productivity. However, implementation of land classification should be
accompanied with the establishment of effective CBOs and carrying-out
regular educational programmes on the subject of environmental protection.

7. PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT (PSDC)
7.1. Background
The environmental assessment practice in Eritrea since its liberation in 1991 has
evolved through various phases which can be grouped, for the purpose of the present
study, under two broad phases, that is, by taking the publication of the NEAPG in
March 1999 as the cut point.
The first phase of the environmental assessment practice in the country can be
described as the period which necessitated the taking of immediate preliminary steps
to streamline the institutional arrangements and practices inherited at date of liberation
along the lines of economic policy and development path mapped out for new Eritrea,
which was soon reinforced with the introduction of new laws and the issuance of the
macro policy of the country, the issuance of the National Environmental Management
Plan for Eritrea (NEMP-E) in 1995, the establishment of the Ministry of Land, Water
and Environment in 1997 and the publication of the NEAPG in 1999.
The early steps taken by Govemment in streamlining the inherited institutional
arrangements and practices included the dissolution of several public enterprises
including the Handicrafts and Small Scale industry Development Agency (HASIDA)
which was primarily responsible for assisting in the establishment of new projects,
particularly small projects and the taking over of the responsibilities entrusted to it by
the Ministry of Industry, the establishment of the Eritrea Investment Center, the
Business Licensing Office etc.
The Ministry of Industry which took over the responsibility of issuing licenses started
to screen projects or business activities by requesting prospective investors to submit
(assisted as and when necessary by its own staff) applications which describe the
proprietor or investor, basic elements regarding the enterprise i.e. market, raw
materials, technology, capital etc; and financial analysis or statement.
In due course environmental concern started to be reflected in connection with some
individual private and state owned projects and as a result the Ministry began to
collect raw data regarding the environmental aspect of medium and large scale
enterprises and to carry out (through its own experts in collaboration with the
technical staff of the plants under it) environmental studies with regard to the
production of leather and leather products, textiles, soap and detergents, bricks and
beverages etc. leading to the introduction of simple mitigation measures and the
recommendation of appropriate technology. The early steps taken by the Ministry
were further enhanced in 1966, when prepared, with the cooperation of IJNIDO, a
waste treatment model for tanneries.
Similarly the concern of other Ministries and agencies such as the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA), Ministry of Energy and Mines (MOEM), Ministry of Fisheries
with regard to environment concerns with respect to projects and activities falling
within their jurisdiction can be said to have evolved more or less along the same lines
i.e. growing concern accompanied by the adoption of improved policies and measures
55



to mitigate negative environmental impacts of damns, soil degradation, mine and
marine resource exploration and exploitation etc.
7.2. Present Setting
At present the private sector mainly consists of micro, small and medium scale
enterprises mostly engaged in trade and a relatively smaller number which
operate or run manufacturing and service activities. Peasant farming dominates
agriculture and artisanal fishermen engaged in micro activities operate the
fishery sector. The majority are solely owned and largely based on family
labour and capital. Eritrea's financial sector is also very small and in a
rudimentary stage. In its current state, it is largely unable to efficiently
mobilize and allocate financial resources to the private sector.
The private sector is thus still undeveloped. Among the major factors that have
led to the present state of the sector, the deliberate mismanagement of the
economy by the previous regimes that governed the country.
Albeit the present private-sector-led policy pursued by the Eritrean
Government pursuant to the issuance of the macropolicy of the country and the
subsequent legislations and measures taken thereafter, the private sector is still
faced with a number of constraints and problems i.e. lack of access to finance,
shortage of utilities (particularly power), inadequate skill development support
and access to modem technology schemes, small size of market and weak
marketing capabilities etc.
In actually all plants, machinery and equipment are obsolete and are unable to
manufacture products that can compete in the international market. Equally
disabling is the perception held by some entrepreneurs in favour of making
profit by way of short cut means rather on the basis of a long-run based
developmental strategy for sustained growth of their enterprises. The private
sector has severely suffered from the recent conflict with Ethiopia.
As indicated earlier, environmental concern with regard to private sector
activities gradually developed to be accorded due importance as reflected by
the measures which were being taken by the concerned Ministries for some
years prior to the issuance of the NEAPG. Since then, significant progress is
currently being witnessed in the area of environment assessment.
7.3. Potential Impacts and Significance
Although the role played by the line Ministries in addressing environmental
issues was commendable, it goes without saying that there was more room left
for further imnproveements. Absence of govemnmental agency solely entrusted
with coordinating environmental assessment of projects led to spontaneous
decisions and measures. As a result a number of projects which would havc not
passed environment clearance were implemented in a number of places. This
56



undesirable development has now called for the review of some of these
projects ex-post and the coming up come up with some mitigatory measures.
With establishment of the Department of Environment and the preparation of
NEAPG efforts are now being exerted to reduce if not to avoid the repeat of
past mistakes by screening projects as early as possible in the project cycle.
Thus, whenever possible project screening is undertaken by the relevant
Government Agency at the Center or Zoba level; and in case no Governmental
agency exists for the screening and evaluation of a particular project, then the
Department of Environmental completes the screening.
7.4. Review of Procedures and Guidelines
7.4.1. Definition
Environmental assessment refers to the overall process of consideration of the
potential impact of a project on the physical, biological, socio-cultural etc components
of its surrounding environment.
It may involve only projects screening and/or environmental evaluation or
environmental impact assessment. Project screening means the formal process that
determines whether or not environmental evaluation or environmental impact
assessment is necessary for a proposed project. Environmental evaluation connotes the
process by which the potential impact of a proposed project on the environment is
determined using primarily local resources and existing information. Environmental
impact assessment refers to the process by which the potential impact of a project on
the environment is determined through an in depth study involving project scoping and
using both existing information and the collection of new data to produce an integrated
Environmental Impact Assessment report and an Environment Management Plan.
7.4.2. NEAPG Objectives
The objectives of the NEAPG have been specified to comprise:
-  assessment of the   significance  of potential impacts which  the
implementation of a project may have on the environment;
-  reducing delays in project approval by providing a standardized and
transparent system for environmental assessment;
-  improving project design and performance, thus improving overall
economic efficiency through  - use of 'environmental good practice'
methods and technology where possible; maximizing potential for recovery
and recycling in waste management; avoiding long-termn decline in project
performance by assessing likely environmental changes over an extended
time frame; and enhancing worker productivity through provision of
cleaner working cnvironment;
-   promoting economic development without unnecessary decline in
environment quality, thus ensuring that both economic development and
the environment in Eritrea are sustainable in the long run.
57



7.4.3. Project Classification
The NEAPG document classifies projects into three categories (i.e. A, B and C) for the
purpose of environmental assessment along the lines followed by the World Bank, that
is,
-  Category A projects: projects which are likely to have significant adverse
environmental impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented; these
impacts may affect an area broader than the sites or facilities subject to
physical works.
-   Category B projects: projects with less potential adverse environmental
impacts than Category A projects and site-specific.
-  Category C projects: projects which are likely to have minimal or no
adverse environmental impacts.
7.4.4. Questionnaires
Various questionnaires have been prepared for the purpose of environmental assessment
of projects for the following sectors:
agriculture - all new agricultural projects involving clearance of natural
vegetation cover, including intensive livestock production- shift from rain-
fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture - changes in pesticide and/or
chemical fertilizer use on existing projects - introduction of new, non-
indigenous plant/animal domesticated for commercial production
(agricultural exotics)
- processing and manufacturing industries - recycling of metal and non-
metal waste and scrap - metal fabrication and finishing - foundries
producing less than 2- tonnes/day -brick and earthenware manufacture with
production of less than I tonnes/day - cement works and lime processing
with production of less than 10 tonnes/day - tanning and dressing of hides
and skins - abattoirs and meat- processing plants - brewing and malting
plants - bulk grain-processing plants - fish processing plants - pulp and
paper mills less than 5 tonnes/day - food processing plants - plants fort the
manufacture or assembly of motorized vehicles - plants for the
construction or repair of aircraft's or railway equipment - plants for the
manufacturing or processing of rubber, including recycling of tyres, etc. -
plants for the manufacture of tanks and reservoirs made up of fiberglass,
sheet metal, - poly plastic etc. - plants for the manufacture of plastics -
mechanical workshops employing less than 50 persons in a specified
industrial zone, or less than 10 persons outside a specified industrial zone -
processing of paints and paint shops - textile plants - printing - battery

stone and slate; aggregates, sand, gravel and laterite; and clay covering
greater than Iha but less than 5ha
- transportation - all tertiary roads i.e. feeder and rural roads - all roads in
protected areas - all bridges over lOm in length - all pipelines over 2 km
in length or greater than 10cm, diameter
- urban planning - designing of residential areas for less than 1,000
families-establishment of industrial estates of less than 10,000 sq.m. -
establishment of areas for manufacturing and small- scale industry areas
not counting "polluting" operations - establishment or expansion of
recreational facilities with capacity of less than 10,000 persons - shopping
centers, complexes and commercial storage areas with area than 5,000
sq.m.- Social infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, fire stations -
tourist hotels with less than 50 rooms - tourism- related infrastructure,
including parks, waterfront developments, marinas, etc.
- waste disposal - sites for solid waste disposal for less than 10,000
population - sewage disposal works for less than 10,000 population
The questionnaires raise technical queries regarding the project under consideration,
its type, location and site (area coverage, site plan), plant and machinery, production
capacity, future expansion, processing technique or technology, raw materials,
chemicals used and storage, source and annual consumption of water and energy, type
and size of vehicles to be used, disposal of solid waste, treatment and release of
effluent, waste emission to air, water or land, measures to be taken to reduce waste
emission, etc. They also raise socio-economic questions including with respect to
number of total and permanent staff to be employed at the site/factory, supply sources
for food, features and distance of residential area from the site, transport means,
sanitation measures etc. See Table 11 for some of the type of projects covered in the
NEAPG and the spectrum of questions raised in their respective questionnaires.

7.4.5. Adequacy, Legality and Coverage
(a) Adequacy
Basically speaking, the NEAPG document is a well prepared document in as much
it addresses in detail the basic concepts involved in environmental assessment and
the procedures to be followed in screening projects and in assessing their
environmental impacts. Nonetheless it would need to be periodically reviewed in
order to render it more practical and complete in its coverage in the context of
Eritrea's current and foreseeable future realities. Some of the major areas of the
document which call for immediate attention and appropriate action in due course
are highlighted hereunder.
(b) Legality
First and foremost it should be underscored that the effective consideration of
potential environmental impacts in the course of project formulation would call for
the legal enforcement of the NEAPG. Short of this the document would not remain
to be legally binding on project promoters other than an expression of desirable
procedures and guidelines that would require use of various administrative means
for inducing project promoters to take appropriate environmental steps.
It has been leamt that a National Environmental Law is being drafted. Its early
promulgation law is thus expected to pave way to more effective enforcement of
the NEAPG.
(c) Coverage
The coverage of the projects for which questionnaires have been prepared vs the
type of projects being promoted and handled by the Financial Internediaries in the
country in general and the type of projects covered by the PSCs of the ERP,
namely, projects eligible for a) relief fund and b) loan fund, in particular, was
examined by holding discussions with the various relevant organizations including
the Department of Environment, the technical Ministries, the Eritrea Investment
Center, the Bank of Eritrea and the three Financial Intermediaries, namely the
Commercial Bank of Eritrea, the Housing and Development Bank and the Eritrea
Development and Investment Bank.
A form was also prepared for the purpose of completing, by the Financial
Intermediaries in particular, the information required including brief description of
their lending practice vs the consideration of environmental factors, steps they may
be planning to introduce in the future in this regard and the type of activilties they
finance by indicating also the sub-activities involved i.e.
61



agriculture (agriculture, hunting; forestry, logging; fishing); -mining and
quarrying (coal, lignite; petroleum, gas; uranium; metal ores; other mining
and quarrying); manufacturing (food, beverages, textiles, wearing apparel,
tanning of leather, footwear, bags, wood products, paper and paper products,
printing, refined, petroleum products, chemicals and chemical products,
rubber. and plastics, other non-metallic products, metal products, machinery
and equipment, office machinery, electrical machinery, radio, TV.
communication,   medical  equipment,  vehicles,  fumiture,  recycling);
electricity, gas, water supply; construction; trade; hotels and restaurants;
transport and communications; education; health; others
7.4.6. Financial Intermediaries
(a) Bank of Eritrea
The Support for affected Enterprises scheme component of the emergency funding
program aims at bailing out banks from sudden depletion of their financial
resources or even bankruptcy as a result of the extensive loan they had expended to
enterprises that have sustained heavy losses due to the Ethiopian invasion and are
unable to repay their debts. Therefore, according to the Bank of Eritrea, no
importation of machinery and no major new construction are envisaged to be
undertaken under the scheme except the partial or full debt forgiveness of the
outstanding bank loans of the beneficiaries. The activities involved are micro or.
very and unlikely to have any adverse impact on environmental small. Hence, no
environmental impact is expected to be carried out in connection with the
disbursement of the fund.
The number of enterprises so far submitted to the Bank by the three Financial
Intermediaries in connection with debt relief funding is 1 564 in total, with the
Commercial Bank of En'trea (CBE) accounting for 1 268 followed by the Housing
and Commerce Bank (HCBE) with 237 and the Eritrea Development and
Investment Bank (EDIB) with 59 only. See Table 12.

The above request for debt relief funding should not be interpreted to indicate
that the total number of enterprises which sustained damages as a result of the
conflict with Ethiopia since the actual figure could be, according to preliminary
study carried by the University of Asmara, more than double of the above
figure. The figure refers only to those for which requests have been submitted by
the three Banks.
The object of the Loan Fund being to provide the three banks with the resource
needed (foreign exchange and terrm financing) to extend medium and long-term
loan to their private sector clients for productive purposes, the request submitted
by the three Banks under this sub-component is with respect to 20 enterprises
for a total amount of about US Dollars 10.8 million (See Table 13).

(c) Housing and Commerce Bank
The Housing and Investment Bank records reveal that the losses sustained by
their customers due to the war with Ethiopia amount to about 46,6 million
Nakfa. The total number of enterprises affected are 490 divided under three
categories in accordance with the degree or type of loss sustained (see Table 16).
Category I loans are those whose collateral assets have been fully or
significantly damaged. Category 2 loans refer to those with minimal damage to
collateral assets but whose owners have been killed, displaced or are not
traceable. Category 3 loans are those whose collateral assets are intact but the
units are not operating at full capacity. The loans granted by the bank are mainly
related to housing projects.

7.5. Institutional Mechanisms
The ultimate success of environmental assessment of projects depends upon the
establishment of appropriate institutional mechanisms. Thus it is highly
important to identify relevant environmental agencies with capability and
understanding for carrying out the required environmental assessment activities.
In addition, policy strengthening is often needed through the development of
legal or regulatory measures that insure adequate environmental performance
standards.
Projects with potentially major impacts normally require the strengthening of
several environmental functions. These functions may be located in one or more
units and at one or more administrative levels. Since environmental issues
generally involve national, provincial and local govemment agencies and cover
a broad range of responsibilities, coordination among the concerned agencies is
crucial.
7.5.1. Environmental Assessment Responsibility
According to the NEAPG, the implementation of the environmental assessment
procedures is the responsibility of the Department of Environment in
collaboration with other Ministries and Government agencies (see Table 19).
Project screening. Project screening should be undertaken by a relevant
Government Agency (either at the Central or Zonal level) responsible for
regulation, development, implementation, management and/or supervision of a
particular development project. In the absence of 11o relevant Goveniment
agency, it should be completed by the Department of Environment or its zonal
branch offices.
66



EnvironmenJal Evaluation. The environmental evaluation of a project should be
carried out by the Project Owner in collaboration with the relevant Government
agency and wherever

Possible and as appropriate, in consultation with any other potentially affected
party. The Department of Environment (or its zonal branch offices) should give
advice to the evaluation process whenever required.
Environmental clearance is automatic, unless a written disagreement is
submitted by the Department of Environment (or its zonal branch offices, as
appropriate), within 10 working days of receipt of the request. Disagreement
over clearance is solved through further rounds of consultation between the
Department (or its zonal branch offices) and all stakeholders.
Full Environmental Impact Assessment.               Completion     of full environmental

7.5.2. Department of Environment
The Department of Environment of the Ministry of Land Water and
Environment is of recent establishment. Thus, it is in its early stages of being
built into a well-organized environmental institution. At present it has two
Divisions i.e. a) Environmental Management and b) Environmental Assessment
and Information Divisions.
The present staff of the Department is still skeletal, both at the head office and
Zoba levels. At the Zobas there are three staff members of the Ministry, one
responsible for Land, one for Water, one for Environment. The primus among
the three is the one responsible for Land. The recent conflict with Ethiopia has
disrupted the staffing of the Zoba offices of the Department. At present some
Zobas have no staff.
The Department carries out its environmental impact assessment tasks by setting
up teams of experts as appropriate. The policy followed by the Department with
respect to deployment of experts in carrying out environmental assessment is to
involve as much as possible experts working in other ministries or organizations.
In such a way it is believed that qualified available human resource within the
country could be better exploited or utilized.
The Department has already launched a formal training program for its staff (see
Table 20).
A number of workshops have been held in the Zobas for representatives of
various pertinent government bodies and stakeholders. The selection of the
participants was not however always satisfactory.
The Department has started launching various programs for the promotion of
environmental awareness by way of coming out with newspaper articles, TV
drama in connection with plastic bags, water pollution etc), video on the state of
environment of Eritrea (resources and environment).

Efforts are being exerted by the Department to render the environmental
clearance mechanism of projects as simple and straight forward as possible:
* Investor - Investment Center - Technical Ministry - Department of
Environment - Technical Ministry - Investment Center - License
Office.
The investor does not have to come to the Department of Environment.
The projects that are usually referred to the Department are those which fall
under Category B. Category A projects are assessed by a technical committee
established for the purpose. The committee is chaired by the Department of
Environment; its members are from all the stakeholders including local
communities, Zoba administration etc. Final approval is given by the
Department. See Table 13 for the kind of projects which have been cleared by
the Department.
7.5.3. Technical Ministries
The technical ministries and government agencies which have been actively
involved so far in environmental assessment of projects include the following
- Ministry of Ag-iculture
- Ministry of Trade and Industry
- Ministry of Tourism
69



- Ministry of Energy and Mines
- Ministry of Fishery
- Ministry of Local Government (ECDF)

Some of the Ministries were already involved in the past, to varying degrees, in
the environmental assessment of several projects, particularly the Ministry of
Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture.
They have also been very active in the review of the NEAPG. As a result they
are now in an improved or better position to conduct environmental assessment
of projects.
Howeyer they are not adequately               staffed. Furthermore their small staff which
was already exposed to and with some experience in environmental assessment
is presently displaced as a result of the recent war with Ethiopia.
The distribution       of responsibility      with   i-egard   to  environmental assessment of
projects calls for clearer understanding among the concerned parties so as to
70



render smooth adherence to the prescription of the procedures and guidelines. It
is hoped to improve through more interactions among the parties concemed.
7.6. The Role of Financial Institutions
(a) Eritrea Investment Center
The Eritrea Investment Center has a pivotal role to play in promoting
investment and facilitating investment formalities in the country.
In its capacity as a one stop Center, it is expected to advise prospective
investors on investment opportunities in the country; pertinent investment
policies and laws, local regulations regarding customs duty, taxation,
employment etc.
The Center is however presently not very active in carrying out its role mainly
due, among others, to shortage of staff.
Projects or applications submitted to the Center are preliminarily screened by it
and then passed to the appropriate technical Ministry for review and clearance
and then to the Department of Environment for approval. See Annex for a
copy of the application form which prospective investors have to complete and
submit to the Center.
So far projects submitted to sectoral Ministries have been rarely rejected. In
case of reservations, implementation of proper mitigation measures and/or
securing of undertaking by project promoters that they would have to abide by
environmental regulations are recommended.
Compared to the past experience, at present there is relatively more delay in
processing projects since both sectoral Ministries as well as the Department of
Environment have to be consulted.
(b) Bank of Eritrea
The   Private  Sector  Reconstruction  Component  of  the  Emergency
Reconstruction Program is coordinated by the Project Management Unit at the
Bank of Eritrea.
At present the Unit has a staff of four people only. The Review Committee is
composed of the Govemor of the Bank, representatives of the Ministry of
Finance, Ministry of Local Govenmment, the Project Management Unit- ERP,
the Auditor General, the concerned financial intermediary and representatives
of PMU,
71



As already indicated it has received 1 564 applications from the three banks
for financing the war affected enterprises and 20 applications for loan fund. So
far about 700 applications only have been processed.
In order to comply with the requirement of the World Bank, the Unit has
prepared a form to be filled by the three banks in which one point refers to
environmental assessment. See Annex.
It is of the understanding that the environmental assessment procedures and
guidelines, although highly desirable, should be applied judiciously at this very
early stage of development of the Eritrean economy. It is also of the opinion
that environmental assessment should be carried out by more competent bodies
outside the banking system i.e. Department of Environment and line Ministries.
7.6.1. Current Practices of Financial Intermediaries
The beneficiaries of the Private Sector Development Component have to submit
their applications supported by a project study to the participating financial
institutions which are responsible for the credit risk. Hence the latter would have
to ensure the viability of the projects submitted, economically as well as
environmentally.
As far as environmental assessment of projects is concerned the experience and
outlook of the three financial intermediaries i.e. the Commercial Bank of Eritrea,
the Housing and Commerce Bank and the Eritrea Development and Investment
Bank is more or less similar.
In general an applicant for a loan is expected to supply the Banks with the
following
-   A filled application form  - feasibility study - land allotment
certificate - business license  - construction plan bill of quantity -
proforma invoice from machinery suppliers - memorandum of
association as applicable - if export oriented project, agreement
entered into with buyer
Environmental clearance certificate is not usually pressed for. However it does
not mean that the Banks are totally lenient with enterprises with obvious
negative environmental impact. In other words they do not easily entertain
their demands unless they take or commit themselves to take proper mitigation
measures or they prove or ensure that the necessary resource (eg. water) is
available in sufficient quantity.
All said the Banks are quite aware that proper attention slhould be given to
environmental impact considerations. As a matter of fact one of them i.e. the
Eritrea Development and Investment Bank has already sent two members of its
72



staff to the UK for short-term training in the field. Others will also follow
within short.
7.7. Monitoring and Evaluation
7.7.1. Adequacies and Practice
Monitoring is the continuous assessment of project implementation in relation
to agreed schedules. Its main objectives are to provide continuous feedback on
actual or potential outcomes as early as possible in order to facilitate timely
adjustments to project implementation.
Evaluation is the periodic assessment of a project in relation to its set out
objectives. There are essentially three types of evaluation, that is a) an interim
evaluation which is undertaken during implementation of a project which is
essentially intended to identify project design problems; b) terminal evaluation
which includes an assessment of the project's effects and their potential
sustainability and c) impact evaluation which is usually undertaken several
years later to measure changes or casualty attributable to the project.
7.7.2. Adequacy
The environmental monitoring and evaluation of projects is relatively briefly
covered in the NEAPG document.
The document indicates that monitoring of projects should take place at two
levels: a) Government level and b) Project level and that the Department of
Environment is responsible for the overall monitoring of the effectiveness of
the environmental assessment process in Eritrea.
It further briefly describes the monitoring process of projects in categories A, B
and C, as briefly indicated below.
Category C projects - the Department of Environment or its zonal branch has to
undertake post. investment monitoring of category C
projects inorder to ensure that no negative significant
impact have developed during implementation. In case, a
project previously screened as category C is found to
produce significant negative environmental impact, then
that project will be classified as category B or even A and
monitoring will take place accordingly.
Category B projects -- these type of project undergo environmental evaluation
based on a customized questionnaires. If the response to
the questionnaires produce recommendation to avoid or
73



minimize negative environmental impacts, then on the
basis of the recommendation environmental management
plan is produced for monitoring the impacts. It is on the
basis of EMP that the DE or its zonal offices are expected
to monitor the project.
Category A project - EMP is produced by the owner and approved by the
Environmental review committee. On the basis of EMP,
mitigation measure are identified with detailed duties of
the Government Agency responsible for monitoring,
including the methodologies to be used for monitoring of
the negative impacts and effectiveness of mitigation.
The monitoring and evaluation section has also a check list of project scooping
composed of project activities and environmental components. The project
activities include location and physical works, construction phase, operation
phase and decommissioning and reinstatement of the site. The environmental
component include physical, land and land use, natural resources, policies and
plans, people, heritage and infrastructure.
Further more, proforma for review of adequacy of content and structure of
environmental impact assessment is included (see table 22)

As it can be noted from the above, the NEAPG document does include basic tools
for monitoring and evaluation. The adequacy and completeness of the referred
tools would be practically tested against the Eritrea realties and improved as
appropriate.
So far the Department of Environment has not started the monitoring of projects
under implementation. Furthermore there is a general understanding that it would
be difficult or rather impractical to monitor or evaluate all projects which are
screened and/or cleared, particularly those falling under Category C.
7.8. Recommendations on NEAPG
7.8.1. General
To start with the NEAPG should be rendered legally binding, To that effect the
draft law on environmental protection which is presently under preparation should
be finalized as early as possible.
The effective application of the NEAPG calls for the building of adequate
awareness among all concerned government agencies, stakeholders and project
owners about its purpose and the need of their concerted efforts for its effective
implementation. The steps which have already been taken towards this end i.e.
running workshops, dissemination of written materials and oral information on
environmental protection etc. should be further expanded and deepened.
The NEAPG document would need to be translated into Tigrigna, Arabic and other
local languages as appropriate so that it could be understood better by those who
could not easily follow the English version. The Department of Environment has
already started translating the document into Tigrigna. As a matter of fact it is
already ready in draft form and will be shortly circulated for comments. Thus a
right step in the right direction has already been started to be taken. It would only
need to be expedited and further reinforced through proper dissemination.
The list of projects for which questionnaires have been prepared would need to be
checked for its completeness or adequacy in the context of Eritrean reality.
Projects which are not so far covered and/or handled will need to be properly
identified and appropriate questionnaires would need to be prepared for them,
including through the adaptation or modification of those which have already been
prepared.
Some of the projects or economic activities which would need to be addressed to
start with, by involvinig, as was done during the preparation of the already prepared
questionnaires, recognized consulting firms with adequate qualification and
experience in the field, are in connection with the following activities or products:
poultry fanning, animal fattening, dairy, fruits and vegetables processing, vegetable
oil processing, bee keeping, mineral water, tea packing, flexible foam, tyre
76



retreading, marble and granite, GLS florescent, glass bottle, clutches, tiles, sanitary
papers, briquettes, wires and cables, aluminum profiles and utensils, electroplating,
incineration of industrial and clinical waste, spraying of DDT, pharmaceuticals,
insecticides and pesticides, petroleum refining, oil and gas development.
To the extent possible the questionnaires which have already been prepared and
those to be prepared in the future should be modified to be as simple as possible in
order to render them investor friendly.
Short of this the practice of giving temporary screening and clearance forms should
be encouraged as much as possible and supplemented through proper monitoring
and evaluation so as to ensure that the NEAPG document would be an additional
facilitator rather than an obstacle to the investment promotion efforts of the
country.
7.8.2. Institutional Mechanism
The establishment of the Department of Environment as the central government
agency for coordinating the efforts which are being exerted on all fronts to ensure
the sustained safeguard or protection of the environment of the country and the
identification of other government organizations, stakeholders and last but not
least project owners as important partners in this effort is no doubt very
commendable. Equally commendable is also the step taken to come out
successfully with highly useful environmental procedures and guidelines.
The steps taken in establishing a focal institution and identifying its collaborating
partners and producing well prepared environmental procedures and guidelines
would however, remain incomplete if a functional and smooth working
mechanism is not established at all levels of interaction between the parties
concemed.
From the discussions held with respect to the present setting in this regard it has
been noted that there is still room left for further improvement and strengthening,
To start with the line of communication between the Department and its zonal
representative offices should be made as much as possible direct and less
bureaucratic. In addition the number of the staff in the Zobas responsible for
environmental matters should be increased.
As already indicated environmental issues generally involve national, provincial
and local government agencies and cover a broad range of responsibilities. Thus,
efficient coordination among all concerned is of paramount importance.
Coordination can be best achieved through interagency meetings convened at
different stages of the environment assessment process.
77



Furtherrnore it goes without saying that there is the need for the strengthening of
the environmental expertise of the Department and its collaborating partners.
The initiative already taken by the Department of Environment in this connection,
that is, to have a study conducted, with the assistance of the World Bank, on its
human resource development requirement based on the activities it is expected or
planning to carry out in the foreseeable future should not only be expedited but
also extended to encompass also the human resource development requirements
of its other collaborating government bodies.
The training programs of the Department and its collaborating governmental
organizations must be further strengthened and expanded. The training to be given
should include other countries' experience and environmental protection and
assessment institutional set up arrangements. It needs no emphasis that the
participants would have to be selected very carefully; similarly the institutions they
would be sent to.
On the job training for the staff of the Department and other collaborating bodies
should be given due consideration in as much as it has its own obvious merits.
Workshops should be held on regular basis for the staff of the Department
including for those at the Zobas and of other collaborating organizations and
pertinent stakeholders.
The awareness building programs which have already been started by the
Department through the various media i.e. newspaper, radio, TV etc. should be
developed further and monitored properly.
7.8.3. Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and evaluation of projects should not be simply deferred. The earlier it
is started the better. To start with it will enable the Department of Environment
and the other concemed parties to take timely corrective actions. Furthermore it
will contribute to the improvement of its capacity.
It is needless to reiterate that it will require proper staffing of the Department and
its partners.
The monitoring and evaluation of Category C projects should at least be can-ied
out on stratified sample basis. Reclassification of projects, if deemed necessary,
could tbien be made on time.
Projects falling under Category B and A could be monitored by the Project
Owner, who could be required to enter into an undertaking to cany- out proper
monitoring in order to ensure that the project will be implemented and operated as
78



per the environmental requirements of the country; and periodically checked by
the Department of Environment.
It is important to point out finally that the section on monitoring and evaluation in
NEAPG would need to be further developed based on actual practice in order to
include further details on monitoring responsibilities, monitoring methodologies
and measures to be taken in case of non-compliance to agreement already entered
in.

8. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
8.1. Agriculture Component
8.1.1.Summary description of the activities
The agriculture component has the aim of assisting the IDPs who are mostly
smallholder farmers to restart their economic activities by providing the essential
means of agricultural production. The main activities include provision of
pesticides, fertilizers, seeds, oxen, breeding animals, veterinary drugs and support
of agricultural machinery for land preparation through the MOA. These inputs
are, except part of the breeding animals, likely to be imported and distributed to
the returning IDPs. This factor increases the significance of the potential
environmental impacts that may occur from at least some of the elements of
programme. Negative environmental impacts of transboundary origin are
expected. These activities involve procurement process handling of imported
inputs from point of entry to the villages of the beneficiaries and implementation.
8.1 .1.1.Pesticide
About 92,000 litres of pesticides will be imported under ERP and most of them
will be organophosphates and carbamates. The set of activities include handling at
the port of entry, transporting, storing, distributing, application and disposal of
empty containers. Application will be in the rainfed and irrigated systems.
8.1 .1.2.Fertilizer
About 1,517 (t) of synthetic fertilizers (urea and DAP) will be imported, handled
at the port of entry, stored at various stages and distributed to the resettling IDPs
under the ERP. These will be applied in both the rainfed cropping and irrigated
farming systems.
8.1.1.3.Seed
Seeds of cereals, oil-seed crops, vegetables and pulses will be supported. About
206(t) of various types of food crop seeds will be imported mostly from the Sudan
and probably some from Asia (e.g. India, Yemen etc). This activity will involve
procurement, control at point of entry, storage and distribution.
8.1.1.4. Animals
This activity is concerned with restocking of cattle, sheep, camel, donkey and
goats. Since adequate supply may not be available locally, considerable part of
these animals are likely to be imported and this will be mostly from the Sudan. In
addition, poultry and bee-colonies will be also distributed.
80



8.1.1.5. Veterinary drug
Farmers in the project area will be supported with veterinary supplies to control
animal diseases and parasites. These include acaricides, microcidals,
antihelminthics and clinical instruments.
8.1.1 .6.Machinery
Tractors and farm implements such as ploughs will be supplied and used by the
MOA for cropping. Additional machinery for earth moving and threshing of
harvested crops will be also supplied to compensate the shortage in labour and
oxen.
8.1.1.7.Water pumps
This activity involves provision of water pumps to replace those destroyed by the
war. They will be used to irrigate horticulture crops.
8.1.2. List of potential environmental impacts
The potential negative environmental impacts considered to be significant against
which mitigatory actions are recommended are listed below under each activity.
8.1.2.1. Pesticides
*  direct poisoning of human beings, animals, natural enemies, pollinators,
soil microorganisms and wildlife;
e  carcinogenecity and tetragenecity;
*  disturbances of the endocrine systems (see hormones) in humans;
o  pesticide resistance of pests;
e  repeated or/and faulty use of pesticides may cause creation of pest
populations resistant to the pesticides applied;
*  minor pests become important when pesticides affect their natural
enemies;
*  increase cost of production due to repeated application of pesticides.
8.1.2.2. Fertilizer
* .excessive use of nitrates as fertilizer or beyond the plant intake capacity
may result into toxic effects on human-beings and livestock;
* fertilizers may contaminate water bodies to enrich fertility, hence certain
water plants may grow excessively and decrease the value of the affected
water;
* nitrates and nitrites may contaminated underground aquifer resources
permanently.
81



8.1.2.3. Seed importation
*  genetic erosion may occur on indigenous cereal and pulses varieties
where adaptability to local conditions is lost or lowered;
*  introduction of plant insect pests or diseases which would reduce crop
production and increase cost of production;
*  introduction of unwanted plant species such as weeds which may
invade large areas.
8.1.2.4. Animal importation
* indigenous farm animal genetic resources erosion may occur;
*  introduction of disease and disease vectors.
8.1.2.5. Machinery
* land degradation;
* decrease the attitude of farmers to use animal power for cropping.
8.1.2.6. Veterinary drugs and related
* toxicity for users of pesticides and the surrounding environment;
* toxicity for consumers of animal products;
*  Creation of resistance to drugs by some vector and pathogen
populations.
8.1.2.7. Water pump
* overpumping may result into salinity;
* depressing natural vegetation by high water depletion;
* permanent underground water depletion by overpumping.
8.1.3. Outline of mitigation measures and responsibilities
8.1.3.1. Pesticides
* In procuring, the competent authority should ensure the use of
selective and effective pesticides with minimum or no effect to non-
targeted organisms, hence correct technical specification and clear
requirements at the time of procurement is a pre-requisite;
* at the port of entry, a competent authority should ensure the identity of
the pesticide received as compared to specification, inspection of
consignment with focus on accompanying certificate of country of
origin, physical state of containers, packaging and labeling;
82



* upon acceptance for entry, pesticides should be placed in stored
prepared only for such product and safety should be ensured to avoid
direct access, damage, free access, and from fire hazard;
* distribution of pesticides to farmers should be in approved small size
original containers with labels and if the distribution requiring
repacking from larger (200 litres) to small containers is inevitable, it
should be carried out in approved premises under technical supervision
to avoid aerosols, contact with the operators or other objects;
* workers in pesticide application should be certified and licensed and
during spraying operation should wear approved protective wear to
protect themselves from pesticide contact with body surface, inhalation
of aerosols and ingestion;
* obsolete pesticides and emptied containers should be disposed in
environmentally safe place under competent technical supervision and
such places should be kept safe;
* introduce standards on pesticide maximum residue limits (MRL) and
(ADI) on food crops and their residues for all pesticides used in the
country;
* establish aerial spray directives or regulation to control pesticide
contamination due to spray drift to minimize non-target effect;
*  provide periodic training to farmers and extension agents on
pesticides, spraying techniques, safety and storage;
* use the minimum application rates to avoid the presence of excessive
pesticide amounts on the soil which is detrimental to soil bacteria.
* develop IPM that includes good agricultural practices, physical
methods, biological control, use of resistant varieties, pheromone and
use of selective pesticides, as may be applicable;
8.1.3.2. Fertilizer
* use the minimum required rate of application so as not to create excess
of fertilizer presence on the soil after the intake of the plants;
* minimize the use of fertilizer on fields in the immediate proximity or
upstream of water bodies to avoid contamination of drinking water
through run-off or percolation;
* prevent the spillage of fertilizer at the sea-port through appropriate
handling and storing of fertilizer containers so as not to contaminate
the sea;
* introduce integrated plant nutrition management (IPNM) such as
inoculants for legume crops, composts and other organic fertilizers to
minimize the use of synthetic fertilizers, hence cost reduction and
dependency on forex.
83



8.1.3.3. Importation of animals
* prevent transboundry disease and vectors by requiring official
veterinary certificate of country of origin;
* at the point of entry of the imported animals clinical inspection,
sampling and testing, quarantine, vaccination or treatment must be
carried-out, as may be applicable;
* mitigate indigenous farm animal genetic resources erosion by not
importing breeds that may cause this negative impact and specifying
accordingly prior to importation and focus on cattle to protect the
Barka cattle breed;
* introduce animal multiplication centres locally to reduce the negative
impacts of transboundary origin.
8.1.3.4 Importation of seed
* prevent introduction of crop pests (insect, pathogen) through requiring
the exporter to produce official phytosanitary certificate;
* at the port of entry, seed must be subjected to sanitary inspection,
quarantine and chemical treatment;
* mitigate genetic erosion of indigenous plants by specifying seed
varieties to be imported and inspection at the point of arrival;
*  mitigate introduction of undesirable plants through inspection of seed
consignment at the port of entry using appropriate sampling
procedures;
* mitigate negative impacts of transboundary origin by establishing seed
multiplication centres in strategic places.
8.1.3.5. Veterinary drugs
* use clear and correct technical specification on products intended to be
imported when processing procurement and requiring certificate of
origin;
* prevent the use of acaricides which have the property of high
persistence, and cumulatative effect such as the CHC group by
excluding them from procurement list and testing at port of entry;
* bum or bury disposable veterinary instruments and empty containers
after use;
* training of user of drugs;
*. establishing monitoring and evaluation systems on drug residue on
foods of aniimial origin;
* prevent drug resistance by usinlg correct doses, routes and drug use
management.
84



8.1.3.6. Machinery
* mitigate land degradation by selecting the most suitable machinery
based on soil types during procurement;
* by mitigate land degradation by training tractor operators on the use of
machinery for land preparation and crop cultural practices;
* mitigate excessive soil moisture loss by avoiding deep ploughing
during seeding operations;
* avoiding the use of machinery on marginal land which is sensitive to
soil erosion;
*  mitigate dependency on machinery by facilitating for needy farmers to
purchase oxen through for instance credit.
8.1.3.7. Water pump
* mitigate salinity and water depletion through applicable drainage
systems and preventing overpumping of the underground water reserve
respectively;
* introduce underground water control regulations on supply and
demand (e.g. permit for digging a well).
8.1.4. Monitoring and evaluation
Technical methods, procedures and standards for monitoring and evaluation must
be prepared by each of the institutions responsible for specific activity. The
required facilities, staff, materials and standard formats must be prepared.
8.1.4.1 .Pesticides
*  monitoring and evaluation of seawater pesticide contamination at the
designated port of entry for pesticides should be done to monitor the
population of marine organisms. The Ministry of Fishery should be the
monitoring and evaluation of pesticide impacts;
*  disposal of used pesticide containers and storage of pesticides should be
monitored and evaluated in registered pesticide stores including major
farms environmental pollution and it should be the responsibility of the
MOA;
*  monitor and evaluate imported pesticides in respect to active ingredient,
labeling, formulation, trade name, common name, properties, efficacy,
pesticide food residue or any special laboratory designated by the DOE is
the responsibility of the MOA;
*   pesticide application that includes chemical drift control, use of protective
wears should be monitored and evaluated. Monitoring should be done on
population of wildlife, natural enemies, microorganisms, livestock and
blood check of human-beings in the sprayed areas. Pesticide application
and its effect on human-beings should be monitored by the MOH;
85



* the MOA should monitor and evaluate the quality of training given for
farmers on the use of pesticide.
8.1.4.2. Seed importation
Seed should be quarantined, inspected and fumigated before distribution to
farmers. The method used and efficacy of the chemical treatment must be
monitored and evaluated by the MOA. Monitoring and evaluation on the
incidence of exotic disease and insect pests, new weeds and genetic erosion
should be conducted by the MOA.
8.1.4.3. Animal importation
The Animal Resources Department (MOA) should establish quarantine measures
for animals imported. It should be also ensure correct drug specification.
Monitoring of transboundry diseases and vectors and the adequacy of the
measures taken should be made by the Animal Resources Department (ARD).
8.1.4.4. Fertilizer
Monitoring and evaluation on water bodies exposed for contamination from
nitrates and nitrites in the project area should be carried-out by the Department of
Water, MLWE.
8.1.4.5. Veterinary drug
Monitoring and evaluation on the use of imported drug safety on users, animals
and animal products and field efficacy must be monitored by the Animal
Resources Department, MOA.
86



8.2. HOUSING COMPONENT
8.2.1. Activities and impacts
Movement and concentration of large numbers of people and livestock in the
resettlement and rehabilitation areas results into negative environmental impacts of
varying levels. The set of activities under this component are:
* traditional house construction;
* household fuel wood energy;
* expansion of farm land on forest land;
* grazing and browsing.
8.2.1.1. Construction of traditional housing
8.2.1.1.1. Positive impact
* households sheltered under safe and hygiene conditions.
8.2.1.1.2. Negative impacts
* destruction of forest and wood results into soil erosion.
8.2.1.2. House hold fuel wvood energy
8.2.1.2.1. Positive impact
* fuel wood and charcoal supply is available for household food
cooking;
* fuel wood cost is almost zero in rural area (cheaper).
8.2.1.2.2. Negative impact
* land degradation and desertification;
*  farm animal manure use for fuel energy deprives the use of fertilizer to
improve soil fertility.
8.2.1.3. Expansion of farm land on forest area
8.2.1.3.1.Positive impact
* increase crop production;
* increase forest and crop residue supply availability for animal feed.
87



8.2.1.3.2.Negative impact
* accelerating of soil erosion due to devegetation;
* siltation of streams and dams as a result of poor land management
practices
8.2.1.4. Grazing and browsing
8.2.1.4.1. Positive impact
* food and income increase through increased number of animals.
8.2.1.4.2.Negative impact
* overstocking of livestock when concentrated on less grazing land area,
causing trampling destroying soil texture and structure leading to the
formation of gully type soil erosion;
* overexploitation of plants as feed may accelerate soil erosion.
8.2.2. Mitigation of impacts
8.2.2.1. On construction of traditional houses
*  research on altemative construction materials for rural houses;
* use of corrugated iron sheet roof at least in the highland;
* use stabilized clay blacks reinforced with grass for wall construction
and woven doum palm leaves for a roof of an "Agdo " lowland house;
* minimize wood and wood products through project management and
harvesting and in particular in the lowland area;
* implementation of rotational closures of wood area for regeneration;
* increase tree plantation on village or individual level and the
expansion of doum palm tree.
8.2.2.2. House hold fuel wood energy
Alternatives to.prevent the explosive use of fuel wood:
* improving the use of present supply of fuel wood through introduction
of fuel wood burning stoves;
displacing fuel wood and charcoal by increasing supply of kerosene;
* reducing supply of fuel wood through appropriate pricing policy;
* increasing the supply of renewable energy resources other than wood
at competitive prices;
* increasing supply of fuel wood through planting trees.



Other activities associated with resettlement such as water sources can have
negative environmental impact. Water can be contaminated if the sources are in
the form of open wells or stagnant pond. This may result into the likely spread of
diarrhoea and other water born diseases and it can be insect breeding site such as
mosquitoes. The cause could be due to improper design of water wells and its
surroundings such as drainage and the use of the same water point for livestock
and human-beings. The impacts can be mitigated by proper plan and design of
wells.
8.2.2.3. Expansion of farm lands on forest area
* design proper land use plan on the basis of land capability
classification;
* implementation of proper farm layout;
* avoid cutting economically important trees;
*  use proper soil conservation measures such as terracing cut off drain,
crop rotation and etc.
8.2.2.4. On grazing and browsing
* by controlling grazing, increasing off take livestock numbers by
creating development of marketing;
* promoting of traditional closure of grazing land;
* improve quality of roughages;
* determine grazing capacity of the area and adjust stocking rates.
8.2.3. Monitoring and evaluation
8.2.3.1. General
At present, monitoring and evaluation is being carried-out by the Department of
Environment. The activities of the Department of Environment are confined to the
head office in Asmara, hence it becomes difficult for the Department to carry-out
its monitoring and evaluation functions in the regions. The Department is a
regulatory body and should be involved with giving guidelines and regulating
matters relating to environmental impact assessment activities including
monitoring and evaluation. The line Ministries at a regional level which are
involved with rehabilitation activities and other concerned agencies should be
delegated the responsibility to carry-out the monitoring and evaluation function
and they should report to the DOE.
89



8.2.3.2. Area of Focus
8.2.3.2.1.Construction of Traditional Houses
* to monitor and evaluate if alternative material for construction is
achieved for implementation as described (suggested for mitigation);
* check carefully corrugated iron has replaced wood for roofing;
* monitor and evaluate if pressed block reinforced with fibber is used
for wall constructs.
8.2.3.2.2. Household fuel wood energy
* efficiency of the new improved stove;
* see the effectiveness of new substitution for fuel wood energy;
* see that trees planted by community or individuals are effective to
prevent further destruction of forest natural and woodland.
8.2.3.2.3.Expansion of farm lands on forest area
* check if land use is designed on the basis of land capability
classification;
* see that effectiveness of farm layout;
* check that cutting of economic trees are. totally stopped;
* follow-up that proper soil conservation activities such as
terracing, cut of dams and crop rotation are implemented.
8.2.3.2.4. Grazing and browsing
o check and evaluate if stocking rates are correct;
o monitor and evaluate if traditional area closure for grazing is
implemented effectively (checking revegetation);
e follow if the quality of grasses and other roughages are
improved;
. monitor and evaluate if there is an increase in off-take of
livestock numbers.
8.2.3.3. Implementing bodies
8.2.3.3.1.Construction of Traditional houses
Monitoring and evaluation should be carried-out principally by the Ministry of
Public Works and Construction, but assisted by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Ministry of Land, Water and Environment.
90



8.2.3.3.2. Household fuel wood energy
Monitoring and evaluation should be coordinated between the Ministry of Mines
and Energy, and the Ministry of Agriculture.
8.2.3.3.3.Expansion of farm lands on forest area
This should be carried-out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Land,
Water and Environment, Department of Land
8.2.3.3.4.Grazing and browsing
It should be carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture.
8.3. PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT (PSDc)
The private sector component of the emergency and rehabilitation programme
mainly consist of micro and small enterprises, such as shops, bars, restaurants,
carpentry shops, garages, bakery shops etc. The activities in this component, due
to the nature of their type, size and made of operation/location, are classified as
Category C and are considered to have no negative environmental impact and thus
require no further environmental assessment beyond screening. Therefore, for
these enterprises, no environmental management or mitigation plan is required.
91



9. ISSUES
9.1. Institutional set-up
The organizational set-up which includes also the Line-Ministries has not been
adequately organized where functions and authorities ate clearly designed and
followed. As a sequel to this, the functions are likely to overlap which may also
occur with the sphere of authority.
9.2. Environmental Laws
The DOE has prepared and submitted a draft proclamation but it has not been
published. Under this status, the institution cannot be expected to enforce
environmental measures and promote linkages and coordination of partnership
such as the private sector. It is not legally empowered to issue directives and
instructions and for EA implementation.
9.2. Technical and Focus
The manual needs to be upgraded technically where the procedures and guidelines
should be based as much as possible on science. Such scientific standards and
definitions on basic environmental requirements should be explicitly specified
against which achievable environmental monitoring and evaluation can be made
and that the EA activities would be effective. It seems that environment has only
little linkage with science. This can give the ground for the development of
national information system on environment which is currently absent.
The manual should also be comprehensive, linking and more reflective to local
realities. For instance, it limits the issues of pesticide and pests to food crops
forgetting the role of animals in the various ecosystems and food-chains. The
environmental problems faced in intensifying animal production have not been
included but such programmes are on-going and their development is taken as
national priority.
This means the manual is not adequately in coherence with the national
development priorities particularly on the concept of sustainability. This is
illustrated by the emphasis on issues such as industrial emissions as compared to
poor environmental health in urban areas and those linked with poverty in rural
areas. It fails also to state explicitly on trade-offs at least as concept, because
environmental costs are high.
