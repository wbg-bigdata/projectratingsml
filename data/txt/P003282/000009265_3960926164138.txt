Memorandum and Recommendation
of the President of the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
to the Executive Directors
on a Proposed Loan
to the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority
with the Guarantee wf Zimbabwe
for a Power II Project
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply
Authority  (ZESA)  for  US$44 million,  guaranteed  by  Zimbabwe, is  submitted  for
approval.   The proposed loan would be for a term of 20 years including a 5-year
grace period, and would help finance the development of the power supply system in
the country.  Cofinancing for the rest of the foreign exchange costs of the project
would be provided by a grant  from the Government of Norway (US$5.0 million), and
loans from the Netherlands Government (US$7.5 million), the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (US$21.7 million) and the African Development Bank (US$20.8 million).
ZESA would f,nance the local project costs (US$89.1 million) and interest during
inmpiementation (US$36.0 million).
2.          Background.   In 1985 Zimbabwe's final energy consumption was about 7.2
m:Lllion toe, equivalent to a per capita consumption of 0.9 toe which is one of the
h:ighest in Africa.   Woodfuels accounted for 64% of final energy consumption, coal
2)%, electric power 8% and petroleum produtts 8%. Zimbabwe has to import all of its
pe!troleum product requirements by pipeline through Mozambique and by rail, and it is
vLrtually  self-sufficient  for its coal  requirements.   Zimbabwe  has  one  of  the
1.argest power systems in Subsaharan Africa, due mainly to the demand of the
manufacturing sector. Maximum power demand in FY86 was 1319 MW, and energy supplied
was 8527 GWh.   Through the Centra' African Power Corporation (CAPC), jointly owned
by Zimbabwe and Zambia, the operations of the power systems in the two countries
have been closely coordinated for about 25 years, baing linked through the Kariba
hydroelectric complex on the Zambezi river which forms the border between the two
countries, and the high voltage transmission system in both countries.   Zimbabwe
imported up to 40% of its power requirements from Zambia during the 1980s.  The two
countries have yet to sign a new agreement on power trade to succeed the agreement
.hich terminated on June 30, 1987. There is substantial underutilized hydroelectric
generating capacity In Zambia and Mozambique.   However, with the commissioning in
1987 of the second stage of the Hwange coal-fired power station under the Bank's
Power  I  Project  (Loan  2212-ZIM),  Zimbabwe  can  presently  satisfy  its  power
requirements from its own generating capacity at Kariba South hydroelectric station
(666 MW) and at coal-fired power stations, especiaily Hwarige (920 MW).
3.            The institutional structure for the energy sector in Zimoabwe lacks
cohesion.   The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and Development (MEWRD) has
overall responsibility for energy policy, excercised through its Department of
Energy (DOE), and for the main power and petroleum product supply organizations,
ZESA and the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM).   The Ministry of Mines is
responsible for the coal subsector which supplies the Hwange power station.
Woodfuel supply issues relating to forestry are the responsibility of the Ministry
of Lands,  Agriculture  and Rural  Resettlement.   The power  sector has just  been
reorganized institutionally with (i) the amalgamation of the former Electricity
Supply Commission and the municipal electricity departments of Harare, Bulawayo,
Gweru and Mutare into ZESA as the national electricity undertaking; and (ii) the
reconstitution of CAPC into the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA) under which its
responsibilities for operating major generation and transmission facilities in
Zimbabwe and Zambia are devolved  to  the national  power  undertakings.    ZRA  is
responsible for managing the use of the Zambezi waters including operating the
Kariba dam and reservoir and any future structures on the river.   Current energy
price levels are generally above economic costs of meeting demand, but the structure



of prices should be changed to improve  th  efficiency of energy usage.   ZESA's
financial situation is satisfactory and in line with the financial covenants of the
Power I Project, which has been substantially completed satlifactorily,
4.        The main Issues in the power sector are (i) deterioration in operation and
maintenance of the power supply facilities and the occurrence of bottlenecks in the
transmission and distribution systems from loss of skilled manpower due to
uncompetitive employment conditions, and from lack of foreign exchange for purchase
of spare parts, equipment and materials; (it) the need to consolidate the ne'j
organizational structure; (iii) the lack of a sound policy for energy pricing which
has led to economically sub-optimal and large unpredictable energy price increases;
(iv) the lack of an updated long-term development program with the risk of
commitment to large but uneconomic investments, especially in the immediate future;
and (v) uncertainty about Government policy on future power imports and thus, on
adopting the least-cost power development program.  Recently progress has been made
in resolving these issues.  ZESA has started a manpower development program.   The
fuznctions of all the municipal electricity departments were transferred to ZESA by
July 1, 1987.  An energy pricing study has been completed under the Power I Project,
and the Government  is presently reviewing its recommendations.   Consultants have
recently submitted to ZESA a draft report or, power system development according to
terms  of  reference  agreed  with  the  Bank.   Zimbabwe  and  Zambia  have  signed  a
bilateral agreement on the reconstiLucion of CAPC, and have promulgated legislation
to enact the agreement. The two countries have also agreed on interim arrangements
for joint power system operations and the basis for agreeing future system
developments.
5.         Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to address the most
critical  needs  of  the  power  subsector  in  the  period  1988-90  by  improving  tho
efficiency and reliability of power supply, removing bottlenecks in the transmission
and distribution systems, and helping ensure a smooth operational and financial
transition to the new sectoral organization.   It would al'  promote economically
efficient energy pricing policies and help establish long-;erni regional investment
priorities.
6.           Project Description.  The proposed project would: (i) rehabilitate and
upgrade the existing generating units of the Kariba icuth hydroelectric station;
(ii) rehabilitate and extend the transraission and distribution networks; (iii)
provide service equipment, spare parts, materials, workshops, and vehicles; (iv)
support ZESA's institutional and manpower development; (v) establish a management
information system (MIS) for ZESA; (vi) provide operational technical assiscaince to
ZESA; (vii) provide engineering services for project execution; and (viii) implement
studies into power system transmission development and operational improvements.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$188.1 million, of which foreign
costs total US$99.0 million (53%).  The local cost component,comprising  47% of the
project costs, would be met by ZESA from its internal cash generation.   Details of
the project costs and the financing  plan are shown in Schedule  A.   Procurement
methods and amounts involved and the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of the Bank Group
operations In Zimbabwe are given in Schedules C and D respectively.   A map of power
facilities is also attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6642-ZIM, of November
30, 1987 is being distributed with this Memorandum.
7.         Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's role in the energy sector in
Zimbabwe supports the Bank's objective for assistance to Zimbabwe which is to help
Government to promote (a) implementation of policy changes to support the process of
economic restructuring; (b) investment in economic infrastructure (including energy)
to support long-term growth in the productive sectors; and (c) the reduction of
poverty and inequality through investment in social and economic infrastructure. In
this context, continued Bank involvement in the power sector would (i) help to



maintain the momentum for implementing the reorganization of the power sector,
economically-efficient energy pricing and least-cost power system development; and
(ii) promote and focus donor assistance on the financing of priority investments in
the power sector.
8.            Agreed Actions:   Government and ZESA agreed at negotiations to the
following actions: (i) ZESA to rationalize by June 30, 1988 the structure and levels
of its compensation packagesZ to attract and retain high-level staff; (ii) ZESA to
retain adequate operational staff for system maintenance and operation throughout
tne project execution period; (III) ZESA to establish a computerized management
information system by July 1, 1991; (iv) ZESA to fill key staff poaitions in its MIS
unit as a condition of loan effectiveness; (v) Government to prepare a plan for
strengthening the planning end management of the energy sector and for improving
coordination among the energy-related institutions, with the Bank's assistance under
the Joint Bank/UNDP Energy Management Assistance Program; (vi) ZESA to conclude new
tariff agreements with twelve major industrial power users based on the Energy
Pricing Study as a condition of loan effectiveness; (vii) ZESA to implement
generally a uniform national tariff by July 1, 1988; (viii) ZESA to earn a rate of
return on net revalued assets of at least 7% and to self-finance at least 40% of its
total construction expenditure during the project implementation period; (ix) ZESA
not to incur future long-term debt without the Bank's consent, unless net income is
at least 1.5 cimes the maximum debt service; (x) ZESA to review with Government and
the Bank the Five Year FY88-92 Power Investmer.t Program by March 31, 1988, to ..dopt
a program satisfactory to Government and the Bank, and to update and review the
program annually with the Government and the Bank thereafter; (xi) Government and
ZESA not to undertake any new power investment exceeding US$50 million until the
Five  Year  FY88-92  Power  Investment  Program  is  adopted;  (xii)  subsequently,
Government and ZESA not to undertake any new power investment exceeding US$50
million  not  in  the  adopted  Five  Year  Power  Investment  Program  without  prior
consultation with the Bank; and (xiii) satisfactory completion of the reconstitution
of CAPC including arrangements for cooperation with Zambia on power system
operations and development.
9.            Justification.   Efficient and reliable power supply is crucial  for
Zimbabwe's diversified economy, particularly for mining, industry and agriculture.
The rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing power facilities, and extensions to
the transmission and distribution networks were determined to be the next phase of
the least cost power system development.    The other project components to improve
the sector's investment planning, institutional development, system operations and
management are also required to maintain a reliable power supply.   The estimated
economic rate of return of the project is 18%.
10.            Risks.   Potential  risks are  relatively minor,  and arise  from the
possibility of inadequate coordination between the Government and ZESA on sector
issues which may affect sector performance and the manpower situation.  The project
would mitigate these risks through establishment of clear responsibilities for
sector coordination and management and through a manpower development and training
program, including the necessary actions to retain qualified staff. There is little
physical risk associated with   this kind of project,  and it would not have an
adverse environmental impact.
11.        Recommendatior.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply w" h
the Articles of Agreement of the World Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
