3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:



The original objectives of the Paraguay Private Sector Development Project (Loans 3375-PA and
3376-PA), approved by thfe Bonrd on July 5- 1994, were: (i) to strengthen the nrivate sector so that it could
foster economic growth; (ii) to strengthen the ongoing reform of the financial sector in order to improve the
efficiecV of IrUsourc 1mob1LaiUUl aiiu allocaLtiVl atlU 1iuaniLalI I  ciLA%& a iii) to  meedim.A
and long-term credit to enterprises in order to overcome investment constraints in Paraguay. These
objectives were appropriate for the project as originally intended and tney remained appropriate until mida
1997 when a financial sector crisis erupted leading to Government intervention in several banks that were
in financial crisis, including two banks intermediating the World Bank loans. The banking crisis reduced
the number of potentially active banking intermediaries, and high levels of arrears weakened the banks'
lending portfolios. No new loans were approved under the project after June 1997, and no new sub-projects
were likely to he approved after that time due to the fragile situation of the banking sector.

and the Borrower agreed to revise the objectives of the project. The remaining undisbursed amount of over
US$16 million was not iikely to be used for the original purpose of the loan and was available when the
crisis related to the El Nifo phenomenon arose in Paraguay in 1997/98. Most of the remainder of the two
Bank loans was reallocated to finance assistance related to the El Niio emergency. This involved a
reallocation of US$ 16.24 million, about 30% of the loans. This ICR relates to the new Part B of the
project that addressed the emergency related to El Ninio. A separate ICR for the Private Sector
Development phase (Part A) of the nroject was issued on March 23; 2001.
3.2 Revised Obhective:
Dluring Novermber and DeemAher 1997 h-eavy rains had occurred in Paraguav destroving infrastructure;
particularly bridges and roads. For the first time in 40 years the Government issued a decree declaring an
eeeyAtus fr          CO-da-tA-.  -C v A -A al  Pdv  andils Ai bUtaries. Alin anuAry 198, aQ ATJD-
mission proposed a strategy to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure and mitigate the effects of floods. A
Bank mission visited Paraguay in February and March 1998 and proposed to amend the two loans
originally intended for private sector development so that they could be used for flood relief instead of
establishing a new loan to finance the El Niino Emergency Assistance Program. The project was formally
amended on June 17, 1998 by the Board of Directors on a no objection basis to change the objectives and
reallocate funding from Loans 3775-PA and 3776-PA. The name of the project was changed to the
"Privat.e Sec-^tnor Deveinpme-nt and El Nifno Project" Signing of the amendment was on June 24, 199R The
original closing date for the new Part B of the project was June 30, 2001.
The new objectives were to assist the Borrower on an emergency basis to:
*   help reduce the loss of human life and a deterioration of living standards that might result from the
1997/98 El Ninlo event;
*   help reduce the loss of or damage to economic infrastructure and rehabilitate economic and social
infrastructure resulting from the El Nifio event; and
*   i       Pr.crea  PralY'c raaci.  to fnrne.at ar.d resnnnd to% flitiure eimilr -vPntc nid ehthkpr natuhral
phenomena.
At the time the project was amended in June 1998, a separate Part B of the project was established with an
estimated cost of US$ 17.8 million of which US$ 16.24 million would be contributed from the remainder of
the Bank loans. A parallel loan of US$ 35 million from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)
was also made available to the government for responding to the El Ninlo phenomenon.

The change in objectives was timelyv Riinqs had caused flooding of low-lving areas in many communities
and cities along the Paraguay River. About 15,000 families had been displaced and were living in
ter.po.-arjy aeas.A. AditUionall ILoUod foreaste   LLLf t. LIh U V.I IVIaJ LUUUVJI JUL1I, WeIre expectLeU to
displace an additional 18,000 families. Most of the people affected were poor.
Projects with similar objectives had already been initiated to confront damage from El Nirlo in other South
American countries. Preparation of Part B of this project took into account past Bank experience with
those El Ninlo projects. Since Paraguay had not been able to take preventive action due to budget
constraints it was not possible to prevent or reduce the loss of human life or damage to economic
infrastructure Hn4owever, it was rossible to nrevent further deterioration of living standards- to rehabilitate
economic and social infrastructure and to improve Paraguay's ability to forecast and respond to future
s,uJLiaI r eVe.tsL0.
l ne revised project had not been inciuded in tne CAS discussed at the Board in March i997. T nat CAS
strategy aimed to (i) enhance social development and human resource development in order to reduce
poverty in rural and peri-urban areas and (ii) improve the performance and institutional capacity of the
Borrower to deliver key social infrastructure and environmental services.  Although the proposed
emergency assistance operation was not included in the CAS, it was broadly supportive of the objectives of
the CAS.
3 3 original Cnomponents:
The original proiect had involved two lines of credit of US$ 25 million each. These were to be channeled
through a unit in the Central Bank of Paraguay to participating financial institutions. One line of credit
wteas a slnger cuarsrerncy loan; anohfer wa tore  fia lnerr loans denomn;rated in lAsIoa crreny.r Wo[rk imdlr theser
components had ceased in 1997, due to the banking crisis, before the project objectives and components
were revised.
3.4 Revised Components:
Whlulen uhe p-oLJQL was amended, a new Palt B of he pr.oJect was established with t.hree cor.poner.ts. T.his
amounted to a complete restructuring of the remainder of the project:
(i) Emergency Prevention/Reconstruction Component: (74.5% of cost; US$13.3 million). Rehabilitation of
public infrastructure such as bridges and roads, hospitals and health posts, schools, river defenses and
embankments in cities along the Paraguay River, according to eligibility criteria.
(ii) Mitigation Comnonent: (\4-5% of nroiect costs; US$0=8 million)- Installation of nermanent water and
sanitary facilities in about three sanitary centers in Asunci6n. These sanitary facilities would (a) improve

El Niio as well as for people temporarily displaced by future floods and (b) be kept as permanent
structures to be used by the Government in order to provide sanitary services to low-income families.
These terraces would be permanent structures to be used to temporarily place people affected by floods.
(iii) Institutional Support Component: (2 1% of cost; US 3.8 million). This would strengthen the capacity
of Paraguayan agencies responsible for carrying out emergency activities, as well as forecasting and
mionito"ing the impacts of rlim2tologieal event<. These agencies were the' N2hinn2! Fmierg,ncv Committsee
(CEN), created under the Ministry of Interior. Other agencies included the Direcci6n de Meteorologia e

responsible for aspects of disaster forecasting and response. This component was to finance technical
sqsstanre_ spelciali7ed enuiinment studies and consulting services for nroiect management to support
project implementation and financial and technical audits.
The project was to be implemented by CEN by a unit to be created within CEN for the implementation of
the project CEN was aiso to be strengthened by part of the emergency assistance ioan financed by IADB.
The project was classified as Category B for environmental impact. The physical components of the project
were appropriate for achieving the objectives, except for prevention, for which the project was initiated too
late. The works to be rehabilitated were reviewed by the Bank when the project was amended. !It was
determnined that they would not affect the quantity or oualitv of water flows in the Paraguay River or any
other international waterways.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The Bank acted rapidly to provide assistance to an ongoing emergency situation. The use of an existing
loan was arn e. V way Lo achieve tUhi.                              -Al the p   o  w  a deAt-1d A
Annex was prepared to describe the new project and lay the course for its implementation. The annex
included background on the El Nino phenomenon in Paraguay, the affected population, eligibility criteria
and preliminary lists of sub-projects to be implemented. A project implementation unit was created within
CEN, to be called Technical Project Implementation Unit (UTEP), and provision was made to prepare a
Project Operation Manual.
Monitorin: indicators, a nrocurement nlan- a financial management system and an Operational Manual
were required as-conditions of effectiveness for the new Part B of the project. Technical audits were to be

when the emergency was in progress, but subprojects were to be screened by the environmental experts of
UT1EP. impact assessments and mitigation plans would be prepared for any sub-projects classified as
category A. Although objectives related to prevention were overtaken by events since El Nino had already
occurred, the inclusion of rehabilitation measures and building capacity for forecasting and future response
were appropriate. Therefore, quality at entry is rated satisfactory.
4. Achievement of Obiective and OutDuts
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The first objective, reducing the loss of and deterioration of living standards, could not be achieved,
because most of the El Niuo related damage had already taken place by the time Part B of the project was
in place in July 1998.
The serond objective, pre-venting dmage to economic infrastructure and rehabilitating social and economic
infrastructure damaged in the 1997/98 floods, was achieved in part, particularly the rehabilitation.
Recns,uctonof roads and bridges and social infritruac.dre was un.deraen throughout flood damlaged
areas. Flood prevention works were implemented in Pilar. In addition, a mitigation program has been
undertaken to provide shelter for future flood victims in Asunci6n.
The third objective, increasing Paraguay's ability to forecast and respond to future such events was
achieved satisfactorily.

4.2 Outputs by components:
During the first year of the project there were delays by the Government in project effectiveness and
implementation (see section 5.2).
Emer.renc.y Preven.t.on - Recongm-u-figo:
Since tne project started wnen mne pnenomenon was aireauy passed, it was not possioie to unoertaKe
emergency/prevention works. Therefore, this component focused on rehabilitation and reconstruction of
social infrastructure, roads and bridges and large-scale flood protection works in Pilar.
By November 15, 2001, 55 schools and 92 health centers had been rehabilitated. Construction of school
buildings is of good auality, but many still lack adeauate sanitary facilities. In the case of health centers,
some improvements have been cosmetic when more critical improvements such as access to water supply

Flood prevention woriks in Pilar involve a large dike around the city costing US$3.6 miilion. The works
were finished near the end of the extended project period. Work by one of the contractors was delayed
because of flooding and construction of illegal housing on the site and delays in signing payment vouchers
because of the recent change of the Director of UTEP. Part of the dike around the city is designed for a
100 year flood and part for a 50 year flood, which means that additional investment would be needed to
achie.ve full re.turn on the investmPnt made iinder the nmroi--t  This large azupih_nrniot was not qiihiprt to
economic evaluation (see section 4.3).
Mitigation
After some delay, agreements were reached to prepare for future the temporary relocation of the victims of
future floods in Asunci6n to one police base and one military base. Both sites are close to flood-prone
areas. The site in the police base has sanitary facilities and a large cement plinth area capable of
accommodating 14 large tents, with each tent accommodating up to 20 families, about a total of 250
fami1ies. Ahniit 20 mrep families iould hb a -onmminiti-d in ma&pqhift hni.qinog in a nperinhemr pn a   The
site in the army base also has sanitary facilities and has enough space for about 1000 families. A third site

Altogether, about half of the 5000 families displaced by the last El Nifno event would now be able to be
accommodated on these new sites. The National Emergency Committee (CEN), presided over by the
Minister of Interior, is in control and assuring the maintenance of the areas. During a disaster the sites will
be administered by an Administration Committee consisting of CEN, the armed forces, the Municipality of
Asunci6n and the Pastoral Social (church).

radio system has been installed connecting CEN to 23 municipalities in disaster prone areas. A weather
monitoring system (wind gauges, radar) is being set up at a university. Geographic information and
plotting equipment have been procured for the Military Directorate of Geography; this equipment is in use.
Additional equipment (office furniture, computers, etc.) are being supplied by the IADB as part of the
refurbishing of CEN offices. Additional office equipment and facilities for a crisis management center are
being provided under an IADB loan (see Section 4.5).
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Given the emergency nature of the works that were focused on reconstruction, no ex-ante economic rates of
return were called for under the proiect  This was unfortunate, since sorne of the large "emergency"
reconstruction works were actually not urgently needed this year and could have benefited from greater

US$3.6 million will achieve an IRR of only 5.4%.
4.4 Financial rate ofreturn:
No financial rates of return were called for under the revised project.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
CEN, which had been in existence since 1993 with responsibility for coordinating response to natural
disasters, was designated the lead agency for project implementation and the main counterpart for the Bank
and the LADB for implementation. CEN had little experienced staff prior to the project. The UTEP was
supposed to be a temporary technical unit under the CEN to assist it in the implementation of the project.
However, it was removed from CEN during project implementation and located in separate offices and
began reporting directly to the Minister of Interior. This constrained the development of CEN into a strong
disaster response agency} as originallv intended. At the end of the proiect penriod I JTF.P was reintegrated
into CEN which contributed somewhat to renewed development of CEN.
CEN was provided consultant services and equipment under the project to prepare it to monitor and
respond to future disasters. Consultant assistance and training were financed for CEN to strengthen its
capacity to assess and manage emergencies and to establish geographic information systems for
emergencies. Communications and emergency equipment were also provided to CEN under the project (see
section 4.2). All of the equipment provided under the project is accounted for, although some has been
loaned to local authorities and the Red Cross for specific needs. Some of the equipment provided under the
TADB loan is not yet in lse, particularly equipment to c-rp-qtA acis management room intende.d for high
officials of government. This latter initiative is ambitious, given CEN's limited visibility and capacity.
CEN has an annual budget equivalent to about US$ 500, 000. With this budget it can pay its 22
permanent staff and the 7 contract staff who are currently paid under projects. it has sufficient resources
to attend to 8-10 small emergencies per year. This year it has been called to 30 small disasters and assisted
victimns of a wind storm and a hale storm. It would require a budget three times this large to a moderate to
severe El Ninio event. CEN has drafted a National Plan for the Prevention of and Response to Disasters.
This would create a National Prevention/Mitigation Committee consisting of 20 public and private agencies
whit-h  lAu ideXntify annd pla n  for prPvention/nittigation measlres. It would al.s c-eat. a vntwialt
Response/Rehabilitation Committee consisting of six agencies (armed forces, police, red cross, etc.) and

Government for approval but was not approved because it included a roughly US$ 1.5 million budget
which Governnient was not willing to finance. CEN is prepa.red to reihbmit the nrnnopsa next year u,ithnit
the funding increase intending to rely on extra budget allocations when large needs arise in the future.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The timing and severity of the flood damage was outside the government's control.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
There was initially a six-month delay in the effectiveness of Part B of the project due to a failure of the
Government to meet all the conditions of effectiveness, including the creation and staffing up of the proiect
unit at CEN. This was serious because of the emergency nature of the project. Procurement decisions,

component, the bidding documents were modified close to the date established for delivering proposals,
whici resuleU III a new bidUUng date thaL UelayeI int sian of this component. Due to a dispute, several
large contracts had to be re-tendered in early 1999. Further delays were caused by changes in government
with the new government hesitating to implement decisions begun by the former government. This led to a
downgrading of the achievement of Development Objectives and Implementation Progress to unsatisfactory
during implementation. The ratings were only changed after the constraints were resolved in early 2000.
There were also delays during proiect implementation due to a delay by the Government in providing its
15% counterpart contribution for works. During implementation, frequent changes in the management of
TITFP (five idifferpnt dirpt) also con rnnqtrinPd npro,ect pexeuition.

CFN developed slowly a an agenc-y and most of the project management "'as taken avay ofrm it by
separating UTEP from it and making it responsible directly to the Minister of Interior. Therefore, during
mrost of Lilt pIUJLAL perLioU 1-IN  id1rU LU UdveIUp as a strong agency capable of managing disaster
response. UTEP's effectiveness was constrained by frequent changes of management. In the end, when
CEN was put back in charge of the project it was able to complete most of the project in a satisfactory
manner.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total project cost increased from US$17.80 million estimated at appraisal to US$19.48 million. This
was due mainly to the increased cost of the city defense works in Pilar and was financed largely by an
increase in the government contribution.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The rehabilitation works for bridges, schools and health centers were undertaken by the respective
ministries (Public Works, Education and Public Health) under the overall direction of UTEP. They were
iudged to be generally of good quality. Their maintenance is the responsibility of the respective ministries.
The flood refuge platforms created under the project are of good quality and under the control of CEN and
not ispei for nthpr pirnoses at ts ti;me.

The development of CEN has focused on physical facilities and equipment which itself will require a
qi7eahle hudget to maintain The US$500,000 now at its disposal shnuld ennhhl CEN to continue fiuture
operations at a modest level. Further development of CEN would be required for it to fulfill a broader role
in udaasteL VLYaVIrVagerLLL ver Lti1I1V, bULt a  muh a.-ger bUUdgeL Ilidy IoL Ube aII alU4UIV.
Maintenance of the fiood protection works in Pilar, including several pumping stations, is uncertain (see
section 6.2). The municipality has agreed to be responsible for operation and maintenance, but its financial
ability to do so has not been assessed by Government.
On balance, the sustainability of facilities and institutions developed under the project is rated marginally
likely.
6.2 Transition arrlayngrempnt t. rvnr oerntinonc6 :
The roads, bridges; schonnl and health centers financed unider the project are the responnibilitv of the
concemed ministries which implemented the works and are now responsible for their operation and
raintem-ancev. CEN.U is iIL WoLtrol Vf Ltbe fLiood 1U,1UrV east.
The municipality is responsible for maintaining the flood protection works in Pilar. There is a plan to
charge the residences and businesses within the protected area a surcharge in order to maintain the dyke,
pumping stations and other facilities. However, no analysis has been done of ability/willingness to pay the
required amounts.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Faced with a request for disaster assistance, the Bank identified an existing source of funding and amended
the original loan quickly. No prevention works could be undertaken because the phenomenon had already
passed. However, given its rapid and flexible response, Bank performance in lending is rated satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
After the decision to restructure the project there were nine Bank supervision missions to Paraguay,
between March 1998 and 2001. These missions were usually short, because they were combined with
other supervision missions of El Nifio proiects. Three of them had only one member. Engineers
predominated and no financial analyst or economist was involved. Bank performance is rated satisfactory.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
The Bank responded quickly to an emergency project in preparing the project. In the face of difficult
political and instittional mr.anagement constraints supprviston misnnion  were able to resolve tchni-cla and
difficult procurement issues and keep the project on track. Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Government was quick to agree on the proposed restructuring of the existing project, but slow to comply
with the conditions of effectiveness. This was critical given the emergency nature of the project, and it led
to delays in implementation (see section 5.2). On balance preparation is rated marginally satisfactory.
7.5 Government imnlementation nerformance:
There were serious delays in the project due to government involvement and interference in the procurement
process. Changes in the focus of project management from CEN to UTEP and back to CEN led to delays
in the prnpjet a.n.d losct rww,rh,nitpa for r   to devueilop. CEN didA not receive sutflf.cint sunpnnrt firnm
successive govemments to develop as an effective organization for providing disaster response (see section
4.5). Availability of counterpart funds was also constrained. GoverinMent implementation performLUaLce is
rated unsatisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
CEN did not develop fully into the highly effective disaster response originally envisioned (see section 4.5).
For most of the project U EP was left to manage project implementation separately from CEN. In spite of
frequent changes in management and delays, UTEP was able to complete most of the physical components
of the project. Almost all the rest was completed when responsibility for project implementation was
shifted back to CEN. CEN's modest capabilities for emergency response have potential for further
development if budgetary support is continued. Implementing agency responsibility is rated marginally
satisfacttnrv

be subject to similar technical, economic, financial and institutional analysis as would be other similar

return were called for under the project.  This was unfortunate, since some of the large "emergency"
reconstruction works were actchaify not iirgentlv needed this year and could have benefited from greater

Additional Annex 8. Borrower's Final Evaluation Summary
1.     Valoraci6n de disefio y objetivo del desarrollo, y de la calidad en la entrada
1.1    Objetivo original:
Los objetivos originales del Proyecto de Desarrollo del Sector Privado del Paraguay (Prestamos 3375-PA y
3376-PA), aprobados el 5 de Julio de 1994, fueron: para fortalecer el sector privado para que pueda crear
el crecimiento econ6micno fhrtalecer 12 refnrm2 contini2 del zentnr fin2nnliern en i rmen a mpinrnr In
eficiencia de la movilizaci6n del recurso, asignaci6n y la intermediaci6n fmanciera; y para proveer

Paraguay. Estos objetivos fueron apropiados para el proyecto como originalmente fue pensado y ellos
permanecieron apropiados hasta mediados del afio 1997 cuando una crisis del sector financiero hizo
erupci6n Ilevando a una intervenci6n Gubernamental a varios bancos que estaban en una crisis financiera,
incluyendo dos bancos interponiendose a los prestamos del Banco Mundial. La crisis bancaria redujo el
niunero de intermediarios bancarios potencialmente activos, y altos niveles de atrasos debilitando las
carpetas prestadas por el banco. Ningun nuevo prestamo fue aprobado bajo el proyecto despues de junio
del afo 1997- v ninguno de os sIuh nrovectos era probable a se.r aprobados de.spuls de ese tiempo debidoa
la fragil situaci6n del sector bancario.
Para mediados del aiio 1998, despues de casi un afno de valuaciones del proyecto poco satisfactorias, y
cerca de ia fecha de clausura, el Banco y el Prestatario acordaron revisar los objetivos del proyecto. El
remanente de mAs de 16 millones de dMlares, no era probable que se utilice para el prop6sito original del
prestamo y estaba disponible cuando ocurri6 la crisis relacionada al fen6meno de "El Nifio" en Paraguay
en 1997/98. La mayor parte del resto del prestamo de los dos bancos fue re ubicado a la asistencia
relacionada a la emergencia de "El Niiio". Esto involucr6 la reasignaci6n de 16 millones de dMlares,
aproximadamente el 300/n de los nretamos Este ICR se relaciona con la nueva Parte B del nrnvecto qnue
dirigi6 la emergencia relacionada al fen6meno "El Nifio". Un IRC separado para la fase del Desarrollo del
Sector Pr:.vAdo fDr+ art  A) e-1oet se erl itio el 23 Ae Marzo Ael 2001.

1.2    Objetivo Revisado:
Durante Noviembre y Diciembre de 1997, lluvias intensas ocurrieron en Paraguay destruyendo
infraestructuras, particularmente puentes y caminos. Por primera vez en 40 afios el Gobierno emiti6 un
decreto declarando un estado de emergencia por las zonas costeras del Rio Paraguay y sus afluentes. En
Enern de 199R8 una miqi6n del IlNDP nmpuso una estrategia nara rehabilitar el dafin de infraestnltura y
mitigar los efectos de las inundaciones. Una misi6n del Banco visit6 al Paraguay en Febrero y Marzo de
1998 y prop-uso enmien; A_ los dos pI__ 4L        _-- igiuauierite pensados para el d1 usarrollo A-1 del sau-
para que ellos pudieran usarse para el alivio de inundaciones en vez de establecer un nuevo prestamo para
financiar el Programa de Asistencia y Emergencia de -El Ni-no. El proyecto fue formaimente enmendado
el 17 de Junio de 1998, por la Mesa de Directorio dando su no objeci6n para cambiar los objetivos y
reasignar consolidaciones de los prestamos 3774-PA y 3775-PA. El nombre del proyecto fue cambiado a
"Desarrollo del Sector Privado y de Emergencia "El Nino". La firma de la enmienda fue el 24 de Junio de
1998. La fecha del cierre original para la nueva Parte B del proyecto fue el 30 de Junio del 2001.

Los nuevos objetivos fueron para asistir al Prestatario en una base de emergencia a:
*      Ayudar a reducir la perdida de vida humana y el deterioro de los niveles de vida que pueden
resuitar dei evento de "Ei Nino" en iy 97/98.
*      Ayudar a reducir la perdida o daiios a la infraestructura economica y social y rehabilitar la
infraestructura econ6mica y social resultante del evento de "El Nifio" y
*      Fortalecer la capacidad del Paraguay para prever y responder a futuros eventos similares u otros
fen6menos naturales.
En el tiempo en que el proyecto fue enmendado en Junio de 1998, una parte separada de la Parte,B del

contribuido del resto de los prestamos del Banco. Un prestamo paralelo de $35 millones del Banco
interamericano de Desarrollo, tambien se hizo disponibie ai gobierno por responder ai fenomeno "ti Nino".
El cambio de objetivos fue oportuno. Las Iluvias habian causado inundaciones de areas bajas en muchas
comunidades y ciudades a lo largo del rio Paraguay. Aproximadamente 15,000 familias fueron trasladadas
y vivieron en areas temporales. Inundaciones adicionales fueron previstas para el periodo de Mayo a Junio
y se esperaba que cambiaran de sitio a un adicional de 1 R000 familias. La mayor narte de las nersonas
afectadas eran pobres.
Proyectos con objetivos similares ya se habian iniciado para enfrentar danios de "El Nino" en otros paises
sudamericanos. La preparaci6n de la Parte B dei proyecto tomo en cuenta ias pasadas experiencias dei
Banco con esos proyectos de "El Nifio". Paraguay no habia sido capaz de tomar acciones preventivas y
debido al ajustado presupuesto no fue posible prevenir o reducir la perdida de vidas humanas o el dafio a la
infraestructura econ6mica. Sin embargo, fue posible prevenir deterioros de la calidad de vida, la
rehabilitaci6n econ6mica y social y para mejorar la habilidad de Paraguay para prever y responder a los

apunt6 a (i) reforzar el desarrollo humano y social en orden a reducir la pobreza en las areas rurales y peri-
urbanas y (ii) fortalecer la capacidad institucional del Prestatario para otorgar iniraestructura sociai y
servicios ambientales. Aunque el fuincionamiento de ayuda de emergencia propuesto no estaba incluido en
el CAS, estaba ampliamente favorecido por los objetivos del CAS.
1.3    Componentes Originales:

aproximadamente tres instalaciones de servicios puiblicos (que incluiran la instalaci6n de sistemas de agua

sanitaria e higienica de personas que viven en campamentos en Asunci6n como a resultado de inundaciones
causadas por "El Nifno", asi como tambien las personas temporalmente cambiadas de sitio por futuras
inundaciones, y ser euardadas como estnicturas permanentes a ser usadas por el Gobierno en orden a
proveer servicios sanitarios a familias de bajos ingresos. Estas terrazas seran estructuras permanentes para

(II)  Componente de Fortalecimiento instituciona;: (21% del Costo; $3.8 miliones). Esto fortalecera Ia
capacidad de agencias Paraguayas responsables en coordinar las actividades de emergencias, asi como
prever y supervisar los impactos de eventos climatol6gicos. Estas agencias fueron El Comite de
Emergencia Nacional (CEN), creado bajo el Ministerio del Interior. Otras agencias incluyeron a la
Direcci6n de Meteorologia e Hidrologia, la Administraci6n de Navegaci6n y Puertos, y el Servicio
Geogr6fico Militar, quienes son responsables en el aspecto de prever y responder a desastres. Este
componente era para financiar la asistencia tecnica, equipo especializado, estudios y servicios de

El proyecto debia ser irnplementado por el CEN con una unidad a ser creada dentro del CEN para la
aplicaci6n del proyecto. El CEN tambien seria fortalecido por parte del prestamo de asistencia de
emergencias financiado por el IADB (BID).
El proyecto fue clasificado como Categoria B por impacto medioambiental. Los comDonentes fisicos del
proyecto fueron apropiados por lograr los objetivos, excepto por prevenci6n, por la cual el proyecto fue
iniciado deasiado t-Ade. Los trabajos a ser rehailitados AiAeron revisados po "r el Tlarn,c n1idAn eAl pwroyectn

1.5    Calidad en la entrada:
El Banco actu6 rapidamente para proveer asistencia a una situaci6n de emergencia en marcha. El uso de un
pr6stamo va existente fue una forma efectiva para lograr esto. Cuando los obietivos del Drovecto fueron
enmendados, un detallado Anexo Tecnico fue preparado para describir el nuevo proyecto y trazar el curso
par su aplicacidn. El ar.exo ir.clwa  ntecedentes sobre e! fenomerno de "17!M  io" en Paromiai, Ia

Una unidad de ejecuci6n del proyecto fue creada dentro del CLEiN, que se iiamo unidad Tecnica Ejecutora
del Proyecto (UTEP), y la provisi6n fue hecha para preparar un Manual de Operaci6n del Proyecto.
Fueron requeridos como condici6n de efectividad para la nueya Parte B del proyecto la presentaci6n de
indicadores para monitorear la ejecuci6n, un plan de adquisiciones, un sistema administrativo financiero y
un Manual de Oneraci6n. Auditonias tecnicas se llevaron a caho v habia una nrovisi6n para ia auditoria

categoria A. A nesar de nue el nrovecto fue prenarado muy tarde para incluir trabaios de prevenci6n,
calidad en la entrada es considerada satisfactoria.
2.     Logros de los Objetivos y Resultados.
2.1    Resultado/logro del objetivo:
El primer objetivo, reducir la perdida o el deterioro de la calidad de vida, no pudo ser un logro, porque gran
parte del dafio causado por "El Nino" ya habia ocurrido cuando la Parte B del proyecto se estableci6 en
Julio de 1998.
El segundo objetivo, prevenir dafios a las infraestructuras econ6micas y rehabilitar las estructuras
.... y-;-   -;so.ial dar.A. por i.undaciones en 1- a-. 1907!02 fue 1n,,.aAn en par,+a  1 ,,i.'nae lo
rehabilitaci6n. La reconstrucci6n de caminos y puentes y infraestructuras sociales fue emprendida en areas
dafiadas por inundaciones. Obras de prevenci6n de inundaciones fueron ;ievadas a cabo en Pilar. Ademas,
un programa de mitigaci6n fue emprendido para proveer albergue para futuras victimas en Asunci6n.
El tercer objetivo, fortalecer la habilidad de Paraguay para predecir y responder a futuros eventos, fue
logrado en parte.
2.2    Resultados por componentes:
Durante el primer afio del proyecto hubo retrasos por parte del gobiemo en efectividad e implementaci6n
del proyecto. (ver seccion 5.2)
Prevenci6n de la emergencia - Reconstrucci6n
Cuando el proyecto empez6 el fen6meno ya habia pasado, por lo que no fue posible emprender trabajos de
emergencias/prevenci6n. Por consiguiente, este componente se enfoc6 en la rehabilitaci6n v reconstrucci6n
de la infraestructura social, caminos y puentes y obras de prevenci6n de inundaciones de gran escala en

Construcciones de edificios de escuelas son de buena calidad, pero en muchos todavia faltan los medios
adecuados de facilidades sanitarias. En el caso de centros de salud, algunas aplicaciones han sido
cosmeticas cuando mejoras mas criticas asi como el suministro de agua hubiera sido importante.
Dieciseis coniuntos de caminos y puentes han sido 8randemente llevados a cabo y completadas para la
fecha tope. Esto incluy6 79 puentes y 78 Km de ruta. Muchos de los puentes han sido aumentados en

Obras de prevenci6n de inundaciones que nan costando $3.6 miiiones en Piiar envueiven con un gran dique
a la ciudad. Los trabajos fueron concluidos cerca del fin del periodo extendido del proyecto. El trabajo de
uno de los contratistas se retras6 a causa de inundaciones y construcciones de albergues ilegales en el sitio
y a retrasos en la firma de los certificados de pago por el cambio del Director de la UTEP. Parte del dique
alrededor de la ciudad fue disefiado por un periodo de 100 anios de inundaciones y parte para 50 anios, lo
que significa que seria necesaria una inversi6n adicional nara lograr el retorno total de la inversi6n hecha
bajo el proyecto. Este gran sub proyecto no fue sujeto a una evaluaci6n econ6mica.

Mitigaci6n.
Despues de algunos retrasos, se lograron convenios para preparar para el futuro campamentos temporales

una gran area de cemento capaz de acomodar 14 carpas, y cada una podrA acomodar aproximadamente 20
familias, aproximadamente un total de 250 familias. Aproximadamente 200 familias mas podrian ser
acomodadas en albergues provisionales en el area periferica. El sitio en la base militar tambien tiene
facilidades sanitarias y tiene suficiente espacio como para 1000 familias. Un tercer sitio estA siendo
desarrollado con la asistencia del BID (LADB) que estarA disponible para acomodar de 1000 a 1500
familias- En total- aproximadamente la mitad de las 5000 persanas deqnspq7%da nnr el i'iltimn eventn de "EP

Apovo Institucional
Para crear la capacidad del CEN de largo plazo para la respuesta al desastre, el proyecto ha financiado
asistencia tecnica y una sbhstAncial suma de equipamiento. La asistencia tecnica incl"lver mimma gestion
de desastres por funcionarios del CEN y oficiales de gobiernos regionales y locales. El equipamiento

municipalidades en areas propensas a desastres. Un sistema que supervision dei tiempo (medidas dei viento,
radar) se esta preparado en una universidad. Sistema de Informaci6n geogrAfica y equipamiento de disenio
han sido adquiridos para la Direcci6n del Servicio Geografico Militar; este equipamiento esta en uso.
Equipamiento adicional (muebles de oficina, computadoras, etc.) estA siendo proporcionadas por el IDB
como parte de restauraci6n de las oficinas del CEN. Equipamientos adicionales de oficina y medios para un
centro de direcci6n de crisis baio un nrestamo del IDB (ver secci6n 4=5)
2.   r,'a.'or Actual.-ado AlJeto /r Ta  de Reto .C o Econ.om.ico:
Dada la emergencia natural de ios trabajos que fueron enfocados en reconstrucci6n, no se caicuiaron tasas
de retorno econ6mico ex-ante para este proyecto. Esto fue inoportuno, ya que algunos de los trabajos de
reconstrucci6n de emergencia grandes fueron en realidad no urgentemente necesitadas este afio y no pudo
tener beneficios de escrutinios mayores. Por ejemplo, por el reciente cAlculo por la UTEP la gran
protecci6n de inundaciones en Pilar costando $3.6 millones lograran un IRR de solo 5.4%.
2.4    Tasa de retorno financiera:
Ninguna tasa de retorno financiera fue llamada para el proyecto revisado.
2.5    Impacto del Desarrollo Institucional:
El CEN, que ha existido desde 1993 con la responsabilidad de coordinar respuestas para los desastres
naturales, fue designado como el Ejecutor de la ejecuci6n del proyecto y como contraparte principal del
Banno y de!l MRB para laejecuciin.E!CN tenia poc-a experiPncia -on e! persnal antes de empen7r con e!

termino del periodo del proyecto, la UTEP fue reinsertada dentro del CEN para contribuir en algo al
desarrollo del CEN.
El CEN fue provisto de servicios de consultoria y equipamiento bajo el proyecto para prepararla para
supervisar y responder a desastres futuros. La asistencia de consultoria y entrenamiento fue financiada
para el CEN para fortalecer su capacidad para evaluar y dirigir emergencias y establecer sistemas de
infhrmaciAn geagiifica de emergencias. Equipamientn de comunicaciones v emergencias fueron tambien
provistos para el CEN bajo el proyecto (ver secci6n 4.2). Todo el equipamiento provisto bajo el proyecto

particuiarmente el equipo para la sala de manejo de crisis pensado para aitos mandos del gobiemo. Esta
iniciativa es ambiciosa, dar al CEN capacidad y visibilidad.
El CEN tiene un presupuesto anual equivalente a $500.000. Con este presupuesto podria pagar a su
personal permanente de 22 personas y a su personal contratado de 7 personas, quienes actualmente estan
siendo pagados baio nrovectos. Tiene suficientes recursos para asistir de 8 a 10 emergencias peauenias por

evento de "El Niflo". El CEN ha bosquejado un Plan Nacional para la Prevenci6n y Respuestas a los
Desastres. Esto crearia un Comite Nacional de  PrevencionilMvitigacion que consiste de 20 agencias
piublicas y privadas que habria de identificar y planear para medidas de prevenci6n/mitigaci6n. Tambien
crearia un Comite Nacional de Respuesta/Rehabilitaci6n consistente de seis agencias (fuerzas armadas,
policia, la cruz roja, etc.) y comites departamentales y locales para responder a desastres. El bosquejo del
plan fue sometido al Gobierno para la aprobaci6n pero no fue aprobado porque incluia un presupuesto de
aproximadarnente de $1.5 millones el cual el Gobierno no estaba dispuesto a financiar. El CEN esta

5.     Factores mayores que afectaron ia ejecuci6n y el resuitado.
5.1    Factoresfuera de control del gobierno o agencias de ejecuci6n:
El tiempo y severidad del dafio de la inundaci6n estaba fuera del control del gobiemo.
5.2    Factores generalmente sujetos al control gubernamental:
Inicialmente hubo un retraso de seis meses en la efectividad de la Parte B del proyecto debido a una falla
del Gobierno para cumplir con todas las condiciones de efectividad, inciuso la creacion y provision de
personal a la unidad del proyecto del CEN. Esto fue serio debido a la naturaleza de la emergencia del
proyecto. Las decisiones en licitaciones, especialmente para las obras, fueron lentas, algunas requerian la
firma del Presidente. Para puentes y caminos, los mayores componentes, los documentos de la licitaci6n
fueron modificados cerca de la fecha establecida pam entrega de propuestas, cuales resultaron en una
nuleva fecf-ha de licitacinni que retras6 el conien7.0 de este componente. Debido a una disputa; varios grandes
contratos debieron ser relicitados en los comienzos de 1999. Retrasos extensos fueron causados por

Esto llev6 de una disminuci6n de logros de los Objetivos de desarrollo y la ejecuci6n del Progreso a poco
satisfactorio durante la impiementacion. La vaiuacion solo fue cambiada despues que ios contratistas

estaban seleccionados en los comienzos del 2000. Tambien hubo retrasos durante la aplicaci6n del proyecto
debido al retraso del Gobiemo para cumplir con sus 15% de contrapartida en las obras. Durante la
ejecuci6n, cambios frecuentes en la direcci6n de la UTEP (cinco directores diferentes) tambien redujeron la
S.3    Factores generalmente sujetos a! control de ia agencia ejecutora:
El CEN se desarrollo lentamente como una agencia y la mayor parte de la direcci6n del proyecto fue
separada de 6l al separar la UTEP y hacerla responsable directamente al Ministerio del Interior. Por lo
tanto, durante la mayor parte del periodo del proyecto el CEN no pudo desarrollarse como una agencia
fuerte capaz de maneiar respuestas a desastres. La efectividad de la UTEP se reprimi6 por frecuentes
cambios de la direcci6n. En fin, cuando el CEN fue reubicado al mando del proyecto ya era capaz de
Crm.isp4tar la mno-.r^r v%a.e4 de!  pro tn ia mane ra satisfactrora
.4 CIosio y rinanciacion:
El costo total del proyecto aument6 de $17.80 millones estimados a la apreciaci6n, a $19.48 millones. Esto
era debido mayormente al aumento del costo de la defensa costera de la ciudad de Pilar y fue financiado
mayormente por el aument6 en la contribuci6n del gobiemo.
6.     Sustentabilidad
6.1    Reflexi6n sobre la clasificaci6n de la sustentabilidad:
Los trabajos de rehabilitaci6n de puentes, escuelas y centros de salud fueron emprendidos por sus
respectivos ministerios (Obras Nblicas, Educaci6n y Salud Pnblica) bajo la direcci6n global de ia UI'E'.
Ellos fueron juzgados de ser generalmente de buena calidad. Su mantenimiento es la responsabilidad de sus
respectivos ministerios. Las plataformas de refugio de las inundaciones creadas bajo el proyecto fueron de
buena calidad y bajo el control del CEN y a no ser usada para otros prop6sitos en esos momentos.

6l desempefie planamente su rol en la direcci6n de desastres en tiempo extra, pero un mayor presupuesto no
puede ser econ6mico.
El mantenimiento de la obra de protecci6n de inundaciones en Pilar, incluyendo varias estaciones de
bombeo. es incierto (ver secci6n 6.2). La municivalidad ha estado de acuerdo en ser responsable por la
operaci6n y el mantenimiento, pero su capacidad financiera para hacerlo no ha sido evaluada por el

6.2    Disposiciones transitorias a operaciones regulares:

fenomeno ya habia pasado. Sin embargo, dando sus rapidas y flexibles respuestas, ia funcion del Banco es
evaluada satisfactorias.
7.2    Supervisi6n:
Despues de la derisi6n de re estuItnrarelproyecto, hubo nueve misinnes de sunervisi6n del Rancro a
Paraguay, entre Marzo de 1998 y 2001. Estas misiones eran generalmente cortas, porque ellos estaban

Los Ingenieros predominaron y ningun analista financiero o economista estaban involucrados. La funci6n
del Banco es evaluada satisfactoria.
7.3    Desempeno global del Banco:
El Banco respondi6 rapidamente a un proyecto de emergencia preparando el proyecto. Ante la dificultad
politirca y la direrpniAn instituclionanlcnn la represiAn de la misiAn de vigilancia ern capaces de reon1ver los
problemas tecnicos, dificiles decisiones y mantener el proyecto en linea. La funci6n del Banco es evaluada
s a' trisa C t O L1a.
Prestatario
7.4    Preparaci6n:
El gobierno fue rapido en estar de acuerdo en la propuesta reestructuranda del proyecto existente, pero
len.to para culmplir con las condicinnes de Pfectiviad. Esto f_e critinco d2d2 la emergenri2 naqtrl de!
proyecto, y llev6 a retrasos en la ejecuci6n (ver secci6n 5.2). En general la preparaci6n es evaluada
msar-gmnamenLe saiisfactrio.
7.5    Funci6n de ejecuci6n gubernamental:
Hubo graves retrasos en el proyecto debido a la interferencia del gobiemo en el proceso de licitaci6n.
Cambios en el enfoaue de la direcci6n del proyecto del CEN a la UTEP y de vuelta al CEN llev6 a retrasos
en el proyecto y perdi6 oportunidades para que el CEN se desarrolle. El CEN no recibi6 soporte suficiente
de sucesvosgobier.nospardesaArollarse como na enf-etiva organiz7ci6n paproveer .respuestas a
desastres (ver secci6n 4.5). La disponibilidad de los fondos de contrapartida fue tambien restringida. El
desempeno del gobiemo es evaluada insatisfactoria.

7.6    Agencia de Implementacivn:
El CEN no se desai-rollo completw,ente para la r,,u efic respuesta a d        co.o estaba
originalmente previsto (ver secci6n 4.5). Para la mayoria del proyecto la UTEP qued6 para dirigir la
ejecucion dci proyecto separadamente dei CON. A pesar ae camoios frecuentes en ia direccion y retrasos, la
UTEP fue capaz de completar la mayoria de los componentes del proyecto. Casi todo el resto fue
completado cuando las responsabilidades de la ejecuci6n del proyecto se cambiaron al CEN. Las
capacidades del CEN para respuestas a emergencias tienen potencial para desarrollarse si el soporte
presupuestario continua. La responsabilidad de la agencia de implementaci6n se evalua marginalmente
satisfactoria.
7.7    Lafun:   global del
El proyecto se empezo rapidamente pero con retrasos iniciaies en efectividaa, consTrenimiento de ias
licitaciones, y cambios en la administraci6n retardaron el progreso en el proyecto. Sin embargo, casi todo
el programa de la inversion fisica ha sido implementado. El CEN ha mejorado su desempenlo, pero su
capacidad para responder a desastres permanece modesta. El desempefio global del prestatario es evaluado
marginalmente satisfactoria.
8.     Lecciones aprendidas
*      Donde se necesita del Banco una respuesta ripida a una emergencia, usar un prestamo existente es
probable que sea io mAs apropiado y el mecanismo eficaz para iograr ia respuesta rapida que se necesita.
*      Respondiendo rapidamente a las necesidades imnediatas de un proyecto de desastre, el gobierno no
deberia abandonar la oportunidad de construir capacidad para una prevenci6n continua de desastres y
capacidad de respuesta.
*      Despues que una emergencia haya pasado, trabajos de reconstrucci6n, particularmente esos que
envuelven i;nurersiones de grAn capital y requenrimienttos de oern_ciAn y direcriAn, Aahn"n ser
cuidadosamente valorados. Ellos deberian estar sujetos a tecnicas similares, econ6micas, analisis
