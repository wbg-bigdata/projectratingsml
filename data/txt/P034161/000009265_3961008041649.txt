MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL LOAN TO THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A FINANCIAL SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT'
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed supplemental loan to Nacional Financiera, S. N.C. (NAFIN), with
the guarantee of the United Mexican States for the equivalent of US$13 8 million.
It will supplement the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Loan (Loan 3838-
ME) to NAFIN increasing the Bank Loan from US$23.6 million to US$37.4
million equivalent. The proposed Supplemental Loan would be made on the same
repayment terms and conditions as Loan 3838-ME.
2.   The two primary objectives of the original project were to: (i) improve the
safety and soundness of the Mexican financial system through enhanced prudential
regulation and supervision; and (ii) support the development of the pension
system.  The negative reaction of financial markets immediately after the
December 1994 devaluation of the Peso hit an already weak banking system and
exacerbated the financial distress faced by Mexican banks. This required the
Government of Mexico (GOM) to develop a Financial Sector Restructuring
Program (FSRP) in close consultation with the Bank (see para 6). Successful
implementation of the FSRP will require an expansion of the assistance provided
under the Financial Technical Assistance Loan (FTAL) to supervisorv agencies
and Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP). Simultaneously, assistance
is urgently needed in new areas such as diagnostic studies of banks and
preparation of bank restructuring plans. The financial crisis has also highlighted
the need to undertake reforms to both increase and improve the allocation of
domestic savings. Thus, the GOM has established pension and contractual
savings reform as a key component of its National Development Plan. In this
context, it has become necessary to redefine the types of assistance to be provided
under the original National Commission of the Retirement Saving System
(CONSAR) subcomponent of LN 3838-ME (see para. 15). The proposed
supplemental loan is the most appropriate vehicle to assist the GOM in these two
priority areas of reform.
Background: Financial Technical Assistance Loan
3.   Project Objectives and Description. The US$23.6 million FTAL was
approved by the Board on January 24, 1995 and signed on March 9, 1995. Its
three interrelated objectives are: (a) to improve the safety and soundness of the
financial system through improved prudential regulation and supervision via
greater incentives for self-regulation by market participants; (b) to support the



-2-
development of the pension system; and (c) to strengthen public investment
evaluation and budgeting. The Project's two primary components consist of:
(a) a program of assistance to modernize financial sector regulation and improve
supervision that provides support to the National Banking and Securities
Commission (CNBV) which was created via the merger of the National Banking
Commission and National Securities Commission that became effective May 1,
1995, National Insurance and Bonding Commission (CNSF) and the CONSAR;
and (b) assistance to strengthen the public investment and budgeting procedures
and processes of SHCP.  The project activities include: hiring external
consultants to assist in the development of specific policies and regulations;
commissioning of related studies, financing participation in seminars, advanced
training programs, and other human resource development activities; secondment
of special long-term consultants to strengthen specific activities of the
Commissions; and procurement of the necessary software, hardware, and
equipment.
4.  Implementation Experience: The project is being executed by SHCP. The
implementation of the supervision and regulation component is being
undertaken by each Commission (CNBV, CNSF, and CONSAR). Separate
institutional development plans (IDPs) were established by the Commissions that
served as the basis for development of the technical assistance program. Thus
far, particular emphasis has been placed on providing urgently needed assistance
to: (i) establish appropriate principles and procedures for resolving troubled
banks; (ii) upgrade on-site inspection through secondment of a foreign examiner
to the CNBV for 6 months; and (iii) review or assist in preparation of regulations
in such areas as troubled debt restructuring guidelines, risk asset classification
guidelines, new regulatory accounting standards, and proposed capital adequacy
standards.   The public investment and budgeting component will be
implemented by the Unidad de Inversion within SHCP. Thus far, the GOM has
placed less emphasis on implementation of this component given the emergency
situation within the Mexican financial system. Overall project implementation is
going very well and is faster than originally foreseen in the case of the
supervision and regulation component. SHCP and the related Commissions are
very committed to the project and are in compliance with all major covenants.
5.   The FTAL is not yet effective.  The GOM  has been using its own
resources, but will ask for reimbursement upon effectiveness given the retroactive
financing available under the original FTAL. Although the original FTAL could
have been made effective shortly, it has been agreed that it be made effective at
the same time as the new supplemental loan (para 25, Agreements Reached).

Rationale for the Supplemental Loan
6.   Changing Country Economic Background. Facing rapid depletion of its
foreign reserves, Mexico was compelled on December 20, 1994 to abandon its
longstanding defense of the peso exchange rate. The subsequent negative reaction
of international financial markets placed further strain on Mexico's already weak
banking system.  In response to the crisis, the Government requested an
accelerated and expanded Bank program of financial support and technical
assistance to restructure the financial system. In February 1995, the Bank began
preparation of the Financial Sector Restructuring Loan (FSRL) to support the
Government's financial sector restructuring program to restore the solvency and
soundness of the financial system. The Government's program is described in the
Memorandum of the President for the FSRL (Report No. FSRL P-6616/ME).
The program is designed to: (i) restore the solvency and soundness of Mexico's
banking system, restructure banks, and improve confidence in the financial
system; (ii) reform the accounting standards and prudential regulations for banks,
and strengthen supervision to prevent future recurrence of systemic problems; (iii)
improve discipline in the provision of liquidity by the Banco de Mexico (Central
Bank); and (iv) initiate reforms in accounting practices and regulation of financial
groups and the deposit protection system.
7.   Due to the events in the Mexican financial sector described above, the
activities supported under the FTAL as approved in January 1995 now require
significant acceleration, expansion, and modification. The proposed FSRP will
require expanded technical assistance to support rapid government efforts. The
Supplemental Loan will also support the Government's objective to increase
growth rate and the efficiency of allocation of domestic savings through pension
and contractual savings reform.  Hence, the component of the project
implemented through CONSAR is being restructured and slightly enlarged to help
lay the foundation for a deeper reform of Mexico's three pillar pension system.
8.   The proposed supplemental loan is fully consistent with the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy and the FSRL (Report No. FSRL P-6616/ME) that will be
presented concurrently with this operation. This supplemental loan addresses two
of the most important priorities of the CAS--restoring the safety and soundness
of the banking system and helping to increase the growth rate and improve the
efficiency of allocation of domestic savings. In addition, the FTAL will serve as
an umbrella project to coordinate assistance provided by various bi-lateral donors
(e.g. supervisory agencies in other countries) in financial sector reform.
Description of the proposed Supplemental Loan
9.   Project Objectives. The proposed supplemental loan will pursue the first
two objectives of the FTAL as originally approved: (i) to improve the safety and



-4-
soundness of the financial system through improved prudential regulation and
supervision, and via greater incentives for self-regulation by market participants;
and (ii) to support the development of the pension system. Technical assistance
to support policy actions under the FSRL fall under the first objective and will
involve assistance to CNBV (para. 12). Assistance involving the development of
Mexico's pension system will be re-designed, but will still be provided to
CONSAR (para. 15). Finally, improvements in the public investment and
budgeting system and related support to the IEIU remain as project objectives.
10. Project Description. The supplemental loan would support expansion of
existing as well as new activities under the Financial Sector Regulation and
Supervision component of the existing FTAL. The modifications to the original
Project are fully described in Annex I. Cost estimates are provided in Schedule
A inclusive of new incremental financing required as well as funds released
through the restructuring of the components of Ln 3838-ME as originally
appraised. The Project Implementation Plan (Attachment I of Annex I) provides
information on the activities, expected output, forms of assistance, timing, and
how the technical assistance program assists the GOM to implement studies,
policies, or other actions under the FSRP.
11. The total estimated cost of additional activities under the modified FTAL
would be US$17.7 million, including US$13.8 million in Bank financing.
Coordinated assistance will be provided through the Secretarfa del Hacienda y
Cr6dito Piiblico (SHCP - Ministry of Finance and Public Credit) over a 3 year
period to the Comisi6n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV - National
Banking and Securities Commission) and the Comisi6n Nacional del Sistema de
Ahorro para el Retiro (CONSAR or National Commission of the Retirement
Savings System). The vast majority of this supplemental financing will support
assistance to CNBV to support important reforms under the FSRP. Supplemental
financing provided to CONSAR relative to originally programmed amounts will
be small, because this component has been redesigned to reallocate financing
previously provided for goods and services.
12. National Banking and Securities Commission. Additional assistance to
CNBV would be provided for related activities agreed under the FSRL:
*    Diagnostic Studies of Troubled Banks. The revised FTAL would support
the hiring of auditors to assist CNBV in conducting rapid, in-depth
assessments of bank capitalization, provisioning requirements and in some
cases assessing the viability of specific financial institutions.
*    Advisors for Restructuring of Troubled Banks. Assistance through
specialized consultants to select investment banks and legal advisors to
prepare and execute bank restructuring plans.



-5-
13. In addition, the supplemental loan would help CNBV to implement the
FSRP through assistance to: (i) accelerate the planned upgrading of the inspection
process for banks and non-bank affiliates within financial groups!'; (ii) examine
possible means to reduce the fiscal costs of the UDI (inflation-indexed units of
account) scheme and to improve inspection of the restructured assets placed in
UDI trusts; and (iii) improve the quality of financial information (already being
undertaken under the original FTAL) with additional measures including
upgrading appraisal standards and qualification criteria for new appraisers.
14. Finally the loan will help CNBV carry out several critical stuidies of the
legal and regulatory framework. These will include: (i) a study of remaining
impediments to securitization of bank and non-bank originated assets; (ii) a study
of the legal framework for secured transactions; (iii) examination of options to
streamline procedures for recognition of out-of-court corporate debt workouts and
arbitration awards; and (iv) a study and formulation of a plan to remove legal and
regulatory impediments (inclusive of tax) to voluntary corporate debt
restructuring.
15. National Retirement Savings System Commission. Assistance to CONSAR
would be restructured to lay the foundation for a more fundamental reform of the
contractual savings system. New actions would include support to: (i) establish
the regulatory framework for the private investment management of SAR
accounts; (ii) develop a consistent regulatory framework for voluntary
occupational plans offered by private sector and parastatal enterprises; (iii)
develop CONSAR's capacity to supervise and inspect the Retirement Saving
System (SAR) accounts; (iv) provide assistance to design a public communications
program in support of pension and contractual savings reform; and (v) develop
a program of human resource development and training in such areas as actuarial
techniques, finance, and supervision of pension funds. Finally, assistance to
conduct a joint study with the CNSF to develop a plan for development of
Mexico's annuity markets will still be undertaken as programmed under the
original FTAL.
16.  Project Costs and Financing. Additional costs of the activities supported
by the supplemental loan of US$17.7 million are fully described in Schedule A.
The Bank would provide US$ 13.8 million, approximately 75% of the total
financing, and the GOM  the remaining US$ 3.9 million.  Procurement
arrangements and the revised disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The project
1/ Financial groups are defined here to only include groups that have a commercial bank affiliate.



-6-
completion date would remain December 31, 1997 as under the original FTAL,
and the closing date would remain June 30, 1998.
17. Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. The design of this project draws
on lessons learned from the experience of the Bank in the delivery of technical
assistance around the world and in Mexico. Bank experience highlights the need
for (i) a high level of Government commitment essential for successful
implementation; (ii) well-defined Project objectives which accurately assess the
country's needs and absorptive capacity; and (iii) regular monitoring of Project
performance indicators and rigorous supervision offering substantive, issue-
oriented support. Based on these experiences, the modified Project contains a
limited number of components critical to reforms of the financial sector.
18. Project Sustainability. Following the economic turbulence which began in
late 1994, the Government has indicated a willingness to undertake an accelerated
and deepened program of reforms and restructuring in the financial sector. With
the Government's strong support, this technical assistance project would facilitate
the implementation of the FSRP and provide a solid basis for the future
operations of the regulatory and supervisory institutions involved.
19. Environmental Aspects. Category C. The project would have no adverse
environmental impact.
20.  Program  Objectives Categories.  The project supports private sector
development by promoting efficient allocation of domestic savings. The project
would also help strengthen Government agencies responsible for regulation and
supervision of the financial system.
21.  Project Benefits. The supplemental loan would support the implementation
of the FSRL, enhancing the sustainability and quality of financial sector
restructuring and reform. The modified Project would support the benefits
pursued under the FSRL, including: increased confidence in the financial system
through support of bank restructuring; early recognition of future problems
through enhanced disclosure requirements and greater transparency of regulatory
and accounting standards; and improvements in prudential regulation and
supervision and in the legal framework for financial transactions lea(ling to a
more efficient, sound, and stable financial system. In addition the supplemental
loan would have the benefit of increasing and making more efficient the allocation
of domestic savings through the redesign of the work programmed with the
CONSAR on pension reform.
22.  Project Risks.  Although the GOM has given every indicatiolm that the
Project will continue to receive strong support, several risk factors remain at this
time: (i) the possibility that the recommended reformns to improve commercial



-7-
bank and financial conglomerate supervision may be slowed due to political
considerations; (ii) the possibility that mandatory SAR contributions remain below
the level required for economic viability of the system despite the reforms
undertaken through the project; and (iii) non-implementation of proposals derived
from studies or inadequate follow-through in implementation of the program by
counterpart agencies.
23. The ad hoc Financial Sector Working Group led by the CNBV and
consisting of representatives of SHCP, CNSF, CONSAR, and the Central Bank
established by the Government to oversee implementation of the FSRP, would
facilitate and coordinate project activities. This Working Group would also serve
to mitigate the risks noted above related to implementation and follow -through of
the expanded technical assistance program. Due to the large number of complex
and sensitive issues involved in implementation of the revised Project, additional
resources for Project supervision would be provided.  These additional
supervision resources would serve to mitigate the risks identified above. In
addition, the close link between the technical assistance to be provided under the
revised FTAL and the FSRP will further offset the risks noted above.
Implementation of the Supplemental Loan
24. Institutional Arrangements. The arrangements for administration and
implementation of the revised FTAL remain essentially as under the original Loan
approved by the Board in January 1995. Arrangements for procurement and
disbursement, and maintenance and auditing of accounts remain unchanged from
the original project. The main modification proposed under the revised project
is due to the May 1, 1995 merger of the National Banking Commission (CNB)
and the National Securities Commission (CNV) to create the new National
Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV). All responsibilities under the
original FTAL assigned to the former two agencies have now been assumed by
the CNBV and loan and guarantee agreements would be amended accordingly.
There are no other changes in the actions agreed under the original FTAL.
25. Agreements Reached. Legal documents reflecting the changes in the project
description in paras 9-15, and the disbursement profile (Schedule Bi have been
agreed with NAFIN and SHCP. It was also agreed that documentation required
for effectiveness of the original FTAL (LN3838-ME) and for effectiveness of this
supplemental loan will be provided to the Bank at the same time.



-8-
Recommendation
26. I am satisfied that the proposed Supplemental Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

MEXICO
FINANCIAL SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
SUPPLEMENTAL LOAN
TECHNICAL ANNEX
1.    The Supplemental Loan would expand the assistance provided under the
Financial Sector Technical Assistance Loan (FTAL) in support of the
implementation of the Financial Sector Restructuring Loan (FSRL) presented to
the Board concurrently with this project (see Section A below). It will also
support activities relating to design and implementation of contractual savings
reform that have recently been established as an important component of the
Mexican national development plan (see Section B below). The original program
of activities to be financed under the FTAL as approved by the Board in January
1995 remains essentially intact and will not be presented again in this document.
The focus here is to provide further detail regarding the specific forms of new
and expanded assistance to be provided under the Supplemental Loan. Detailed
information on the objectives, activities, outputs, forms of assistance, timing and
relationship of each project element to the FSRP are in the Project
Implementation Plan (Attachment I).
Project Modifications and Description
A. National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV)
2.    The primary modifications to the FTAL relate to the need to finance
urgently needed assistance to implement the Government's Financial Sector
Restructuring Program (FSRP). Most of this assistance is focused on support to
the CNBV. In addition the support to be provided to the CONSAR will be
restructured to better meet the near term needs of this commission.
3.    Acceleration of Inspection Process. The current crisis and the measures
that the Government has introduced involving temporary capitalization and partial
regulatory forbearance (e.g. PROCAPTE) require that the capacity of the CNBV
to undertake inspections of Mexican commercial banks and financial groups be
rapidly upgraded. This component includes on-the-job training for examiners and



- 16 -
Annex I
Page 2 of 7
the modernization of regulatory and supervisory policies beyond wV at was
originally foreseen under the FTAL. Examiners from foreign agencies (including
the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Controller
of the Currency, and Federal Reserve Board) would provide training to CNBV
Examiners in the areas of asset quality assessment, insider and related party
transactions, transactions between affiliates of financial groups, detection of large
exposures, and consolidated supervision of financial groups. In addition, these
examiners would help the CNBV to upgrade inspection of securities activities
inclusive of brokerage house operations and off-balance sheet actix ities in
international operations for different entities within financial groups. Some
emphasis would also be placed on developing a methodology for the on-site
supervision of free standing auxiliary credit institutions not part of linancial
groups (e.g., leasing and factoring companies and credit unioni), and
development banks and trust funds.
4.    Diagnostic Studies of Troubled Banks. While the CNBV has greatly
improved the information available about the financial condition of banks through
on-site inspections, the financial crisis has made necessary very rapid and in-depth
assessments of bank capitalization and provisioning requirements. While the
FSRP has established a time frame for the diagnostic studies of troubled banks
(see the attached Implementation Plan), the aim of this component will be to
support the CNBV's efforts by financing assistance provided by international
auditing firms retained by the Commission. In the case of some PROCAPTE
banks the auditing firms would undertake an extensive diagnostic that could
include evaluation or verification of: accounting policies and procedures; internal
control and compliance processes; credit risk management processes and
practices; asset quality and concentration of risks; adequacy of loss resernes; title
or valuation of fixed assets; capital adequacy; market risk management; quality
of earnings; liquidity management; and role, capacity and systems of the treasury
to serve the banks' needs. This diagnostic could also include a listing of explicit
adjustments to the financial and income statements.
5.    By contrast in the case of some banks auditing firms would assist CNBV
to rapidly prepare restructuring plans in coordination with investment and legal
advisors (para. 6). In this case the terms of reference for the diagnostic study
may not be as detailed and will focus attention on the structuring of a business
plan for the bank and upon gathering information to support investment bank
analysis of restructuring options. The auditing firm's involvement and total costs
will depend on the extent of the investigation required for each bank.
6.    Selection of Advisors: Restructuring of Troubled Banks. The Govermnent
strategy for restructuring troubled banks aims to minimize the overall fiscal cost



- 17 -
Annex I
Page 3 of 7
while creating an attractive environment for domestic and foreign investors to
contribute to the capitalization of banks. The options for bank restructuring
include: (i) closure and liquidation of banks identified as fundamentally non-
viable; (ii) properly structured mergers of banks to enhance operating efficiency
and competition in the provision of financial services; and (iii)
organizational/managerial restructuring and sale of troubled but potentially viable
banks. To this end, the revised FTAL would provide financing for a consultant
to assist an informal committee1' to select specialized consultants or investment
banks and legal advisors to prepare and execute bank restructuring plans.
7.    Ouality of Financial Information. Financial statements for Mexican banks
are prepared in accordance with CNBV guidelines, which differ significantly from
U.lS GAAP in, inter alia, the treatment of loan loss provisions, accrual of interest
income on past due loans and on rescheduled debts, investment in subsidiaries and
affiliates, repurchase agreements, revaluation of fixed assets and disclosure
requirements. The CNBV has prepared draft regulatory accounting principles that
reconcile Mexican and U.S. GAAP. With the additional assistance under the
supplemental loan, this reconciliation will be undertaken for all non-banking
fmancial entities that are affiliates of financial groups. Additional assistance will
be provided by specialized external consultants that will submit their
recommendations for upgrading the existing appraisal standards used by the
Association of Mexican Appraisers and CNBV inspectors. Special emphasis will
be given to the improvement of real estate, appraisal methodologies and the
qualification criteria for registering appraisers.
8.    Analysis of UDI Scheme and Inspection of UDI Trusts. The Government
has introduced a number of Support Programs (Programas de Apoyo) to permit
the restructuring of bank loans to corporations, mortgage borrowers, and state and
municipal governments2' using the UDI (real unit of account)."'  The
supplemental loan would support an analysis and review of the fiscal costs of the
Support Programs during the period of implementation. Assistance is currently
being provided under the original FTAL to design new guidelines for troubled
' The GOM has established an informal Selection Committee with
representatives of CNBV, FOBAPROA, and Hacienda.
-'This only applies to financial groups that include a commercial bank as
part of their group.
1'For a detailed description of the UDI program, see Annex X,
Memorandum of the President for the Financial Sector Restructuring Loan
(Report No. FSRL P-6616/ME).

Annex I
Page 4 of 7
debt restructuring. Recommendations will be made for specific changes in the
design of the regulations governing the different Support Programs as a result of
this review.
9.    This component will also provide financing to train a special group of
inspectors that will conduct special inspections of the restructured assets in the
UDI trusts established by privatized or newly chartered Mexican banks. This will
involve secondment of a specific external consultant to the CNBV for six months
to implement the methodology and inspection processes in coordination with the
assistance provided to accelerate inspections (see para. 4 above).
10.   Facilitate Corporate and Other Debt Restructuring.   The Mexican
legal/regulatory framework for corporate workouts is not conducive to efficient
restructurings of troubled enterprises. Bank regulatory provisions limit the
options available for restructuring. Legal, notarial, re-registration and other costs
can be quite high. Enforcement of agreements is often time consuming and
costly. The Mexican Bankers Association has established a committee to develop
initiatives for removing obstacles to restructuring and is developing an arbitration
procedure for resolving disputes among creditors. Recognizing that legal and
regulatory changes are necessary to facilitate re-organization of troubled
enterprises, the Government will conduct a study of existing obstacles to
voluntary debt restructuring and formulate a framework for quicker recognition
of out-of-court workouts and arbitration awards.
11.   Securitization of Bank and Non-bank Originated Assets. This module will
build upon assistance already available under the original FTAL. External
consultants will review changes already introduced, examine the remaining legal
and regulatory impediments, and propose possible legal and regulatory changes
to allow securitization of bank and non-bank originated assets. This work will be
closely coordinated between the CNBV, SHCP, and the Central Bank.
12.   Secured Transactions. The lack of a comprehensive legal framework for
lending secured by movable goods distorts credit allocation and limits credit
available to small and medium enterprises. The existing laws and the conditions
of the public registries make lending against many types of movable property
legally or practically impossible. In response to this situation, the Government
will undertake a study of how to modify the regulations and legislation relating
to secured lending.

Annex I
Page 5 of 7
B. National Retirement Savings System Commission
13.   The Mexican National Development Plan now under preparation identifies
contractual savings and social security reform as an important priority. Such
reforms will support the GOM objective of both gradually increasing the rate of
domestic savings and the efficiency of its allocation across investments. In light
of these developments the GOM and the Bank have agreed to restructure the
original CONSAR component of the FTAL. The new items to be financed form
a consistent package that will support the development of the CONSAR and
proper definition of the regulatory framework. These actions win be critical if
augmenting the size of SAR accounts is not to entail significant risks once private
investment management is allowed.
14.    Regulatory Framework for SAR Accounts. A broader effort to reform
the contractual savings system will have to involve making the SAR operational.
To this end, an explicit regulatory framework needs to be developed to allow for
private investment management of SAR accounts in a competitive environment.
Thus the supplementary loan will provide financing for external consultants to
both review draft regulations and to work with staff of the CONSAR to prepare
new circulars and regulations. More specifically some of the most important
assistance activities will include: (i) authorization guidelines to either provide
investment management services or investment advice; (ii) design of investment
regulations inclusive of guidelines for diversification, asset risk classification, and
risk concentration; (iii) regulations relating to the structure and level of
commissions for investment management, account administration, and other
pension related services; (iv) regulations relating to conflicts and proper
management of own and third-party accounts; and (v) regulatory reporting and
financial and non-financial public disclosures required of such entities as
investment management companies and investment advisors.
15.   Regulatory Framework for Occupational Pension Plans. Besides reforming
the regulatory framework relating to the SAR accounts there is a need to
harmonize regulation and supervision of Mexico's voluntary occupational
retirement plans offered both by private companies and large parastatal
companies. Parastatals such as PEMEX, CFE, Ferrocarriles, Telmex, IMSS and
the military funds (e.g. for the navy) are underfunded and have large actuarial
deficits. Assistance will be provided to develop and implement a regulatory
framework in respect to actuarial and non-actuarial disclosures that is consistent
with that implemented for the SAR investment accounts. It will also support
efforts to segregate pension accounts and management services from general
corporate accounts and develop guidelines for external actuarial audits of these
plans.



- 20 -
Annex I
Page 6 of 7
16.   Supervision of SAR Accounts. A critical precondition for any major
expansion in the size of SAR accounts associated with pension reforn will be
adequate supervision. Thus, assistance taking the form of external consultants
and specialized external training will be combined to enable the CONSAR to: (i)
rapidly upgrade on-site inspections and offsight surveillance of SAR accounts; (ii)
develop permanent training programs and related supervision manuals; (iii) design
specialized software with the CNBV to detect trading irregularities linked to
investment management of SAR accounts; and (iv) evaluate joint CNBV and
CONSAR efforts to develop a real time system for evaluating the value of
investment portfolios of SAR account investment managers.
17.   Communication Campaign to Support Contractual Savings Reform. In
many countries the complexity of pension reforms can make it difficult to clearly
present options in simple terms that are clearly understandable to different
affected interest groups. Thus, financing will be provided to assist the GOM in
the design of a communications campaign to support specific aspects of the
pension and contractual savings reform. This will be extremely important in light
of the recent Mexican government announcement that legislation reforming the
social security system will be forthcoming in the future.
18. Human Resource Development. The recent establishment of the CONSAR
coupled with the growing role it will play as contributions to these accounts
increase requires exceptional efforts to rapidly build its human capital. This part
of the program will support specialized training abroad as well as use of external
consultants to provide training in techniques of supervision, actuarial modelling
experience in pension or investment management supervision in other countries,
and advice on proper actuarial disclosures to be required for SAR accounts.
Efforts will be made to institutionalize these training programs. The CONSAR
like other Commissions under the original FTAL will have to submit in explicit
training plan to the Bank.4'
Project Administration and Implementation
19.   The arrangements for administration and implementation of the revised
FTAL remain essentially as under the original Loan approved by the Board in
January 1995. Arrangements for procurement and disbursement, and maintenance
and auditing of accounts remain unchanged from the original project. The main
modification proposed in project administration is due to the May 1, 1995 merger

of the National Banking Commission (CNB) and the National Securities

original FTAL assigned to the former two agencies have now been assumed by
the CNBV.
