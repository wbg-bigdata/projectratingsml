MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE RECIFE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Federative Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of US$102.0 million to help finance the Recife
Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project in the State of Pernambuco. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, and a grace period of five years with
loan amortization based on level repayments of principal.
Background
2.    Covering 2,200 km2, the Recife Metropolitan Region (RMR) has 2.8 million inhabitants spread
over 13 municipalities and is dominated by the 1.4 million people of the Recife Municipality. The RMR is
considered the forth most important economic region of the country and generates roughly 55 percent of
the Gross Domestic Product in the State of Pemambuco. Each day 2.3 million person-trips take place in
the RMR of which 59 percent are by bus, 34 percent by private automobile, 5 percent by metropolitan
rail, 1 percent by suburban rail, and the remaining 1 percent by trolleybus. During rush hour, most
arterial roads are clogged with bumper to bumper buses. Even in the segregated busways the average
speed of buses is 23 km/hr and a scant 14 km/hr in the central business district. In the Municipality of
Recife, the number of road accidents increased by 16 percent from 1991 to 1993 with an estimated 6.6
deaths/i 0,000 vehicles, which shows that improved traffic safety and control are an urgent priority for the
RMR.
3.    Low-income households are the main users of public transport and bear the brunt of its
problems.  During rush hour, capacity shortages result in overcrowding, with often more than 12
passengers per square meter. Home-to-work journeys of greater than 2.5 hours with two or more modal
transfers are common. Many users pay over a fifth of their income in transport fares. The air quality of
Recife has deteriorated due to increasing levels of carbon monoxide and particulate matter (mainly
smoke and dust). To address these problems, the State transit authorities in conjunction with the Federal
Government's Brazilian Urban Trains Company (CBTU) have prepared studies which show that by
extending the metropolitan rail system (popularly called METROREC) by 4.5 km, converting the
suburban rail system (South Line) from diesel to electric power and linking it to the METROREC, adding
more stations to the rail system, and better integrating it with the bus system, traffic congestion would
decrease significantly and the quality of service would improve for transit users.
4.     The METROREC consists of a 20.5-km line inaugurated in 1984 and operated by the Recife
subdivision of CBTU. It serves an average of 105,000 passengers a day instead of the 300,000
originally envisaged. The principal reason for the low ridership is that METROREC lacks sufficient bus
transfer terminals. The suburban rail system (South Line) consists of a 32-km line in a high-demand
area, yet serves only 20,000 passengers a day. This is because the South Line is unreliable, infrequent,
dilapidated, does not go into the central business district, and has no connection to the METROREC. As
it stands today, METROREC and the South Line do little to alleviate the heavy traffic congestion in the
RMR and are a financial burden on the Federal Government, which contributes about US$39 million
annually to keep them afloat, since revenues cover only 11 percent of the operating costs (without
depreciation).
5.    Lack of coordination among federal, state and municipal transport authorities has resulted in
poor modal and tariff integration, a lack of shared investment priorities in urban transport, and no
common policies on pricing and subsidies. In 1979, the Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos
(EMTU) was established to coordinate transport integration, financing and subsidies in the RMR on
behalf of the municipalities and the State. While EMTU has improved transport sector coordination, the



strengthening of EMTU's institutional capacity to define common policies on pricing, regulation, financing
and investments would enable more effective modal integration in the RMR. Further, CBTU is in the
process of decentralizing responsibility for its metropolitan rail systems to the States and Municipalities in
which they are located. This decentralization process was mandated by the 1988 Constitution and has
thus far resulted in the transfer of over US$2 billion in assets from the Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro
subdivisions of CBTU to the respective states. CBTU's decentralization is being supported by ongoing
Bank loans (Lns. 3457-BR and 3633-BR, respectively) which are financing the rehabilitation and modal
integration of the systems in S3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The transfers of these systems to the States
have been completed and both loans are disbursing at a satisfactory rate.
Project Objectives
6.     The objectives of the proposed project are: (a) the development of an integrated urban
transport system for the RMR under the existing regional transport coordination commission (EMTU) that
would be in charge of coordinating and recommending common policies on pricing, regulation, financing
and investments; (b) the decentralization (transfer of ownership and operation responsibilities) of the
Recife subdivision of CBTU (METROREC and South Line) from the Federal to the State level; (c) a
reduction in the negative environmental and safety impacts (mainly pollution and accidents) of road
vehicles in the RMR and the promotion of non-motorized transport modes; and (d) the development of
targeted strategies and actions to improve the accessibility of the low-income population to employment
centers as well as health and education facilities.
Project Description
7.    The project would consist of three inter-related components:  (a) an Infrastructure and
Equipment component to help build the rail extension and conversions of the existing systems, and the
additional stations, transfer terminals, and physical accesses required for the integration of buses, rail,
pedestrians, automobiles and bicycles (US$199.8 million equivalent or 98.1 percent of total project cost);
(b) an Environmental and Traffic Safety component to support: (i) the design of an inspection and
maintenance program for the control of vehicle emissions and noise; and (ii) a traffic management and
safety program (US$0.4 million equivalent or 0.2 percent of total project cost); and (c) an Institutional
and Policy Development component to help in: (i) strengthening the EMTU and introducing sound
cost-recovery, tariff, regulatory and subsidy policies; (ii) preparing an integrated urban transport, land
use, and air quality management strategy for the RMR to meet transport and air quality goals; (iii)
developing an action plan to improve financial management in the sector; and (iv) developing an
enabling environment and financial instruments for participation of the private sector in METROREC and
the South Line (US$3.6 million or 1.7 percent of total project cost).
Project Implementation
8.     Overall project implementation would be the responsibility of a Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) within CBTU assisted by State transport authorities. The Pernambuco State Environmental
Agency (CPRH) would assist with the implementation of the vehicle inspection and maintenance
program, and the Pernambuco State Transit Department would assist with the implementation of the
traffic management and safety program. The PIU's staff would include a Project Coordinator in charge of
the unit, a transport economist and policy studies coordinator to oversee the execution of all the studies
and the economic aspects of the proposed project, an information management specialist responsible for
project monitoring and reporting, a procurement specialist familiar with Bank procedures, and a
resettlement specialist.

Project Sustainability
9.     One of the primary goals of the proposed project is to establish long-term financial mechanisms
and an institutional framework which would ensure not only project sustainability, but also the financial
sustainability of the RMR urban transport system. The State of Pernambuco has agreed to strengthen the
institutional capacity and sustainability of EMTU by improving its institutional framework and introducing
financial mechanisms (including private sector participation) to achieve financial sustainability.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement
10.    The design of this project incorporates the lessons learned from the experience of previous
urban transport projects. The main lessons are: (a) coordination among the three levels of government
in urban transport should be dealt with carefully during project preparation and be reviewed in detail at
the Mid-Term Project Review; (b) policy for the sector should be strengthened to minimize distortions
resulting from inefficient physical and financial coordination between modes and to promote multi-modal
integration; (c) tariff levels should allow for significant recovery of working costs and should be
complemented by financing mechanisms to cover the shortfall: (d) forecasts of demand are often
overestimated and should therefore be carefully scrutinized; (e) availability of counterpart funds must be
assured to avoid costly construction delays; and (f) the actual decentralization process for urban rail
systems to the states and municipalities takes longer than foreseen and should be advanced as much as
possible during project preparation.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
11.   The Bank's current Country Assistance Strategy for Brazil, discussed by the Board on June 29,
1993, and the new Country Assistance Strategy (expected to be presented to the Board on June 29.
1995) both support policies and investments that will encourage economic growth and social
development in a context of macroeconomic stability. The emphasis is on efficient resource allocation,
increased efficiency in the public sector, and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to
the poor. The proposed project is fully consistent with this assistance strategy since it is designed to: (a)
promote reform and financial sustainability of public enterprises, including decentralization from Federal
to State and Municipal levels; (b) foster private sector participation in the development of new
infrastructure and its operation; (c) increase the efficiency of infrastructure investments; (d) contribute to
poverty alleviation; and (e) reduce government subsidies through improved tariff policies and financial
management. The proposed project is part of a systematic Bank-supported program initiated with the
S5o Paulo Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3457-BR) and the Rio de Janeiro
Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3633-BR) to decentralize the federally-owned CBTU
to state and municipal authorities in an effort to reduce subsidies, improve operational and financial
performance, and encourage more effective modal and tariff integration in the provision of urban
transport services.
Agreed Actions
12.    The principal agreed actions are: (a) making EMTU transport coordination more effective by
including all transport modes under its purview not later than one year after Loan effectiveness; (b)
encouraging private sector participation by having the State of Pernambuco offer to the private sector at
least four invitations to bid on investments or operating activities not later than one year after the Recife
subdivision of CBTU have been decentralized; (c) implementing a mix of cost-based tariffs and targeted
subsidies to improve sector financial sustainability and ensure urban transport affordability for low-
income users (performance targets addressing this issue have been included as loan covenants); (d)
introducing adequate and predictable urban transport funding mechanisms and allocation rules to ensure
timely payment of operating subsidies and counterpart funds for investments (a study to recommend
financing mechanisms will be undertaken no later than the Mid-Term Project Review); and (e)
guaranteeing a phased implementation of the action plans derived from an integrated urban transport,
land use, and air quality strategy; the State of Pemambuco will submit such plans no later than one year



- 4 -
after Loan signing and put them into practice no later than one month after the opening of each link or
new railway station. The conditions of Loan disbursement are: (a) the approval by the State of
Pernambuco authorities of the environmental assessment, the resettlement reports, and the construction
license for the South Line; and (b) the approval by the State of Pemambuco authorities of the
environmental assessment, the resettlement reports. and the construction license for the METROREC
extension.
Environmental Aspects
13.   The proposed project is classified as category B. A full Environmental Assessment was
prepared in accordance with Brazilian law and is available in the project files. The rail extensions would
involve the resettlement of an estimated 433 households, 49 small shops, and 13 industrial
establishments. Of the 433 residential properties to be expropriated, 157 are middle-to-low income
houses, and 275 are very low-income (favela) houses. The total affected population is estimated to be
under 1,980. Over the past 20 years, CBTU has carried out over 5,000 expropriations by offering
purchase prices based on the market values of the properties. In 70 percent of these, the proposed
purchase price was accepted. The adequacy of compensation at market value is well established as
evidenced by follow-up studies of how those displaced by the existing METROREC line were relocated.
With favela houses, the practice adopted is either to resettle the affected population to houses which are
equal to or better than the ones expropriated-preferably to sites which are close to the existing
properties-or to offer a financial compensation for those families who prefer to receive money instead
of being relocated. In the case of low-income families, CBTU also provides assistance in finding
replacement housing, logistical support for moving, legal support to regularize property titles, relocation
grants, and other services. The total amount for resettlement and expropriation is estimated at US$8.9
million. This amount is included in the project costs and would be fully financed by the Federal
Government. A resettlement plan was reviewed and approved by the Bank, and resources were
allocated in the project costs to monitor the implementation progress of the resettlement plan.
14.   Motor-vehicle generated air pollution in RMR has a major impact on public health. Benefits due
to its abatement include decreased incidence of illness and premature death due to respiratory and
cardiovascular illness, and improvements in the overall well-being and quality of life of the population.
Noise pollution generated by buses and automobiles would also decrease due to the diversion of
commuters to rail-based electrified systems. During construction of the METROREC and the South Line
extension and terminal accesses, it is expected that the surrounding areas would be affected due to
street closure and excavation. Those impacts would be minimized through traffic schemes which would
reroute traffic to other roads and by appropriate arrangements for disposal of waste during construction.
Overall, the project's environmental impact on traffic congestion, overcrowding of buses, and accidents
is expected to be positive.
Program Objective and Poverty Categories
15.   The project would make the Recife urban transport system more environmentally sustainable by
encouraging transport users to switch from road-based to rail-based transport. Further, with a reduction
in motor-vehicle emissions and the implementation of traffic safety measures, the health and well-being
of the urban population would improve. The project will also enhance the financial sustainability of the
urban transport subsector by introducing stable financing mechanisms for the urban transport systems in
the RMR. Finally, it will contribute to the improvement of quality of life of the very low-income
populations by facilitating their access to employment, health centers, and education facilities.
Participatory Approach
16.   CBTU and the State of Pernambuco are committed to the project, as evidenced by their active
participation in project preparation and appraisal. The Municipality of Recife, although not a direct
stakeholder, has confirmed to Bank missions its full support of the proposed project and has actively
participated in the program, particularly in the review and preparation of the resettlement plan.

Project Benefits
17.   Benefits expected from the integration of rail and bus networks include operational and
investment cost savings, time savings for the users, fewer accidents and fatalities, and employment
generation through better spatial integration of markets and places of work with residential areas. In
addition, there would be a positive environmental impact through reduction of fuel consumption, motor
vehicle-related emissions, and road congestion with a consequent improvement in air quality and noise
pollution. Reductions in road accidents are also expected given the traffic safety measures proposed.
Further, the project would facilitate access to employment and services, particularly for the poor.
Important non-quantifiable benefits include the development of an integrated public transport system
under a regional coordination body in charge of integrating pricing and subsidy policies, prioritizing major
investments, and proposing common demand management measures in the RMR. Finally, by
encouraging greater private sector participation, the proposed project would be a first step toward
decreasing the investment burden on the State. An economic evaluation of the project shows an internal
economic rate of return of 28 percent for the infrastructure and equipment component, which represents
98 percent of the total project cost. On the financial side, annual subsidy requirements are expected to
fall from US$39 million in 1994 to US$3 million in 2001 under the proposed project.
Risks
18.   The main risks involved are the political reluctance to introduce unpopular regulatory and air
pollution policies, possible delays in the procurement process, possible delays in the transfer of
METROREC and the South Line to the State, and the timely availability of counterpart funds.
Negotiations between the Federal Government and the State are well advanced, and a letter of
agreement for the transfer of METROREC and the South Line (ConvOnio Basico) was recently signed.
The State of Pernambuco and the Recife Municipality have also signed an agreement for modal and
tariff coordination. All parties have agreed on the need for an integrated project, but there are risks
associated with a government reluctance to relinquish powers to the EMTU. At this stage, there is strong
commitment to the environmental and safety program from the governments involved. The delays in the
procurement process have been minimized by the adoption of standard bidding documents, by starting at
pre-appraisal the pre-qualification for lots in the critical path of project implementation, and by having
required the Borrower to produce by appraisal the major tender documents for the first year of the
project. The timely availability of counterpart funds would be addressed by seeking assurances that
funds are included in the Federal Government's CY96 budget provisions for the operating agencies
involved. This was already done for the calendar year ending December 1995.
Recommendation
19.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
