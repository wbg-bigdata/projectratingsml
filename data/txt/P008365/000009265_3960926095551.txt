MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOR THE SOUTHERN CONVEYOR PROJECT FOR WATER
RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT (PHASE II)
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed investment
loan to the Republic of Cyprus for US$30 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 15 years, including 3 years
of grace, at the standard variable interest rate. It would help finance the
second phase of the Southern Conveyor Project for Water Resources Development,
designed for irrigation development and domestic water supply. The Government
of Cyprus would be the Borrower. The project would be cofinanced by the
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development for about US$15.4,million equivalent.
2.       Background.  The Government of Cyprus has placed water resources
development among its highest priorities. Most water resources in the country
have already been developed and many aquifers are overpumped. Prospects of
further development are limited. Shortage of water for domestic water supply
and irrigation use is mov!ng steadily closer to the danger point, with the
major cities of Nicosia and Larnaca already experiencing acute shortages, and
another major city, Limassol, as well as the area of Famagusta expected to
face a severe problem in the next few years. Tourist development along the
coast is also increasingly constrained on this account. As to irrigation,
depleted groundwater resources threaten highly profitable export production in
a major production area (Kokkinokhoria). It was to meet this urgent need to
provide additional water that the Bank approved a loan of US$27 million in
March 1984 for the financing of the first phase of the Southern Conveyor
Project (SCPI) (Ln. 2386-CY). The physical implementation of SCPI has been
satisfactory. and most project components are expected to be completed on
schedule or erlier.
3.       SCP Objiectives and Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The main SCP
objectives are: (i) to secure a reliable source of domestic water supply to
meet the needs of four major population areas (Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca and
A         Famagusta) and nearby villages at least to the year 2000; (ii) to provide
irrigation water in order to maintain present agriculture production in
9,125 ha in Kokkinokhoria, and to expand irrigated agriculture in four other
areas along the southern coast of the island, totaling about 4,300 ha; and
(iii) to implement policies and take institutional measures in order to
improve overall cost recovery through increased revenues and to further
enhance the efficient use of both domestic and irrigation water through an
integrated institutional framework to ensure the efficient use of water
resources. The proposed Phase II (SCPII) would complement the iTvestments
made under SCPI in order to fully achieve the overall objectives. The cost of
the project is very large relative to the country's economy, and Bank
participation in its funding will be catalytic in attracting cofinancing and
enhance the chances for the establishment of awz integrated institutional
framework for the efficient planning and management of the country's water
resources.

4.       Project Description.  The proposed SCPII would supplement the SCPI
through the following components: (i) water resources development, consisting
of the construction of the Dhiarizos diversion, conveying additional water
into the Kouris reservoir by means of a 14.5 km long tunnel; (ii) irrigation
development on 4,335 ha; (iii) on-farm development (irrigation systems, fruit
trees and greenhouses supported through medium-term credit); (iv) domestic
water supply, consisting of the Limassol and Tersephanou water treatment
plants, the Tersephanou-Nicosia water main and about 20 rural water supply
schemes; (v) provision of operr.ion and maintenance equipment; and
(vi) technical services for detailed SCP system operation studies, aquifer
management and recharge studies, sewage water reuse studies, data processing
for operation and maintenance, computerized customer billing and collection,
and training. The project, to be carried out over seven years, provides funds
for civil works, vehicles and equipment, consultants and study tours. The
total cost of SCPII is estimated at US$164.0 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$90.3 million (55%). A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The Government of Cyprus has
negotiated a loan with the Kuwait Fund for KD 4.3 million (about US$15.4
million equivalent). In addition, suppliers' credit is being sought for
irrigation equipment, the water treatment plants and the importation of pipes
for the Tersephanou-Nicosia conveyor. Amounts and methods of procurement and
of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Cyprus are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map of
the principal features of the project is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 6649-CY) dated January 21, 1988, is being distributed separately.
5.       Agreed Actions.  The Government of Cyprus has agreed on the following
main actions. (i) completing by June 30, 1989, the study for the establishment
of a water entity; exchanging views with the Bank on the study's findings; and
taking all measures to establish the water entity or undertake alternative
institutional reform; (ii) recovering 38% of the weighted average unit cost of
SCP and non-SCP irrigation water by March 31, 1990; (iii) maintaining bulk
water tariffs for domestic water supply at a level covering, inter alia, full
operation and maintenance costs, working capital requirements and debt
service; (iv) reviewing annually irrigation water charges and bulk and retail
tariffs for domestic water supply in accordance with agreed criteria and their
adjustment for inflation and shortfall or surplus in required revenue in the
previous year; (v) taking measures to ensure payment of irrigation and
domestic water bills within 90 days of their issuance; (vi) providing the
Water Development Department (WDD) with a Financial Manager by July 1988;
(vii) project implementation according to an agreed action plan;
(viii) assigning staff and recruiting short term consultants in accordance
with the Bank Guidelines to carry out the project studies; (ix) retaining
panels of experts to inspect the construction of the Dhiarizos tunnel and
assist with the system operation studies; and (x) preparation and
implementation of a management plan for the maintenance or improvement of the
ecology in the Akrotiri Salt Lake and Phasouri marsh.



6.       Justification.  The project ensures vital drinking water supplies to
the majority of Cyprus' population, and provides irrigation water to areas
currently dependent upon rapidly shrinking groundwater resources. Project
benefits are mostly due to tne sale of domestic water (50Q) and potato exports
(322), which are relatively risk-free enterprises; the balance (182) is on
account of fruit and vegetable production and exports. The project has a 142
overall economic rate of return, which is relatively insensitive to cost
increases, benefit reductions and delays.
7.       Risks.  Cyprus might experience some initial difficulties in
increasing vegetable exports; however, the sector has demonstrated that it can
adjust quickly and substitute other crops, like citrus or potatoes, for which
well-established marketing channels and markets exist.  The main risk
associated with project implementation and costs wo'ld concern unanticipated
geological conditions in the construction of the Dhiarizos diversion tunnel.
However, any cost overruns and time delays in this component would only have a
minor impact on the economic viability of the project.
Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
