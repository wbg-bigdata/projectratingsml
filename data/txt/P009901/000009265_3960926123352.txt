MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
INDIA
FOR THE SECOND KARNATAKA POWFR PROJECT
1.      I submit, for your approval, a proposal for a loan to India
equivalent to US$260 million.  The proposed loan, to be issued at the
standard IBRD variable interest rate, will be repayable over 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period. The loan will help to finatce a project
designed to alleviate power shortages, reduce energy losses, and improve
operational efficiency in the power system of Karnataka, a state in southern
India.
2.      Background.  The supply of power in Karnataka depends primarily on
the development of local hydroelectric resources. Potentially exploitable
resources in the State are sizable and economically attractive. However,
lengthy project preparation, primarily caused by the need to obtain
environmental clearances, has left the State with chronic power shortages.
The Karnataka Electricity Board (KEB) has tried to cope with the shortages by
imposing restrictions on the use of electricity by its large consumers. The
level of these restrictions has been increasing so that large consumers now
are allowed to use only 40% of their contracted demand and 80% of their
historical energy consumption. Industries have reacted to these restrictions
by installing their own generatinj capacity, usually in the form of diesel
generators. Although industries should be permitted to invest in captive
plants as a second best solution, the use of diesel -- a high value imported
fuel - is An expensive way to meet the State's power requirements. It
therefore is vital that the State's low cost hydroelectric resources be
developed at an accelerated pace in order to meet the power demand. The
Sharavathi Tailrace scheme (STRS) is particularly attractive since it
benefits from the regulation provided by upstream reservoirs and involves
no resettlement and minimal submergence of forest land.
3.      Karnataka is a large state with an area of 191,800 square kilometers.
Over 1,900 MW of its 2,300 NW of generating capacity is located in the
southwest of the State, while its major demand centers such as Bangalore are
located in the southeast, 400 km away. Underinvestment in both the
transmission and distribution networks has led to two problems: poor quality
electrical service, and high energy losses. Outages are frequent and large
voltage fluctuations are widespread. The outages result in a loss of
production, and the voltage fluctuations impose a substantial cost on
consumers in the form of equipment damage and the expense of installing
voltage stabilizers. Energy losses, which average about 22% of net
generation, also represent a substantial cost to the economy. Although some
of these losses are caused by non-technical problems involving metering and
billing, others are clearly technical in nature. Technical losses could be
reduced by at least 5%, saving the economy about US$27 million per year.



2-
4.      The first Karnataka Power Proje:t, approved in June 1987, is making
it possible for the State to develop the second stage of the Xalinadi
hydroelectric complex (270 MW) and reinforce part of the transmission
network. The project also includes: a study to determine an effective
treatment for the leak in the Talakalale dam, upstream of the STRS; a
reactive compensation study of the transmission system; and preparation of a
20-year distribution master plan for Bangalore, the largest city in the
State. The proposed Second Karnataka Power Project is designed to complement
the first one by assisting the State in developing an additional 240 MW of
hydroelectric plant and repairing the Talakalale dam, while, in parallel,
placing increased emphasis on needed investment in transmission and
distribution. The transmission component is intended to improve reliability
and reduce energy losses in the bulk power system; it is based on studies
recently completed by KEB.  The distribution component addresses needs in the
Bangalore system that are so critical they are justified independently of
the long-term master plan about to be prepared. Distribution improvements
will help KEB avoid further deterioration in service, especially in the
commercial and industrial areas of the city, and prevent damage to equipment.
In addition, the proposed Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
system will allow KEB to respond more quickly to system disturbances, thereby
reducing outage times.
5.      In terms of institutional development, the first Karnataka Power
Project focuses primarily on the financial performance of KEB and KPC. The
proposed Second Karnataka Power Project complements this initiative by
emphasizing improvement of KEB's operational efficiency. It includes
financing for tools, equipment, and training to modernize KEB's methods of
building and maintaining its transmission and distribution systems.
6.     Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project presents an
opportunity for the Bank to support state and national efforts to alleviate
power shortages in the Southern Region by exploiting indigenous hydroelectric
resources. The project allows the Bank to participate in the augmentation
of transmission and distribution capacity which will reduce system losses
and improve service quality. Since it involves further association with the
beneficiaries, Karnataka Power Corporation (KPC) and Karnataka Electricity
Board (KEB), the project also permits the Bank to consolidate the financial
and institutional improvements started under the first Karnataka Power
Project. A new component of the project will be to improve KEB's operational
efficiency by: introducing improved tools and work methods for building and
maintaining its transmission and distribution systems; introducing new
cost-effective technologies such as mobile transformers; and introducing a
supervisory control and data acquisition system to improve operator
responsiveness to power system disturbances.
7.      Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to:  alleviate
the acute shortage of generating capacity in Karnataka and the Southern
Region by developing the Sharavathi Tailrace Hydroelectric Scheme (STRS);
reduce the risk to downstream structures and human settlements by repairing



3-
the Talakalale dam; provide transmission capacity to evacuate power from the
STRS; provide transmission and distribution capacity to reduce energy losses,
and improve the quality of electric service; reduce capital and operat.ng
costs of distribution by introducing new technologies; and improve KEB's
capability to construct, maintain, and control its transmission and
distribution systems.
8.      Project Description.  The components of the proposed project will be
implemented by KPC and KEB. KPC will be responsible for: construction of
the 240 MW STRS including a 60 m high 736 m long concrete gravity dam and an
outdoor powerhouse with four 60 MW generating units; compensatory
afforestation associated with the STRS; and repair of the Talakalale dam, a
60 m high masonry structure. KEB will be responsible for: construction of
about 250 km of double circuit 400 kV transmission lines, 250 km of double
and single circuit 220 kV transmission lines, and 225 km of single circuit
transmission lines on existing towers, together with the associated
substations; laying of about 6 km of 66 kV underground cable together with
the construction of associated substations; reinforcement of the 11 kV
primary distribution grid in Bangalore; installation of a computerized
control center for the distribution system; the acquisition of tools and
equipment, and consulting services to train KEB personnel in the use of tools
and equipment for constructing and maintaining transmission and distribution
facilities; and consulting services to assist with the design and
construction of 400 kV lines and substations.
9.      The proposed project will be implemented over a period of about seven
years at an estimated cost of US$467.1 million. Interest during construction
adds US$103 million. The foreign exchange component is estimated to be
US$195.2 million (34% of the total). The cost estimates and financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Procurement and disbursement arrangements are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in India are shown in Schedules C and D
respectively. Two maps highlighting the project, are attached -- IBRD Nos.
20892 and 20893. A Staff Appraisal Report "Second Karnataka Power Project"
dated April 19, 1988 is being distributed separately.
10.     Agreed Actions.  KPC agreed to: (a) present to the Bank a
satisfactory plan for repairing the Talakalale dam and sign a contract with
a qualified firm by October 31, 1989, to perform the necessary work; (b)
present to the Bank no later than one year before the expected completion
of the structures, its proposed arrangements for periodic inspection and
maintenance of the dam and related structures; and (c) take all measures
necessary for KPC to earn a rate of return after interest of 3%.
11.     GOK agreed to: (a) onlend the proceeds of the loan applicable to KPC
and KEB respectively at an interest rate of not less than 11.5%; (b) cause
KEB to complete the detailed route survey for the 220 kV Gersoppa-Talaguppa
transmission line and, not later than December 31, 1988, make an application
to OI for clearance under its Forest (Conservation) Act; (c) cause KEB to
retain, by December 31, 1988, the services of a qualified firm to review its



-4-
work planning procedures, introduce new tools and equipment and train KEB
personnel in their use; (d) cause KEB to take all measures necessary for the
Board to earn a rate of return after interest of 3%; (e) cause the Board by
April 1, 1990 to collect its accounts receivable from its principal debtors
as of March 31, 1987, and maintain accounts receivable, with respect to sales
after March 31, 1987, at a level equivalent to two months' sales; and (f)
cause the Board to clear sums owed to KPC, not covered by a letter of credit,
within 30 days of billing. The conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement
between GOK and KPC is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
12.     Justification.  The economic benefits of the proposed project
comprise: an increase in the amount of power available to consumers; an
improvement in the quality of power supply; a reduction in system losses; and
greater efficiency in the use of assets in the public power supply system.
The least cost power development program for the Southern Region, of which
the proposed project is an integral part, is expected to have a quantAfiable
economic rate of return of at least 12%.
13.     Risks.  Except for those risks pertaining to the Talakalale dam,
there are no unusual technical risks associated with the Project. The risks
related to the Talakalale dam are being minimized by the use of specialized
consultants to investigate and supervise the repairs needed. There is a risk
that these consultants will find that more extensive repairs are required
than those currently envisaged. However, if this occurs neither the
rationale for nor the desirable timing of the STRS will be affected. The
geological and geotechnical information is adequate and indicates good
foundation conditions. KPC and KEB have sufficient staff available to carry
out the work who are experienced in supervising and executing activities
similar to those of the project. Consultants will be used in all areas in
which their in-house expertise is lacking.
14.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
