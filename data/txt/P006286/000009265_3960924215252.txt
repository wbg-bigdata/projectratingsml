PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
BRAZIL: SUPPORTING RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORTHEAST

(Loan 1537-BR)

(Loan 1728-2R)
PREFACE
This is a Project Performance Audit Report of three projects
designed to support rural development in th.ee areas wlthin Northeast (NE)
Brazil. Loan 1488 provided $17.0 million for the Ibiapaba region of Ceara
State.  It was approved by  the  Board  in  NovemDer 1977 and was closed in
December 1985 with  $7.9  million  (46Z)  undisbursed.   Loan 1537 provided
$24.0 million for the Brejo region of Paraiba State. It was approved by
the Board in March 1978 and was closed in September 1986 with $12.5 million
(52%) undisbursed.    Loan  1728  provided  $40.0  million  for the Agreste
Setentrional region of Pernambuco State.   It  was approved by the Board in
June 1979 and was closed in December 1986 with $12.9 million (33%)
undisbursed.
The PPAR consists of a Project Performance Audit Memorandum (PPAM)
prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) and a combined
Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by the FAO/World Bank Cooperative
Programme. The PPAM is based on the attached PCR, Staff Appraisal Reports
and President's Report, and the Loan Agreements. Correspondence with the
Borrower and internal Bank  memoranda  on  the  project issues contained in
Bank  files  have  been  consultAd   and  relevanc  Bank  staff  have  been
interviewed. An OED mission visited Brazil in Fabruary 1989, and discussed
project issues with SUDENE, Secretariat of Planning, PRORURAL, and CEPA-CE.
Their kind cooperation and valuable assistance ir the preparation of this
report is gratefully acknowledged.
The PCR provides a good account and assessment of the projects
principal achievements and difficulties.   The points discussed by the PPAR
audit hsve been selected as likely to be of particular importance in the
design of future projects aimed at assisting the Government in the rural
develcpment of NE Brazil. The major lessons involve the importance of the
macro-policy environment within which the rural development projects are
expected to operate, and the inappropriateness of subsidized credit as a
stimulus to  development.    While  the  projects  had  a  large  number of
components, it is not clear that any of them (except probably subsidized
credit) could advantageously have been dropped. Multi-component projects

inevitably  face  implementation  problems.    While  there  is  a  need to
experiment  with  alternative   administrative  arrangements,  the  central
technical unit continues to be one cnsible model for managing such
projects. As of February 1989, the cost of borrowing for these projects
can be estimated to be about 13.4Z to 202 in dollar terms.
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were
sent to the  Government  and  the  Borrower.    No  coments were, however,
received.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
*Introduction
i.       The Ceara, Paraiba and  Pernambuco Rural Development Projects were
three of ten first generation  Bank  funded rural development (RD) projects
in eight states of  Northeast  (NE)  Brazil.    They  formed a sub-set of a
larger NE program of 43 area-based projects, POLONORDESTE, started in 1974
by the Federal Government in conjunction with the NE states and NE regional
authority, SUDENE.   They  have  been  followed  by  a second generation of
projects, appraised in the 1985-86  period.   The Bank's experience to date
with RD in the NE is currently the subject of an OED study.l/ The three
project areas shared the characteristics of having potential for some
small-scale irrigated vegetable and fruit production. Location and rain-
fall gave them better prospects for expanded agricultural production than
the large areas of drier land in the NE.
Objectives
ii.      Though the  three  regions  had  diverse  farming environments and
agricultural potential, the projects were very similar in aiming to
increase the incomes and living  standards  of  small farmers, and of small
non-farm enterprises by the provision of infrastructure (roads, marketing
and storage), services (education, health and support to cooperative enter-
prises) and a package of agricultural support i:icluding credit, extension,
research, improved seed and more secure land tenure (para. 8). Project
specific interventions included Rural Electrification and Small Irrigation
Schemes in Ceara, Soil Conservation and Livestock Development in Paraiba
and Water conservation and a Community Development Fund in Pernambuco.
1/ The approach paper was discussed by the JAC on December 7, 1988. An
audit of a fourth RD project Loan 1589-Bahia Rural Development Project-
Paraguacu, is available in Report 7331.

Implementation Experience
iii.     Implmentation took place in  the  face  of a number of unforeseen
difficulties including a prolonged drought for 1979 to 1985, invasion by
the cotton boil woevil, erosion of counterpart funding by delayed disburse-
ment in the face of inflation and resistance to more secure land titling.
Daspite these difficulties, and despite low Bank disbursements, the
projects came close to  achieving  their  physical  targets.   By and large
taese physical targets represented means to an end (health posts, extension
agents appointed, miles of road constructed, etc.) rather than the ultimate
objective of higher  incomes  for  the  rural  poor.    The audit saw clear
evidence that expected benefits had flowed from these intermediate targets;
and that the regions have had a rapid expansion of their production of
horticultural crops in response to strong demand from the large cities in
the NE.
iv.      A major problem for implementation  was the difficulty in ensuring
that extension staff, once appointed, would address themselves productively
to improving the agricultural productivity of smallholders and share-
croppers. In part the drought can be blamed for undermining the efforts
which were made; but there were also problems with the packages available
for extension, and the motivation of extension personnel to work on tech-
nical agricultural problems rather than other forms of community service
(para. 32).
Results
V.       An almost complete dearth  of  monitoring  data prevents any clear
judgment as to project impact on the intended target group. However, it is
evident that the projects were successful in greatly augmenti:g the infra-
structure (both physical and organizational) for rural development in their
regions. Since the major differences are between components, rather than
between projects, results are presented by component, rather than the more
usual by project discussion within a joint audit.
vi.      In discussion, project  beneficiaries  and  local leaders, pointed
particularly to physical infrastructure (roads, rural electrification,
health an' agricultural mini-posts) as the major perceived benefits of the
project. This should not necessarily be taken as evidence that expend-
itures on extension, credit and research were ineffective; merely that the
project benefits are less easily perceived by recipients.
vii.     For the extension  service  and  those  farmers  whc got access to
subsidized credit, POLONORDESTE is remembered as `i;he best of times".
Extension salaries were attractive, staff were being aided, new vehicles
and recurrent resources were freely available, and extension could clearly
help farmers: by giving them access to cheap credit. We now know that
this expansive situation was too expensive to continue.
viii.    There was some shift towards  higher valued crops.  Potato produc-
tion increased in Pernambuco; tomato, passion fruit and assorted vegetable



- xi -
production increased in Ceara, and potatoes, citrus and banana production
in Paraiba.   The  latter  due  to  introduction  of  the disease resistant
Pacovan variety due to  project  funded  research.   As with other indirect
benefits it is not clear that banana growers recognized this as a benefit
of the project. Potato yields increased dramatically in Ceara under the
project, but fell off again due to farmers reverting to home produced seed
in which viruses had accumulated, and a low input technology.
ix.      In all  three  projects,  farmers  reported  that increased horti-
cultural production has meant that work can now be obtained on a casual
basis at any time of year: It is no longer necessary to migrate to Rio or
Sao Paulo from July to December.    This  may have been the most beneficial
change to have taken place.
x.       The health  posts  and  schools  are  operating,  and  by training
cosumunity members to provide elementary educatior and preventative and
simple medical tasks have kept the recurrent costs of their services at a
manageable level and thus have greatly extended the range of people
receiving simple educational and health services.
xi.      The projects were  also  successful  in  strengthening the bureau-
cracies designed to assist the rural poor, and provided the experience on
which the second generation of projects built.
xii.     It is doubtful if much moze  could have been achieved in the light
of the adverse policy environment within which the projects were expected
to operate.
Findings and Lessons
xiii.    The major  limitations  on  project  success  were  largely beyond
project control. These included:
i)  An anti-agricultural policy  bias  which  prevented the region
from exploiting its comparative advantage (para. 13),
ii)  Lack  of  technological  basis  for  significant  productivity
increases in most of the NE (para. 14),
iii) The INCRA policy of not giving title to properties below
defined "module" size (para. 11(iii)), and
iv)  Interruptions in the supply  of credit and recurrent resources
dictated by macro-policy and federal administrative procedures
(para. 30).
xiv.     Two factors, apparently  neglected  in  project  design, limit the
increase in incomes which can be expected to result from the projects.
Inelastic demand for the products of unirrigated agriculture in the NE
means that increased productivity for these products is likely to lower
prices and raise consumer surplus rather than producer incomes. Further-
more, the integration of the NE with the Brazil-wide unskilled market labor



- xii -
means that any tendency towards higher expected labor incomes in the NE
would be likely to be dampened by reduced out-migration. Unfortunately low
wages for 4nskilled labor is not a problem unique to the NE. This does not
mean that the projects were "doomed to failure', but rather that project
benefits may be felt primarily outside the NE in decreased out-migration,
rather than in significantly higher incomes in the NE.
xv.      While these 'external' factors  go  a  long way towards explaining
the relatively modest impact of the  projects, they also pose the question:
Why  were  the  projects  undertaken  without  addressing  the  fundamental
problems (i) to (ii) above?
xvi.     The most notable feature  of  project implementation has been poor
to non-existent monitoring and evaluation, and an almost complete lack of a
continuing social, political and  economic  research  program.   There is a
dearth of project wide information as to how particular components
functioned at various times during  the  project.    The audit and PCR have
thus been  forced  back  to  soliciting  individual  opinions and anecdotal
information. The minimum data needed for project management does not
appear to have been recorded. Knowing the number of health posts does not
tell us (a) whether they are fully staffed, (b) level of training of the
staff, (c) which diseases have been controlled, (d) adequacy of medical
supplies and other recurrent needs supplied to the posts, etc. The need is
to monitor such factors over time; a once only record is of limited useful-
ness (para. 55).
xvii.    Given the already  toted  "external"  limitations within which the
projects were called upon to operate, their design succeeded in addressing
a wide range of ways of assisting the rural poot. By refraining from
providing for an official or cooperative marketing system, the projects
left room for the rapid growth of middlemen who now compete actively in the
provision of a wide range of market related services. This omission was
crucial to project success (para. 10).
xviii.   The audit regards the question of "overly complex design" as moot.
It is not clear  that  any  components  should  have  been dropped ex ante.
There were other ways to deliver such a bundle of services, however, alter-
native approaches would also have had their own administrative difficul-
ties.  Other administrative structures  should be experimented with; but it
is possible that this will lead to increased satisfaction with the Tech-
nical Unit structure used in these projects.
xix.     The least sati3factory  components  ex  post  appear  to have been
extension and credit.   Rampant  inflation  untdermined the agreed basis for
advancing credit, and neither rroject management nor Bank supervision
missions suggested appropriate .emedial action, through experiments with
commodity denominated small  farmer  credit  and  now  un;_rway (para. 88).



- xiii -
Extension because though the extension service has been redirected to
assisting small farmers, it is not evident that a way of delivering exten-
sion services to small farmers at acceptable cost has yet been found (para.
33) .2/
2/ The region has commented that "Back in 1974/75/76 when the extension,
research, land and education components were conceived, the then
existing situation was very different from the one today. They V;ere
designed to respond to the institutional, economic and political
situation of that time.   To  a  large extent, the approach adopted was
one of learning by doing.   The  PPAR shows little appreciation of this
evolutionary process and fails to -ecognize the many innovations and
changes introduced by  the  projects."    This  qualification has to be
accepted; it has not been possible to recapture the perspectives of the
mid-1970s,  or  to  trace   the   evolution  of  political  and  policy
developmants that followed.   The  PPAR  should  be  read  as a view of
project performance and lessons, incorporating the perspective of the
late 1980s. It is probably fair to comment that this characteristic is
also shared by the PCR.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
BRAZIL: SUPPORTING RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORTHEAST
CEARA RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - IBIAPABA
(Loan 1488-BR)
PARAIBA RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - BREJO
(Loan 1537-BR)
PERNAMBUCO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - AGRESTE SFTENTRIONAL
(Loan 1728-BR)
I. BACKGROUND
Context
1.       Once the country's wealthiest region, during the sugar boom of the
colonial period, the Northeast  (NE)  hes  been viewed as Brazil's foremost
"problem area" since  the  late  1860s.    In  1973,  Mr. McNamara made his
Nairobi  speech  committing  the  Bank  to  increased  concern  with income
distribution and in  particular  the  rural  poor.    In 1974 the Brazilian
government announced the POLONORDESTE program designed inter alia to raise
the productivity and incomes of small farmers through integrated rural
development projects, focussing initially on selected priority areas with
especially  pronounced  poverty   problems   and/or  immediate  development
possibilities.    It  was  thus  natural   for  the  Bank  to  support  the
POLONORDEST5 program with a series of projects. These three projects were
part of a portfolio of ten first generation rural development (RD) projecte
in eight states of the NE, which in turn were a subset of 46 projects
funded  under  POLONORDESTE.        They  have  been  followed  by  a "second
generation" of Northeast Rural Development (NERD) projects appraised in
1985-86.
2.       The Bank's  portfolio  of  first  generation  projects  provided a
substantial   (US$370   million)   contribution   towards   the   costs  of
POLONORDESTE. However larger total amounts of money were also contributed
by the Government itself, and were spent over a wider area than was covered
by the Bank's projects.
3.       The three  projects  included  in  this  audit  covered relatively
favorably regions in their  states  1/    with good possibilities for small
scale irrigation and in Ceara and Paraiba possibilities for rainfed
horticultural production.
1/ Though less favorable than the belt of sugar lands along the coast.



4.       Migration between the NE and  Rio  de  Janeiro (Rio) and Sao Paulo
means that the unskilled labor market in the NE is well integrated into the
unskilled labor market in Brazil as a whole. Many of the rural poor in the
NE have  relatives  in  the  south.    Seasonal  migration  is  an accepted
employment  option;  and   even   instances   of   reverse  migration  were
encountered.
Obiectives
5.       The POLONORDESTE program  supported  by  these  projects had as an
overall objective the improvement of the incomes and the standard of living
of the rural population in the NE, and the reduction in disparities in
economic and social development between the rural NE and much of the rest
of the country.   An  important  secondary  objective was to strengthen the
planning and project execution and coordination capacity of the agencies
responsible for RD in the  states.    It  was  expected to have an indirect
benefit in slowing rural-urban migration either within the NE or between
the NE and large cities in the South, thus recognizing the integration of
the NE with the unskilled labor market in the rest of Brazil.
Design
6.       A key consideration in the design  of projects to assist the poor,
is the recognition that almost the only asset of the poor is their labor.
Thus strategier to raise their incomes need to rest largely on ways of
increasing the Froductivity of their  labor.   This may result from general
economic conditions wbich lead to a higher demand for unskilled labor in
general; but will usually involve the provision of assets which allow the
poor to improve their labor productivity, and/or agricultural research and
technology transfer which can lead to new products and higher productivity
and/or education or health services which result in labor becoming more
productive. This major labor productivity thrust can bo supported by
physical infrastructure  (such  as  roads  and  electrification).    Social
infrastructure (such as health or educational services) also help improve
living standards.
7.       Major income disparities exist  in  Brazil between the large scale
formal sector (including Government) and the small scale informal sector
(including small farmers and rural  lAborers).   The provision of increased
social services to the rural poor needs to rest on the delivery of these
services by the rural poor.   rhis  is  because delivery of services by the
formal sector to the poor on any substantial scale is likely to be too
expensive. A key to sustainability of improved social services to the
rural poor is thus the training of community members to deliver the needed
services (para. 46).
8.       Strengths.  Given this  perspective,  and the objective of helping
the ruial poor, the projects included a sensible and comprehensive set of
components:
i) Credit, to give recipients some assets beyond their labor,
ii) Research, to improve technological, and hence labor and land
productivity,



-3-
iii) Extension, to improve technology and ensure that credit was
spent productively,
iv)  Land reform and titling  to  give beneficiaries the s..urity
to allow them to invest (and also enjoy a higher proportion
of their earnings),
v) Roads to reduce marketing costs and improve the working of
the labor market,
vi) Support to small non-farm enterprises, to improve the
opportunities for off-farm employment,
vii) Health, both to imorove labor productivity, and through the
use of rural health posts to practice preventative medicine
for a wide range of health problems which were costly to
treat in their advanced form, and thus previously went
untreated.
viii) Education to improve labor productivity, and
ix) Marketing support to increase competition in the market, and
increase the price-elasticity of demand.
Project specific interventions included Rural Electrification and Small
Irrigation Schemes in Ceara, Soil Conservation and Livestock Development
in Paraiba and Water conservation and a Community Development Fund in
Pernambuco (PCR, para. 20).
9.       Omissions.  Even with hindsight  the only major omission from this
list which should perhaps have been included would appear to be some
strengthening of the rural telephone network to permit better working of
labor and produce markets, and to allow contact with family members who
have migrated. Even this component would have had to rest on training
community members to act as telephone operators at, or near, the cost of
day labor.2/
10.      A wise omission was the  absence  of  support for public sector or
cooperative marketing. Marketing support was limited to construction of
vegetable markets at Campina Grande (Paraiba) and Tiangua (Ceara); and
marketing mini-posts  in  Paraiba.    In  the  absence  of formal marketing
arrangements a large number of competing middlemen have emerged who provide
a wide range of  marketing  services  (para.  40).   By refraining from the
provision  of  direct   marketing   services,   the  project  provided  the
environment for a rapid and competitive expansion by the small scale
private sector.
2/  The Re-ion comments: "'Even with hindsight' we have doubta on improving
the laDor and product market through project support for improving the
rural telephone system."



11.     W!knsaeas   There are  three  areas where Implementation problems
could be traced to project design.
I)  Subsidized  Credit.    The  Prosident's  Report  (PR)  for the
projects clearly provided for interest rates to be negative In
real terms, for exaples
oCredit  term    end   conditions   would  be  those
established by the Government for the POLONORDESTE
progrem, namely, interest to the farmr at 101,
unindoxed, for both investment and seasonal credit,
with repayment term for investment credit of up to
12 years, Including a grace period of up to six
years.    The  Government   would  advise  the  Bank
promptly  of  any   changes   in   these  terms  and
conditions (Section  3.03(a)  and  (b)  of the draft
Loan Agreoment). Given Brazil's inflation rate, the
interest   rates    adopted    by   Government   for
POLONORDESTE projects are negative in real terms.
The potential misallocation of resources would be
mitigated by the fact that the beneficiaries, small
farmers with incomes below the poverty level, would
be closely supervised by the rural extension agents
and by project monitoring and evaluation.' (PR for
Ln. 1728-BR, para. 46).
The ill-effects of this provision are discussed below (pars.
32).   Here  it  is  sufficient  to  note  that when inflation
accelerated and "credit' became almost synonymous with a
*grant", the absence of any pre-specified limit on the
acceptable degree of negative real interest rates, meant that
the Bank was not well placed to demand the needed redesign of
the credit component.    With  the  target  group of small and
medium owner-operators (owning below 50 ha) earning less than
a third of the per capita GNP (i.e., earning less than US$380
p.a.) (Paraiba SAR, par&. 3.05), the provision of up to
US$6,000 in credit (Paraiba SAR, para. x) appears to the audit
to have been  disproportionate.    One  loan  of t!S$6,000 to a
farmer earning even US$380 p.a., represents 15 years labor
income in one loan. This is a very generous credit treatment;
the cash-flow protection of the lenders is almost non-
existent.
ii)  Extension:  In  sharp  contrast  to  the  education and health
components, the extension component did not provide for the
upgrading of comunity  members  to deliver extension services
to small farmers. While 'group extension" was used to cut the
cost of delivery of extension services, this still involved
salaried extension staff in village meetings every two weeks.
It seems probable that some further ingenuity in project
design could have cut costs significantly to a sustainable
level (pars. 33).3/
3/  At the time  of  the  audit,  lack  of  funds  for  fuel  meant that in
Pernembuco and Paraibs field visits had essentially stopped.



-5-
iii)  Land Refom.  The land reform and titling components rested on
an unresolved Catch-22. For the most part, the areas of land
demarcated and/or transferred to farmers were smaller than the
INCRA 'module', defined for each municipality. In consequence
INCRA would not, in most cases, allow title to be transferred
to the new owner. It s*eem clear that either the INCRA module
should have been redefined to better describe the area
required to sustain a family at an acceptabli level of living,
or where the INCRA module w a correct, aslistance with the
transfer and titling of smaller properties should not be
provided. Transfer and demarcation of properties to which the
new owner cannot get proper title is unsatisfactory. An
informal market in the rights to land title (when eventually
issued)  has  developed,  supported   by  the  implicit  title
obtained by payment  of  land  taxes.   However, though better
than nothing this would appear to be storia- up problems for
the future.
12.      External Factors:    A  number  of  'givens"  or  external factors
circumscribed the possible impact of the projects. These are not factors
which could have been corrocced by better project design, but they do pose
a question as to whether support for the projects (either by Government or
the Bank) was justified pending their resolution.
13.      The  most  serious   external   factor   was   an  adverse  Rolicy
environment.  An over-valued  currency, coupled with industrial protection,
subsidies  for  industrial   eAports,   and   protection  for  agricultural
processing (see Box 1) discriminated strongly against agricultural exports
from the  NE.    But  agricultural  exports  offered  the  best  hope of NE
agricalture getting access to a market with elastic demand. Absent an
elastic demand, increased technical efficiency would contribute principally
to consumer rather than producer surplus, leaving NE producers very little
better off.4/ At the very least it would have seemed sensible to allow
agricultural products from the NE to be exported at the market rate of
exchange.
14.      There was, and  continues  to  be,  an  absence  of a transforming
technology which would allow the profitable closer settlement of the dry
areas of the NE; and even the drier areas within the projects. Supported
research has produced some marginal improvements that can be made to
sma'lholder production systems, contour planting, cultural practices such
as 'double line' planting of cassava, and better varieties. But when all
improvements have been made, a hoe based cropping technology cannot provide
an adequate income in the dryer parts of the NE, without irrigation or a
substantial cattle herd.5/   This  meant  that there were many smallholders
who could not earn a satisfactory income from any reajonable augmentation
4/  See, for instance.   The  AEricultural  Economy of Northeast Brazil, by
Kutcher and Scandizzo, World Bank, 1981; Table 7.7, p. 192.
5/ As one extension officer put it, "Lets face it, large areas of the NE
are too dry for successful smallholder settlement."



BOX 1
CRITIQUE OF BRAZILIAN AGRICULTURAL POLICY IN CONTEXT OF A PROPOSED AGRICULTURAL SECTOR LOAN II
(Project Briet dated January 26, 1984)
11.  Commercial Policy Interventions.  Deteriorating term  of trad  tor agriculture In many countries are
blamed on external foreee but in Biazil this date-ioration may be principally attributed to
Brazilian Government actlons ovor the entire range of comercial policy. The Instruments of this
policy have Included:
*   quantity controls on crop exports,  ranging  from  restrictions and ceilling  n-edod to guarantee
input supplies for local processors, to outright suspension of exports when international prices
began to attract supplies away trom, or increase prices in, local markets;
*   protection and subsidies tor processors ot many ot these crops accompanied these oxport rostric-
tions, leading to abnormally high processing costs and uneconomic capacity expansion, especially
tor soybeans and cotton;
*   export taxes, often alternating with export subsidies for the sums crop, as with cotton;
f flat Import prohibitions;
imports by Governeant tor resole  below  not  only  market  price  but often producer costs, the
differential absorbed by the Government;
*   a consistently over-valued exchange rote,  which  particularly  taxed crop exports excluded from
the compensating export credit and tax subsidies provided to procossed exports;
*   the building up and unloading of public stocks to destabilize markots, even at harvest timo;
*   fixing of guaranted minimum prices woll  b4         border  prices and often below production cost,
discouraging production, or fixing these prices  well  above  prices at which imports were later
resold, loading to enormous public purchases under the minimum price program and building up of
large stocks, later used to destabilize tho market or. for non-traded crops such as black beans,
fixing excessivoly high minimum prices which  exacerbate  already  already highly unstable price
and supply patterns;
*   agentlmnos agr_ements  with supermarkets to hold  retail  prices below market, In exchange for
governmsnt supplios, In competition with producers, at prices well below markot and often below
production costs.
The choleo of instrument has varied over crops and tims, action tending to be taken unpredictably
whonever domestic prices thr-stened to rise or Internal supplies threatened to grow scarce. What
has been consistent In thin policy has been the unpredictability of intervention, in terms of
timing, Instrumnt or extent, and the overall pattern which emerges as one of disincentives and risk
intensification In agriculture.
19.  With most of these policies  being  determined  and  executed by agoncies principally concerned with
?inancial, Inflation and balance of  paymsnts  objectives,  usually within a short-term perspective,
littlo consideration has been given to Impact of these actions on agriculture. There is no mechs-
nim for inrorting agricultural considerations into tho de,ision-process, although the Minister of
Agriculture Is a member of the CNN.  Nor  Is there adequate capability for such analysis.  Finally,
thore are few alternative policy instruments to execute a more focussed agricultural policy.



of their resource bases. This difficulty lay at the heart of the already
noted dispute with INCRA on titling of small holdings (para. 1l(iii)).
Whilst not a major problem for the three projects currently being audited
(para. 3), this was a major problem for the program of which the three
projects form a part (para. 1).
Financina Plan
15.      Project financing was basically  similar  across projects as shown
in Table 1, with the Bank providing about a third of project costs.
Farmers were expected to make a small contribution in Ceara, but beyond
this the major portion of resources were to be provided by the Federal
Government.

Pre-implementation Processing
16.      All three projects were  prepared  by  the relevant state planning
agencies, with very substantial (approximately five staff years per
project) assistance from Bank missions, as summarized in Table 2 (PCR,
paras. 4 to 7!.

Pernambuco Oct. 1977  Dec. 1978  June 1979   Feb. 1960    6        216
17.      Despite the  substantial  involvement  of  Bank  staff  in project
preparation, the Government and Bank continued  to differ in their views on
appropriate lending terms. At negotiations, the Bank reluctantly accepted
the Government's decision to offer low, unindexed interest rates. The Bank
rationalized its acceptance of this decision on the grounds (a) that the
subsidies would be going to low income farmers, tenants and landless; and
(b) that the supervision provided by the extension services could prevent
any serious misallocation, (PCR, para. 8).
18.      Lack of monitoring and  evaluation  data prevents any quantitative
judgment as to the realism of the Bank staffs' rationalization. However,
discussion  with  extension  staff  who   had  worked  extensively  in  the
preparation of credit requests for farmers, revealed that their only



- 8 -
apparent measure of loan success was whether it had been repaid. The audit
found no examples of e*tension staff who had refused to prepare a credit
application because the proposal would have been unprofitable at a positive
rate of interest.    Quite  the  contrary;  there  was a widespread feeling
amongst extension staff  that  Guvernment  should  again provide subsidized
credit, in order that extension staff could again prepare loan applications
for farmers, which the farmers would be able to repay.
Board Concerns
19.      The  Board  welcomed  the  projects  as  providing  an  integrated
response to the needs of a target group that merited the Bank's fullest
support. Concern focussed on (a) the lack of a population component and
(b) the likely ill-effects of negative real interest rates. The staff
responded that whilst desirable there was not, and never had been, any
chance that the Government would borrow for a population control program;
and that tight supervision by extension staff would ensure that credit
supplied under the project was used productively.
20.      In discussion of the  Pernambuco  project the Board drew attention
to the prov:sion of US$7.2 million under the loan to finance local salary
costs. A staff explanation that this would increase Bank influence over
staff selection and job descriptions was accepted by the Board (PCR, para.
12).6/ 7/
6/ This explanation is at variance with the normal position of operational
management   which    disavows    any    responsibility   for   project
.Lmplementation, as illustrated by the following quotation:
'The relationship between the borrower, Bank management and
the Bank as an entity is that: (a) the borrower applies for
a loan to finance a specific projects, (b) Bank management
appraises the project proposed by the borrower and recommends
it to the Board for approval, (c) the Board decides on the
recommendation, Id) the borrower implements the project, and
(e) the Bank ensures that the project is satisfactorily
implemented by the borrower. Thus, no implementation problem
can be 'prima facie a Bank problem."' (Comment from COD on
Draft Supervision Study Approach Paper, dated December 20, 1988).
7/ The Region notes that this argument would no longer apply since: "The
overall cost sharing in Brazil has been fixed for sometime and the
decision about the financing percentages of components is in reality
pragmatic and based largely on administrative considerations."



-9-
II. IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIENCE
ManaRement
21.      The projects were inherently  complex.    A  wide range of project
components were combined with legitimate interest in project implementation
by the Bank, several Ministries from the Federal Government, SUDENE (the
Regional Development Authority), and the State Government, not to mention a
range of implementing agencies.   A  special Technical Unit (TU) within the
relevant state planning unit, together with a coordinating comittee of
state permanent secretaries was used to manage the project and coordinate
the other  agencies  involved.    Coordination  problem.  were encountered,
particularly in arranging for the timely release of funds. Whilst other
organizational arrangements can be proposed, and should be tried on an
experimental basis, it is not clear that they would actually reduce the
inherent complexity of such projects.
22.      A  close  focus  on   agricultural  components  would  make  these
components easier to manage, however this would be at the cost of going
without other components, or having to also arrange for their coordination
and management. As brought out in para. 8, there were no components which
were obviously superfluous.
23.      Coordinatios. by a central TU in each state, has the advantage that
this provides one place to which Bank, Federal or SUDENE officials can turn
for an overview of the state project, its succe!;ses, and any overriding
problems.   However,  the  TU  may  also  filter  cut  problems reported by
implementing agencies, for any  of  a  number  of  reasons.   The TU is the
natural first call for Bank supervisors, however it should not be the only
call. One implementing agency visited by the audit reported that the
previous official call from Bank staff had been during project preparation.8/
The agency, was naturally skeptical whether its quite acute problems with
funding and access to credit had been accurately portrayed to Bank
supervision missions.
24.      There are endemic problems  with  the release of counterpart funds
for projects in Brazil, delays of three to four months in release of the
first payment in a financial year being commonplace. The impact of such
delays is compounded in the presence of high inflation which results in
erosion of the real  value  of  delayed  payments.   Whilst this problem is
widely recognized, no satisfactory procedure for its resolution has been
found. In part, slow and incomplete project disbursements can be traced to
the apparent inability (a) of the Federal Government to release budgeted
funds in a timely fashion, and (b) of the implementing agencies to protect
themselves from chese delays.
8/  The Region has commented: "While the budget constraints for supervision
in recent years would certainly explain the failure of supervision
mission to visit line agencies, we seriously question the validity
and/or the generality of the claim by the implementing agency cited in
the report. At best, it is an isolated example."



- 10 -
Start-up
25.      There were initial problems of  coordination due to the difficulty
of the TU in coordinating the work of the independent, and independently
minded, executing agencies.    Most  of  which  were not initially oriented
towards the needs of small farmers and the rural poor. However, these
difficulties were no greater than could be expected with such a complex
project.
Sequence
26.      The several components  in  these  projects were not significantly
inter-dependent. Thus delay with one component did not generally hold up
others. A partial exception to this rule was provided by the credit
component, access to which became the key service provided by extension.
When the credit component went underfunded on macro-economic grounds (as is
1984-86), extension found itself ill-prepared to assist farmers without
resort to subsidized credit.
Procurement
27.      The depth  of  the  Brazilian  economy,  and relatively fragmented
nature of project expenditures meant that most goods and services were
procured by local procurement and competitive bidding procedures. Some
problems were encountered with bidding documents for road components which
contained fixed price limits which were particularly inappropriate in the
face of rapid inflation. This was corrected following a Bank intervention,
indicating that this clause would have to be deleted for future contracts
to qualify for reimbursement (PCR, para. 76 (d)).
Report ing
28.      Quarterly reports were produced by the TUs in a format mandated by
SUDENE. However these reports were not seen by the TUs as a tool for
project management, but rather as a bureaucratic requirement of SUDENE and
the Bank. As a result these reports tended to be detailed without being
informative.    Despite  efforts  by  the  Bank,  it  was  not  possible to
significantly improve the quality of reporting, due to the lack of trained
monitoring and evaluation staff in SUDENE and the project management units
(PCR, para. 73).
III. OUTCOMES
29.      General.  A visit to  the  project areas is sufficient to identify
many  artifacts  from   the   projects;   and   conversation  with  project
participants and beneficiaries indicates convincingly that project impacts
were positive.    Whether  benefits  exceeded  eosts  is  more difficult to
determine (paras. 55 and 56); but it is clear that there were significant
benefits. In particular, all three regions have experienced an important
increase in irrigated production, to the point that casual agricultural
work is available fairly widely at all times of year. An indication of the

magnitude of this expansion is provided by the produce sold through the
Tiangua market (Table 3). There is, of course, no way of relating these
sales to total production or sales from the project areas. Project
investments have clearly assisted this expansion, roads have reduced
marketing costs; produce markets have lowered transaction costs and
provided purchasers with a reliable source of supply; credit has been
available  for  investments  in   irrigation  equipment;  land  reform  has
increased some farmers access to water; research has helped introduce new
crop varieties; and extension has helped both with technology and access to
credit. Whilst it is not evident to exactly what extent the project
contributed to the expansion, it is clear that these project interventions
were in the right direction,9/ and this underlines the wisdom of focussing
the RD  projects  on  areas  with  agricultural  potential.   (For detailed
discussion of project outcomes see PCR paras. 29 to 56 and Annexes I to
III). Since these three projects shared very much the same design and were
implemented over the same  time  period  in climatically similar areas, th_
between project differences for a given component were small. Accordingly
this audit presents the project outcomes "by component", rather than the
more usual joint audit arrangement "by project".

30.      Credit.  The SARs explicitly noted that the credit component would
involve a  subsidy  element  (para.  11(i)).    However, rapidly escalating
inflation turned the subsidy component into a de facto grant program with
rapid erosion of the real value of the credit fund. (A grant program where
the landless were excluded because they could not offer security, where the
grant might equal twenty times the basic wage, and where the Government was
borrowing internationally a third of the funds granted.) This does not
necessarily mean that it was badly spent, especially since the extension
service was directly involved in the preparation of credits proposals.
Even the apparent shift from permanent farm investmerts towards the
purchase of cattle (PCR, para. 29) may have been in the right direction,
since in the absence of irrigation, cattle, even on a small scale, are the
most profitable enterprise. As outlined in PCR para. 29 there were severe
and continuing problems in the administration of the credit component
including underfunding on macro-economic grounds in the period 1984-86,
which is reflected in the relatively low disbursement for this component
(less than 35% of SAR estimates).    In  view  of its de facto grant nature
noted above, Government was probably wise to underfund this component.
However, both extension and farmers who benefited from the credit component
remember it wistfully.
91 And, as already noted (para. 10), the project did not introduce a
centralized, monopolistic, public sector marketing system which could
well have nullifi2d the other beneficial developments.



- 12 -
31.      Extension.    The   projects   were  successful  in  significantly
expanding the extension services available to small farmers. Staffing,
mobility and office space were all increased.10/ It should be recognized,
however, that this expansion took place from a small base; and that even
after expansion most small farmers had no direct contact with extension.
Service to large farmers ceased for all practical purposes.
32.      The provision of technical  advice  was  largely 'captured' by the
credit program, so that extension became accustomed to providing technical
advice supported by  credit  at  negative  rates  of  interest.   Since the
"package' of advice plus credit was profitable to farmers, the discipline
of evaluating the profitability of the technical advice in its own right
and in the light of farmers' existing circumstances, seems to have been
largely lost. To the point that the audit was told on several occasions:
We need a subsidized credit program so that farmers can afford to cake our
advice.
33.      Extension has been  redirected  towards  group  extension to small
farmers; typically on a fortnightly basis.   With only three days a week in
the field (when there is petrol), this means serv4ng at most six g oups per
extensior office.11/  This may  be  too  expensive.   Some of the ingenuity
used in the delivery of health and education services, could profitably be
adopted for extension. Such as the selection of two farmers per group to
come to town for a monthly lecture and demonstration, which they would then
report to other farmers, or involvement in a residential training course
during the dry period, subsidized demonstration plot on the farmer's farm,
etc. It seems likely that widespread excessive use of insecticides in
Ibiapaba (which is both dangerous and expensive) could be reduced if there
was a village insecticide expert, who had had even a couple of months
training, and some support from formal extension. These suggestions are
purely illustrative. Some way has to be found to extend the reach of
university training extensionists. Insistence that only graduates be used
for extension would likely result in most poor farmers not getting any
extension. To the audit, it appears that low cost delivery of reliable
extension advice to small farmers has not yet been achieved.
34.      Aricultural   Research.  .  Agricultural   research   has   been
substantially refocused to give adequate, but not e::clusive, attention to
the problems of small farmers.    In  Pernambuco  this is being done in the
context of "farming systems experiments" on small farms, particularly
experiments with sorghum silage to carry cattle better through the dry
period. In Ceara useful work has been done on the introduction of passion
fruit and tomato varieties; and currently a new disease of cassava "super-
branching" is being studied. This latter work is of vital importance for
subsistence farmers. In Paraiba good work was done on potato husbandry and
10/ Current fiscal stringency means that this mobility has not been
maintained. Apart from separately funded "projects", the extension
service at the time of the audit was limited to office visits.
11, Though in one office visited four staff were serving a total of 18
groups; or only 4.5 groups per staff member.

control of panama disease. Potato yields were increased from 3.2 toas at
appraisal to 12 tons in 1979 (vs 12.5 tons projected by the SAR) on the
basis of research, extension  and  credit.    With  the withdrawal of cheap
credit, farmers have failed to renew their seed or provide for cash inputs,
with the result that yields have reverted to pre-project levels.12/
35.      Seeds and SeedlinRs.    This  component  appears  to have operated
satisfactorily, especially for banana suckers and potato seed in Paraiba.
In Ceara the middlemen had a vital, if unplanned, role in the introduction
and testing of new species and varieties.
36.      Land Tenure.  At the time of the audit, quite different approaches
to land reform were  evident  in  different  states.   Ir Ceara, MIRAD (tlhe
federal land settlement agency) was active in the distribution of land to
new settlers. Under MIRAD's tutelage the settlers were required to work
collectively, either for the settlement as a whole, or in smaller groups.13/
At one level, MIRAD consulted extensively with the settling groups as to
their requirements and cropping strategy; but at a higher level MIRAD
officials argued amongst themselves on ideological grounds as to whether
the settlers would be allowed to hire labor, or work for others and the
degree of capital-labor substitution which would be allowed. Despite the
forms of consultation with the settlers, the M.RAD land reform program in
Ceara was ideological and paternalistic.    It  came as a surprise that the
technical advisors to these small farmers should explicitly take decisions
which would limit their income earning capacity. The land reform program
in Ceara appears too paternalistic and ideological to merit Bank support.
37.      In Paraiba, the state land  reform  authority was focussing on the
settlement of farmers in place. Land was being given to groups of farmers
who  had  previously  worked  for  an  absentee  landlord.    In  one large
settlement visited approximately 500 titles had been transferred to the
farmers despite farm size being well below the size of the INCRA module.
Elsewhere there was an evident  conflict  between  the small size of parcel
being transferred to farmers, being incompatible with INCRA agreeing tc, the
transfer of title (para. 11(iii)).
38.      In  Pernambuco  two  of   the   .hree  land  reform  beneficiaries
interviewed had recently been successful enot'h  to  be able to buy a house
in town.  Without giving up  the  farm,  the  family was moving to town. so
that the children could continue  their  education.  This provides evidence
that access to land may be seen as providing access to income, rather than
12/ With cheap cred :, it was sensible to borrow for inputs, and then to
regard all earning after repayment of the loan as disposable income.
Unfortunately the need to retain sufficient resources to plant in the
next season was not made evident to farmers until after the cheap
credit option had been withdrawn.
13/ Some form of settler association or cormnunity is likely to be needed
to provide comnon services; to lobby the public sector to deliver its
services; and, to defend the settler's property rights. It is the
encouragement to do communally what cculd equally be done individually
that is being questioned.



- 14 -
as an end in itself; which poses a question as to the cost of alternative
ways of increasing income. The audit was unable to obtain an estimate of
the cost of settlement, but given the number of Government officials
involved, it appeared high. It is probable that land settlement in these
cases is a pyrrhic victory:    it  is  doubxful if Brazil could afford land
reform on this pattern on a large scale. This should not be generalized to
all land reform. The three projects exhibited quite different approaches
to land reform. Evidently other approaches exist. In Sergipe land reform
is associated with shifting land into orange orchards, and may be
replicable on a large scale.
39.      Marketing.  This  was  a  highly  successful project component, by
virtue of the limited nature of the project interventions. Principally the
projects supported the construction of crop assembly markets at Campina
Grande (Paraiba) and Tiangua (Ceara). These markets provided a focal point
at which truck loads of produce could be assembled for shipment to the
large coastal cities, and the south of Brazil. Accurate weights, market
reporting services and procedures for dispute adjudication provided in
conjunction with these markets helped reduce the risk of exploitation of
small producers. Some assistance was provided to cooperative societies,
but fortunately not in a form which would give them a monopsony.
40.      In the absence of other  project initiatives, a diverse network of
middlemen evolved providing a wide range of marketing services to farmers.
These included on-farm purchase (at fixed prices or relative to the price
at the regional market); transport of goods to market (at a fixed price per
box of produce); provisioal of working capital, inputs,14/ and new seeds.
The result was that most zmall farmers appeared to be well informed as to
market prices, and to have a range of selling options open to them, and
even several buyers for any given option.
41.      Rural Roads.  Rural roads  were repeatedly mentioned by farmers as
the principal benefits  from  POLONORDESTE.15,    Several  factors may help
explain this popularity.    Roads  are  seen  as  providing benefits to all
members of the community.    If  you  live  on  the  road  you get a direct
benefit. It is not necessary to qualify in other ways, there is no
association to join or meetings  to  attend.   Transport costs and time for
getting to town are greatly reduced, and increased mobility for the
individual also contribute to better working of the labor market. If, as
is often the case, the road generates a daily or weekly transport service,
then the farmers' isolation is dramatically reduced.
14/ The audit was unable to ascertain whether provision of capital and
inputs resulted in an "exploitative" relationship with middlemen; but
in general producers had several marketing options available to them
from a range of middlemen.
15/ In part this may reflect farmer unawareness of the role which the
project played in the introduction of new crop varieties, the
redirection of research, or assistance in small scale irrigation.



- 15 -
42.      On  many  project  roads,  middlemen  make  regular  trips  to buy
produce. Thus the road component may contribute directly to better working
of the vegetable market. In particular, a farmer's bargaining position is
much stronger (and the middleman's position correspondingly weaker) when
the farmer has his produce on his own farm, than when he has already
incurred the cost of transporting it to market.
43.      The PCR notes problems  with  road  maintenance (PCR, para. 46 and
48). The audit mission, which occurred in the dry season, found that
though the roads had clearly deteriorated they were easily passable by
truck or light car; and farmers talked to seemed well aware of the sorts of
agitation needed to get the municipality to maintain the road when needed.
Some maintenance was being provided by municipalities, and roads did not
appear to have been allowed to deteriorate to the point their value would
be put in question.
44.      Non-Farm Enterprises.  The  PCR  reports  this component as having
been very successful  (PCR,  para.  49).    It  was  designed to help small
"informal" enterprises to increase their efficiency and expand, thus
improving  the  off-farm  employment  opportunities.    Like  the extension
service, this component relied on access to credit at negative real
interest rate    to  fund  investment  by  participating small businessmen.
Just as for the extension component, the subsidized credit was part of a
"technical package" including better  accounting, sales promotion, business
planning, etc.   Some  assisted  small  enterprises  had several subsidized
loans. Unlike small farmers, many of the small businessmen graduated to
the use of unsubsidized credit, as the availability of subsidized credit
dried up. However, like small farmers, there seemed to be little interest
in the advisory services in the absence of credit. Since all costs of loan
administration  were  paid  by   the   project,   in  depth  study  of  the
beneficiaries would be needed before the PCR's judgment could be endorsed.16/
45.      Just as for extension this  component also had difficulty with the
non-availability of credit under the  project.    There  was also a lack of
direct contact with Bank supervision missions (para. 23).
46.      Hea th.   The  health  posts  and  associated  scheme for training
people from che community to provide simple health care, represented a
useful extension cf the health care system to rural people. The key to the
success of this component was the training of community members (usual two
people for three months) to carry out simple medical tasks, such as
inoculation, child delivery, bandaging and splints, diagnosis of comnon
illness or dehydration, etc.    Use  of  community members meant that wages
could be kept to the low level customary in the community (thus keeping
recurrent costs at an affordable level) but responsibility for primary
health also gave the health post attendant(s) recognition and status within
the community.
16/ See for instance, "Ventures in the Informal Sector, and How They
Worked Out in Brazil' AID Evaluation Special Study 12, USAID, March
1983, for a study of one of the implementing agencies at an earlier
period.



- 16 -
47.      Extension of this low  cost/low  technology health care meant that
many health problems were treated, which had previously simply gone
untreated.    This  system  also  allowed  more  serious  conditions  to be
recognized and sent to the local town for professional care. Whilst family
planning was not an explicit part of this component, the health post often
provided a place where interested women could ask a knowledgeable person
how to control their fertility. 17/
48.      At the time of the audit,  the health posts were suffering extreme
financial stringency. Better financing for salaries and recurrent costs is
a local matter which depends on the mayor's allocation of the municipal
budget. Health post staff and community leaders recognize that better
funding is likely to follow only when village level politicians lobby with
the mayor for better treatment.   No  doubt such agitation will take place,
and additional funding will be made available, when community leaders feel
that there has been a noticeable deterioration in the service available to
them.
49.      Education.  As for  health,  the  staffing  of the project schools
depends on teachers trained  in  the  community.   In Paraiba rural primary
school teachers monthly salary was only NCZ$6.00 (six New Cruzados), or
US$4.00 per month at the market rate of exchange.18/ From the viewpoint of
the local mayor who pays these salaries, this helps keep recurrent costs at
an affordable level.
50.      At such a low salary  level,  only very poorly trained local young
people are likely to be available as teachers. Teachers (usually girls
from the community) have often only finished second grade themselves. They
usually live with their families which get recognition for providing a
teacher.
51.      In this situation, attempts such  as  these made under the project
(PCR, para. 76(c)) to raise the formal qualifications and salaries of rural
teachere may have been ill-advised. If successful it could well reduce the
number of teachers, due to mayors being unable/unwilling to pay the
required salaries and or a shortage of suitable candidates. A more useful
strategy may be to recognize that for so .e time rural teachers are likely
to be under-qualified, and for this reason to attempt to upgtade their
skills through further training; with some accompanying augmentation,
towards the level of the basic wage, of the current extraordinarily low
salaries.
52.      The project has made a  useful  start in improving the educational
opportunities open to rural people.   Much  more  remains to be done, and a
good case could be made for state assistance to municipalities in paying
17/ Electrification and the associated spread of television has probably
had a role in reducing the reproductive rate.
18/ There may however be retirement and other benefits which raise the
total payment to a more reasonable level.

the cost of such  an  improvement.    However,  given the wide disparity in
rural incomes and professional salaries in Brazil, it will be important to
look for changes which will alLws the  local community to have r large role
in the improvement of the educational opportunities available to its
children.
53.      Evaluation.  In  Pernambuco  the  Federal  University  %as given a
contract covering monitoring and evaluation.    Data collection for a base-
line and final survey were financed as were several evaluative studies.
Inexplicably, no contract was entered into to cover the processing and
analysis of the final survey. Given the paucity of data on RD impacts in
the NE, it would be highly desirable for the collected data to be properly
analyzed and evaluated.
54.      Proiect Administration.  In Ceara and Paraiba administrative costs
per year were less than projected in the SAR, while these yearly costs in
Pernambuco were higher:
Administrative Annual Costs
Project                   Appraisal      Actual      Percent
----- USS '000 -----        SAR
Ceara                        303            215         71
Paraiba                      431            332         77
Pernambuco                   783          1,415        181
However, project implementation took  longer  than the projected five years
(six years in Ceara, eight in  Pernambuco and nine in Paraiba), while total
disbursements still fell somewhat below  projections.   The result was very
much higher administrative costs per dollar spent than had been foreseen in
the SAR:
Total Cost              Administrative Cost
Prolect         $ '000      Z SAR         $ '000          Z SAR
Ceara           23,572         56          2,943            90
Paraiba         24,684         47          2,659           123
Pernambuco    103,085         115          9,903           253
The increase in administrative costs per  dollar spent in Ceara and Paraiba
may also reflect unforeseen responsibilities for preparation of follow-on
and expanded projects.   In  Ceara  the  Bank  took active steps to control
costs (PCR, para. 58). Since TUs can be structured in many ways, this may
be a fruitful area for cross-project comparisons, and cost reduction in
future projects.



- 18 -
Economic Performance
55      'Although the projects  contained  evaluation components, in-depth
assessments of the impact the projects had had over a period of years are
not available. For instance, even after project completion practically no
quantitative data are available on farm practices, costs and returns."
(PCR, para. 73).19/
56.      In these  circumstances  it  would  be  misleading  to  attempt to
construct an ERR estimate.    The  audit's subjective assessment of project
outcomes have  already  boen  reported  in  para.  29.    This is basically
favorable, but with the cost of Bank funds for this project (evaluated in
February 1989) estimated to be in the range 13.4% to 20.0% in dollar terms,20/
the economic benefits are moot.
Sustainabilitv
57.      The  private  sector  changes  are  probably  highly  sustainable,
specifically farm investments in irrigation, the non-farm small business
investments, and  the  proliferating  activities  of  the  middlemen.   The
community based investments particularly health care and primary education,
are probably also  highly  sustainable.    As  are  roads (communities will
agitate for their improvement in the event that they become impassable) r.d
improved varieties introduced due to research.
58.      Clearly, the  credit  program  was  not  sustainable.   Subsidized
credit, viewed as primarily a grant program, wi'l have been of mixed
sustainability depending on the purpose for which the credit/grant was
used.
59.      Even  t1-  extensio.. ani  research  programs  have  continued  to
function for thrL, years after project closing, supported by follow-on
projects.  Extension, as currently  delivered to small farmers, is probably
too expensive to  be  sustainable  in  the  long-run  (pare.  33).   With a
redesigned community based delivery system to small farmers at lower costs,
and a significant expansion of services to commercial farmers, to widen the
basis of political support, extension too could become sLstainable.
Environmental Effects
60.      Smallholder rainfed production  of  annual crops generally results
in some soil loss. This will have been accelerated in the few areas where
land reform has resulted in new settlement. Extension has promoted contour
19/  The PCR in this case may  have  overlooked the base-line data which is
available as a result of the 1972-73 Bank-SUDENE survey of 8,000
farmers, reported in "The Economics of Farming in NE Brazil", Kutcher
and Scandizzo, World Bank, mimeo, 1974.
20/ See PPAR of Loan 2348-BR, "Agricultural Export Development Project,"
Attachment 2, for details of method of calculating the cost of Bank
funds.



- 19 -
farming, but without evidert impact.    In  Ceara, there has been excessive
use of insecticides on horticultural crops, with adverse offects both on
consumers and producers. Since this is both costly and dangerous, it is an
area where more could have been expected of extension.
Human Resource Development
61.      The health$ education and  small non-farm business components have
clearly had a direct and beneficial effect on the human development of the
target population.   The  projects'  group  orientation  has encouraged the
emorgence of group leaders. The focus of extensions on credit and social
contributions to the community, means that it has had little human resource
development impact beyond its group work.
62.      The  health   and   education   components   have   probably  been
Particularly beneficial to women.   Women  have  had equal access to health
care and educational services; and the health program has provided indirect
assistance to women with family  planning.   While no direct statistics are
available, observation suggests that most of the primary teachers are women
as are many of the  health  post  attendants.   While neither of these jobs
provides an attractive income nevertheless  women's role in providing these
vital services to the community must improve their social status.
63.      The rural road network has  greatly reduced the isolation of rural
people in the project areas. This will have increased the welfare of women
at least equally with  men.    The increased employment opportunities which
have become available over the life of the project, have reduced the need
for workers to migrate to the  south  over  the dry ; riod.  This will have
been conducive to more "normal" family life, and reduced the strain on
women forced to act as household head for long periods without the presence
of the husband. This is a major, but little noticed, benefit.
IV. FINDINGS AND ISSUES
Overview
64.      Brazilian Labor Market.  The achievements and limitations of these
three projects can only be properly appreciated in the context of the
economic and policy environment within which they have been called upon to
function.
65.      The primary objective of these projects to improve the incomes and
standard of living of the rural population in NE Brazil (para. 5), can be
achieved either by  higher  transfer  payments  21/    or  by higher earned
incomes for the rural poor.
21/  'Transfer  payments"  widely  defined   to  include  direct  payments,
subsidies on traded commodities, or provision of social services not
covered by local taxation.



- 20 -
66.      There are definite budgetary  limitations  to what can be achieved
by transfer payments,22/ thus the main hope for real progress in raising
the incomes of the rural poor must be in increasing cheir earned incomes.
But almost by definition, the poor have little to sell but their labor.
Increasing the earned incomes of the poor, thus means increasing their
labor income.
67.      A higher labor income can come from working longer hours, or being
paid more  per  hour.    Economic  theory  says,  and substantial empirical
observation supports this theory, that real wages tend to be fairly closely
correlated with labor produ..tivity.    Thus  higher  labor incomes could be
expected to follow from increased employment opportunities and higher labor
productivity.
68.      The prospects for "raising labor productivity' obviously vary very
substantially depending whethes one is talking of the proj-ct area, the NIS
in general, or indeed Brazil as a whole. 'Which is relevant depends on the
nature of the  Brazilian  market  for  unskilled  labor.    If it were very
fragmented, with poor communications between municipalities, high cost
transport, ethnic animosities, etc., then substantial wage premiums could
occur in the project area, without prompting migration. If, however, there
is a national market in unskilled labor, with good communication between
regions, reliable transport, ready acceptance of immigrants, etc., then an
increase in wages and job opportunities in the area will be self-dampening
as it prompts inward migration and thus an increased supply of labor, and
this cauaes ths increase in wages to be moderated.
69.      Tnus how far POLONORDESTE and the projects could be expected to go
in 'raising the incomes of the rural population", depends directly on the
nature of the Brazilian  market  for  uiiskilled  labor.   A number of signs
point to a highly integrated market, at least between the NE and the major
employment centers in the south. The NE has been an exporter or labor for
generations, so that almost all rural families have one or more relatives
established in Rio or Sao Paulo.    Migration  from the project area to the
south over the dry summer on an intra-year basis was well known prior to
the recent improvement in  employment  opportunities.   Examples of reverse
migration can be found where after a period of years people have found city
life in the south "too dangerous" and have preferred to return to their
families in the NE. Perhaps most telling is the daily direct bus service
that runs from Ubajara (a town of 50,000 in the Ceara project area) to Rio,
3,000 km to the south.
I,i.     Thus beyond some point the POLONORDESTE objective of raising rural
incomes will be best met by raising the productivity of labor in Brazil as
a whole, not just the  NE.    As  indicated  by putting it first, the audit
22/ A very valuable and significant contribution of these projects has
been to improve the coumnunity involvement in the provision of health
care and educational services, thus lowering the cost of providing the
service, and allowing a given transfer payment to have much increased
benefits.

regards this perspective on the determinants of labor product.vity as
esseatial to any strategic thinking about the problem of improving rural
incomes in the NE.23/
71.      Role of Commercial Farm Sector.  The extension and research thrust
of the projects has focussed on raising the productivity of small farmers
on their own farms. Valuable though this is, this orientation of extension
and research does little  directly  for  the  landless,241  and ignores the
additional  employment  opportunities  which   could  be  generated  by  an
expanding commercial farm sector.    A  major potentia'. source of increased
jobs, increased competition for labor, and higher wages, thus seems to have
been overlooked.
72.      Market Access.  As  is  well  known  increased productivity in the
face of not very elastic demand result primarily in benefits to the
consumer through lower prices (consumer surplus), rather than higher
incomes for producers.25/   The  relative  success of small scale irrigated
production '.n the project areas has rested on a buoyant demand from the
coastal cities which have been able to absorb increased supplies of fruits
and vegetables without a price collapse.
73.      The most elastic demand for  products is provided by international
trade, where any one country starts with a small proportion of the supply.
If the country's supply doubles this does not greatly affect total supply
which in turn means that any price depressing effects are minimal. This
suggests  that  a  key  to   the  successful  achievement  of  POLONORDESTE
objectives may be an export oriented agricultural expaision, as apparently
was achieved in Sergipe.    For  a  variety of institutional reasoas, large
scale private farms or firms may be much better at gaining access to
internaticnal  markets  than  are  small   farmers.    Improved  access  to
international markets  is  unlikely  to  be  achieved  by direct Government
planning, since trading opportunities are not known ex ante. It takes
initiative (usually private)  to  develop  them.    Once  a market has been
recognized and demonstrated (e.g., frozen orange juice for export in
23/ The Region has commented on paras. 64 to 70: "The academnic excursion
into the relation between income, labor, labor productivity and
internal migration is interesting, but does not fit well in the
chapter of Findings and Issues of this PPAR. This is especiaily true
as long as you have sizeable un- and under-employment all over Brazil
and the objective of the projects is to help tap the economic
potential/contribution of the NE."
24/  The  Region  notes   that   project   investments  in  infrastructure,
education, health, etc., were not small farm specific.
25/ See Kutcher and Scandizzo, 'The Agricultural Economy of Northeast
Brazil', Johns Hopkins Press, 1981, Table 7.7, page 192, for a
discussion of the relevance of this observation for RD in the NE.

Sergipe) then cooperative marketing by small farmers can have a major role
in its expansion.   To  date  the  three  RD projects make little provision
either for export led  agricultural  expansion,26/    or the possibly vital
role of the large commercial farm sector.
74.      Agricultural and Development  Policy.   Brazilian agricultural and
development policies are biased against agricultural exports from the NE.
A sumary of Brazil's agricultural policies is provided in Box 1.
Agricultural production costs are raised by industrial protection, and
subsidies for industrial exports.   Soya  bean exports (a southern product)
benefit  from  an  export  subsidy.    Meanwhile  unprocessed  agricultural
products from the NE have to be exported at the official rate of exchange
which currently imposes the equivalent of a 10 to 130 27/ percent ad
valorem export tax, as compared to exporting at the market rate of
exchange. The real cost of these policies is not the implicit tax on
exports from the NE, but rather the exports which have never been
developed, because industrial and exchange rate policy have nullified the
natural comparative advantage of the NE.28/
75.      By accepting  Brazilian  agricultural  and  development  policy as
given, there is a clear danger that the projects will provide expensive
26/  The Region notes: 'At the time  these projects were prepared, the idea
of fo.ussing on the promotion of export crops as a first stago. of farm
development would not have been very practical or realistic.'
27/  Associated Press - Dow Jones  reports  (May 10, 1989), that the 'black
price for dollars was 2.62-2.68 new cruzados, versus 1.048-1.053 new
cruzados at the official rate.
28/  Nothing in the projects'  description  of  the  RD  problems of the NE
gives the reader any hint that these might be the result of Brazilian
policies. Thus:
"II. BACKGROUND
Characteristics of the Northeast
2.01      The  30  rmillion  inhabitants of the Northeastern region, of
whom  nearly  602  are   rural,   constitute  the  largest  geographic
concentration of poverty stricken people in Latin America. Per capita
income of the area is less than half the national average. In the
rural areas, land ownership is extremely skewed; holdings with less
than 10 hectares constitute nearly 70% of the total number, but
control only 5.6% of  the  total  farm  area.    At the other extreme,
larger holdings over 500 hectares, representing only 1% of this number
account for nearly 40% of the total area. Share-croppers - the most
common form of sub-tenants - cultivate about one-fourth of the land
under more or less precarious forms of land tenure. ... The lack of
adequate farm services provided by the Government exacerbates these
problems.' (Paraiba, SAR).



- 23 -
credit and extension support to assist a farmer to produce traditional
crops, or carry an extra cattle beast, when he should really be prolucing
passion fruit for export.
76.      Unanswered Empirical Questions.   The  above  arguments point to a
large aumber of unanswered empirical questions. The result is that we know
very  little  about  such   key   questions   as  (a)  impact  of  national
agricultural, trade and development policies on the competitive position of
NE  agriculture,  (b)  the   demographic   characteristics  of  the  target
population, and attitudes to family size, (c) ways in which members of
target communities can be trained to provide social and other services to
the community, (d) the prospects for new agriculture products and/or for
research breakthroughs with existing products, (e) the scope for increased
employment from the commercial farm sector, (f) informal sources of credit
and its relation to marketing arrangements, and (g) possible export
potential for NE agricultural products.
77.      It may be that answers  to  these  questions would show that there
was and is little hope for improving on current RD strategies for the NE.
IIowever, unless the Bank and Government commit themselves to a serious
p.ogram of research into the economic, social, technical and demographic
characteristics of the NE we will never know.
Lessons
78.      Lack of a Development Strategy.   While she projects' objective of
improving the incomes and standard of living of the rural population in the
NE is clear, and while project interventions have had this effect in the
climatically favored project areas, there  is  still no convincing strategy
for rural development in the NE. It seems likely that increased demand for
labor in the NE will result in changed migration patterns rather than
significantly higher incomes, and that in any case there is very limited
scope for increased labor demand based solely on small scale irrigation and



- 24 -
domestic demand for irrigated crops.   The persistent question is:  what is
the technological basis for the proposed rural development?29/
79.      The audit  is  not  intended  to  say  "that  the  NE  program was
basically a failure." Rather it says that some things worked badly
(particularly most credit and much extension), but some worked well
particularly health, education, roads, marketing infrastructuro, research,
and that portion of credit invested in small-scale irrigation. However,
knowing (a) how little the projects could assist small farmers without
access to irrigation in the drier sub-project areas, and (b) the extent of
such dry conditions across the NE in general, the relatively favorable
results of the three prolects audited cannot safely be extrapolated to the
effects of the other proiects covered by POLONORDESTE. This is simply a
caution against  improper  extrapolation:    it  is  intended  to warn that
examination of these three modestly successful projects does not allow the
audit to conclude that all other projects must have been a success.
However, if there is a meaningful overall strategy for the NE, if there is
the necessary monitoring, evaluation and research activity to allow
29/ The Region has commented:
"There is a general perception by Regional staff, that RD
projects in Brazil have worked better than elsewhere. The repoL.:,
however, seems to say that the  NE erogram was basically a failure and
that 'there is still no convincing strategy for RD in the NE.' This
would seem to be an inappropriate conclusion to draw from an audit of
these three projects.   First,  these  RD  projects  were not meant to
constitute  a  comprehensive  strategy.    The  'direct  intervention'
approach exemiplified by the  POLONORDESTE  program is just one element
of an overall strategy  which  should  also  include  inter alia:  (a)
macroeconomic  and   sectoral   policy   changes   (which  the  report
emphasizes); (b) a continued transfer of labor into other sectors and
a  large-scale  commercial  agriculture;   and  (c)  a  massive  rural
education effort to complement both direct interventions and transfer
of labor. Secondly, the POLONORDESTE program cannot be judged on the
basis of the performance of only three projects (out of 46). Also, in
the light of statements like 'significant improvements in productivity
and output', 'the project came close to achieving their physical
targets', etc., in the PPAR, it would seem that these projects had an
undeniable impact on employment, incomes, and standard of living.
These are worth highlighting, especially taking account of the pilot
character  of  these  initial   operations   and  the  hostile  policy
environment.
The report goes out of his way to emphasize the limitations
imposed by a 'wrong'  macro-economic  framework.   The impact of these
policies may well have been significant, but the PPAR fails to
document empirically any direct cause/effect relation for any of these
projects.   We  make  this  point  not  to  belittle  the considerable
constraints imposed by unsuitable macro-policies, but to underline
that in the real, imperfect world, there is still some room for making
viable  investments  and  achieving   positive  results,  even  before
creating the macro-policy 'nirvana'."



- 25 -
development of a strategy, and if there is general sensitivity as to the
extent that the depressed state of the rural areas of the NE flows directly
from national policies, then these three rrojects have been largely
untouched by these activities.
80.      What has been done by the projects  is useful, but there is a lack
of clarity as to what can be achieved by such RD projects, both in
increasing earned incomes, and increasing the efficiency and amount of
transfer payments.
81.      Omitted Components.  Perhaps the  most surprising lesson from this
audit, is the value of having omitted any direct involvement in marketing
from the project design (para. 10).    This left 'space' for a middlemen to
emerge offering a much wider diversity of marketing services than could
have been built into any one marketing component (para. 40). Support of an
official marketing service or expanded support to the cooperatives would
very likely have been costly and have involved impediment to the evolution
of private sector services. This would have been to the detriment of small
farmers in  the  project  area.    Provision  of  marketing infrastructure,
particularly roads and market structures, on the other hand set the stage
for the emergence of the middlemen,  and fostered competition among them to
the great advantage of project beneficiaries.
82.      Use of Proiect Beneficiaries to Deliver Proiect Services.  In both
the health and education components, local peiple were trained to provide
services to their communities. This kept cost of services to a manageable
level and greatly enhances the probability that these services will
continue to be provided (paras. 46 to  52).   As suggested in para. 33, the
same principle could well prove appropriate in reducing tle cost of
delivering extension services  to  small  farmers.    This  is very much an
empirical question, depending on the techniques to be extended and need to
tailor advice to individual farmers.    Sometimes it will be appropriate to
use "village assistants', sometimes not.   However, if an extension officer
can teach a farmer (or group of farmers) a new technique, it is relevant to
ask: could he not teach the farmer to teach his neighbors?
83.      Suppor-ive Research.  As indicated earlier (para. 76) the research
program underpinning the NERD program has been almost non-existent. It is
not meaningful to talk of a RD strategy for the NE in the absence of such
information. 30/ This points to the need for a substantial (say at least
US$2 million per year on a continuing basis) research program to study the
30/ Little seems to have changed since Kutcher and Scandizzo reported on
the  Bank-SUDENE  survey:      "In   discussions  with  various  groups
undertaking analysis of development problems in the Northeast, it
became apparent that a data and information base was virtually non-
existent; an in-depth research effort as intended would have to focus
on this question.    Operating  departments  within  the Bank, as they
began to shift their focus to the Northeast at about the same time,
were discovering this information/data problem simultaneously.", in
The Economics of Farming in NE Brazil, World Bank, mimeo, 1974.



- 26 -
economic, social, technical and demographic characteristics of the region
and population to be assisted, and the effects of national policies on the
region.
84.      An active zesearch program could  be  expected to place demands on
project monitoring and evaluation systems, which would result in their
performance being significantly upgraded, thus providing a very valuable
and direct benefit from the research program.
85.      National Policy Review.    As  brought  out  in para. 13, national
agricultural, trade and development policies seem likely to have an adverse
effect on the competitive position of agriculture in the NE. A compre-
hensive review of these policies should be undertaken so that proposals can
be made to allow the NE's natural comparative advantage to express itself.
86.      Modified  Extension  System.       Direct  fortnightly  face-to-face
contact of extension staff with each small farmer group may represent
luxury use of extension  resources.    Thought  should  be  given to use of
community members to reduce the cost of extension (para. 33).
87.      Restoration of Extension  Service  to  Commercial  Farmers.  Since
intensified production on commercial farms can provide some additional
jobs, a modest extension effort aimed at increasing the efficiency of
commercial farms should probably be introduced in the RD strategy. There
may also be some p,)tential for transfer of technology from large to small
farms.
88.      Grants and  Credit.    As  noted  in  para.  30,  unforeseen rapid
inflation converted what was meant to be a credit program with modest
negative interest rates to almost completely a grant program. A grant
program which, in the event, the Government wisely left two-thirds
unfunded. This points to the need to distinguish clearly between a credit
program in which the real value of the credit, plus interest, is repaid;
and a grant program where It  is  not.    Since  credit was over 30% of all
three projects, and the PCR does not draw specific lessons with respect to
the component, it may be worth expanding briefly on relative roles of
credit and grants.
89.      A credit should be repaid;  this  preserves the capital for re-usa
by other borrowers.   However,  it  means  that  some  form of assurance of
repayment is needed, usually secu. ity but properly organized coimnunity
pressure, or highly profitable investments, also serve. This usually means
relatively high administrative co ts and difficulty in assisting the
assetless. However, it also means that relatively large sums can be
advanced because it is to be repaid.
90.      A grant, on the other  hand,  does  not  have  to be repaid.  This
means that (a) it can be easily used to reach the vary poor, and (b) cannot
be large since  no  recovery  is  expected.    A  grant should be carefully
targetted with an explicit purpose (to intrLduce farmers to new seeds or
fertilizer, or to demonstrate for one family in a village an improved
method of water collection, etc.).



- 27 -
91.      Both credit and grants can be used as valuable developmental tools
in  the  right  circumstances;   but   they   should   not  be  treated  as
interchangeable.    Official  credit  now  has  such  a  checkered  history
(incomplete monetary connection, full OTN leading to forgiveness, etc.)
that farmers are suspicious of credit with full monetary connection.
Experiments are being conducted in Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte with
initial success, with credit to be repaid in product so as to return a
competitive real interest rate. There are indications from this audit that
farmers would use such a  facility.    In the absence of subsidized credit,
farmers  are  borrowing  modest   amounts   of  unsubsidized  credit  where
available. Thus substantially refuting the view that subsidized credit was
needed in the first place.
92.      Paternalistic and Ideological Land  Reform.   Land reform is being
practiced in many ways. As administered by MIRAD in Ceara it acts to limit
the  income  earning  capacity  of  settlers  (para.  36).    This  type of
ideological land reform serves to limit development potential and should be
dropped.
93.      Resolution of the INCRA  Title  Registration  Impasse.  As brought
out in para. 1l(iii), every effort should be made to ensure that land
reform provides farms of economic size, and that title then be transferred
to the farmers.
94.      Release of Counterpart Funds.    There  is a continuing problem of
late release of counterpart funds leading to erosion of their real value by
inflation, and morale problems  for  unpaid  sraff.    This is a ubiquitous
problem throughout the public sector, nevertheless every effort should be
made to find ways that project funds can be released ?romptly.
95.      The latter two lessons  are  mentioned more for completeness, than
in any expectation that a satisfactory solution will be found. They are
well recognized and long standing problems.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       Since the late 1800s, the Northeast has been viewed as Brazil's
foremost "problema area". The country's wealthiest region during the sugar
boom of the colonial period, the Northeast subsequently lagged behind as
industrial, agricultural, and commercial activity shifted to the South. In
1973, the Bank and the government initiated a dialogue on rural development
issues and strategies for the Northeast. The dialogue coincided with, and
was partially the result of, a growing interest on the part of the Bank and
the government in poverty-oriented, integrated rural development programs.
In October 1974, the Program of Development of Integrated Areas of the
Northeast (POLONORDESTE) was created. It sought to increase the production,
productivity, incomes, and standards of living of small-scale farmers and
their families in selected micro-regions. Bank involvement followed a Bank-
funded research project (Loan 670-73) begun in 1973 to study the
agricultural economy of the region, although research results from this
project did not become available until several of the early projects were
under way. Over the next decade, the Bank financed ten POLONORDESTE projects
in eight Northeast states.
2.       The POLONORDESTE projects represent the first generation of rural
development projects in Northeast Brazil. Reviews of POLONORDESTE and other
Northeast rural programs were carried out by the government end the Bank
during the 1980s. Drawing on these interim assessments, a second generation
of projects began in April 1985 with the signing of the first two loans for
the new Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP) in the states of Rio
Grande do Norte and Sergipe. Subsequently, under the NRDP, the Northeast
Region Land Tenure Improvement Project (Loan 2593-BR) and 8 more projects
for other Northeast states (Pernambuco - Loan 2718; Bahia - Loan 2761; Piaui
- Loan 2762; Ceara - Loan 2763; Paraiba - Loan 2860; Minas Gerais - Loan
2861; Maranhao - Loan 2862; and Alagoas - Loan 2863) have been financed.
3.       This report is a combined Project Completion Report for the second
(Ceara - Loan 1488), third (Paraiba - Loan 1537) and sixth (Pernambuco -
Loan 1728) Rural Development Projects in the Bank-financed POLONORDESTE
series. The main text focuses on background and performance of all three
projects. An annex on each project contains basic completion information.

II. PROJECT FORMULATION AND DESCRIPTION
Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
4.       The project for the Serra da Ibiapaba region in the State of Ceara
(CE) was prepared by a team in the state's Agricultural Planning Commission
(CEPA-CE), assisted by a number of visits of Bank staff and consultants. The
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) notes that particular attention was given to
the selection and refining, from a somewhat larger package of investments
included in the original project proposal, of those investments most
urgently ioquired to reach agricultural production targets, and those social
and productive support improvements considered feasible in light of the
administrative capabilities offering those services. The project was to
build upon initial POLONORDESTE-funded activities and investments: (i) begun
in 1976 (coffee expansion, construction of a produce trans-shipment market,
feeder roads, electrification, research, and the early recruitment and
training of project staff); and (ii) planned construction of a storage
facility and of a private alcohol refinery. It was recognized that the
project as a whole and especially the social components (health and
education) were complex. However this alone was not considered a reason to
exclude them from the project.
5.       The project for the Brejo area of Paraiba (PB) was prepared by
CEPA-PB. During project preparation several Bank missions assisted in
developing the project components. Building on the comprehensive design in
Ceara, the Paraiba project fLrther extended the scale and range of
activities under the government's ruz.al development program in the
Northeast, with the inclusion of support for the development of small-scale
non-agricultural enterprises. This component was one of the first of its
type proposed for Bank financing. The project also took into account the
early lessons learned during the implemaentation of the Rio Grande do Norte
Project (Loan 1195-BR), particula.Ly in agricultural extension and research,
credit, and project management.
6.       The original Agreste Setentrional Rural Development Project in the
state of Pernambuco (PE) was prepared by the Development Institute of
Pernambuco (FUNDEPE) and was initiated early in 1977. Due to the importance
of the area, the state government requested Bank participation in the
project in November 1977. The Bank expressed willingness to consider such
participation, provided that the original project would be reformulated for
Bank financing, which was agreed. The original proposal consisted of a
series of isolated program for small- and medium-sized farms of up to 100
ha, scattered across the project area. The revised proposal, which was
prepared by the Technical Unit for Coordination within the State Secretariat
of Planning with assistance from Bank missions, had a broader and more
integrated base and was intended to build on the results already achieved in
the original project. During pieparation the milk processing capacity in the
project area was studied carefully, to ensure that this was adequate to
absorb the projected incremental production.
7.       A high level of Bank staff input was necessary during preparation
and appraisal of all three projects. This can be attributed to their multi-
sectoral nature and the need for a variety of specialists. From
identification to Board Presentation, there were seven missions in Ceara



- 33 -
(identification, three preparations, appraisal, post-appraisal,
negotiations) and a total staff input of 236 weeks; five in Paraiba
(identification, preparation, appraisal, post-appraisal, negotiations) and a
total staff input of 282 weeks; and six missions in Pernambuco
(identification, two preparations, appraisal, post-appraisal, negotiations)
and a total staff input of 210 weeks.
Negotiations and Board Approval
8.       For all three projects, at negotiations the Bank reluctantly
accepted the government's decisicn to extend on-farm investment and working
capital credit to low income farmers, landless sharecroppers and tenants at
low, unindexed interest rates. Given Brazil's annual inflation rate of about
40Z over the three years 1977-79, the interest rates adopted by the
government for POLONORDESTE projects were highly negative in real terms.
Interest rates were marginally increased in early 1978, from 72 to 1OZ for
small loans and from 12X to 142 for large loans, but a considerable subsidy
remained. The government, at the time, was reluctant to reduce the subsidy
further for small farmer programmes such as POLONORDESTE. Since the
beneficiaries of the proposed projects were mainly in the lower income
classes, and since it was intended that the possibility of misallocation of
resources would be contained through close supervision under the technical
assistance programmes, the SARs suggested that the Bank should be prepared
to acquiesce to the government's position (see below).
9.       At negotiations, the Brazilian Delegation raised other major points
only in connection with the Ceara project. Firstly, it questioned the
limited scope of the education component. Consequently, the Bank agreed to
review the education component if performance clearly indicated that the
school construction and teacher training program as defined in the Loan
Agreement would be substantially completed during the first three years of
the project, and if the goals of an increased student population and
increased retention of students within the cducation system were met.
Secondly, the Delegation suggested that an explicit statement be made in the
loan documents to the effect that credit would be provided exclusively to
small-scale farmers, instead of establishing a credit ceiling (i.e., 200 ha
maximum) based on farm size. In view of the fact that the proposed credit
limit per beneficiary of about US$ 6,000 equivalent would provide an
effective mechanism to ensure that credit would be broadly distributed to
smaller-scale operations, it was agreed to dispense with the proposed
ceiling on farm size.
10.      For the Ceara loan the Board raised two issues: (i) the lack of a
population planning program - this had not been included in the project
because of the federal government's strong historical reluctance to sponsor
such activities; and (ii) the dangers of misallocating capital, since loans
to the project's ultimate beneficiaries would carry negative real interest
rates. On the latter, the staff and Chairman responded that the Bank had
consiscently urged a change to more reilistic interest rates, but this had
had, as yet, little impact on the government's policy: it had simply led to
a refusal of the Bank to support agricultural projects in Brazil for several
years. This had only changed with the development of projects in which
supervision and extension services were strong enough to protect against a
serious misallocation of resources.

11.      The Board welcomed the Paraiba project because it was a multi-
sectoral integrated response to the needs of a target group that deserved
the Bank's fullest suppert; and it welcomed the Bank's willingness to
finance a large share of local costs (see below). The Board again Lcised the
two issues which had been discussed at approval of the Ceara project: (i) a
possible population planning program (which had not been included in the
Paraiba project on the same grounds as in Ceara); and (ii) the negative
interest rates in real terms on sub-loans under the agricultural credit
component. The concern of the Board about the interest rates was reflected
in a number of speakers' statements. These illustrated the dilemma of trying
to pursue macroeconomic objectives through project lending; the Board
recommended that there should be a wider dialogue with government on
adjustments in overall economic management policies. The Board also
questioned: (i) the project's capacity for benefitting sharecroppers, who
accounted for 262 of the target groups, and who were unable - under land
tenure arrangem.'nts at the time - to derive optimal benefits from the
project; and (ii) the cap- ity of beneficiaries to repay investment costs.
The importance of secure land tenure as part of rural development and the
limited capacity of beneficiaries to repay investment costs, were
increasingly recognized during implementation of the project.
12.      The Board again welcomed the Pernambuco project as well-designed
and directed towards meeting baslc needs in a poverty area that needed
assistance. It asked for further clarification of the rationale for
financing if local salary costs in Brazil, since up to 18Z of the loan
amount - US$ 7.2 million - had been earmarked ifr salaries. The staff
replied that by participatirg in the prcvision of salaries fcr incremental
staff, the Bank gained an influence on both job cescrintion and staff
selection that was felt helpful in aiding institutional development.
The Project Areas
13.      All three project areas were extended during execution. The
projects varied considerably in area and population as shown in the table
below:
Project         Municipalities                Area                 Population

Paraiba       14            21       1,580       3,120        187            n.a.
Pernambuco   31             36       10,820      11,560      1,000           n.a.
14.      The Ceara project area was located on a plateau (Serra da
Ibiapaba) in the northwestern part of the state. Rainfall increases from
less than 1,000 mm per year in the lowlands to 1,900 mm in the higher
areas, with a heavy concentration (902) during the period December to June.
As a result of climate, topography and soil characteristics, the area was
divided into three land capability classes: the relatively dry western part
(carrasco), which covers about 702 of the area, with moderate to poor
agricultural potential; the central humid and subhumid zone, corresponding
to 202 of the area, with good agricultural potential; and the lower eastern



- 35 -
part (sertao), which covers about 10? of the area, with limited
agricultural possibilities. The Ibiapaba area had considerable potential
for increased production of a variety of crops including coffee, corn,
bananas, sugarcane, beans, manioc, peanuts and miscellaneous other
vegetables and fruits through both expansion of the cropped area and
increases in yields. Geographically, the area was situated so as to make it
one of the most important sources of food supply for several urban areas in
the Northeast and North of Brazil.
15.      The Paraiba project area (the Brejo) was located in the eastern
part of the state. The Brejo benefits from favorable climatic conditions
with rainfall well distributed over a six-month period. Most of the soils
found in the area are of medium to low fertility. For agricultural
development, three different sub-areas were distinguished according to the
cropping pattern. The potato sub-area (202 of the total area) benefits from
800 mm to 1,000 mm of annual rainfall, has very sandy soils and is
traditionally specialized in potato production; the second sub-area (20Z of
the total area) has similar physical conditions, but is more specialized in
cotton and in traditional food crops; the third sub-area (60? of the area)
benefits from higher rainfall (between 1,100 mm and 1,400 mm), presents a
more broken topography and has a highly diversified cropping pattern
(subsistence crops, sugarcane, fruits, and dairy cattle).
16.      The Pernambuco project was located in the state's eastern
intermediate area (agreste setentrional). The topography ranges from the
billy more humid areas in the East, through the flat central plains, to the
more mountainous West. The mean annual rainfall decreases from 1,100 mm in
the East to 500 to 700 nun in the West. Soils are of medium fertility.
Ground water resources are limited, costly to exploit and high in salt
content. On the basis of these ecological conditions, agricultural
development is very localized and varies within short distances; several
municipalities are characterized by cultivation of special crops, such as
carrots in Brejo da Madre de DioE and pineapples in Riacho das Almas. The
agreste is a region which plays a complementary role in the development of
the coastal lands by supplying the Recife metropolitan area with food and
the sugar belt with seasonal labor.
17.      The project areas are periodically affected by droughts. A
particularly prolonged and acute peak in the cyclic droughts happened to
coincide with a large part of the intended project periods (1979-83). In
terms of production results, the crops hit hardest by droughts were cotton
and subsistence food crops on which small holders and sharecroppers in the
project areas were most dependent. In addition to the droughts, the cotton
crop in the project areas was devastated by the arrival of the boll weevil
(bicudo) in the Northeast region in 1983.
Objectives and Agricultural Development Strategy
18.      The projects shared the objective of increasing the production,
incomes, and living standards of small farmer families within well-defined
geographic areas. They also sought to increase incomes from small-scale
non-farm enterprises. Improving the effectiveness of institutions
participating in the projects was another important common objective.



- 36 -
19.      The three project, employed a common agricultural development
strategy; at appraisal, there was evidence that the project areas were
beginning to 'take off' in economic terms, primarily because of the
building of new access roads and the better marketing opportunities that
this represented. The strategy was therefore to hasten the natural
development process by improving the support services and infrastructure
available to farmers. However, the thrust of the individual projects
differed:
a) in Ceara, the aim was to increase small farmers' production of
the traditional subsistence crops (manioc and beans) and of
the profitable cash crops (sugaicane, citrus, passion fruits,
vegetables, and peanuts); the increase of production was
expected to result from an expansion of about 200Z over 8-9
years of cropped areas by the participating fdrmers and an
average improvement in yields of about 50Z over the respective
pre-project levels;
b) in Paraiba, the thrust was to increase production especially
of profitable potatoes, citrus, bananas and cotton (both as a
resul, of sizeable increases of yields and areas planted); of
manioc, beans and sugarcane (considerable increases of yields
were expected to offset decreases of areas planted); and of
milk and meat;
c) in Pernambuco, the intention was to diversify small farmer
activities from the traditional cultivation of subsistence
crops into more remunerative vegetable and fruit crops;
previous levels of subsistence food production (manioc, beans
and corn) were expected to be maintained (a reduction in the
planted areas was projected to be offset by increases in
yields), and the area under improved pastures and fruit and
vegetable crops was to be expanded.
Project Components
20.      The main components of the three projects were credit for on-farm
development, agricultural extension and rural infrastructure (roads
construction and improvement, also electrification in Ceara), which
accounted for three-fourths of total baseline costs. The projects also
financed complementary investments which were relatively less important in
terms of cost, none of these accounted for more than 82 of total baseline
costs, but which were considered indispensable for project success. Some
components were added during execution. The components financed under the
projects, as foreseen at appraisal, respectively later included, are shown
overleaf:

21.      In addition to expansion of their areas and extension of the
project periods, the Ceara and Paraiba projects were modified during
execution. The Ceara project was reformulated in June 1982. At the same
time, the loan Closing Date was extended for three years to December 31,
1985. It was administratively absorbed by the successor Ceara Second Rural
Development Project (Loan 1924-BR) which was approved on December 2, 1980
and had essentially the same components but covered the entire state. The
main thrust of the Ceara pro,ect (Loan 1488-BR) was subsequently directed
toward the drier and less fertile carrasco sub-region. Bank participation
was addressed especially to production support activities. In contrast, the
social services components were to be pursued by the state under the new
Loan 1924-BR. The changes in the Ceara project reflect three important
trends in the state's development: (i) the decision to provide special
attention to the situation of the rural poor of the carrasco sub-region;
(ii) shift of emphasis in rural development projects toward production
support activities; and (iii) pursuit of social service improvements (which
suffered institutiornal capacity pioblems) through special efforts on a
state-wide basis.
22.      The Paraiba project was extended and modified in December 1983,
and it was was buised on a 3-year program. The Closing Date was postponed by
one year to September 30, 1984. Further postponement of the Closing Date
was foreseen. The main approved modifications were: (i) expanding the land
titling and distribution component; (ii) expanding the technical assistance
to small-scale non-farm enterprises; (iii) extending the health and
sanitation component; (iv) reducing the marketing and storage component;
and (v) dropping a cold storage unit for potato seed, since capacity of the
1,000 ton store constructed at Alagoinha was adequate for the project's
needs, and the social extension component (social extensionists of the
agricultural extension service already located in the area provided the
necessary services).
Organization and Management
23.      There was a large number of agencies involved in all three
projects. At the federal level, the Ministry of the Interior (MINTER) held
formal responsibility for program policy-makitig and for coordinating the
activities of the various sectoral agencies involved in POLONORDESTE,
including the Ceara, Paraiba and Pernambuco projects. MINTER performed
routine administrative tasks: channeling the resources to the states,
monitoring their use, and consolidating reports from SUDENE on POLONORDESTE
and other programs. The federal Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN) focused
mainly on general policy issues, funding decisions including determination
of available program resources, and overall evaluation of special programs.
The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) also participated ill decisions
regarding POLONORDESTE.
24.      At the regional level, the Superintendency for Development of the
Northeast (SUDENE) had responsibility for the coordination of POLONORDESTE.
Regional coordination functions included setting (together with Ministry
technicians) overall and sectoral guidelines for the program, assisting the
states in project preparation and annual. planning, monitoring project
execution, and maintaining liaison with the federal entities involved. The
projects were implemented by existing federal and state line agencies,



- 39 -
comeercial banks, agricultural cooperatives, and municipalities. A non-
governmental organization (NGO) also participated in project execution: the
Basic Education Unit (MEB) was one of the executing agencies of the
vocational training sub-component for the Ceara project. The number of
executing and collaborating agencies by project is shown below:
Proiect                Executing Agencies      Collaborating Agencies
---__------------- -Number --------------------

Paraiba                        13                         14
Pernambuco                     16                         24
25.      Coordination of each project and the establishaent of policy
guideline. was done by a Management Council (Conselho Director) composed of
the State Secretaries responsible for the implementing agencies. The State
Secretary of Planning was appointed head of the Council for the Ceara and
Pernambuco projects, while the State Secretary of Agriculture was President
of the Council in Paraiba. Responsibility for implementation of project
components was assigned by the Management Council through written
agreements (convenios and scb-convenios) with the relevant State
Secretaries and implementing agencies.
26.      Technical Units were set up to car:y out day to day coordination
of project activities, finalize annual operating pians with the operating
agencies, provide technical support, and serve as the liaison link between
the executing agencies, the Management Council and the financing agencie3.
The Units' organizational arrangements and functions were similar in all
three states. In Ceara, the Unit was established in the State Agricultural
Planning Commission (CEPA-CE). It was supervised by the manager (General
Coordinator) of CEPA-CE, who reported to the Management Council through the
State Secretary of Planning. In addition, a separate Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit was set up, which answered directly to the General
Coordinator of CEPA-CE. In Paraiba, the Technical Unit was set up under the
responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture in his function as President
of the Management Council. In addition to project coordination, the Unit
was also responsible for project monitoring. In Pernambuco, the Government
had established a Technical Unit within the Secretariat of Planning which
oversaw the four POLONORDESTE projects in the state. With the increasing
workload separete Management Units (gv.rencias) were set up in 1978 for each
project, including the Agreste Setentrional project. The Unit was also
responsible for monitoring the project. Since the project executing state
and federal line agencies reported directly to state political leaders,
the Technical Units were obliged to coordinate the activities of agencies
over which they had little control. Also they did not have direct control
over project resources.
Costs and Financing
27.      The total project costs over the five year implementation periods
were estimated at USS 55.8 million for Ceara, USS 67.3 million for Paraiba,
and USS 116.7 million for Pernambuco. The projects had a relatively low
foreign exchange content (20Z in Ceara and Paraiba, 16t in Pernambuco).



- 40 -
This situation was due to the capability of the Brazilian economy to
produce the inputs required by the projects. Therefore at appraisal it vas
considered appropriate - in order to be effective in supporting projects of
this kind - for the bank to assist in financing part of the local currency
expenditures on the projects. Consequently the Board approved financing 302
of total project costs net of taxes of the Ceara project, and 35Z for the
Paraiba and Pernambuco projects. In 1983, the projects verc included in the
Special Action Programe (SAP) for agricultural projects in Brazil. Under
the SAP, the average disbursement share was raised to 67.52 of eligible
expenditures until December 31, 1985, and lovered to 502 thereafter. The
costs and financing situation of the projects are shown overleaf (details

B. Common Project Components1
Credit for On-Farm Development
29.      Farm credit was a major component of all three projects (312 of
total baseline costs in Ceara, 392 in Paraiba, and 502 in Pernambuco).
However disbursements for credit were low (352 of the Loan amount allocated
in Ceara, 162 in Paraiba, and 322 in Pernambuco). Sub-loans for seasonal
credit were relatively less important than for investments by a factor of
1:3. Information on the individual credit programs is scanty: some 980 sub-
I/ In the following, targets for the Ceara and Paraiba projects refer to
the Updated appraisal Estimates, unless otherwise noted.



- 41 -
loans (192 of the Annual Operating Plan target) were made to finance
working capital requirements and on-farm investments in the Ceara project;
no data are available on sub-loans under the Paraiba project; and around
13,790 credit plans (double the target) were approved in the Pernambuco
project, where the credit for on-farm investment was largely used for
livestock (as was likely also in the other projects). This was a deviation
from the original aim of also financing establishment of permanent crops
and other permanent on-farm improvements such as storage installations and
reservoirs. The main problems were: (i) new Bank lending for agricultural
credit was suspended from 1981-83 due to disagreement with government on
interest rate policies, and short-term credit (custeio) was largely
suspended in 1984/85 and 1985/86 by the Central Bank due to economy
measures; (ii) the drought reduced working capital needs and planned
investments of small farmers and sharecroppers who received technical
assistance and who may have wished to borrow during more normal times;
(iii) few farmers had adequate loan guarantees, including land titles, for
medium- and long-term loans; (iv) credit was not available at the time of
farmers' most urgent needs; (v) local banks had more lucrative investment
opportunities than comparatively small loans for agriculture; and (vi)
problems of information and communication between extensionists and banks.
Agricultural Extension
30.      This was another major component of all three projects. Costs were
projected at 132 of total baseline costs in Paraiba, 112 in Ceara, and 102
in Pernambuco. Actual disbursements of the loans practically met (Paraiba),
or exceeded (Ceara and Pernambuco), the loan amounts which had been
originally allocated. The overruns in Ceara and Pernambuco are explained by
the expansion of the project areas and the extension of the project
periods. In all three projects, agricultural extension services were
reoriented towards the small farmers. Group extension was emphasized and
this improved the efficiency of the services (supported by research).
31.      In Ceara the main themes were: the introduction of new cash crops
(tomato, pepper, carrot) and fruits (passion fruit); introduction of
disease resistant manioc varieties; and use of fertilizers and animal
traction. The target of beneficiary farmers was exceeded (8,730 farmers or
1472). The number of farmers assisted per extensionist (2"0) was larger
than projected at appraisal (60) s.nce recruitment of extensionists fell
short of targets (38 or 642) and more farmers were reached than foreseen.
However the definition of "farmers assisted" is wide and possibly includes
producers who may have had only minimal contact with :he extension service.
The quality of services was adversely affected by: (i) the frequent
turnover of field staff as a result of falling real ss.aries, imposed in
response to Brazil's deepening economic crisis; (ii) tne drought when
project-financed extensionists were presumably put onto other tasks; (iii)
difficulty of access to credit by the small farmers; and (iv)
unavailability of quality fertilizers and seeds. In addition, the
extensionists lacked technical packages for the small farmers related to
use of modern inputs, especially for optimal use of fertilizers and
pesticides. However there were cases where the extensionists attempted to
reduce the excessive use of plant protection chemicals, based on the
experience of field trials. The obligation to comply with numerous



- 42 -
regulations, forms and procedures imposed by the federal extension
authorities reduced the total amount of time which the extensionists could
devote to actual field work. Also the extensionists' activities wvre
dispersed over several programs (POLONORDESTE, PROALCOOL, PROTERRA, Social
Services, Credit, Forward Crop Purchasing) which jeopardized their
principal eztension responsibility under the project. Coordination between
the Ceara Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Company (EMATER-CE) and
social services was poor, which was reflect ' in duplication of campaigns
for water filters and latrines, sewing courses, and comunity development.
Extension in the carrasco zone was light, although at project reformulation
it was intended that it would be given priority.
32.      In Paraiba, the target of number of assisted farmers was almost
met (7,400 or 862). Extension generally suffered from the same problems as
in Ceara. Modification of the project in December 1983 was an opportunity
to address the problems affecting project implementation, and to introduce
cropping patterns better adapted to the drought. However the project
largely continued implementing the extension programs which had already
been in progress. In 1983 the cotton crop was devastated by the arrival of
the boll weevil (bicudo) in the Northeast. Cotton represented a major
source of income for many farmers, with limited possibility of viable
diversification in the short run. The government took steps to (i)
intensify research for more efficient control measures; and (ii) sell
insecticides. As this pest devastated the entire Northeast cotton area, an
FAO-CP mission reviewed the situation of the cotton crops and advised the
Bank on the viability of a regional pest management program, and on
measures for cotton rehabilitation in the Northeast states. The review
concluded that control only paid if potential yield was very high, thus
effectively eliminating cotton as an income source for all tree cotton
producers and many others as well. As the chances of rapidly finding an
alternative cash crop for the semi-arid are limited, Paraiba, as well as
Ceara, are implementing a cotton rehabilitation program (successfully
initiated in Brazil's southern states) based on a new technological package
(short-season seeds, better crop agronomy and improved chemical control of
the boll weevil). This rehabilitation program is being financed partly
through the NRDP projects for these states.
33.      In Pernambuco, the target number of farmers benefitting from
agricultural extension was exceeded under the project (23,000 or 1482).
However, again the work of EMATER-PE extensionists was affected by periodic
lack of on-farm credit, the drought, and frequent rotation of staff. Also
during the drought many of the staff were involved in emergency relief
operations and therefore the service had no active role in developing
cropping patterns adapted to the drought. Thereafter, however, EMATER-PE
installed demonstration plots which were technically well:managed; they
showed various production systems (including both monocropping and multiple
crops) and used traditional and improved technology. The extensionists also
played an active part in assisting farmers' applications for credit.
Agricultural Research
34.      In Ceara, the appraisal of this component suggested that
experiments would be focussed on the small farm as production unit and that
trials would be located both on producers' farms and on agricultural
research stations; 15 experimental plots and 12 production system trials



- 43 -
were set up, and thus targets were exceeded, but most of this work was done
initially on the research facilities themselves. The main factor, which
initially limited the research program, was insufficient cooperation
between the Ceara Agricultural Research Company (EPACE) and EMATER-CE in
defining the experimental programs to meet the declared component target,
(i) to improve reliability and profitability of subsistence and cash crops
in the various sub-regions; (ii) to cope with the drought; and (iii) to
enhance integration of agriculture and livestock development. Later,
however, because of new regional directives, coordination between EPACE and
EMATER-CE was closer, the research program improved, experiments focused on
the small farm as a farming system, and many trials took place on
producers' farms.
35.      In Paraiba, government agencies, when redirected under the project
to support small-scale producers instead of larger commercial growers,
failed to adapt their technical approach to the small producers' philosophy
and continued to approach commodities on an individual basis. Activities
focussed most notably on potatoes, oranges and bananas, rather than on the
small property as a whole, or on the producer as the manager of a
relatively high-risk integrated enterprise (both in terms of climate and of
investment costs). In this sense the 230 demonstration plots and 10 trials
which were set up were not really effective for small-farm development,
although the numerical targets for this work were met.
36.      In Pernambuco, most experiments were carried out on farmers'
fields with participation of EMATER-PE extensionists. The State
Agricultural Research Institute (IPA-PE) cooperated closely in defining the
trials and transferring their results to farmers. Cooperation between
EMATER-PE and IPA-PE was enhanced with the secondment of an EMATER-PE
extensionist to the Research Station in Caruaru in 1980. IPA-PE developed
several improvements which were readily taken up by the farmers: new
varieties of beans, tomatoes, and carrots; cultivation of manioc with
animal traction and improved spacing between plants; new crop associations;
soil conservation; and the introduction of potato cultivation. However IPA-
PE did not succeed in identifying improvements to insulate farmers from the
effects of drought.
Seeds and Seedlings
37.      The availability of certified seed was a problem in Ceara, and the
state had to rely on imports of often poor quality seed from the sout.h. A
seeds component had not been foreseen at appraisal, but the project was
flexible enough to address the problem of lack of quality seeds. Under a
modification adopted while the project was in progress, EPACE produced
basic seed at its research station network, and the Ceara-Organization of
Cooperatives (OCEC) assisted in handling the multiplication of certified
seed. EMATER-CE coordinated the work on seed production with EPACE and
OCEC. The project provided irrigation equipment to help assure the
production of basic seed by EPACE. However it is not clear what proportion
of the state's seed requirements are now met this way.
38.      In Paraiba, the State Agricultural Research Company (EMEPA) made
considerable progress in the production of certified (and basic) seed on
its research stations. The seed processing plant at Alagoinha provided



- 44 -
around one third of the state's requirements for bean and corn seed
(September 1984). The production of banana and fruit tree seedlings in the
station of Mangabeiras developed rapidly, thanks to construction of a
reservoir for irrigation. Disease resistant banana suckers, especially,
found a ready market, as a result of the successful campaign against Panama
disease and expansion of the project area. However EMEPA was less
successful in promoting improved citrus seedlings due to the impact of the
drought and farmers' land tenure problems.
39.      The seeds component in the Pernambuco project was implemented by
the State Seeds and Seedlings Company (SEMEMPE), which produced seeds for
basic food crops (beans and corn), cotton, seedlings for passion fruit,
citrus, avocado, coconut and papaya, and banana suckers. Again it is not
clear what share of the project area's needs were met by the project, nor
what share of seeds and seedling production went to the small-scale
farmers.
Land Tenure
40.      Performance of this component in Ceara was poor. Only 3,439
hectares were distributpd to landless farmers (492 of the target of 7,000
hectares), and only 36 titles were issued. In Paraiba, performance was
somewhat better; although only 3,047 hectares of l.and were distributed (362
of the target of 8,488 hectares), about 7,560 titles were issued. Execution
of the components was difficult due to a combination of reasons: (i) state
authorities argued that most land offered for sale for redistribution was
of low quality and was overpriced (it is not clear whether they were right,
or just trying to delay the program); (ii) the screening of potential areas
for redistribution was time consuming; (iii) only at the end of the project
was a proper cadastral service was set up in the Brejo area, and a regional
office of the State Land Institute (FUNDAP) opened in Alagoinha; (iv) no
office of the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform
(INCRA) existea in Paraiba -  land acquisition and distribution in the
state were managed through the regional office in Recife; (v) the purchase
of land in the states had to be reviewed by INCRA headquarters in Brasilia;
(vi) delays caused by legal disputes resulting from government attempts to
acquire land for redistribution were underestimated by the Bank; (vii) the
cost per beneficiary of land acquisition/redistribution was probably high.
Probably also it was nLot very iealistic of the Bank to expect the
government to act decisively in this very sensitive area, especially during
the early stages of the implementation periods.
41.      The Pernambuco project included costs for studies on land
acquisition and titling, and eventually for improving land titling
services. The study was implemented and pointed to the need for a specific
State Land Authority (COTEPE), which was established in 1981 under the
Secretariat of Agriculture. This new authority faced similar constraints to
land redistribution es the agencies in Ceara and Paraiba. Nonetheless,
6,300 hectares of lands in Pesqueiro were distributed to farmers under the
Pernambuco project. The Bank subsequently addressed the land tenure
problems on a wider scale under the Northeast Region Land Tenure
Improvement Project (Loan 2593-BR) which became effective in March 1986.



- 45 -
Harketing and Storage
42.      This component of the Ceara project consisted of a Forward Crop
Purchasing (CAP) program specifically for landless farmers in the carrasco
sub-region. The CAP program proved helpful to some 2,noo producers; almost
9,000 tons of produce were marketed. Also under the project, some 2,160
fanmers were served by marketing posts, which handled 21,000 tons of
produce. The farmers expanded their marketing from only cotton to include
other products such as grains, cassava flour, cocoa, cashew nuts and milk.
However a number of problems arose: owing to high inflation rates and poor
cost recovery as a result of the drought, CAP working capital was eroded;
payments made under the program were late; and inter-institutional
relations between the agencies responsible for execution of the component,
EMATER-CE, the Ceara Agricultural Development Company (CODAGRO) and the
Brazilian Food Company (COBAL), were a problem.
43.      In Paraiba, the planned construction of 54 mini-markets was
cancelled in early 1984, since out of the eight built, most were used as
stores and only two were in operation as mini-markets. It was found that
the minimarkets were poorly located and lacked adequate staff. Yet several
local agencies which were supported under the project, did provide some
marketing services, notably for potatoes, oranges and bananas. For
instance, the Paraiba Agricultural Development Company (CIDAGRO) was
successful in stabilizing potato prices by purchasing small quantities. It
also stored seed potatoes in its cold store in Esperanca; although the cold
store was initially hardly used, finally it was regularly filled to its
1,000 ton capacity.
44.      In Pernambuco, the marketing component was executed by EMATER-PE
and selected cooperatives. Only four of the planned 16 crop assembly
warehouses were constructed, due to budget cuts and lack of interest of the
cooperatives. Radio equipment was provided to improve communications
between EMArER-PE, the cooperatives and the Agricultural Information
Service (SIMA), but information is not available on whether reliable market
news was in fact broadcast to farmers as planned.
Rural Roads
45.      Roads construction was a major component of all three projects.
Roads accounted for 252 of projected baseline costs in Paraiba, 172 in
Pernambuco, and 142 in Ceara. Disbursements practically met the original
loan allocation in Paraiba, and exceeded it in Ceara and Pernambuco.
46.      However in Ceara, the target of constructing and improving 300 km
of roads was far from being met (63 km or 212). Moreover the State Highway
Department (DAER-CE) had a weak capacity for the planning and supervision
of works, and consequently the quality of construction was generally poor.
Little attention was paid to achieving standards of construction which
could minimize costly future maintenance or untimely rehabilitation. The
lack of municipal involvement in the maintenance of feeder roads was
identified as an issue with no easy solution.



- 46 -
47.      The target of the Paraiba project for coustruction and
rehabilitation of roads (271 km or 842) was almost achieved but no
information is available on construction standards.
48.      The target for road construction was exceeded in Pernambuco (1,097
km, or 115Z); and the State Highways Department (DAER-PE) successfully
trained municipal workers in roads maintenance. However the municipalities
lacked the funds of their own to ensure proper upkeep of roads and
eventually it was necessary to support this under the project. Since some
construction had not been carried out to standard and maintenance was poor,
the rains destroyed some structures and reconstruction proved costly.
Small-Scale Non-Farm Enterprises
49.      The projects supported the development of these enterprises which
performed a variety of activities including food processing, carpentry,
ceramics, sewing, leather work, small retail stores and services. These
components were considered very successful in all three projects. Some 155
enterprises in Ceara, almost 3,000 in Paraiba and 7,340 in Pernambuco were
assisted with management training. About 2,670 enterprises in Pernambuco
received credit from local sources. In Ceara and Paraiba support was
provided by the National Services for Apprenticeship in Industry and
Commerce (SENAI and SENAC) and the Centre for Assistance to Small and
Medium Enterprises (CEAG). In Pernambuco, the component was executed by the
Northeast Union of Assistance to Small-Scale Organizations (UNO), which had
already established close working relationships with local banks before the
project began. A main reason for the success of the components was the
dedication and quality of the CEAG and UNO staff. CEAG is a federally
funded agency that has shown consistently good performance throughout. UNO,
a state government agency, is part of the federal level Brazilian Centre
for Assistance to Small and Medium Enterpriset (CEBRAE) and has had many
years experience in providing technical and managerial assistance to small-
scale commerce and industry in Metropolitan Recife. The concept and
experience of these components were taken into account in the design of
other rural development projects in Northeast Brazil.
Health and Sanitation
50.      The construction targets of the health and sanitation components
were not met in Ceara, were largely met in Paraiba, and they were exceeded
in Pernambuco. However health administration continued to be mediocre. The
states did not have the resources to maintain, supply and staff the health
posts properly. The posts suffered from inappropriate and insufficient
supplies of drugs, low level of training of staff (but often dedicated to
their job), and infrequent supervision and inspection of facilities by thc
Secretariat of Health. These problems were subsequently addressed on a
wider scale under the Northeast Basic Health Service Project (Loan
2699-BR).
51.      The performance of the sanitation sub-components in the three
projects generally was good. A large number of water supply schemes and pit
latrines were constructed, and many water filters were distributed. However
some water supplies fell into disuse because water quality was poor, the
systems had been poorly built, attendants were not adequately trained, and



- 47 -
the villages were not sufficiently associated with construction and
maintenance. In Paraiba the Bank finally dispensed with trying to establish
water users' associations, and proposed instead that municipalities would
enter into arrangements with the State Secretariat of Health (SESAU) to
contribute labor and materials to the construction of water supply schemes,
and collect charges from their users to cover their operation and
maintenance costs. It is not clear, however, whether this alternative to
public participation worked.
Education and Training
52.      In Ceara eight rural education centres were constructed as planned
and 65 were provided with equipment. Staff training targets uere
practically met. An NGO (MEB) was contracted to organize vocational
training courses for women in various trade areas including embroidery,
dress-making and home industries. This program helped a considerable number
of rural women to develop skills, to improve their living conditions and to
supplement the family income. Continuous problems were low salaries and
lack of job security for teachers. The salary problem was related to the
fact that teachers' salaries were intended to be met from overstretched
municipal budgets and were supplemented by a contribution from the state:
however payments failed to keep up with inflation and gradually lost a
great deal of their real value. The suggested Teacher's Charter (Estatuto
do Magisterio) was never applied by the municipalities. Successive
supervision missions drew attention to this problem and considered
recommending cancellation of this component. Education and training were
subsequently included in the Ceara Second Project, until the Bank decided
that this problem, which was common to the entire Northeast region,
required solving at the Ministerial level and should not be tackled on a
project-by-project basis.
53.      In Paraiba and Pernambuco targets for school construction,
rehabilitation, equipping and teacher training were exceeded. This was
attributed to the good performance of the State Secretariats of Education,
in spite of the problems of late release of budgeted counterpart funds. The
states managed to bring teachers" salaries to appropriate levels toward the
end of the project periods when the Estatuto do Magisterio was applied.
Cooperative Support
54.      In Ceara the component for technical and managerial support to
cooperatives proved difficult to implement, basically due to tensions
between cooperative directors, who are often also large landowners,
cooperative extension agents, and the members who included many small
farmers and share-croppers. However some 520 small-scale farmer,
cooperative members benefitted from technical and managerial assistance
from production of certified seed and from construction of marketing posts
(many with the cooperatives' own resources). Perhaps more importantly, the
cooperative movement grew stronger, and small-scale farmers came to serve
on the boards of some cooperatives. Also OCEC improved its services
(financial management, legal services and marketing) to member societies.



- 48 -
55.      In Paraiba the cooperative support component financed technical
assistance, equipment and training. Two cooperatives were reorganized and
equipped with manioc processing facilities (casas de farinhas) and one
cooperative was reactivated.
56.      In Pernambuco targets of membership, education and training were
well exceeded, but the programme impact on performance of the cooperatives
is not clear.
Project Administration
57.      The costs of equipping, staffing and providing the necessary
materials for the Technical Units during the implementation periods were
included in the project investment costs. The Technical Units were located
in state capitals, and the projects also gradually set up field offices to
promote interaction among the executing agencies and to improve contacts
with local communities and project beneficiaries.
58.      At project reformulation in 1982, the Ceara and its successor
Ceara Second Project were both managed by a single Project Unit but this
Unit was heavily staffed. At appraisal it was estimated that by the fifth
year of project implementation, staff would total 65 technicians in
addition to administrative support personnel. This number was justified on
the grounds that they would assume primary responsibility for all state
rural development projects. By mid-1985, however, the project financed 104
technicians and 43 support personnel, and while 102 of the project's
baseline costs were budgeted at appraisal for administration and studies,
expenditures had reeched as high as 26Z of total costs eligible for
reimbursement, including management, evaluations and preparation of the
NRDP project. Subsequently it was agreed that disbursement requests to the
Bank would be made on the basis of only 89 technicians and 43 support staff
and that the financing of studies would be clearly identified. The soil
surveys, water resource development and soil conservation studies financed
under this component were carried out as planned.
59.      The Technical Unit of the Paraiba project, which was attached to
the Secretariat of Agriculture, performed satisfactorily as project
coordinator.  However, in 1985, the State Government decided to assign the
task of preparirg and coordinating the second generation rural development
program to the Secretariat of Planning, given the latter's overall
responsibility for state policy and program coordination. For this
purpose, a Superior Administration Unit (USA) was established within the
Secretariat of Planning. Initially, this created some friction between the
high level staff of both Secretariats, and the Technical Unit had
difficulties in coordinating those activities which were dot under the
direct management of the Secretariat of Agriculture. Eventually, during
the last years of the project, a clearer definition of responsibilities
between the technical Unit and the USA emerged, aided by discussions held
by Bank supervision missions with the Secretaries of Agriculture and
Planning, and project administration improved.
60.      The Technical Unit of the Pernambuco project appears to have
performed well, in spite of frequent turnover of key personnel. The Unit
made a determined effort to improve coordination among executing agencies
particularly in gearing up for the Northeast Rural Development V project in



- 49 -
1984/85. In addition to its duties of project management and coordination
with other agencies, the Unit was also responsible for commissioning a
study on land acquisition and titling - which was carried out as planned -
and for project monitoring and evaluation, which was contracted to the
Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE). The latter was intended to cover:
(i) baseline studies; (ii) monitoring; and (iii) final evaluation. Only the
baseline studies and some ad hoc studies were carried out; but the baseline
survey needed to be executed before the project started. The work was
generally considered of good professional quality but of little practical
benefit to project management. The same criticism was made in relation to
monitoring, for which responsibility was eventually transferred to the
successor project, and no independent evaluation of the p:-oject was carried
out (see below).
C. Specific Ceara Components
Mechanization Services
61.      Thi  project supplied a small stock of equipment (mainly farm
tractors and related implements but including also crawler tractors for
heavier land clearing jobs) to CODAGRO, to provide mechanization services
to the farmers. However the machines were generally useless on the farmers'
small plots. This was a conceptual mistake: animal traction and small
machines managed by the farmers themselves would have been more
appropriate.
Rural Electrification
62.      This was the fourth major component of the Ceara project, and
accounted for US$ 6.6 million or 15Z of total estimated baseline costs. In
the event, US$ 1.2 million were disbursed. Although the target of installed
distribution lines was not reached (108 km or 36Z) some 630 new consumers
were connected, or more than twice the target. Electrification (and roads)
are the main indicators of progress which were mentioned time and again by
the population in the area. Probably they were also more often the subject
of lobbying by the intended beneficiaries than technical components. As a
result of electrification, for instance, electrical motors have been
installed to run irrigation pumps for vegetable gardening, and cottage
industries such as sewing have sprung up,
Small Irrigation Schemes
63.      This component for small-scale farmers in the carrascc zone proved
difficult to implement due to insufficient technical and institutional
expertise. At project closing only two small-scale schemes had been
constructed with a command area of about 10 hectares each, but they were
not in operation because, according to project field staff, they had not
yet been officially turned over to the beneficiaries.
Community Water Storage
64.      This component foresaw financing construction of community
sponsored water storage systems (acudes). CEPA-CE information only
indicates that 10 of the 60 planned acudes were built, but it is not clear
why the construction target was not met.



- 50 -
D. Specific Paraiba Components
Soil Conservation
65.      The existing soils laboratory at the agricultural college of the
Federal University of Paraiba was equipped under the project; a total of
7,400 soils samples were analyzed, and a research program in soil
conservation was conducted by the college.
Livestock Development
66.      The project financed construction of a livestock centre but, for
reasons which are not clear, the centre's planned activities of artificial
insemination and technical assistance were limited.
E. Specific Pernambuco Components
Water Conservation
67.      The project was originally intended to provide for construction of
two 50,000 m3 communal dams, operated by groups of farmers. These were
constructed as planned, but the drought required an expansion of targets
and a reorientation of the program. The State Agriculture and Livestock
Services Company (CISAGRO) therefore constructed an additional 146 small-
scale irrigation schemes, dams and tubewells. Consequently disbursements
for this component (USS 0.7 million) were more than twice those expected at
appraisal. The importance of this component was the demonstration effect of
the community projects and their scope for expansion of the irrigated
areas.
Community Development Fund
68. This component was executed by the Program for the Development of
Rural Communities (PRODECOR), a national agency of the Ministry of
Agriculture. Under the experimental program, some small-scale
infrastructure improvements were carried out in three municipalities;
construction materials were provided by the fund and unskilled labor was
contributed by the population.
F. Disbursements
69.      All three projects shared a poor disbursement history. In the
Ceara project, total disbursements amounted to US$ 9.1 million or 542 of
the original loan amount (Annex I, Table 4). In Paraiba, total
disbursements were US$ 11.5 million or 482 of the original loan amount
(Annex II, Table 4). In the Pernambuco project, total disbursements
amounted to US$ 27.1 million or 672 of the original loan amount (Annex III,
Table 4). Throughout most of the implementation periods, disbursements ran
below 50% of appraisal estimates. The projects shared the following
constraints:
a) shortfalls and delays in release of budgeted counterpart
funds, and competing uses for counterpart funds, because of
other rural special programs, emergencv drought relief
measures, and the presence of non-Bans-financed components in
the projects;



- 51 -
b) overly optimistic Bank and government expectations concerr.ing
execution capabilities for some components;
c) diminished execution capacity for some components because of
the drought;
d)  restrictions on the availability of rural credit, particularly
from 1982/83 on as part of national macroeconomic adjustment
policies;
e) failure of local bank managers to maintain adequate records
and submit reimbursement requests for credit, especially for
working capital loans (Paraiba and Pernambuco);
f) high inflation rates combined with slow reimbursement
procedures, producing constant erosion (estimated at 20 to
302) in the US dollar value of reimbursement requests;
g) lower unit costs on many items in US dollar terms than those
estimated at appraisal because of the constant devaluation of
the cruzeiro and some real cost sqvings.
70.      Beginning in 1983, disbursements improved. This was due to the
establishment of:
a) a direct channelling system between the Treasury and the
projects, cutting delays in the receipt of counterpait funds;
b) a Central Bank advance system to pre-finance the share of
funds which eventually would be reimbursed by the Bank loans;
c) Special Accounts in US dollars at the Central Bank,
accelerating disbursements and allowing expenditures to be
claimed for reimbursement at the rate of exchange in effect on
the date of expenditure.
71.      Also the Bank decided to raise its share of co-financed expenses
from 30-35% to about 67%; this measure was approved in connection with the
Bank's Special Action Program which became effective in May 1984.
G. Procurement
72.      Most goods and services in the three projects were procured in
accordance with local procurement and competitive bidding procedures.
Construction contracts were generally awarded on the basi§ of competitive
bidding advertised locally. A small amount of civil wcrks was carried out
under local procurement, self-help and by force account. A procurement
problem arose in connection with road construction in the Ceara and Paraiba
projects, where some civil works were not procured and contracted in
accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement (see below).



- 52 -
H. Reporting, Accounts and Auditing
Reporting
73.      The Bank provided support during the design stage to set up
monitoring and evaluation units. However, thereafter little attention was
given by project management or the Bank to the development of these units
and the design of effective monitoring and evaluation systems. Monitoring
was seen as a vehicle for providing data from the Project Units and
executing agencies to the regional and federal authorities, and the Bank,
rather than an input into the routine decision-making of line management.
The Project Units produced quarterly reports following procedures and
formats mandated by SUDENE. The reports were often received late by the
Bank, and they were too long, too detailed, and often contained unimportant
information. Monitoring indicators were also oriented towards physical and
financial progress, rather than toward measurement of service delivery and
adoption of techniques by producers. On several occasions, the Bank
discussed with SUDENE the need to improve the quality of the POLONORDESTE
monitoring system. Although the Bank's proposals were well received, it
proved difficult to improve the quality of monitoring reports. This was
due to the lack of trained monitoring and evaluation staff in SUDENE and
the project management units, as well as the continued tendency of project
management to view performance narrowly in terms of physical and financial
progress. Some stud'Ies and ad hoc surveys were carried out; but these were
costly and very elaborate (e.g., in Ceara) or reflected an academic
treatment of infonnation which was largely already available to project
management (e.g., Paraiba and Pernambuco). Other brief studies on various
specific topics (credit program, marketing campaign, monitoring and
evaluation) would also have been appropriate. Although the projects
contained evaluation components, in-depth assessments of the impact the
projects had had over a period of years are not available. For instance,
even after project completion practically no quantitative data are
available on farm practices, costs and returns.
Accounting and Auditing
74.      The states' Completion Reports were all received late except for
the report on the Pernambuco project education component. Quality varies:
all are detailed (up to five volumes in Ceara), but they do not
consistently address the main points as outlined in the Bank guidelines.
The Ceara team apparently made little use of Bank guidance (for instance,
detailed guidelines given by a Bank mission to CEPA-CE and the Secretariat
of Education for the Completion Report on the education component). The
Paraiba report gives no indication of project impact on agricultural
development. However perhaps because an FAO-CP mission to'Ceara in December
1987 had opportunity to discuss PCR content and presentation with the
PRORURAL team while the decument was under preparation, the CEPA-
PE/PRORURAL document provides V critical analysis of project performance
and experience, with comprehensive information on physical targets,
achievements and costs. However no PCR provides much data on the projects'
impact on land use, and practically no information is given on changes in
production and incomes of the beneficiaries. This is not the fault of the
teams which prepared the reports, but reflects the weak project monitoring
and evaluation.



- 53 -
75.      Separate project accounts were maintained in each executing
agency. For Ceara, the Auditors expressed concern (end 1986) over the lack
of financial controls at the level of the various executing agencies, and
CEPA-CE's Financial Department. The Auditors also drew attention to CEPA-
CE's outdated organization and recomended measures to improve project
financial monitoring and control. Likewise the Audit Report for the fiscal
year ending March 1986 for the Pernambuco project makes a series of
recomnendations concerning the need to strengthen financial control and
internal auditing of project funds by PRORURAL. In addition, the financial
tables prepared by CEPA-CE's Financial Department for the PCR do not allow
analysis of project expenditures expressed in US dollars, neither for
1982183 (Project Year 6) through 1985/86 (Project Year 9), nor for the
cumulative project period.
I. Adherence to Covenants
76.      The Bank considered that compliance with the project's legal
obligations had generally not been met in four major areas; extension of
the Paraiba project was conditioned inter alia on appropriate measures to
improve items b), c) and d) below.
a) Provision of counterpart funds. For all three projects,
ciunterpart funds were not provided promptly as needed,
although some yeers (e.g., 1984-85) were better than others.
Shortfalls and delays in counterpart funding are mentioned
repeatedly in Supervision Reports and in letters to the
Borrowers. The Special Action Program approved by the Bank in
late 1983 alleviated funding difficulties slightly, but
funding remained a problem.
b) Rural credit. The availability, procedures, and monitoring of
rural credit were pervasive problems for all three projects.
Availability and procedures for rural credit throughout the
country were major e'lements in the Bank's agricultural sector
dialogue with the government. In 1981, new Bank lending for
agricultural credit was discontinued. In 1983, lending
resumed following a comprehensive interest rate agreement,
included as part of the conditions in the Agricultural Credit
and Export Development Project (Loan 2348-BR). Credit
accounting and reporting were unsatisfactory. This was
largely due to the complex design of the credit components.
In each project year, Bank disbursements for seasonal credit
were intended to be made only against credit in excess of the
amount lent during the previous year; but since credit was
channeled to farmers through numerous branches of several
banks within and outside the project areas, seasonal credit
distribution was virtually impossible to monitor.
Consequently, it was not possible to comply with stipulated
lending policies and procedures in the Loan Agreements. In
addition, comments such as "satisfactory" or "improving' in
Supervision Reports, in connection with status of compliance
with key legal agreements, did not convey the technical or



- 54 -
legal sense of compliance. Control over the application of
Bank disbursements for seasonal credit in the Paraiba project
became so inadequate, that at one point, it was proposed to
drop the component.
c)  Teachers' qua ifications and salaries.  There were very few
teachers in rural Ceara who had normal schoo.. qualifications
(12 grades of education), which was the minimum qualification
accepted for urban primary school teachers in the state.
Therefore, it proved impossible for the state to comply with
the covenant, that at least 75Z of the rural primary school
teachers should meet this standard. Thin Bank should have
known this in advance and set more realistic criteria. Also
both the Ceara and Paraiba Governments had difficulties in
meeting the covenant requiring payment of rural primary school
teachers' salaries according to the salary scale of the state.
The problem was common through the Northeast, where teachers'
salaries were a municipal responsibility but municipalities
could not meet their financial commitments. The situation
improved in Paraiba towards the end of the project when
salaries were increased under the Estatuto do Magisterio.
d) Procurement. Bidding documents for the projects' road
components contained fixed price limits which discouraged
bidding, curtailed competition, and jeopardized construction
standards. This may have been due to failure on the part of
the states to allow for galloping inflation. The Bank brought
this matter to the federal and state governments' attention on
a number of occasions, including letters in April 1985 which
warned that the Bank would not finance future contracts if
satisfactory procedures were not followed. The states
subsequently agreed to modify their practice.
IV. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT AND OTHER BENEFITS
Agricultural Impact
77.      Monitoring and evaluation of the three projects was inadequate.
The surveys and studies which were carried out provide little useful
information on farm practices, costs and returns. For agriculture, only
annual regional production statistics are available. The most recent firm
data available in Ceara are for 1985, and in Paraiba these are for 1986.
In Pernambuco, figures for the last two project years (1985 and 1986) are
only preliminary. This data are reproduced in Table 5 of-Annexes I
(Ceara), II (Paraiba) and III (Pernambuco).
78.      However, four factors have to be kept in mind when annual regional
statistics are examined:
a) the data covers all farmers in the areas, and not only project
beneficiaries; thus, it is not possible to estimate the share
of effects which can be attributed to farmers who were
supported by the project, relative to those who did not
benefit;



- 55 -
b) the drought (which was particularly severe in Pernambuco)
coincided with most of the project years; the reduction of
extension work and the shortage of credit, factors which were
all beyond control of management, resulted in sharp production
declines compared to more normal years: the drought was
followed by two years of excessive rains in CEARA which again
affected production;
c) since 1983, the boll weevil has destroyed much of the cotton
crop (Paraiba and Pernambuco); and the projects were not able
to react to the pest; and,
d) pre-project production figures given in the SARs do not
correspond to the data for the same years provided by the
Project Units.
79.      The available statistics only permit a comparison of areas, yields
and production during the first years of the projects with the last ones.
The mission has done this as far as possible, supported by its own
observations in the field and by information from discussions with farmers
and project field staff. This comparison is summarized below, and details
are provided in Annexes I-III. In this situation, the mission has
refrained from making estimates of the projects' rates of return.
80.      The statistics indicate that the total cultivated area expanded
slightly in the Ceara and Paraiba project areas. A substantial reduction
occurred in Pernambuco, where land was taken out of crop cultivation and
used for pasture (see below).
81.      Cultivation of the traditional food crops remained an important
activity of the farmers. Production of beans increased in all three areas,
and more corn was grown in Ceara and Pernambuco, and a yield reduction in
Paraiba. All of these crops continue to be the basic staple food and are
especially important for the small-scale farmers. By supporting their
production, the projects were likely to have contributed to increase the
incomes and nutrition standards of some of t;.e rural poor.
82.      Farmers were also able to increase production of some high value
vegetables and fruits. Notable were the production increases of tomatoes
in Ceara, and of potatoes in Paraiba. Citrus and banana production
increased in Paraiba, largely due to introduction of the disease resistant
Pacovan variety. The production of citrus was seriously affected by the
drought, to which the trees are especially vulnerable. Production fell in
Ceara and increased only slightly in Paraiba. In addition, credit for the
planting of citrus trees was suspended due to oversupply of citrus on the
world market, where Brazil is the major exporter. Pineapple production
decreased in Pernambuco, a deviation from projections at appraisal, since
land was taken out of this crop. Sugar cane production increased in Ceara
and Paraiba. This was likely to be R result of the PROALCOOL program,
which assured credit, a guaranteed market and adequate producer prices.
For cotton, the boll weevil pest led to a drop of production in Paraiba and
Pernambuco as a result of falling yields and high production costs which
reduced profitability of the crop.



- 56 -
83.      Loan disbursement figures suggest that extension and other
services possibly had a greater impact on agricultural development than
credit, where lending targets were not met by far.
84.      Irrigation was intended to be important to assure the harvests of
high value crops which found ready markets in the Northeast. However, the
project field staff had limited experience with small-scale irrigation
schemes and development turned out to be more difficult than expected.
85.      The rural roads components had an important impact by linking the
areas of production to the consumer centres. Electrification (Ceara)
enabled the introduction of motors to run irrigation pumps, and many
farmers made use of this opportunity to produce high value vegetables under
irrigation.
Other Benefits
86.      The projects had a number of other benefits, however, which are
difficult to quantify, including improvements in education, health and
sanitation services. In this case, the benefits did not accrue only to the
target population, but benefitted the community in general.
87.      Overall the projects appear to have contributed to yield and area
increases, and to have had a discernible impact on living standards for a
relatively small number of families (compared to about three million rural
poor families in the Northeast) in the areas on which they were focused.
It may be concluded that, in spite of their many problems - and most of
which are common to complex rural development projects - the projects made
some good progress in meeting their goals and in tailoring the services
they offered to the priorities of the areas as these have emerged more
clearly. Main achievements were the introduction of the group extension
approach, better focus of agricultural research on the needs of local
farmers, and heightened sensitivity to the need for land regularization and
titling as a precondition for improving farm productivity. The projects
also served as pilot operations to test possibilities of planning and
implementing state-wide rural and sub-sectoral development programs. In
addition, they trained staff and developed and institutional framework
which should result in increased efficiency of future development
programmes. Their timing was fortuitous in that implementation coincided
with the emergence of a distinct small farmer orientation as a new force in
rural development.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
88.      Numerous federal, regional, state and municipal agencies were
involved in the planning, execution and supervision of the projects. The
integrated project approach is inherently complicated, because of the large
number of components and implementing agencies, and the need for
coordination among them. The POLONORDESTE program was the first major
program to use this integrated approach in Brazil. For many of the
executing agencies it was their first attempt to coordinate their
activities with those of other agencies and to reach the rural poor. This
said, project implementation was nonetheless complicated, and hampered by
inadequate administrative capability, coordination problems, competition



- 57 -
among government agencies, rapid expansion of staff, and bureaucratic
procedures which inhibited progress. There was, however, progress toward
establishing integrated, target-oriented planninlg and action by
participating government agencies and the experience gained has been
incorporated into improved designs for the current generation of NRDP.
Specific implementation problems are discussed below.
Federal Level
89.      Responsibility for the POLONORDESTE program, including the Ceara,
Paraiba and Pernambuco projects, was allocated to a number of different
federal ministries. Final responsibility for major program decisions
remained diffuse. The lack of clear institutional leadership at the
federal level was at least partially responsible for several major project
problems, including those related to the curtailment of credit and delays
in the release of budgeted counterpart funds.
Regional Level
90.      The POLONORDESTE Unit within SUDENE was responsible for regional
coordination, technical supervision and administrative backstopping for the
entire POLONORDESTE program, including the Ceara, Paraiba and Pernambuco
projects. Initially, the Unit performed administrative tasks (e.g., budget
consolidation), but it was unable to fulfill its technical assistance and
quality control roles. This was mainly due to permanent shortages in
financial and human resources Rs a result of erosion of political support.
However, SUDENE's capacity to provide orientation and technical assistance
to the states appear to have improved towards the end of the projects'
implementation periods, based on institutional measures taken for the
implementation of the second generation projects.
State Level
91.      Institutional performance at the state level was mixed.  Initially
time was required for the executing agencies to accept the approach of
integrated assistance to small farmers and the rural poor, and to create
the organizational capacity to carry out their components of the project.
Yet the most important reason for poor implementation performance,
especially in the beginning, was the inability of technical coordination
bodies at state level to effectively manage, control and redirect the work
programs of numerous project executing agencies. Executing institutions
were initially stronger in political and technical terms than the bodies
which were expected to coordinate them. However, the institutional
performance of the state agencies improved once the roles and procedures of
the Technical Units were accepted.
92.      The Technical Units generally had a large number of staff and thus
were costly to maintain. Project administration costs (including
monitoring and studies) incurred by the Technical Units amounted to 9Z of
total costs in Ceara, 112 in ParaJba, and 102 in Pernambuco. Not included
in these figures are the own costs of project administration incurred by
each of the executing agencies.



- 58 -
93.      Implementation problems were also encountered with the annual
planning exercises for the projects, which centered around the Annual
Operating Programs (POA). These were the basic documents to plan budgets
of participating agencies and to cbtain from the federal government a
commitment of the needed appropriations. Financial planning was carried
out by listing investment and current expenditures by component/executing
agency, following the pattern agreed in the loan documents. However,
expenditures were generally not easy to relate to specific activities,
making it difficult to forecast the financial and economic impact on the
target group of the planned an implemented activities. Approval of POAs at
federal level was subject to clearance by state governments and SUDENE.
The process was long and cumbersome and subject to numerous modifications.
The final POA had little use as an effective planning instrument. At end
1986, the FAO-CP assisted the states in making improvements to the POA.
This consisted of a gradual introduction of a new planning/budgeting system
where investments and current expenditures in the POA were defined on the
basis of programs identified at grassroot level. The State of Pernambuco
(PRORURAL), for instance, agreed to re-design the methods for formulation
of POAs following this new approach, but this came too late to benefit this
particular project.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
94.      The Bank made an important contribution to Brazilian rural
development policy through the POLONORDESTE program, including the Ceara,
Paraiba and Pernambuco projects. The emphasis on benefitting small-scale
farmers and sharecroppers, the mix of productive and social components, the
focus on land tenure improvements as a necessary condition for rural
development, and the support to non-farm enterprises, were central to the
projects. However, all three projects may be accused of over complex
design, over-concentration of resources in particular areas, and responding
to pressures to expand the project areas before technical implementation
experience, and levels of planning, managemelit and coordination skills had
developed sufficiently.
95.      Supervision was expected to require great attention, because of
the Bank's limited knowledge and experience of rural development in Brazil
and because a degree of flexibility had been built into the projects so
that modifications could be made as experience was gained. The field
visits which were budgeted may have been sufficient initially and contact
with project implementation was also supplemented by visits from staff of
the Recife Office. However, attention during supervision missions soon
became more focused on reformulating and expanding the projects, and
eventually on preparing follow-up projects, to the detriment of supervision
of on-going activities.
96.      More Bank staff resources were employed for supervision of the
Ceara and Paraiba projects than for the larger Pernambuco project. But
staff inputs fell sharply for all three projects after the fifth year of
implementation, resulting, for instance, in an average of only 5.6 staff
weeks of supervision time annually for the period of FY1983-87 for Ceara.



- 59 -
Yet this was the time when farming was recovering from the drought and the
main project investments were being made. The Bank's measures to improve
disbursements put in place in 1983 coincided with the cutback in staff
resources for supervision.2
97.      It was also thought that extension of the Loans 1537-BR and
1728-DR by one-year time slices, depending on ptoject performance, could
provide an incentive for improvements in project implementation. This was
the right decision and provided the opportunity for thorough periodic
reviews but again should have been associated with devoting more resources
to supervision.
98.      The work of the supervision missions was difficult, given their
time constraints, the complexity of the projects, and a lack of continuity
of staffing and of expertise to deal with the wide range of components.
Perhaps most supervision time was spend on major implementation
difficulties, including institutional issues, delays in release of budgeted
counterpart funds and credit shortages. Given the overriding importance of
these, this was not surprising. But as the Loan 1195-BR/1714-BR PCR notes,
the dialogue on these issues would have been more effective is a part of
the total supervision time dedicated to these and similar projects had been
set aside to address the technical issues in a continuing and coordinated
fashion and on a program-wide basis. Reporting was occesionally weak.
Supervision reports did not always clearly specify or document the
missicns' technical recommendations and the projects' approved revised
targets. Also reports for the first and second Ceara projects were not
kept separate; when the original project was absorbed by the successor, the
reports covered both, and physical targets, achievements, costs and
financing were often not clearly separated. However, some reports listed
specific topics for follow-up during subsequent missions, and this practice
was especially useful given the frequent rotation of supervision mission
staff.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
99g      The POLONORDESTE projects, including the Ceara, Paraiba and
Pernambuco projects, were .The first of a series which was based on an
integrated development approach for specific target groups of small tarmers
and sharecroppers in the Northeast. Although initially the Bank tackled
only a part of each state, the projects turned out to be too ambitious both
in design and scope to be readily implementable. Important constraints
which were not taken fully enough into account in project design and
implementation are listed below.
2  Moreover, the supervision missions did not always have the right mix of
specialists. While two of the main problems affecting the projects were
credit and financial issues, missions for these projects included only a
very limited participation of credit specialists and financial analysts
(2 staffweeks, or one percent of total supervision time for the three
projects, for credit specialists, and 4 staffweeks, or two percent, for
financial analysts). Improvements have since been introduced with the
designation of various subject matter specialists who can provide
technical support to the various project officers in project
supervision, among other activities.



- 60 -
a)  An overestimate of the states' implementation capacity.  In
the initial stages of rural development, there is a need for
more realistic planning horizons for instltutions to start up
and become effective.
b)  Support of a system, consistent witi! politics aL the time,
where the beneficiary had little say in the decision making
process and where resources were allocated following a
centrally established "top-down" pattern. Thus there was
little way of ensuring that project designs really responded
to beneficiary demands o. needs. Furthermore, "top-dowrL"
planning proved insufficiently flexible to adjust and
eventually redirect activities to tackle new priorities or
emergencies such as, for example, the new cycle of drought.
Building on this lesson and in response to macro-political
change, coordination of the projects was eventually
decentralized and community participation in the planning and
execution of project activities incrt;ased. Also the projects
tried to allocate more resources to community development
activities, and specific components were added for this
purpose.
c)  The implicit assumption in the technical strategy of the
projects that farmers would readily take up the inputs and
credit that were supposed to satisfy their needs. It is by no
means clear that these were the right technical options for
poor farmers in an environment as risky, for instance, as the
carrasco sub-region towards which the Ceara project was re-
oriented, ever if they may have been suitable for better areas
or for the more 'technified' larger scale farmers which were
the previous targets of regional research, extension and
credit programs. With hindsight, as the unexpectedly long and
severe drought showed, the need was probably to minimize risks
and costs, instead of promoting costly, credit-demanding
intensification in an inappropriate setting.
d)  Initial failure of the Bank to take sufficient account of the
adverse impact that uncertain and unstable land tenure would
have on project implementation, especially in the Paraiba
project - a failure about which the then government took no
steps to warn the Bank. The importance of insecure land
tenure became increasingly apparent during project
implementation, but efforts to provide land regularization
services were both expensive and slow.
e)  Reluctance on the part of t:  states, SUDENE and the Bank to
stop financing components (e.g., education and training in
Cears and seasonal credit in Paraiba) that, mainly due to
political interference or high cost, repeatedly showed little
improvement despite Bank supervision efforts - especially if,
according to the dogma included in the designs, they were
indispensable to overall project success (which may truly have
been the case).



- 61 -
f)  The difficulty, in such a setting, of developing methodologies
to relate project inputs quantitatively to 'outputs',
especially since activities and expenditures were not focused
exclusively and in an integrated fashion on a specific target
group in a stated area, where 'without' and wwith" project
conditions could be easily quantified.
100.     A number of more general lessons can be drawn from these and other
POLONORDESTE projects.3
a)  Projects in a semi-arid environment aimed at small-scale
producers should be based on thorough assessments of their
likely responses to recommended innovations, which must be
sound both from a technical and financial point of view to
capture their interest (i.e., they must combine low risk with
low cost). Projects should also include concrete measures to
deal with insecure land tenure, and they should seek to
enhance farmer participation in the decision-making process.
b)  For farmers to participate in the decision making process and
execute project activities, there must be political commitment
to decentralize organizational, administrative and planning
functions to the regional and micro-regional level. Project
monitoring should be strengthened and decentralized to the
same levels since it is an essential part of the planning
process; aad furthermore, to encourage central bodies to
delegate powers of decision, they must have reliable means of
still knowing what is going on at regional and lower levels:
otherwise, they will refuse to take the perceived risk of
decentralization.
c)  The tendency to design large and complex first-phase projects
should be avoided: it magnifies the management requirement to
a level which cannot be sustained over the long term; it
concentrates authority in the public sector; and the more
comprehensive a project is, the larger the number of interest
groups involved and the more inflexible the entire structure
is therefore likely to become. In the case of these projects,
pressures from the Government for increased resource transfer
and, hence, large loans appeared to have been a factor in
determining project size. In the event, the projects were not
appropriate to the task of increasing resource transfer
significantly in the short term because of their relatively
long implementation periods.
Some of these are drawn from : PCR, Bahia Rural Development Project -
Paraguacu (Loan 1589-BR) dated June 2, 1987.



- 62 -
d)  The three projects, which consisted of many components and
targeted resources to a relatively small number of
beneficiaries, required US$47.6 million in Bank loans and
double that amount of domestic counterpart funds to reach
about 62,000 small farmers and sharecroppers. On average,
this amounted to almost US$2,500 per direct beneficiary
family. Much of this cost was in the form of
agricultural/social services and public infrastructure and
little provision was made for on-farm and other directly
productive investments. Yet the projects provided experience
on how to deal more effectively with the massive problems
facing the Northeast. The number, mix, and intensity of
services offered to small farmers have gradually been modified
with experience and appreciation of budget and institutional
constraints; and greater emphasis placed on supporting on-farm
and other directly productive investments.
e) In a technically risky and institutionally weak setting, there
is a need for more built-in flexibility, through the
establishment of indicative targets and explicit recognition
that initial targets and operating procedures may of necessity
need to be adjusted as implementation proceeds. The gradual
introduction of the POAs corresponded to this need.
f) Similarly, it is unrealistic to demand that complex rural
development projects should carry a heavy conditionality, such
as farm credit interest rate policy and level of teachers'
salaries, as well as be an agricultural success. Structural
ano policy adjustment loans are more appropriate vehicles and
heavy conditionality should be separated from the aims of
area-specific rural development projects.
g) Little coordination existed among the projects, despite their
common objectives, target population and strategies. Closer
regional cooperatioh is warranted to increase program
effectiveness, for instance, in putting small-scale irrigation
to greater use for increasing production of small producers
and insulating them from the drought; promoting more modern
soil management techniques at the small farm level; and in
support non-agricultural activities in rural areas for
stabilizing and perhaps raising family income.
h) To avoid complication of the institutional matrix and
supervision demands, some needs (e.g., education and health)
are more efficiently addressed in a sectoral program, where a
more comprehensive technical and regional approach can be
adopted to deal with the fundamental issues that such
components often pose.
i) A revised approach to supervision (emphasizing continuity and
prompt response, implying that some supervision staff should
probably be resident in the Borrower's country) would go a
long way toward creating an environment in which projects
could react to changing circumstances in a more flexible and
creative way.



- 63 -
J) Management information systems and any evaluation system need
to be clearly designed during project preparation; project
managers need to have a clear understanding of the systen.; and
the Bank should provide more expertise and technical
assistance for the implementation and supervision of project
management information reporting and impact evaluation
components.
Many of the above lessons have been incorporated into the second generation
rural development projects, the NRDP, which began in 1985.

BRAZIL
CEARA RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - IBIAPABA
(LOAN 1488-BR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
1.       The aim of the Ceara project was to increase small farmers'
production of the traditional subsistence crops (manioc and beans) and of
the profitable cash crops (sugarcane, citrus, passion fruits, vegetables
and peanuts); the increase of production was expected to result from an
expansion of about 2002 over 8-9 years in cropped areas by the
participating farmers and an average improvement in yields of about 50X
over thLe respective pre-project levels.
2.       Monitoring, surveys, and studies on specific topics which were
carried out, provide little useful information on farm practices, costs and
returns. Even after project completion, production figures for the main
crops by sub-region in the Ibiapaba area are the only available indicators
to examine the impact of project investments. Due to the lack of data, only
a discussion of production effects based on the limited information
available follows in this Annex. Also, for this reason the mission has not
attempted to carry out a rate of return analysis. 3. The table below gives
a comparison of production increases of main crops of beneficiary farmers
as projected at appraisal, with actual production differences between 1977
(Project YeaL 1) and 1985 (most recent available data) for all farmers in
the project area, including project beneficiaries (see also Table 5).

4.       It is not possible to identify the share of production increases
which accrued to the farmers who benefitted from the project. However, it
could be assumed that they performed better than average, given that they
received technical assistance and other services under the project, and
benefitted to some extent from working capital and investment credit.
5.       Farmers increased total cultivated area by 10,000 to 20,000
hectares from 1978 and 1979 to 1984 and 1985 (Table 5). The structure of
production was also modified: the traditional beans and corn crops became
relatively more important in 1984 and 1985. Also tomato cultivation became
more important. This can be attributed to the project which concent.ated
its efforts on the small-scale farmers and sharecroppers who mostly grew
these crops. Beans and corn are the staple foodcrops, while tomato is
produced for the regional markets where it is in great demand. The area
planted to manioc, sugarcane, coffee (which was supported under a separate
programme), and fruit trees remained practically stable. Farmers had less
interest than expected in establishing fruit tree plantations due to the
drought and the lack of investment credit. This was especially the case for
cittus, which - wry vulnerable to shortages of water.
6.       The comparison of 1977 fid 1978 with 1984 and 1985 indicates that
yields basicallv remained stable. Yields of some crops (especially fruit
trees) were rec Jring from the drought, and some annual crops were
affected by the unusually high rainfal' especially in 1985.
7.       In retrospect, the project approach of financing programmes which
were complementary to investments underway (e.g., coffee expansion) and
planned at the time (e.g., construction of storage and a private alcohol
refinery), was well conceived. Also the project was. able to build on
initial investments begun under POLONORDESTE in 1976, which inclurded feeder
roads construction, agricultural research and training of key staff.
8.       The project had a regional focus, concentrating on opening more
fully one of the relatively high potential food production areas in Ceara.
The project investments were important for its development but they
probably were not decisive, since the area was already 'taking off'
economically. Project impact would have been larger if executior. had not
faced serious problems: delays in release of budgeted counterpart funds,
problems of som' of the executing agencies, frequent turnover of key staff,
and the severe and prolonged drought. Another problem was the poor
performance of the credit component, which was intended to make a major
contribution to intensified agricultural development (projected at 25Z of
total baseline costs, but US$1.5 million or only 351 of thie loan allocation
was disbursed).
9.       The expansion of areas planted to high value vegetables (tomatoes,
peppers, carrots) for the regional market indicates the farmers' response
to market and income opportunities. Many farmers had significant income
increases, which, in turn, enabled them to purchase motors for irrigation
of vegetables when electric power became available. Farmers probably also
bFnefitted from sugarcane cultivation under the PROALCOOL programme and the
ready market for -ane at the alcohol refinery.

10.      Agricultural development has led to an increased demand for
labour, and it has also improved nutrition. However, indiscriminate use of
plant orotection chemicals was reported by extension field staff, which
they had difficulty to control. The destruction of the protective tree and
bush cover to plant coffee and sugarcane may have had a negative effect on
rainfall.
11.      The project had liLtle impact in the relatively dry and less
fertile carrasco zone, although at reformulation ir, 1982 it was intended
that actions would be concentrated in this poor area, while the humid and
sub-humid areas would be covered under the Ceara Second Project (Loan
1924-BR). However, an intensive programme for the development of water
resou es was not availahle; this was not the fault of project management,
since this would nave been a long-term programme. Also in the carrasco a
land reform progranmne would hEve been important, since this is an area with
a concentration of large landholdings, but a political decision was not
taken in this regard. There again time was too short before end of the
project period to develop a significant programme.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
1.       The thrust of the Paraiba project was to increase production
especially of the cash crops citrus, bananas, potatoes and cotton (both as
a result of sizeable increases of yields and areas planted); of manioc and
beans (considerable increases of yields were expected to offset decreases
of areas planted); and of milk and meat.
2.       The mission was not able to examine project impact on the
participating farmers due to the lack of reliable project evaluation. Also
results of field surveys based on samples of farmers are not available,
which would permit estimating costs and benefits and carrying out a
reasonable rate of return analysis.
3.       As an indicator of project performance, the mission has compared
farm production in 1978 (the year before the project began) and in 1986
(Project Year 8) based on SAR projections and actual production figures
supplied by CEPA-PB (Table 5). The data is shown below. However, this
comparison does not indicate which share of production was contributed by
the project's target group of farmers, of the total number of farmers in
the area.

4.       The changes in production projected at appraisal for 11,700 small-
scale and medium-scale farmers who were intended to participate in the
project are different from actual changes from 1978 to 1986 for the entire
project area, including the beneficiary farmers. Production of sugarcane
and potatoes increased due to an improvement of yields in spite of minor
reductions of the cultivated area. The main boost to sugarcane production
were likely to be the incentives under the PROALCOOL programme (credit, a



- 77 -                               ANNEX II
Page 2 of 2
guaranteed market and adequate producer prices). Potato yields practically
doubled to around 4 tons per hectare and were likely to have been effected
by extension, research and cold storage for seed. However, production
suffered from low and irregular rainfall during 1979-84, a degeneration of
potato seed and insufficient credit. These factors prevented average yields
trom reaching the projected 12.5 tons/ha.
5.       The output of beans and manioc grew as a result of area and yield
increases. Production of both crops benefitted from the introduction of
improved varieties and extension of better cultural practices t3 farmers.
6.      Production of oranges and bananas increased in the project area.
However, farmers' interest in planting of orange groves was less than
expected. Main problems were the drought and the lack of credit. Banana
production experienced a breakthrough with the introduction of the Pacovan
variety, which is resistant to the Panama disease. This fruit has good
prospectives in the area.
7.       Again data on inco)mes is not available, but it can be assumed that
the incomes of the small-scale farmers who grew high value crops, such as
potatoes, citrus and bananas, increased. Also it is likely that increased
production of sugarcane, potatoes, oranges, beans and bananas generated
additional employment, which offset the corresponding reduction of
production of manic-c. Throughout, the population in the project area
benefitted from improved roads communications, better health care, water
supply and improved access to education.

PERNAMBUCO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - AGRESTt SETENTRIONAL
(LOAN 1728-bR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
1.      The intention of agricultural development in the Pernambuco project
was to diversify small farmers' activities from the traditional cultivation
of subsistence crops into more remunerative vegetable and fruit c-"ps;
previous levels of subsistence food production (manioc, Deans and corn)
were expected to be maintained (a reduction in the planted areas was
projected to be offset by increases in yields), and the area under improved
pastures and fruit and vegetable crops was to be expanded.
2.      Also this project lacked an effective evaluation system, and no
field investigatinns or sample surveys of beneficiaries were carried out.
Therefore again the impact of the project actions on the target grouD is
not clear.
3.      The limited information available on production of the main farm
commodities in the project area is shown in Table 5. Data from 1978 to 1984
is from FIBGE, while figures for 1985 and 1986 are PRORURAL estimates. The
following text refers to the final figures through 1984 only since later
ones are preliminary. The statistics indicate that between 1978 (Project
Year 1) and 1984 (the first year after the drought), there was a reduction
of production of all commodities with the exception of beans, corn and
milk. This contrasts with the projections made at appraisal, as shown
below:

4.       The reduction of production shown by these figures suggests a
sharp drop of farmers' income, particularly in revenues from high value
crops such as tomtoes, bananas and p_.neapples. Yet, these crops were
expected to provide major increases in farmers' incomes. For traditional
staple foods, the large reduction of manioc production was only pprtly
offset by increased output of beans and corn. Incremental production of
milk exceeded projections.
5.       Figures on pasture areas are not available, and these would have
been useful for a comparison with variations in areas planted to annual
crops. This would have shown the effect of pecuarizacao, or the
substitution of pastures for cropping. However, the increase in livestock
and milk production suggests that the area inder pastures has increased. 6.
Also the statistics do not show areas cultivated to newly introduced crops
such as passion fruits, carrots and peppers which together with tomato,
pineapple and banana production were intended to generate important
benefits but which were not achieved for the latter three crops.
7.       Available statistics do not allow identification of project impact
on areas end yields. Only some sk'tchy information is available; for
instance, EMATER-PE promoted development of specifiL crops in irrigated
areas (1,500 ha of carrots in Brejo da Madre de Deus and 500 ha of beets in
Jatauba) by providing extension services, assistance with credit
application and marketing support. Also important progress was made in
cultivation of manioc, by introducing improved planting material and better
cultural practices. Some farmers also mentioned to the mission improvements
for cultivation of corn and beans as a result of extension, field trials
and supply of improved seeds. However, it is unlikely that the intended
diversification from traditional subsistance crops into vegetable and fruit
crops on 14,000 ha was achieved. This would have required a major effort to
expand irrigated areas, especially during the drought years, but which was
not the case.
8.       The agricultural development strategy of the project was based on
"normal" rainfall, and it was unfortunate that most of the project period
coincided with one of the severest droughts in the Northeast. In this
situation, the water conservation component was much too small to have any
impact beyond carrying out pilot work and gaining experience for future
developments. During a project period it is difficult to introduce an
irrigation orientation among small-scale farmers, which implies
considerable modification of cultural practices and higher production costs
associated with expected productivity increases. The diversification of
farming from traditional cultivation of suLsistence crops into more
remunerative vegetable and fruit crops as projected at appraisal only
appears feasible with an expansion of irrigation due to the risk of
drought.
9.       Apart from the drought, which disrupted the economy of the area,
the pro_ect suffered from reduction and delays in release of budgeted
counterpart funds, recession and rapid inflation, weakness of some of the
executing institutions, and competition for funds and staff with other
projects. In spite of these factors the project had a number of benefits,
but which are not readily quantifiable, including education, basic health

care and sanitation. The roads component promoted integration of hitherto
inaccessible farm areas with the important urb.n markets. The training and
institutional strengthening actions of the project should result in lower
costs and increased efficiency of rural prugrammes, particularly for
agricultural extension, applied research, water resource development,
credit and marketing which are being financed under Loan 2718-BR (which
becam effective on 14 November 1986), and for land tenure improveaent,
which is being supported under Loan 2593-BR (effective in March 1986).
