MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Republic of Yemen
Fourth Power Project (Credit 1701-YAR)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on the Republic of Yemen - Fourth Power
Project (Credit 1701-YAR) prepared by the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office, with Part
HI contributed by the Borrower.
This was the fourth Bank operation to assist the power sector in the Republic of Yemen.
The US$11.8 million equivalent loan aimed at increasing by 23,000 the number of customers
connected to the power generation system and improving the service given to 15,000 existing clients.
Effectiveness of the project was delayed by two years because of the Government's reluctance to
allow tariff increases. A component urgently needed was financed with other resources and US$4
million equivalent (or 33.6%) was cancelled.
The implementing agency was not free enough from political interference to operate in a
profitable way and to implement even the physical component successfully. The project did not
improve the quality of service as intended and system losses mounted instead of declining. Accounts
receivable have been growing faster than revenues and cash flows have been insufficient to service
debts. Technical assistance has not made significant changes in the operating mode of the utility.
Covenants do not seem to have been enforced to achieve the expected changes.
Project risks were not correctly identified. Overall, the project outcome is rated as
unsatisfactory, its sustainability as unlikely as it depends on the reduction of losses and good execution
of the recent tariff reform. Its institutional impact is rated as negligible.
The PCR is satisfactory. No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
(Credit 1701-YAR)
PREFACE
1.         This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Power Project, for which
Credit 1701-YAR in the amount of SDR 10.9 million (US$11.8 million equivalent) was approved on
May 15, 1986. The Credit was made to the then Yemen Arab Republic (YAR)' and onlent to the
Yemen General Electricity Corporation (YGEC).
2.         The Credit was made effective on February 1, 1989, and closed on June 30, 1993.
About SDR 2.83 million (US$3.96 million equivalent) remained undisbursed as of November 5, 1993
and was subsequently cancelled.
3.         Parts I and III of this PCR were prepared by the Industry and Energy Division, Country
Department II, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office. Part II was prepared by the
Beneficiary, YGEC.
4.         Preparation of this report was started during the IDA PCR mission on April 14, 19942
and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, President's Report, Credit, Guarantee and
Project Agreements; supervision reports; the International Development Association's (IDA) internal
memoranda and reports; and correspondence between IDA and the Borrower/Beneficiary.
5.         The generous assistance provided by YGEC officials to the PCR mission is gratefully
acknowledged.
I/  In May 1990, the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) united into the Republic of
Yemen (ROY). As a result, Yemen General Electricity Corporation (YGEC) of the Northern Govemorate and the Public Corporation for
Electric Power (PCEP) of the Southern Govemorate merged into Public Electricity Corporation (PEC). The merger, however, is yet to be
ratified. The PCR involves mainly the power project implemented by the Northern Governorate, which is referred to as YGEC throughout
the report for consistency.
./  The PCR niision was delayed several times for security reasons.

PROJECT COMPLEMION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
(Credit 1701-YAR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.        This was the fourth (Credits 837, 1102, 1361, 1701) Bank Group operation with the
Yemen General Electricity Corporation (YGEC) and the last credit to the country's power sector
before the unification of the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and People's Democratic Republic of
Yemen (PDRY) in 1990. The credit, in the amount of SDR 10.9 million (US$11.8 million equivalent
at appraisal), was primarily intended for maximizing the full benefits from earlier investments and to
strengthen YGEC institutionally.
Obiective
2.        The project was designed to assist YGEC in realizing the benefits accruing from its earlier
investments in more efficient generation and transmission facilities, by extending supplies in three
main area groupings to about 23,000 new consumers and by upgrading the quality of supply to more
than 15,000 existing consumers. The benefits were to arise principally from increased sales revenues,
and from fuel savings resulting from the operation of its steam power plants at higher capacity levels,
as well as from the displacement of diesel-based generation by some private and industrial producers.
The project was also to help with institution building through provision of suitable training, and
advisory services for line loss reduction, management, planning and forecasting capabilities.
Implementation Experience
3.       Implementation was envisaged for seven years (1986-1992), but has been delayed by
about four years with a revised estimated completion date in 1996, due to delays in the signing of the
credit and project agreements and in project effectiveness (Table 2, p. 21) resulting from the
Government's reluctance to allow YGEC to raise its tariffs (para. 8.9) and the resultant breach of
financial covenants (paras. 8.6); as well as lack of financing (paras. 4.2 and 4.3) and delay in contract
award for Package C (para. 7.1). The Technical Assistance (TA) components also suffered delays
and incomplete implementation mainly due to the proposed merger of YGEC in the then YAR and the
Public Corporation for Electric Power (PCEP) of the former PDRY into one utility company in the
unified Republic of Yemen (ROY) (para. 4.5) and the components' overambitious design.



- iii -
Results
4.        The project has not been completed within the initial target dates (Table 4, pp. 23-25).
Only works in Area 3 were completed, connecting 3,700 consumers to the interconnected system
(ICS) instead of the SAR estimate of 23,000 under a completed project. Because of financing
problems, one component covering works in Area 2 (which could have connected 2,805 new
consumers) was eliminated from the scope of the project (para. 4.3), contributing to the failure of
achieving the intended objective of enabling YGEC to obtain maximum benefits from its past
investment in generation and transmission facilities and strengthening its financial position through
increased sales revenues and efficient fuel utilization. As a result, the project did not improve the
quality of service and system losses were not reduced. YGEC's financial performance deteriorated
significantly and YGEC is currently in breach of the financial covenants under the Credit.
Institutional performance of YGEC remains weak, and the technical assistance components (para. 4.5
and 8.2), such as the second phase of the Financial Recovery Plan (para. 4.5), studies (Tables 4, p.
23 and 10, p. 31), and training component (para 8.4) failed to address YGEC's financial problems
since these were not fully implemented.
Sustainabil i
5.        The sustainability of the project depends largely on the Government's ability to address
the issue of YGEC's financial performance through implementation of the recommendations of the
completed tariff study, which was expected to lay the basis for tariff policy for the unified Yemen
(Table 10, p. 31), and on YGEC's technical and financial capability. Though the Council of Ministers
has passed a three-year tariff reform program (after more than ten years of no tariff increase) for
YGEC effective January 1994, the program entails changes in the first year affecting only the
Southern Governorate. The tariff reform was designed so that electricity prices in the Southern
Governorate would be increased gradually in the first year (1994) to bring them to the level of
electricity prices in the Northern Governorate; and by the second and third years (1995-1996), tariffs
would be increased in both Governorates. (The PCR mission did not have the opportunity to evaluate
the impact on YGEC of the tariff increase, due to its failure to submit the projected financial
statements for the next three years.) With the recent outbreak of civil war (which occurred
immediately after the PCR mission left Yemen), the outlook for improvement of YGEC's financial
performance is gloomy. While issues of tariffs, fuel prices and exchange rate fluctuations are beyond
YGEC's control, YGEC could, to a certain extent, lower operating costs by reducing system losses
and implementing the institution building and manpower development activities envisioned under this
and previous IDA projects.
Lessons Learned
6.        Overall, project implementation was unsatisfactory. The lessons derived from the
implementation of the project are: (i) IDA and Borrower should agree on satisfactory up-front action
in electricity tariff reforms and measures for financial viability prior to endorsing a project; (ii) IDA
should ensure Government commitment and project ownership, (iii) in the cases of beneficiaries with
limited implementation capabilities, project design should be kept simple and focussed on essential
components; and (iv) IDA should agree to a joint funding arrangement for a contract only if IDA
procurement guidelines are acceptable to the cofinancier and only if IDA is authorized to administer
the disbursement of the cofinancier's funds; and (v) IDA should require the Borrower to sign and
enforce, through legal contracts, the return of staff/trainees to work for a specified period after
completion of training to benefit the Government entity that financed their training and studies.

2. Background
The Power Subsector
2.1       At the time of appraisal of the Fourth Power Project in 1985, YGEC was responsible for
public electricity supply in the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR). In November 1991, 18 months after
the unification of the two Yemens into the Republic of Yemen (ROY), it was proposed that the two
electricity utilities, YGEC, responsible for public electricity supply in the Northern Region, and the
PCEP, responsible for electricity supply in the Southern Region, merge into the Public Electricity
Corporation (PEC). Although the operations of PCEP and YGEC were unified, the legal steps
required to consummate the proposed merger were never taken. As of 1987, prior to Credit signing
and effectiveness of the Fourth Power Project, YGEC of the Northern Region had an installed total
capacity (interconnected and isolated systems) of 408 MW and gross generation of 703 GWh, which
increased to 412 MW and 1,524 GWh respectively by 1993.
2.2      In 1992, about 42 percent of the population of the Northern Region was supplied with
electricity; about 20 percent by private producers and 22 percent by YGEC. YGEC provides
electricity to its consumers from two systems--the interconnected (ICS) and isolated systems. Since
the share of electricity sales from the isolated system declined from about 15 percent in 1983 to about
4.5 percent in 1992, the observations in this section mainly relate to the ICS. Prior to 1983, YGEC
had an installed generation capacity of about 62 MW in diesel power stations in the urban areas of
Sana'a, Hodeida and Taiz and an installed capacity of about 26 MW in 25 isolated areas in YAR.
With the commissioning of about 150 MW capacity at Ras Katenib thermal power station in
1983/1984 and the installation of the 132-kV transmission lines, YGEC laid the foundations for the



2
basic interconnected system to cater to the electricity demand in the urban areas of Sana'a, Hodeida,
Taiz, Dhamar and Ibb. The diesel power stations in the urban areas were connected to ICS which
was further augmented by the commissioning of about 160 MW of capacity at the Al Mukha thermal
power station in 1986/87. However, the Government/YGEC did not provide adequate funding for
development of the electrical distribution network to fully utilize the installed generation capacity of
ICS. Thus, in 1988, the ICS installed capacity of 372 MW was far in excess of the demand of 144
MW and the reserve margin (difference between the generating capacity and peak load expressed as a
percentage of peak load) for the ICS was about 158 percent compared to the normal margin of about
40 percent for the weakly interconnected system in ROY. For full utilization of the excess installed
capacity of ICS, and to provide additional electricity sales revenue for YGEC, the Government/YGEC
decided to give high priority for development of the electrical distribution system with a special
emphasis on connecting major industrial loads to the ICS. Thus, except for marginal investments in
the addition of small isolated diesel generation capacity, and expenditures for power plant spares and
for efficiency improvements in existing power stations, investment in the power subsector since 1987
has been mainly for expansion of the transmission and distribution systems. As a result, the
maximum demand of ICS nearly doubled from 128 MW in 1987 to 240 MW in 1993.
2.3      In the meantime, due to delays in procurement of spare parts and lack of availability of
trained maintenance staff, the effective capacity of the generating units in the power stations declined.
Consequently, in 1993, the ICS effective generating capacity was 313 MW compared to the installed
capacity of 372 MW and the reserve margin was reduced to about 23 percent only. The inadequate
reserve margin for the size of ICS and the inability of the existing 132-kV transmission system to
adequately meet the demand in the Sana'a region resulted in deterioration in the quality of supply in
the Sana'a region. Consequently, YGEC had to resort to daily rolling blackouts in the region. To
rectify the situation, the Government/YGEC is considering emergency measures such as installation of
about 80 MW capacity of combustion turbines in the Sana'a region. Further, until the installation of
a natural gas pipeline from Marib to Sana'a is completed (which is based on the 1992 updated Gas
Utilization Study's recommendation to use natural gas resources in ROY for electrical power
production and industrial loads, such as cement plants), the combustion turbines would be using costly
diesel oil as fuel for generation of electrical power.
2.4      Implementation of the recommendations and measures proposed to be taken under the first
and second phase of the Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) funded under the Third and Fourth Power
Projects (Credits 1361-YAR and 1701-YAR) were expected to reduce the total system losses for ICS
from about 36 percent in 1984 to 23 percent in 1992. However, the actual system losses (station
auxiliaries and line losses) for the period were consistently higher than those estimated in the SAR.
This was mainly due to incomplete implementation of the first phase under the Third Power Project
and non-implementation of the second phase of FRP (para 4.4) under the Fourth Power Project. As a
result, even in 1992, the system losses of ICS and the isolated system continued to be high at about
32 and 36 percent respectively.
2.5       The SAR had projected higher YGEC electricity sales for 1986 through 1990 on the
presumption that the cement plants at Bajil, Amran and Mafraq would be connected to ICS in 1986,
1987 and 1990 respectively. However, due to delays (by YGEC) in completion of the required
substation facilities at Bajil and Amran cement plants, the two cement plants were connected to ICS
in August 1989 only. However, the supply to Amran was discontinued to avoid damage to the
equipment in the cement plant in April 1991 since YGEC was unable to maintain within acceptable



3
limits the supply voltage to Amran cement plant due to restrictions in the 132-kV transmission
system. The substation facility at Mafraq was completed by YGEC much ahead of the commissioning
of the cement plant which was connected to ICS (two years later than SAR estimates) in October 1992
only. Therefore, the SAR electricity sales estimates for the period 1986 through 1989 were higher
than the actual for the period. However, despite the delays in connecting the Mafraq cement plant to
ICS and disconnection of electrical supply to the Amran cement plant in April 1991, the actual YGEC
electricity sales for the period 1990 through 1992 were higher than the SAR estimates mainly due to
the additional demand for electricity created by unification of the two Yemens in 1990 (population
migration from the Southern Region to the Northern Region) and the return, in early 1991, of a large
number (about 0.6 million) of Yemeni workers from the Gulf countries as a result of the Gulf war.
Past IDA Involvement in the Sector (Table 1. p. 20)
2.6       This project is the fourth operation in the power subsector of the Northern Region (YAR)
managed by YGEC (after Credits 837-YAR, 1102-YAR and 1361-YAR). All four Credits were
interrelated, financing part of the foreign exchange project costs involving the supply of electricity,
rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution networks of Sana'a, Taiz, and Hodeidah, institutional
building and manpower development. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for the First
and Second Projects (Credits 837-YAR and 1102-YAR) demonstrates that the projects achieved their
physical objectives, but institutional development of YGEC was fraught with difficulties and
proceeded at a pace substantially slower than originally expected. The PCR on the Third Power
Project (1361-YAR) shows that it achieved the physical components in spite of major implementation
delays. It provided electrical service to 15,500 new consumers in predominantly rural areas, and
upgraded the service to 4,500 existing consumers at a cost of about 5 percent less than originally
estimated. The Fourth Power Project ensured continued involvement of IDA to address the general
policy issues related to the power subsector, such as rationalization of fuel prices and electricity tariff.
Its main thrust was to address the issues related to the: (i) balanced growth of the ICS (para. 2.2);
(ii) principal causes of system losses (para. 2.3); (iii) improvement of YGEC's operational efficiency;
and (iv) enhancement of the skills of YGEC staff.
3. Project Obiectives and Description
Project Objectives
3.1       The project aimed at assisting YGEC in: (a) efficient utilization of YGEC's earlier
investments in generation and transmission facilities; (b) achieving fuel saving for the economy by
connecting to ICS industrial consumers who were using costly diesel oil for generation of electricity
compared to the cheaper fuel oil used for generation by YGEC in its thermal power stations; (c)
extending electrical supply to about 23,000 new consumers and improving the quality of service to
more than 15,000 existing consumers; and (d) institutional development by providing technical
assistance for reduction of line losses, training and improvement of management, financial and
planning capabilities.
Project Description
3.2       The project as envisaged at appraisal comprised plant, works and services for (Table 5, p.
26):



4
(a) Area 1. The reinforcement of the distribution system connecting the towns of Ibb,
Dhamar, Rada'a and Yarim, and extension of the distribution system to the surrounding
areas including the areas of Ad Dahl, Az Zaydiah and Al Munirah; the extension of the
distribution system of the isolated power station at Al Beida; and the installation of
isolated diesel power stations and associated distribution systems at Al Fara and al
Mantaque for supply of electricity to the nearby villages.
(b) Area 2. Connection to ICS of the towns and nearby villages in the areas of Thila,
Hababah, Shibam, Raydah and Khamer.
(c) Area 3. Connection to ICS of the town of Sanhan and the surrounding villages.
(d) Technical assistance for consultancy services related to the second phase of the
Financial Recovery Plan; pre-construction and construction phase supervision of the three
areas; improvement of YGEC's technical, financial and administrative capabilities by
providing funds for expert assistance; continuation of the academic training, on the job
training and training abroad in utility education of YGEC staff initiated under the Third
Power Project; and
(e) Meter Testing Laboratory and Replacement of Meters. Construction of a meter
testing laboratory at Sana'a and replacement of about 8000 meters;
4. Changes in Project Scope
General
4.1       Events since Board approval on May 15, 1986, had an important bearing on the changes
in project scope. The Credit signing was delayed by about two years due to two major issues: (i)
financing gap caused by the Government's decision not to avail itself of a loan of about US$10.5
million offered by the Islamic Development Bank (1DB) for the procurement of materials and
equipment for Area 1 (para. 4.2); and (ii) inability of the Government/YGEC to comply with the
financial covenants as negotiated and approved by the Board (para. 8.1). The Credit was signed on
June 17, 1988 only after agreement was reached with the Government/YGEC on the measures to be
taken to improve the financial health of YGEC, revised financial covenants were incorporated in the
Credit Agreements, and after the financing gap was secured (para. 6.5). Further, Credit Effectiveness
was delayed by about four months due to delay in signing of the cofinancing agreement with the
Swedish Agency for International Technical and Economic Cooperation (BITS). The agreement with
BITS for funding of Package A (Area 2) was signed on November 1, 1988 and after completion of
the conditions for effectiveness by the Government/YGEC, the Fourth Power Project became effective
on February 1, 1989.
Area 1 (Package C)
4.2       The contract award for Area 1 was delayed by more than two years due to financing
difficulties and the delay in Credit effectiveness (para. 6.5). As a result, the Yarim area was
eliminated (YGEC, however, completed the works in Yarim from funds provided by other sources)
from the scope of the contract, since it needed urgent rehabilitation which could not await finalization



5
of the contract award for Package C (para. 6.6 b). Also eliminated from the scope of the contract
were the areas of Ad Dahl, Az Zayidah and Al Munirah due to the high costs involved. The major
difference between the scope prior to the contract award and the scope based on the line surveys
recently carried out by the contractor is related to the construction length of the 0.4-kv distribution
lines, which will be increased by 98 km mainly due to the increase in the number of consumers in
Area 1. The demand for electrical supply in Area 1 has grown faster than the implementation of
works, which was delayed; the work for Area l(Package C) has just started and would be completed
by March 1996 only (para. 8.1).
Area 2 (Package A)
4.3       The financing agreement with BITS contained a requirement that procurement of materials
for Package A should be of Swedish origin. YGEC decided not to utilize BITS financing since the
prices quoted by the winning bidder for Package A were about 30% higher than the prices for similar
items offered by the successful bidder of Package B. In spite of BITS' willingness to increase its
funding for Package A to match the offer of the successful bidder, the Government/YGEC did not
award the contract for Package A, mainly due to the procurement issue. Hence, project components
for Area 2 were never implemented. The completion of these components could have increased the
connection of new consumers by 2,805.
Area 3 (Package B)
4.4       The work under this package, funded by IDA, was completed in September 1992, about
six months later than the SAR estimate. The main difference between the scope at SAR and as
completed is the additional 115 km length of 0.4-kV distribution lines, partly due to the additional
1,709 consumers connected under the package, but mainly due to the actual length of 0.4-kV line
installed per consumer being about 46 meters compared to the SAR estimate of 28 meters.
Technical Assistance
4.5       Financial Recovery Plan. Under the Third Power Project (Credit 1361-YAR), funding
was provided for the first phase of the FRP for assisting YGEC in improving its planning, financial
and management activities. Under the Fourth Power Project, an amount of about US$1.58 million (in
foreign exchange) was included to implement the second phase (Table 5, p. 26). This second phase
provided for consultancy services covering 15 tasks (paras. 2.4, 5.3 and 8.2) for improving the
operational efficiency of YGEC in the areas of construction, generation and transmission. However,
due to the preoccupation of YGEC with the issues related to the unification, the Gulf War, and the
proposed merger of YGEC and PCEP, the second phase of the FRP was not implemented and only an
amount of about US$0.15 million was utilized by YGEC for completing the Tariff Study, which was
not part of the original project scope (para. 8.10). Since line loss reduction measures were important
for YGEC, and implementation of the second phase of FRP was unlikely to be initiated prior to the
Credit closing, IDA agreed to provide foreign exchange funding of about US$0.91 million from the
original FRP allocation for the software and hardware required for the line loss reduction study being
carried out under the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). There was no change in the
scope of the academic training component, which was initiated under the Third Power Project.
4.6       Training. There was no change in the scope of the training component (para. 8.4, Note
No. 8 p. 25).



6
4.7       Pre-Construction and Construction Phase Supervision. Pre-construction phase supervision
(up to contract award) consultancy services covered the three project areas; the consultancy services
for construction phase (after contract award) supervision were limited to two areas, Area 3 (Package
B) and Area 1 (Package C) only, since works for Area 2 were never implemented (paras. 4.3 and
5.2). It was estimated that about 75 expert months (EMs), out of the SAR estimate of 200 EMs for
the three areas would be required for construction phase supervision for Package A. As of the time
of the PCR mission, 75 and 36 EMs had been used for pre-construction phase supervision of Package
B and C respectively, and to complete the construction supervision of Package C, it is estimated that
an additional 80 EMs would be required by March 1996. Thus, 191 EMs would be required for the
pre-construction and construction phase supervision consultancy services of the two areas instead of
the SAR estimate of 125 (200 minus 75) EMs. The delay in award of the contract and execution of
works for Area 1, resulted in proportionately higher EMs required compared to the SAR estimates.
4.8       Expert Assistance. Foreign exchange funding of about US$1.7 million was provided (but
unutilized) for funding of experts and trainers to assist YGEC staff to improve efficiency of YGEC
operation and maintenance activities. IDA had emphasized the need for providing experts for on-the-
job training of YGEC staff with a view to improve efficiency of YGEC operation and maintenance
activities. However, due to preoccupation of YGEC with the issues related to unification, the Gulf
war and the proposed merger of YGEC and PCEP, this sub-component was never implemented para.
8.3).
Meter Testing Laboratory and Replacement of Meters
4.9        Taking into account the distances involved for transportation and the number of meters to
be tested, it was decided to install three meter testing laboratories at Sana'a, Hodeida and Taiz instead
of one at Sana'a as proposed in the SAR. However, due to preoccupation of YGEC with the issues
related to the unification of the two Yemens, the Gulf war and the proposed merger of YGEC and
PCEP, YGEC did not procure 8,000 meters (as estimated in SAR) to be used for the first phase of
replacing about 60,000 old meters (Note No. 6, p. 25).
5. Project Design and Organization
5.1       The project, for ease of funding by cofinanciers, was divided into three areas, but
supported the common objective of utilizing YGEC's earlier investment in generation and
transmission facilities by extending the electrical services from ICS. In spite of the division into three
areas, funding from one cofinancier alone could not cover the complete works for Area 1 for which
joint financing by IDB (US$10.5 million for material and equipment) and AFESD ($14.5 million
mainly for installation facilities and for material and equipment not funded by IDB) were envisaged in
the SAR. Further, to avoid delays and to provide timely assistance to YGEC in procurement
activities up to award of contracts for the three areas, the project design provided for YGEC to
continue services of the consultants who prepared the feasibility study for pre-construction services.
This gave YGEC adequate time for short listing of the consultants and inviting offers for the
supervision consultancy services for the three project areas.
5.2       Because of the interest of AFESD in technical assistance, it was to jointly finance on a 50-
50 basis with IDA consultancy services for pre-construction and construction phase supervision (para.
6.3). IDA ended up paying 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs for the consultants' services for



7
the pre-construction phase, to avoid delays in project implementation due to the Gulf War. However,
the arrangement of joint financing created some difficulties regarding timely payments to the
consultants for the construction phase supervision, which worsened during the Gulf War since the
office of AFESD had to be temporarily relocated. In addition, due to an error in translation from
English to Arabic of the percentage of the foreign exchange cost to be paid by AFESD, it paid only
about 40 percent instead of 50 percent of the foreign exchange amount invoiced by the consultants.
At the request of YGEC and to facilitate payments to the consultants, IDA, as a special exception,
made additional payments to the consultants just before the closing of the Credit. This experience
suggests that it would have been more efficient to avoid joint financing of a single consultancy
contract, unless the cofinancier's funds could be administered by IDA.
5.3       The consultancy services for the second phase of the FRP failed partly due to the Gulf
War, lack of YGEC commitment, and its over-ambitious design. The FRP consisted of 15 tasks
(para. 4.5); the FRP could have been more successful had it focussed on priority tasks such as tariff
study, system loss reduction, efficient load dispatch, inventory control and maintenance scheduling
(Notes Nos. 3 and 7, p. 25).
6. Project Cost and Financing
Project C=s
6.1       Since the Package C funded by AFESD (Table 6, p. 27) is expected to be completed only
by March 1996, the cost estimates for Area 3 are based on the updated contract quantities on the line
surveys carried out by the contractor for Package C. The cost estimates for the construction phase
supervision consultancy services, jointly funded by IDA and AFESD, are based on the actual
expenditures until closing of the Credit and estimated payments that would be made by AFESD to the
consultants upon completion of works for the component. The costs for other completed components
are based on the actual payments by IDA and YGEC. Table 5, p. 26 compares the SAR project cost
estimates with the actual/estimated costs for the project components. The actual/estimated total costs
stated in US Dollar and Yemeni Rial were about US$36.7 million and YR 439.7 million,
respectively, compared to the SAR estimates of about US$59.5 million and YR 451.5 million,
respectively. The actual/ estimated costs, which appear to be lower than the SAR estimates, cannot
be directly compared with the SAR total costs for the following reasons:
(a) the works for Area 2 were never implemented (para. 4.3) and the works for Area 1
were substantially modified (para. 4.2);
(b) the 8000 replacement meters were not procured (para. 4.9) and the expert assistance
was not provided (para. 4.8);
(c) no activities under the second phase of the FRP, as originally designed, were started
(para. 4.5) while the tariff study and equipment for line loss reduction were added;
(d) the construction phase supervision services were limited to two of the planned three
areas (para. 4.7); and



8
(e) equipment for three meter testing laboratories was procured instead of one (para. 4.5).
Further, because of the considerable variation in the exchange rate of the local currency
compared to the US Dollar (1US$ = YR 7.25 in 1985 compared to YR 12.01 in 1990), it would be
logical to compare the: (i) US$ estimate in the SAR with actual estimated costs for foreign cost
components; and (ii) SAR local cost estimate with actual estimated costs for the local cost
components.
6.2       Package B (Area 3). Table 5. D. 26. In spite of the increase in quantities (para. 4.4), the
foreign cost for the package was about 31 percent lower at US$5.0 million compared to the SAR
estimate of US$7.2 million. However, the local cost was higher by about 17 percent at YR 16.9
million compared to the SAR estimate of YR 14.5 million mainly due to the high local inflation rates
at the time of bid opening which increased from about 15 to 50 percent during the period 1989
through 1992, instead of decreasing from about 8 to 5 percent for the same period as assumed in
SAR.
6.3       Pre-Construction and Construction Phase Supervision. Table 5. p. 26. Even though the
actual total foreign exchange requirements for the two phases of supervision services and SAR
estimates appear to be close, in view of substantial changes in the scope of services (para. 4.7), a
separate review of the costs for the two phases of the supervision services would have been useful.
However, this proves difficult, since costs for pre-construction and construction phase supervision
consultancy services were not separated in the SAR (para. 5.2). It took 60 months for contract award
of Packages B and C compared to the SAR schedule of 16 months. Further, even with the reduction
of construction phase consultancy services to two areas, the costs are relatively higher than anticipated
because of the delays in contract award for Package C (para. 4.2) which is rescheduled for
completion in the first quarter of 1996 (and may be further delayed due to the civil war in Yemen),
about four years later than forecasted in the SAR.
6.4       Training (Table 5 p.27) . The cost for training (para. 8.4, Note No. 8 p. 25) was very
close to the SAR estimate: about US$0.69 million (PCR) compared to US$0.65 million (SAR).
Proiect Financing
6.5       Table 6 on page 27 gives details of the financing plan at three stages of the project cycle--
at appraisal, at the Credit signing in June 1988 and at the Credit closing in June 1993. The financing
plan at appraisal was based on the meeting of the cofinanciers held in Paris in January 1986, where it
was estimated that project costs aggregated to US$58.90 million (excluding interest on loans during
construction) of which US$11.70 million in local currency and US$ 47.20 million in foreign
exchange. By the time of Credit signing the total project financing was revised to US$56.30 million.
The Government did not avail itself of IDB funding of about US$10.5 million intended for Package
C. The bid price for Package C by the time of Credit signing in June 1988 was considerably lower
than estimated at appraisal, and the reduced financing gap was covered at Credit signing by both IDA
and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) financing. IDA was able to
provide about US$2.70 million, which was generated from its savings from Package B (Area 3), as a
result of the low bid prices and a favorable exchange rate of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR)
against the US Dollar (SDR 10.9 million equivalent to US$14.70 million). The Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development (AFESD) generated savings from the strong exchange rate of



9
Kuwaiti Dinars against US$ (KD4.2 million equivalent to US$15.20 million) and provided the
additional funds to secure the financing gap.
6.6       The project financing plan had changed further by the Credit closing date due to the
following events:
(a) After the Credit signing in June 1988, Package A was dropped from the project since
YGEC did not avail itself of BITS funding for Package A;
(b) AFESD agreed to provide additional funding to cover the increased cost of Package C,
which was rebid when the successful bidder refused to sign the contract unless the
contract price was increased and YGEC could not award the contract to the next lowest
evaluated bidder as the validity of all bids had expired;
(c) To assist in completing the funding for the package and avoid delays in contract award
for Package C (para. 5.2), the Association agreed to fund 100 percent of the foreign cost
of the pre-construction phase consultancy services (para. 6.3); and
(d) Out of the estimated foreign exchange cost of US$ 1.43 million for the
construction phase supervision services, YGEC covered US$ 0.31 million.
As of the Credit closing date, IDA had disbursed US$ 0.56 million; AFESD
agreed to finance the balance of US$ 0.56 million of which US$ 0.37 million
had been disbursed.
7. Project Implementation
7.1       Table 4, pp. 23-25 gives the scheduled and actual completion dates for the major activities
of the project components. The estimates of project completion for Package C (Item c below) and
construction phase consultancy services do not include the impact of civil war (Taiz under Area 1 of
Package C is very close to Aden, where the impact of war is heaviest), which started after the PCR
mission's departure. The delays in implementation of individual project components are summarized
below and discussed in detail under the notes to Table 4. In general, project implementation (with the
changes in scope) has been delayed by about four years compared to the SAR estimates mainly due
to delays in:
(a) signing of the Credit by about 21 months (para. 4.2);
(b) Credit effectiveness by about 4 months para. 4.2);
(c) contract award for Package C by about 23 months (paras. 5.2 and 6.6(b));
and the external circumstances beyond the control of YGEC, as follows:
(i) unification process of two Yemens;
(ii) the Gulf War;



10
(iii) delay in contract effectiveness (about one year) resulting from lengthy bureaucratic
procedures in opening the letter of credit;
(iv) lengthy Government approval process (about six to eight months) on the issuance of
change orders to the contractor; and
(v) YGEC inability to take timely action on the implementation of financial measures
agreed with IDA at the time of signing of the Credit Agreements, due to its lack of
powers to implement the agreed measures without the Government's approval.
8. Project Results
Electricity Services
8.1       Due to changes in scope and an estimated delay of four years in project completion, the
main project objective of connecting about 23,000 new consumers and improving quality of service to
about 15,000 existing consumers (in Area 1) could not be achieved by March 1992, as envisaged
under the SAR. By Credit closing, YGEC had only completed works for Area 3 (paras. 4.1), and
connected about 3,700 consumers to ICS. About 16,800 additional consumers will be connected in
March 1996, after completion of works for Area 1 (Package C)(para. 4.2). Thus, by then, about
20,500 consumers would have been added to ICS. In spite of the delay in adding new consumers,
YGEC generation capacity has been fully utilized and there is a need for installation of additional
generation capacity in ICS (para. 2.3). Further, since the work of Area 1 (Package C) has just started
and would be completed only by March 1996, the project objective of improving the quality of supply
to the existing 15,000 consumers (para. 3.1) could not be achieved at the time of PCR.
Technical Assistance
8.2       Financial Recovery Plan. Besides installation of distribution systems to connect additional
consumers to ICS, an equally important objective of the project was providing technical assistance to
assist YGEC in efficiently managing its construction, generation and transmission operations. The
consultants for these services were to make recommendations in important areas such as project
management, inventory control, efficient load despatch and system loss reduction. Unfortunately, the
funds provided for this were not utilized (para. 4.5). As a result the project objective of institutional
strengthening in these areas was not achieved.
8.3       Expert Assistance. This sub-component was never implemented. Consequently, an
important project objective of institutional strengthening, e.g. expert assistance for operations
maintenance in the areas of generation, transmission and distribution facilities, was not achieved
(para. 4.8). Experts funded by the Overseas Development Agency (ODA) are currently providing
limited expert assistance for YGEC operation and maintenance activities in the areas of transmission
and distribution.
8.4       Training. IDA supervision missions regularly requested information from ODA and
AMIDEAST agencies, responsible for the academic training of the students under the Third Power
Project. IDA was not fully satisfied with the way training was managed; the type of training and the
performance of the students should have been monitored better. Even though there was some



11
improvement in the management of training compared to that under the Third Power Project, the
project objectives for this component were only partly achieved. YGEC could provide details of 22
trainees out of the 28 trainees under the program that started under the Third Power Project. Out of
the 22 trainees, 12 are working with YGEC, eight either did not complete the studies or left YGEC,
and two in U.K. have yet to complete the studies.
Financial Performance
8.5        Under the Third Power Project the Government/YGEC agreed to take all measures
necessary to ensure that YGEC would cover at least 90% and 100% of its total operating expenses
(including depreciation on revalued assets but excluding interest chargeable to operations) in 1984 and
1985 respectively, and earn a rate of return on revalued assets of 3% in 1986 through 1988, 5% in
1989, 6% in 1990 and 8% in 1991 and each year thereafter. During appraisal and negotiations for
the Fourth Power Project the same rate of return objectives were also agreed upon; forecasts indicated
that YGEC could comply with the covenant through 1987, but that measures would be needed to
enable compliance thereafter. However, it soon emerged that due to adverse changes in YAR's
economic circumstances these targets could not be achieved in the absence of substantial tariff
increases. The main adverse changes in YAR's economic position included a rapid depreciation of
the Yemeni Rial from US$ 1.00=YR7.25 at appraisal to US$1.00=YR9.76 in 1987 and a substantial
fall in workers' remittances due to the Gulf War. The short supply and high cost of foreign exchange
slowed down YGEC's program for construction of transmission and distribution facilities to maximize
income from the excess generation facilities. In addition, the Government did not expeditiously revise
fuel prices paid by YGEC when the international oil prices softened. It was against this background
that YGEC proposed a Financial Action Plan (FAP) in 1987 to IDA, consisting of (a) reduction to
international levels of the prices of heavy fuel oil charged to YGEC retroactively from January 1987;
(b) allowing YGEC to purchase diesel oil free of duty; (c) adequate Government provision of funds to
enable Government departments and public sector companies to settle bills for electricity within 60
days of billing; and (d) specific annual increases in monthly service charges during 1988 though
1990. Considering the macro-economic situation as short-lived and beyond YGEC's control, IDA
management agreed to YGEC's proposed FAP, and modified the rate of return covenant, resulting in
a downward revision of the rate of return financial targets, with amendment of the Credit and
Development Agreements on June 18, 1988, as shown below:
Financial Targets
Debt-Service Coverage  At least equal to 1.5 times the projected debt service
requirement.
Accounts Receivable   Outstanding average of 60 days from billing date.

8.6         The performance of YGEC fell far short of even the revised financial targets agreed with
IDA (para. 8.5), as reflected in YGEC's recorded negative rates of return. YGEC operated at a loss
throughout project implementation and until Credit closing in 1993 (para. 8.9). YGEC's rates of
return on revalued assets were minus 3.4 percent, minus 5.6 percent, minus 5.7 percent and minus
7.3 percent in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 respectively. The forecasted return for 1993 is minus 4.7
percent. YGEC net losses increased from YR 111.71 million in 1987 to YR 380.97 million in 1992
on the basis of historical asset values. The discrepancy between the appraisal estimates and actual
financial performance resulted from failure to implement the FAP, as well as (i) the lack of any
significant tariff increase in the last ten years, before the Council of Ministers approved the tariff
increase that took effect on January 1994 (para. 8.9); (ii) operational inefficiencies in the system; (iii)
slower rate of distribution investments needed to utilize available excess generation capacity and
especially the slower rate of connection of industrial consumers; (iv) the 15% increase in salaries and
wages bill that took effect in January 1, 1992; (vi) a new tax on fuel consumption at the rate of 7.5%
fils/litre and rapid devaluation of the Yemen Rial from US$ 1 = YR7.25 at the time of appraisal to
US$1=YR  12.01 in 1990, which increased YGEC's imported fuel bill. The principal features, trends
and causes of YGEC's poor financial performance, are reflected below and in Table 17, p. 38. The
SAR positive profitability ratios are attributed to appraisal assumptions of increases in service and
connection charges and low operating expenses (low fuel costs and salaries), while actual results show
the opposite, with increased salaries and high fuel costs.

YGEC's Accounts Receivable
8.7         The level of accounts receivable has been a problem to YGEC consistently, well above
the agreed average 60 days from billing date. The outstanding accounts receivables ranged from a
low of about five months in 1988 to a high of ten months in 1993, as illustrated on the next page,
Figure 1. This contributed significantly to YGEC's serious liquidity problem, and stemmed from: (i)

Debt Service Coverage
8.8    Under this Credit,
YGEC was required to obtain IDA's prior
approval for any new long-term borrowing unless the net revenue for each year during the term of the
debt (before depreciation and interest) was at least equal to 1.5 times the projected debt service
requirement for such year, on all its
debt, including the debt to be incurred.
Although YGEC did not incur any long
term debt that is against this covenant,
its lack of profitability meant that the               Figure 2.  D-bt Activity
Government had to finance investment
expenditures and meet the utility's debt
service obligations as they fell due.
Thus, the Government provided a total                 06
of YR 4.7 billion from 1986 to 1992 and                0 2

Tariff
8.9        Since 1983, almost all customers within consumer categories in either urban or rural
areas have been charged a uniform tariff per kWh irrespective of the kWhs consumed. Industrial,
commercial and agricultural consumers are paying tariffs, which are about 2040% lower than fuel
cost and lower than rates paid by households. Only households pay enough to cover fuel costs. The
urban and rural tariff in the Northern Governorate remains at YR 1. 10/kWh and YR 1.5/kWh
respectively (even after the January tariff increase), equivalent to 37% and 51 % respectively of the
economic cost. Aside from tariff, consumers are also required to pay a connection charge, which is a
one-time fee incurred at the time of connection and a service charge. In 1988 the service charges for
commercial consumers were reduced from YR 100/month to YR 50/month for single phase
consumers, and from YR 200 to 100/month for three phase consumers. These reductions were in
response to persistent complaints from small workshops, where in certain cases the charges exceeded
the actual bill. The last increase in connection charges approved by the Government in the Northern
Governorate was in April 1991, involving the connection charges for the single and three phase
domestic consumers, non-domestic consumers and large consumers using current transformers (CTs).
8.10      Prior to the substantial devaluation of the Rial in February 1990, YGEC's weighted
average tariff had been above the long-run marginal cost (except for the large industries). Because of
the devaluation and the merger, it became necessary to undertake a tariff study to reflect economic
costs and to enable the whole power subsector to meet its revenue requirements. In July 1990, YGEC
agreed to complete a tariff study by November 1990, to be financed under the Fourth Power Project.
Originally, the Tariff Study was envisioned under the Third Power Project for the Northern Region
but the delay in its implementation caused it to be continued under the Fourth Power Project, and
redesigned to include the Southern Region after the unification. There was a long delay in
designating the consultant for the tariff study, which was finally completed by the Jordan Electricity
Authority and SwedPower in October 1993. The consultants' recommendations include the immediate
adjustment of tariffs to cover long run marginal cost, the transfer of accumulated unpaid debt service
to capital contribution, and reduction of electrical losses, operating expenses and average accounts
receivable. However, without reference to the Tariff Study, the Council of Ministers approved to
implement a tariff increase based on the Council's own evaluation, to take effect over a three year
period, starting January 1994. The gradual tariff increase will not have much impact, at least
initially, on the Northern Governorate since the tariff design was such that the electricity prices in the
Southern Governorate were to be increased first to bring them to the level of electricity prices in the
Northern Governorate. (During the PCR mission, IDA agreed with YGEC to evaluate the impact of
the tariff reform provided YGEC submitted its Investment Plan and Projected Financial Statements for
the next three years. However, immediately after the mission left, civil war broke out and
communication with YGEC became more strenuous).
Audits
8.11      There have consistently been delays of between 1-2 years in the submission of audited
financial statements. Under this Credit, YGEC was required to submit audited reports within 6
months after the end of each fiscal year. YGEC submitted its audited financial statements for 1989 in
January 1991; those for 1990 and 1991 were received in 1992 and 1993 respectively; and 1992
audited accounts were received only during the April 1994 PCR mission. Factors contributing to this



15
non-compliance were the lack of sufficient experience by the local staff in YGEC in producing the
financial statements for the auditors, late annual appointment of external auditors by the Central
Organization for Control and Auditing (COCA), the unification of operations of YGEC and PCEP
and the difference in accounting policies between the Northern and Southern Governorates. YGEC's
auditors until 1989 were Saba & Company in association with Touche Ross of London. They were
replaced by Dar Almohasaba, a local Yemeni auditing firm in Sana'a.
8.12      YGEC's 1992 (and the previous three years') audit report is qualified and several issues
including inventory valuation have yet to be resolved with COCA. YGEC's 1992 records reflect no
asset revaluation; an inaccurate consumer list; no control over assets; difference in prices for fuel
compared to those claimed by the supplier, the National Oil Company of Yemen (NOCY) (YGEC
does not agree with the oil company's high fuel prices, and is awaiting a Cabinet decision). The
delay presently experienced in the preparation of the 1993 Audit Report are related to a difference of
YR 240 million in fuel costs per YGEC's record compared to that claimed by NOCY and to
verification of accounts receivable and long-term loans. YGEC and its auditors are currently
reviewing the 1993 accounts and the auditors' report is expected shortly.
Economic Rate of Return
8.13      The actual internal economic rate of return (IERR) has been calculated for YGEC's
investment program for the period 1986-93, the same period in which the IDA financed part of the
project was implemented. The investment approach to calculating the IERR has been adopted to
avoid difficulties of separately identifying and attributing specific incremental benefits to the project.
This approach was similar to that adopted in the PCR of Power III and is widely used in the Bank.
Because the IERR is calculated on the investment program for 1986-1993, the resulting real IERR of
8 percent is not directly comparable to the 16 percent estimated for the project at appraisal.
However, given that the project is typical of the bulk of the projects in the program, its IERR would
be expected to be close to the program's IERR. The difference between the program and the
project's estimated IERR are explained by the lack of tariff increases, high inflation, high fuel costs
and non-completion of a number of critical project components. Whereas substantial resources have
been committed in generation assets, recovery of these costs is hindered by an inadequate distribution
system. The program's IERR was not adequate to cover the opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent
and is barely higher than the financial cost of debt capital of about 7 percent. Higher levels of return
could have been achieved with timely (yearly) adjustment of tariffs to compensate for high inflation
and the rapid depreciation of YR against US$ and with immediate implementation and completion of
the program.
9. Sustainability
9.1       The sustainability of the project will depend largely on the Government's commitment to
effect its tariff reform to cover the economic cost of supply and on YGEC's technical and financial
capability. YGEC's electrical supply remains unsatisfactory (para. 2.6) as at the time of PCR; and
system losses are still high. The full implementation of the second phase of the FRP, the
implementation of a Management Information System (MIS) and a cost management and inventory
control system, downward delegation of authority, improvement of operation and maintenance of
facilities with expert assistance, and review of organization structure for maximum utilization of staff
would be necessary to improve YGEC as an institution and develop its technical and financial staff,



16
thereby supporting the sustainability of the project which is in question. The situation could worsen as
a result of the civil war which started in May 1994.
10. IDA Performance
10.1      Supervision missions took place twice a year until 1989, when the merger and Gulf War
started. Following unification in May 1990, supervision was put on hold until the new Government
settled in. Meanwhile, IDA identified most of the appropriate financial, institutional and physical
issues, e.g., need for a tariff increase and reduction in accounts receivable, inadequate rate of return,
need for improvement of accounting and financial management, and need for system losses reduction.
IDA sent its last supervision mission in May 1992 to press YGEC and the Government to take action
to increase the tariff. The Government did not respond and the project was closed on June 30, 1993.
10.2      The IDA supervision missions have emphasized the importance of institutional
strengthening, but YGEC was preoccupied with the merger and Gulf War, resulting in the failure to
implement the FRP and to make use of other technical assistance. The FRP required under the
project certainly had merit but was overambitious given YGEC's limited implementation capacity.
The scope of the FRP had been revised during implementation to focus on the most essential issues
(para.4.5)
11. Borrower and Beneficiary Performance
11.1      The Project experienced delays due to the failure of the Government to take appropriate
actions causing IDA to extend the signing and effectiveness of the Credit. This inaction suggests an
initial lack of commitment on the part of the Government and YGEC to proceed with the Project.
The technical staff of YGEC, having the experience from the earlier three power projects, was
technically competent to handle the implementation of the project, although substantial delays took
place, particularly during the start-up, for other reasons.
11.2      The problems that adversely affected the Third Power Project resurfaced during the
implementation of Fourth Power Project (para. 6.1). The financing difficulties due to the Gulf War,
procurement issue and lengthy negotiations (two-year delay in signing and effectiveness) with
YGEC/Government, all contributed to the implementation delays. IDA supervision missions reported
that YGEC's project implementation progress was habitually behind (revised) schedule.
11.3      YGEC's financial performance was unsatisfactory during the entire project period, and
never satisfied the performance criteria (return on revalued assets, debt service coverage, accounts
receivable outstanding in months, submission of audit reports) stipulated under the Credit and Project
Agreements (para.8.6). Govermment departments and agencies throughout remained behind in
payment of bills (para. 8.7).
11.4      On the operational side, e.g. energy generated and distributed, number of customers,
number of villages electrified, YGEC performed unsatisfactorily. The system losses have remained at
a range of 32 and 36 percent for the ICS and isolated system (para. 2.4) since 1984, instead of
declining to 23 percent in 1992 as estimated in the SAR.



17
12. Performance of Consultants and Contractors
12.1      The performance of YGEC's consultants and contractors for pre-construction and
construction phase services was generally satisfactory.
13. Project Relationship
13.1      The IDA's staff maintained a good working relationship with the Government and YGEC.
14. Project Documentation
14.1      Except for the delayed audited financial statements and report, the project was reasonably
documented. The SAR, progress reports and supervision reports provided the essential information to
evaluate project implementation. The Credit and Development Agreement as well as the SAR
adequately reflected project objectives.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
(CREDIT 1701-YAR)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BENEFICIARY'S PERSPECTIVE
(Text as prepared by YGEC)
A. Bank's Performance
It is PEC opinion that the Bank performed very well during the project, i.e. the Bank
acted as expected for the benefit of the project during the early stages of the project, appraisal process
and the Supervision phase.
B. Borrower's Performance
Main strengths - PEC had a very strong Project Organization during the project with the
following staff directly attached to the Project Office:
1. General Manager of Projects
2. C & S Project Managers
3. Project Manager
4. Site Engineers, Electrical
5. Site Engineer, Civil Work
Furthermore a number of specialists from PEC participated in the tests of the Sayyan
33/11 kV Substation.
Main weaknesses - The complicated processing system for the Contractor's invoices, after
the issue of Payment Certificate, caused a lot of problems and delay in payment. The documents
have to pass at least 10-12 different steps in PEC including participating agencies and each step is
normally related to a person and not to a department or function. If one person in this chain is absent
the whole process is delayed during his absence.
In spite of the strong project organization described above PEC was not able to issue
wayleaves in time to the Contractor. The difficulties are related to the traditional strong position of
the landowners in Yemen and their aversion against any encroachment on their property.
Otherwise PEC performed very well during the project preparation stage, during other
phases of the project prior to project implementation and during project implementation. The main
problems during the implementation of the project are related to an inferior study made by a
consultant (Lahmeyer) which resulted in underestimated contractual quantities.
C. Project Relationship
1. Borrower and Bank: The relation between the World Bank and PEC must be described as very
good during all the stages of the project.



19
2. Borrower and Co-Financier (Arab Fund): The Consultant services should have been paid
50/50 by the World Bank and the Arab Fund. However due to a typing error the Arab Fund paid
only 33%' during a long time of the project which resulted in losses for the Consultant. Arab Fund
did not agree to settle the outstanding payment to the Contractor retroactive and therefore the payment
was arranged through the World Bank. Otherwise the relation between PEC and the Arab Fund can
be described as good.
3. Borrower and other parties: PEC had during the implementation of the project daily contracts
with both the Contractor and the Consultant to the benefit of all parties. The cooperation can very
well be described as a success. The relation between PEC and involved Yemen ministries have been
very good.

NOTES TO TABLE 4-
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Bid Package B (Area 3). In spite of the delays in credit signing and credit effectiveness, and delays in
opening the letter of credit, the implementation of the package was delayed by about six months only
compared to the SAR schedule. It would have been possible to complete the works under the package by
the SAR scheduled date, had the project manager been empowered to approve changes in contract, within
certain limits (since such changes simply involve the issuance of the Engineer's orders and to accommodate
the changes, a provisional sum of about 10 percent of the contract is provided), by eliminating the multi-tier
bureaucratic steps required to obtain approval of routine changes to the contract. Currently, before the
change orders can be issued to the contractor, YGEC has to obtain approvals of the: (a) YGEC board ; (b)
Ministry of Planning; and (c) Prime Minister. After obtaining these approvals, a detailed master list has to
be submitted to the Ministry of Planning for approval and onward transmission to the Ministry of Finance
for issuing the customs authorization. The whole process takes at least about 6 to 8 months.
2. Bid Package C (Area 1). The works under the package have been delayed by about four years (based
on the estimates prior to the outbreak of civil war, which could delay the completion of works if the
contractor is prevented from carrying out the installation of work in the area) compared to the SAR
estimates. In addition to the delays mentioned in para. 7.2 for opening the letter of credit and approval of
changes orders, the package had to be rebid (para. 6.7).
3. Pre-Construction Phase Consuliancy Services. During the cofinanciers meeting in Paris in January
1986, to maintain the schedule for contract award and to assist YGEC in procurement activities leading to
contract awards for the three project areas, it was agreed to continue the services of the consultants who
prepared the feasibility study for the project in 1984. The SAR had estimated that the contract awards for
the works in the three areas would take about 16 months from the date of Paris meeting. Accordingly, the
consultants had estimated an amount of about DM 0.49 million for the services. However, due to
procurement delays and rebid of Package C, the consultancy services had to be continued for 60 months,
instead, and the final amount paid was about DM 1.25 million; about 2.5 times the original estimate.
4. Construction Phase Consultancy Services. The delay of two years in contract award for the
consultancy services compared to the SAR estimate did not have a major impact since the contract award
for the bid packages B and C were delayed by about 16 and 36 months respectively. Since YGEC signed
the consultancy contract without prior review by IDA in August 1989, an amendment to the contract had to
be issued in February 1990 to ensure compliance with IDA guidelines for selection of the consultants, and
incorporation of the payment terms for joint funding (para. 5.2) agreed with AFESD. As mentioned in
para. 5.2, the consultants faced some difficulties in obtaining timely payments due to the situation created
by the Gulf War and AFESD (paras.4.7 and 6.3).

Notes to Table 4 (Con't.)
5. Twiff Study. This study, originally to be undertaken under the Third Power Project, was not included
in the Fourth Power SAR project scope but in view of the importance of the study in assisting the
Government/YGEC in rationalization of existing electricity tariffs in the Northern and Southern regions and
in adjusting the electricity tariffs to economic levels, IDA agreed to provide funding for the study. Initially,
in January 1990, to save time in completing the Tariff Study and at the request of YGEC, IDA agreed to
extend the services of the consultants assisting YGEC in implementation of the first phase of the FRP.
However, with the merger of the two Yemens in May 1990, the Government/YGEC requested IDA's
consent for YGEC to invite offers from the short-listed consultants to carry out the Tariff Study that would
cover the regions controlled by YGEC and PCEP. IDA agreed, but the study was completed in about 12
months instead of the 7 months estimate.
6. Meter Testing Laboratory Equipment. The equipment was procured about five years later than the
SAR estimate, since YGEC faced difficulty (shortage) in funding Package B, of which it was a part.
Finally, YGEC procured the equipment for the three laboratories at Sana'a, Hodeida and Taiz (para. 4.5).
7. Line Loss Reduction Equipment. In view of the high line losses in ICS, IDA actively encouraged
YGEC to carry out the Loss Reduction Study with UNDP assistance (para. 4.9). Since the funding for the
study was not adequate for procurement of equipment (such as computers, plotters and recorders) needed
for the study, IDA agreed to provide funding for the equipment. YGEC procured the equipment when
works under Package B were near completion.
8. Academic Training. The training was an extension of the training program funded by IDA under the
Third Power Project (Credit 1361-YAR).

(1) The SAR and PCR total project costs cannot be directly compared since actions against sonme of the components (Area 2, TA including replacement of meters and expert assistance) were not initiated.
Further, the action against the Financial Recovery Plan, was limited to carrying out the Tariff Study only. In addition, SAR had provided for establishment of one meter testing laboratory in Sana'a only
while three meter testing laboratories (at Sana'a, Hodeida and Taiz region) have been established with the meter testing equipment procured under the project. Computer (hardware and software)
equipment for assisting YGEC/UNDP in completing the line loss reduction study was also procured under the project component.
(2) SAR estimated project completion date was December 31, 1992, six months prior to Credit Closing Date of June 30, 1993. Due to delayed start of the project activities and delays due to the Gulf War
in January 1991, only package B activities were completed on September 19, 1992, prior to the SAR project completion date. Activities under package C (funded by Arab Fund) were delayed and are now
estimated to be completed by December 1996. Therefore the SAR project costs (for the period 1986 through 1992) are compared with the PCR actual/estimated cost (for the period 1986 through 1996).
(3) SAR project cost Table (SAR-Annex 3.3) has some arithmetical errors in USS costs, which have been corrected in Table S above ( para. 6.5, Table 6 and footnote 8)

NOTES:
1. Board Approval - As presented to the Board was based on the co-financiers' meeting held in Paris from
January 16 through 17, 1986. During the meeting, BITS confirmed that the Board of BITS had approved a credit
amount of US$ 10.5 million equivalent, which was later revised to US$11.10, since the original cost estimates did
not cover the full foreign exchange requirements.  On November 17, 1986, the Government of YAR informed
that IDB's Board had approved their financing of the project and IDA hoped that the YAR Parliament's approval
would follow shortly.
2. Credit Signing - The YAR Parliament, however, did not approve IDB funding of US$10.5 million equivalent
for Package C of the project due to high leasing fees charged by IDB. In addition, as a result of high prices of bids
received for the Package A funded by BITS, there was a shortfall in foreign exchange funding for Packages A and C.
BITs agreed for the additional funding required for package A. The issue of bridging the financing gap was resolved
since as a result of favorable SDR exchange rates against the US Dollar and low prices for bids against Package B,
IDA agreed to include in the contract for Package B, about US$ 2.7 million of material to be given for installation
to the successful bidder for Package C (para.6.5), some additional savings were available from AFESD and the bid
price for Package C was lower than anticipated in the SAR.
3. Credit Closing - The Government/YGEC did not finalize the award of contract for Package A, since rates
quoted by the successful contractor for Package A (who was also awarded the contract for Package B funded by IDA)
were about 30 percent higher than those quoted under Package B for similar items mainly due to restriction of BITS
that the materials procured for Package A should be of Swedish origin in contrast to the freedom of procuring material
for Package B from the Bank member countries. In addition, the Government and BITS did not reach an agreement
regarding the type of guarantee to be given under the BITS credit agreement. As a result, at the time of Credit Closing
Date, no contract for Package A has been awarded. Therefore, funding for Package A was deleted from the financing
plan. Further, YGEC did not commence activities against some of the items under the technical assistance component.
Consequently, only USS 11,059,958.16 were disbursed and an amount of US$ 3,957,823.46 (equivalent to SDR
2,831,587.75) was cancelled when the account against the credit was closed on November 5, 1993.
./  The Staff Appraisal Report (Annex 3.3) reflects an arithmetic error in project co.t. aggregating to USs 58.90 m, broken down into
local costs, USS 11.70 m and foreign costs, USs 47.20 m. This was corrected in Table 5 (p. 26), with totsl project costs of USs 59,538.7
m, consisting of local cosu USs 11,807.6 m and foreign cosu USs 47,731.1 m.
