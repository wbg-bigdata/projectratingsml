APPRAISAL OF
AN ORCHARDS PROJECT
ROMANIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania has requested
assistance from the Bank in financing a portion of its investment program for
orchards and fruit storage. An identification mission reviewed possible
project components in Romania in September/October 1978. Romanian preparation
reports were presented to the Bank in June 1979, and proposed project compo-
nents were reviewed by a preappraisal mission in September/October 1979. The
project was appraised by a mission consisting of Messrs. Noon, Clough, Schertz
(Bank) and Moulton (Consultant) in November/December 1979. A special mission
consisting of Messrs. Noon, Clough (Bank),. and Lynn (Consultant) visited The
Netherlands and Italy in January 1980 to review proposed project technology.
The findings of the following report are also based on work undertaken by
Messrs. Lazar (Bank) and Lynn as part of the preappraisal mission, and by
Messrs. M. Pekonnen and F. Wright (Bank) for computer applications used in
project analysis.
II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. The Role of Agriculture in the Romanian Economy
2.01      Agriculture plays an important role in the Romanian economy.  In
1978, agriculture accounted for 15.3% of national income and provided 32.5% of
all employment. Agriculture provided almost all of the country's food and the
raw materials required for a number of processing industries. In addition
agriculture supplied 14% of exports in 1978. The agriculture sector has also
acted as a reserve pool of labor which has been used to meet growing employment
needs of other sectors, especially industry.
2.02      The rate of growth of the Romanian economy has been impressive over
the past two or three decades. From 1951 to 1978 national income grew at an
average rate of about 9% per annum. During this period national income in
agriculture grew at an average rate of 3.5% per annum. As the rate of growth
in agriculture was less rapid than in other sectors of the economy, agricul-
ture's share of national income declined from 27.8% in 1950 to 15.3% in 1978.
2.03      Between 1948 and 1978 the population of Romania increased from 15.9
to 21.0 million. During the same period the rural population declined from
12.2 million to 11.2 million. The proportion of people living in the rural



- 2 -
areas therefore declined from 77% in 1948 to 51% in 1978. The decline in the
agricultural labor force has been even more marked, from 74% in 1950 to 33% in
1978. Despite these significant changes, more than half of the population
still lives in the rural areas and one third of all employment is provided by
agriculture.
2.04      Romanian agriculture benefits from relatively good soils, a climate
seasonally suitable for production, and exploitable water resources. Out of a
national total of 23.8 million ha, 14.9 million are used for various types of
agricultural production. Of the agricultural total, arable land accounts for
65.8% (9.8 million ha), pasture 20.1% (3.0 million ha), meadowland 9.4% (1.4
million ha), and vineyards and orchards 4.7% (0.7 million ha). Romania can be
divided into three agroclimatic zones based on climatic factors, topography,
soils, and other natural conditions influencing land use and agricultural
performance. The Plains Zone, located in the western, southern, and eastern
parts of the country, is especially well endowed with fertile soils and
irrigation infrastructure; it contains approximately 53% of total arable land
but only 18% of land under pastures and meadows. Crop yields tend to be
highest in this region. The Foothills Zone, situated mainly to the north of
the Plains Zone, is characterized by shallow, less productive soils. About
28% of the total arable land and 32% of total pasture and meadowlands are
situated in the Foothills. The Mountain and Tableland Zone, including dis-
tricts in the northern and central parts of the country, accounts for 19% of
total arable area, but 50% of pasture and meadowlands.
2.05      Romanian agriculture has undergone a major transformation following
the collectivisation measures introduced since the Second World War. Today
agricultural production, especially crop production, is dominated by state
agricultural enterprises (UASs) and agricultural production cooperatives
(CAPs). Production by individual farmers and from small private plots of
cooperatives members is relatively unimportant except for certain products
including fruit and livestock. Agricultural Mechanization Stations (SMAs)
play a major role in providing machinery hire services to all producers.
Recently a number of Intercooperative Associations (ICAs) have been formed
through combining the activities of a number of individual cooperatives.
These ICAs are engaged in various large scale agricultural operations such as
pig and poultry production. ICAs are expected to undertake about 30% of
investment in new orchards from 1980 to 1985 and will play an increasingly
important role in fruit production.
2.06      In 1978, crop production accounted for 56% of total agricultural
output. About two thirds of all arable land is planted with cereals, espe-
cially wheat and maize. Other important crops include soyabeans, sunflower,
sugar beet, potatoes and vegetables, fodder crops, grapes and fruit. Livestock
accounted for 44% of agricultural output in 1978. In that year the livestock
population in Romania included 6.5 million cattle, 10.3 million pigs, 15.6
million sheep and 100 million poultry.



B. Development Constraints and Issues
2.07      Although considerable progress has been made in increasing agricul-
tural production in Romania in recent years, the sector remains relatively
underdeveloped. One of the main constraints preventing rapid agricultural
development has been the low and erratic rainfall in the principal agricul-
tural areas of the country, especially in the Danube plains. Many areas have
also suffered from flooding at certain times while soil erosion has also been
a problem.  Fortunately the soils in most of the crop producing areas are
good, and there is an excellent source of water in the Danube and its tribu-
taries. Romania has therefore given high priority to development of irriga-
tion, flood control and drainage.  The total area under irrigation has been
increased from 200,000 ha in 1960 to 2.2 million ha in 1979. The latter is
equivalent to 23% of all arable land. Government plans to increase the area
irrigated to 3.7 million ha by 1985. Development of irrigation would there-
fore continue to play a central role in agricultural development strategy.
2.08      State farms and producer cooperatives are the most important forms
of production unit in Romanian agriculture. These farms have at times suffered
from a shortage of material inputs such as machinery, fertilizers and other
agricultural chemicals. Due to a shortage of foreign exchange, Government
has sometimes exported fertilizers or reduced importation of pesticides and
insecticides which were needed by Romanian agriculture. In the past IASs have
received a higher share of investment relative to their share of cultivated
land while CAPs have been relatively neglected and have consequently been less
productive. IASs have also been better endowed than CAPs with good land,
skilled management and farm inputs such as fertilizers. Recently Government
decided that it would discontinue its previous policy of giving favored
treatment to IASs and would instead accord equal treatment to IASs and CAPs.
This new policy is to be implemented through newly created Unified Agroindus-
trial Councils (UACs) which are responsible for providing equal levels of
services and inputs to cooperative and State sector farms. There will be
about 700 UACs, one for each SMA, which will operate under an annual plan from
the Judet General Department for Agriculture of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Food Industry (MAFI). Each UAC will in turn be responsible for coordina-
tion of all agricultural activities, and the production and other operating
results of the State and cooperative units in its area. One of the major
features of the reorganization is the centralization of all farm mechanization
services for both State and cooperative farms under the direct control of the
UAC.
C. Sector Planning, Strategy and Investment Program
2.09      Agricultural policy is formulated within the framework of a national
plan approved by Government and the Romanian Communist Party. The plan is
comprehensive and determines the physical and financial framework for all
important areas of the economy. The next development plan will cover the
1981-1985 period. The guidelines for this plan were approved by the Party
Congress in November 1979, and the detailed plan will be released later this



- 4 -
year. Each year, annual development plans are prepared and these provide the
basis for implementation of the overall targets set out in the five year
plans. Approved Government plans are enacted as laws and it is mandatory for
all actual investment decisions to be made within the framework of the plan.
2.10      For the 1981-85 plan, the guidelines forecast that national income
will increase at a rate of between 6.7 and 7.4% p.a., gross industrial produc-
tion is to increase in the range 8.0 to 9.0% p.a. and gross agricultural
production at 4.5 to 5.0% p.a. Investment in agriculture in this period will
amount to 155 billion Lei (US$8.6 billion), equivalent to about 12% of total
national investment for the plan period. The main thrust of agricultural
development strategy will be to increase crop and livestock yields through the
use of more efficient techniques, especially improved mechanization, increased
use of fertilizers and other inputs, and further large investments in irriga-
tion. The plan also aims to improve the efficiency of management and organi-
zation within agriculture especially through the creation of the new UACs and
through a reorganization of the Ministry for Agriculture and Food Industry
(MAFI) in August 1979.
2.11      Specific investments planned for the agricultural sector during the
1981-85 plan include:
(a) investments of Lei 133 billion (US$7.4 billion) on State
and cooperative farms;
(b) an increase of arable area by about 154,000 ha, by 1985,
through reclamation of land in the Danube delta and in
other zones, bringing the total to about 10 million
ha;
(c) an increase of irrigated areas from 2.2 million ha in
1979 to about 3.7 million ha by 1985;
(d) provision of drainage facilities for an additional 0.8
million ha and soil erosion control works to protect an
additional 1.0 million ha;
(e) an increase in the use of high power tractors, to reach
140,000 units, and self-propelled harvesters to 40,000
units, including a wide range of other multipurpose farm
machinery and equipment;
(f) an increase in fertilizer applications to about 3.8
million tons p.a. by 1985;
(g) provision of increased quantities of pesticides and high
yield seeds and seedlings; and
(h) improvement of the present breeds of livestock and devel-
opment of new ones.



- 5 -
2.12      Developments planned for the orchard sector in the 1981-85 period
would be consistent with the overall plan strategy of increasing yields
through the introduction of improved production methods. New orchards to be
developed during the plan period would produce fruit yields much greater than
present average yields, through the introduction of improved tree varieties,
more intensive planting, the increased use of fertilizers and crop protection
chemicals, and improved management. Most of the new orchards -to be developed
in the new plan period would be irrigated.
D. Bank Assistance in Agriculture
l
2.13      The Bank has made 25 loans to Romania since it became a member in
December 1972, for a total volume of lending amounting to US$1,537.8 million.
Eleven of these loans, totalling US$691.5 million, were for agriculture.
These included six irrigation projects, one agricultural credit project, a
flood recovery project and three livestock projects. The first irrigation
project (Guirgiu-Razmiresti, Loan 1082-RO) has been completed satisfactorily,
and a completion report for the project is being prepared. No OED reports
have yet been prepared for agricultural projects in Romania. Progress with
all agricultural projects has been satisfactory. These projects have been
supervised regularly by Bank staff.
III. THE BANK FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRY
3.01      The Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) is a State-owned
credit institution established in 1968 to finance and supervise investments
and operations in agriculture and agroindustries. The Administrative Council
is BAFI's policy-making body. Between the sessions of the Administrative
Council, the Executive Bureau acts as the decision-making body. BAFI's
operations are carried out by 39 branches, 57 sub-branches, 35 agency branches
in offices of the National Bank and about 850 credit cooperatives which serve
as BAFI'S agents for small-scale lending. Enterprises of national importance
are served by the three operational departments in the head office (agro-
industries, cooperative sector and state sector).
3.02      BAFI makes short, medium and long-term loans to the cooperative
sector and to a limited degree to individual borrowers (coop members and
private farmers). Short-term capital requirements of State enterprises are
financed mainly by equity contribution (State budget allocations channeled
through BAFI) and partly by BAFI production credits. Long-term investments in
State enterprises are likewise generally financed with equity from the State
budget channelled through BAFI.
3.03      One of BAFI's most important functions is that of financial agent
for State investments in agriculture and agroindustries. BAFI reviews and is
empowered to require changes in proposed development plans, disburses accord-
ing to approved plans, supervises implementation with particular emphasis on
adherence to appraisal estimates and plan targets, and collects depreciation



- 6 -
payments 1/ and net incomes for the State budget account. BAFI is paid a
commission for this service at the rate of 0.5% of the investment channelled
through it. Over the past several years, State equity contributions for
investments disbursed by BAFI were as follows:
Index
FY                  Million Lei                     1970 = 100
1970                     27,077                          100
1973                     39,471                          146
1976                     70,598                          261
1977                    93,445                           345
1978                    110,100                          406
In terms of their relative importance, net investments financed with State
equity channelled through BAFI were equivalent to about (31%) of BAFI's total
assets at the end of 1978.
3.04      Loans are primarily secured by "credit engagements" of borrowers,
who commit all present and future income to debt service and are obliged to
maintain all their financial assets in BAFI settlement (deposit) accounts.
Under BAFI policy, short-term credit extended to cooperatives cannot exceed
60% of the contracted value of the commodity whose costs are being financed,
and interest and principal repayments are deducted from the borrowers' account
when sales proceeds are realized.
3.05      The various sources of the funds channelled through BAFI as of the
end of 1978 were the State budget (35%), 2/ short term loans from the National
Bank of Romania (53%), deposits of State enterprises and cooperatives (6%),
BAFI's statutory capital and reserves (2%), and IBRD borrowings (4%). BAFI
has also undertaken US$300 million in other foreign borrowings in the past
ten months under cofinancing arrangements for three Bank-financed agricultural
projects, US$100 million in 1979 for the Second Livestock Project (Loan 1669-
RO) and US$200 million in April 1980 for the Mostistea Irrigation (Loan
1670-RO) and Third Livestock (Loan 1764-RO) projects. BAFI's on-lending
interest rates for investments under the proposed project will vary from 3 to
4% depending on the type of borrowing entity. Although these rates are lower
than the interest rate which BAFI will pay on the Bank's loan, the overall
average spread on BAFI's total loan is positive about 1.7% due to other
sources of funds which have lower effective costs.
1/   Depreciation charges are assessed on capital inputs on the basis of
cost and the legal life of each item, to provide for full cost recovery
and accumulate savings for future investments.
2/   Balance sheet items included under this category are the "Fund for short
term credits", the "Fund for medium - and long-term credits", accounts
payable to the State budget, and the State budget investment account
administered by BAFI.



3.06      BAFI's financial condition is strong and is expected to remain so.
The balance sheet reveals a prudent matching of assets lives with financing
sources. Net worth is about 2% of total assets, a ratio that is similar to
those of Western commercial banks and adequate in relation to the low propor-
tion of BAFI's repayable long-term debt, the low volatility of BAFI's revenue
and deposits, and the quality of its asset portfolio relative to loan default
risk.
IV. THE ORCHARD SUBSECTOR
A.  Role in Agriculture
4.01      Much of the arable land in Romania has suitable soils and is in
areas where the climate is favorable for fruit production. While fruit are
grown throughout the country, most species are grown in particular areas where
production conditions are most favorable (see Map). Apples, plums, pears,
sweet cherries and sour cherries are produced mostly in the Foothills Zone of
the Carpathians and in the rolling plateaus in the northern Mountain and
Tableland Zone where soils and terrain are suitable for orchards but less
desirable for field and row crops. Peaches and apricots are generally grown
in the Plains Zone in the south since they do better in the deeper and lighter
soils. Also, the warmer and drier climate in the plains is more suitable for
soft fruits.
4.02      The Statistical Yearbook indicates that the total area under fruit
in Romania was 418,000 ha in 1978. This was equivalent to 2.8% of all agricul-
tural land. The total area shown in the official statistics included 282,000
ha in the socialist sector (199,000 ha on CAPs and 83,000 ha on state enter-
prises). Data in the statistical yearbook, however, are misleading in that
they include areas under very old orchards which are no longer productive and
exclude significant portions of the individual producer sector for which many
trees around households were not recorded. A more recent fruit census con-
ducted by MAFI in mid-1979 indicated that the total area of fruit in the
socialist sector was about 253,000 ha, 29,000 ha less than the figure in the
Statistical Yearbook. This census also estimated that individual producers
have about 65 million fruit trees, over half of which are plums. The recent
census is considered more reliable as it has excluded from the area under
fruit a large amount of old orchards which had degenerated into pasture and
ceased to be productive, and sought to record trees of individual producers.
4.03      Although apples and plums are the most important species of fruit
grown in Romania a wide variety of other fruits are also produced. This
provides consumers with a choice of different fruits while it also helps to
extend the harvest season over a wider period. During 1976-78 local consump-
tion of fruit accounted for 93% of total production (excluding table grapes).
Only 7% of production was exported. The volume of exports has been erratic
and has not shown any increasing trend for the last 20 years. In addition to
fresh fruit which is sold through the marketing system for consumption within



- 8 -
Romania, a significant amount of fruit is consumed directly by producers, in-
cluding individual small farmers, plotholders on CAPs and private householders.
Some fruit is also processed in various forms including canned fruit, fruit
juices, and distilled alcoholic beverages, especially plum brandy (Tuica).
B. Production and Production Organization -
4.04     Fruit production in Romania has been relatively neglected and has
shown only a slightly increasing trend in the last few years as shown in
the table below. Total fruit production amounted to 1.2 million tons in 1965

and in 1970. This had increased to between 1.3 and 1.5 million tons during
1976-1978. However production has tended to increase more noticeably for
certain species of fruit. The data in the table indicate no significant
trend in the growth of production for plums, cherries and apricots, although
increases have been apparent for apples, pears and peaches. Romania has not
until recently been replanting sufficient old orchards to maintain the national
orchard in a healthy condition. In the period 1971-1975, orchard replantings
in the socialist sector averaged about 5,000 ha p.a., or about 2% of the area
under Socialist sector orchards. During 1971-75 there were no radical changes
in the type of technology adopted and the yields obtained, and given an average
tree life of about 25 years it is necessary to replant about 4% of the orchards
each year if production is to be maintained. Thus in the period 1971 to 1975
if Romania had replaced 4% of its socialist sector orchards, replantings would
have averaged about 10,000 ha each year compared with the 5,000 ha actually
achieved. During 1976 to 1978 the rate of replanting in the socialist sector
increased to about 7,000 ha per annum while major changes were also made in
production methods. Most of the new plantings made since 1976 have been based
on more intensive planting systems while many have been provided with irriga-
tion. Yields from these new orchards are expected to be much higher than
those from the older established orchards. In addition to replanting, a major



orchard modernization and improvement program has also been started in the
socialist sector since 1976. Thus, fruit production from existing orchards in
the socialist sector is expected to increase in the next few years as recently
planted and modernized orchards come into full production. While data on
replantings are available only for the socialist sector, very little planting
material has been provided to fruit producers in the private sector during the
last decade and these producers must therefore have had difficulty maintaining
their fruit trees in a healthy condition.
4.05      The current very poor levels of production from Romania's orchards,
together with the concomitant low level of fruit consumption, provide the main
rationale for the orchard project described here. There is an enormous gulf
between the level of yields which would be obtained under the project using
modern orchard production practices and the actual level of yields currently
obtained in Romania. This is illustrated by the data below:
Existing       Average of
Classical      All Romanian        Project

Cherries          1.0               1.1             10.0
4.06      Fruit is produced by state enterprises and CAPs in the socialist
sector and by individual farmers, CAP plotholders and private householders in
the private sector. Although it has been given very little encouragement by
Government, the private sector plays a major role in fruit production. In
1978 about 57% of total fruit production came from individual producers while
the remaining 43% came from the socialist sector. Within the socialist sector
56% of production came from state enterprises and 44% from CAPs. Production
in the co-operative sector was very poor, for CAPs had more than twice the area
of orchards compared with state enterprises yet produced less fruit than the
state sector. The official statistics indicate that in 1978 yields on State
enterprises averaged 3.8 tons/ha while on CAPs yields were only 1.2 tons/ha.
Although these yield statistics must be treated with some caution because of
lack of accurate area statistics, there is no doubt that CAPs control a major
share of Romania's orchard lands yet obtain very poor yields. The performance
of CAPs represents a major weakness in Romania's fruit industry which to some
extent must reflect the Government's earlier policy of concentrating develop-
ment, investment and input supplies on State enterprises.
4.07      The relative importance of fruit production in the socialist sector
compared with the individual farm sector varies according to the type of fruit
produced.  In 1978 about 66 percent of all plums, 83 percent of all cherries,



- 10 -
and 74 percent of apricots were produced by individual farmers and CAP plot-
holders. On the other hand 63 percent of apples and 90 percent of peaches
were produced in the socialist sector. In the socialist sector new orchard
plantings are now based on intensive methods of planting with much higher
plant populations than the traditional methods. These intensive methods
produce fruit more quickly than the traditional methods, and because the trees
are short, enable most work to be done without the use of ladders. They
therefore permit the much more efficient use of labor, an important considera-
tion with a labor demanding crop such as fruit. The intensive plantings
require much larger numbers of plants per hectare and Romania has started
to modernize its orchard nurseries in order to produce increased quantities of
better quality planting material.
C. Domestic Consumption and Export
4.08      Fruit is produced in Romania primarily for domestic consumption.  Of
the seven main species (apples, pears, plums, sweet and sour cherries, peaches
and apricots) over the period 1976-1978, 63% was used locally as either fresh
or processed fruit, 29% was distilled in order to make alcoholic beverages,
and only 7% was exported (see Annex 2, Table 1). Of the amount consumed
within Romania 35% was consumed directly by producers, 28% was sold fresh and
36% was processed. Exports included 61% as fresh fruit and 39% as processed
fruit. The major export markets were in western Europe (45%) and the Comecon
countries (40%).
4.09      For fruit grown in Romania local consumption during 1976-1978
averaged 44.2 kg per capita (see Annex 2, Table 1). In addition consumption
of imported fruit, primarily citrus, amounted to about 3 kg per capita. This
level of consumption was low compared with most other countries at a similar
stage of development. For example, fruit consumption in Bulgaria, Turkey and
Greece has been about 101, 100 and 106 kgs per capita (p.c.) respectively in
the early 1970s. Consumption in Romania has been low primarily because it was
constrained by the lack of supplies of local fruit, while Government has kept
fruit imports to a minimum in order to conserve foreign exchange. The quality
of fruit available on the local market has also been very poor partly because
of production and grading problems on the farms, but also because of inadequate
fruit handling and storage facilities in the marketing system. At present
Romania has limited cold storage capacity while it has no controlled atmosphere
storage. It has not therefore been possible to keep significant quantities of
fresh fruit for consumption in the off season.
4.10      Although 29% of all fruit produced in Romania was distilled, this
heavy use for distillation resulted primarily from the manufacture of plum
brandy. Plums accounted for 93% of all fruit used for distillation and this
type of use was unimportant for all other types of fruit. Individual producers
account for the bulk of the plums used to make brandy in Government-owned dis-
tilleries.

D. Handling, Storage and Processing
4.11      Romanian post-harvest fruit sorting, grading and packing facilities
are characterized by lack of uniformity and poor presentation of the products
in domestic and export markets. Fruit handling begins with hand picking,
fieldsorting and packing into boxes and/or box pallets for transport by truck
or trailer to local collection centers. The boxed fruit is stored normally in
non-refrigerated storage for a short period prior to entering the market dis-
tribution system.  Fruit for domestic consumption is usually transported in
non-refrigerated trucks to urban market centers and fruit for export is
transported by refrigerated truck, but normally without precooling prior to
shipment. At collection centers, fruit may be packed into consumer size
packages or into boxes for distribution to wholesale markets. Conventional
mixed fruit cold storage plants are located primarily in urban areas and are
used on a very limited basis for cooling and holding fresh fruit to prevent
product quality losses and to extend shelf life. In 1979, Romania had a
total fruit storage capacity of 331,000 tons of which 190,000 tons was non-
refrigerated and 141,000 tons was refrigerated. There was no controlled
atmosphere storage.
4.12      In 1979, Romania had 69 fruit processing facilities, with a total
processing capacity of 376,600 tons per year which produced such products as
compote, juice, jellies, jams, fruit syrup, nectar and frozen and dried
fruit. Present capacities are adequate, but since many of these facilities
have old, inefficient equipment and utilize obsolete technology, the 1981-85
plan provides for modernizing 13 of them. To keep pace with expanding produc-
tion ten modern fruit processing facilities are to be constructed by 1985 to
provide for the production of a larger variety of products.
E. Subsector Institutions
4.13      The General Economic Directorate for Horticulture (GEDH) of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry is the central institution dealing
with all aspects of fruit production, processing and marketing in Romania
(Annex 2, Chart 1). About 440 State farms and 765 cooperative units are
responsible for the bulk of actual fruit production in the socialist sector,
but GEDH working through its Orchards Trust determines the technical packages
used by these units and coordinates the establishment of their production
targets. The Orchards Trust is also responsible for a system of 21 research
stations, 41 orchard nurseries and about 12,000 ha of orchards under the
direct control of its Institute for Research and Orchard Production. The
research stations of the Orchards Trust also provide some extension support to
individual fruit growers.
4.14      All fruit processing is undertaken by the Fruit and Vegetable
Processing Directorate of GEDH. This Directorate is responsible for 39
judet-level Enterprises for Processing and Industrialization of Fruit and
Vegetables. These are responsible in turn for individual fruit and vegetable



- 12 -
processing facilities. Production plans for the enterprises are established
centrally by the Directorate. The Research Institute for Marketing of Fruit
and Vegetables has the responsibility for new product development, adaptation
of new technology in processing and packaging, development of quality standards,
design engineering, storage technology and transportation methods. The Insti-
tute is adequately staffed with well qualified engineers and technologists,
but lacks modern laboratory, quality control, pilot plant and-specialized
equipment necessary to adequately support the packaging and processing of the
expanded production of fruit when new orchards become fully productive.
4.15      The Commercial Directorate of GEDH is responsible for marketing all
fresh fruit within Romania. This Directorate has 39 judet-level Fruit and
Vegetable Enterprises which operate sorting, packing and storage facilities,
and a system of retail fruit shops. The enterprises contract annually with
production units under a national marketing plan which is later adjusted by
the Commercial Directorate on the basis of pre-harvest production forecasts.
This adjusted plan provides the basis for final allocations among immediate
consumption, storage, processing and export channels. Individual producers
consume their fruit at home or market it fresh through local farmers markets.
Some individuals also contract to deliver fruit to the Judet Fruit and Vege-
table Enterprises, and use their contracts as the basis for securing BAFI
credit and inputs. Fruit exports are handled by Fructexport, a foreign trade
company responsible jointly to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry
of Agriculture. Fructexport is a trading company relying on the handling,
storage and processing capacities of the Judet-level marketing and processing
enterprises.
F. Subsector Strategy and Plan
4.16      The Government plans in the forthcoming Five-Year Plan to shift the
emphasis of its development strategy toward allocation of an increasing share
of GDP to consumption. Bank economic work has endorsed this shift, which will
result in a reduction in savings from 28% of GDP in the current (1976-80) plan
period to 23 or 24% for 1981-85. In keeping with this change in strategy, the
planning authorities have established (on the basis of Romanian scientific and
nutritional studies) consumption targets for 1990 for a wide range of food-
stuffs including fruits. The Romanian consumption target for fruit and table
grapes established as part of this process is 129 kg p.c. In comparison with
levels of consumption in other countries, this target is quite high and con-
sumption in the range of 95 to 105 kg p.c. would more reasonably be expected
for Romania. This disparity and its possible marketing consequences are dis-
cussed further in the paragraphs below and in Chapter VI.
4.17      In order to reach consumption targets, the Government strategy for
the subsector is to increase fruit production substantially by replacing older,
classical orchards with modern, intensive plantings on large-scale State farms
and cooperatives (including here and elsewhere below both CAPs and ICAs). The
process of orchard intensification, begun early in the current (1976-80) plan
period, would be accelerated with 70,600 ha of new orchard plantings planned
for 1980 to 1985 as follows:

A program to modernize 36,500 ha of the better existing apple and plum orchards,
already begun with interplanting to increase tree density, would be completed
during this period, bringing the total area of new and modernized orchards
to over 100,000 ha. The Government also plans related investments in both
conventional and controlled atmosphere cold storage, in fruit processing
capacity and in orchard nurseries. In addition to increased production, other
objectives of the program are: (i) to improve yields and production without
increasing the total area under orchards; (ii) to irrigate in most areas to
overcome summer water deficits, thereby improving yields and fruit quality;
(iii) to increase labor productivity, primarily with new planting systems; and
(iv) to improve product quality for domestic consumption and export.
4.18      Romanian production plans associated with its investment in the
subsector call for a three-fold increase in production from 1.3-1.4 million
tons in 1976-78 to 4.0 million tons in 1990. This plan should, however, be
viewed more as a target than a forecast. The appraisal mission's analysis of
past performance of established orchards in the socialist sector and of
existing individual orchard holdings, and a detailed yield build-up for recent
and planned orchard plantings, shows that production in 1990 is more likely to
be about 3.3 million tons. Recent production performance and plan targets are
compared with production forecasts in the following table: 1/

Annex 2, Table 2 presents a more detailed summary of the production forecasts
used in appraisal.
4.19      Based upon the findings in Chapter VI, a more reasonable expected
level of domestic consumption for all fruits and table grapes in 1990 would be
in the range of 95 to 105 kg p.c. The table below summarizes the disposition
of forecast supplies based upon consumption at 100 kg p.c.:
Disposition of 1990 Fruit
Forecast Supply -'000 tons
Domestic Fruit Production Forecast                       3,315
Table Grape Production Forecast                            555
Citrus and Tropical Import Plan                             75
Total Supply                                             3,945
Less Average Losses at 5.7%                           221
Available Supply                                         3,724
Less: Domestic Consumption

Less: Distillation at 1976-78
levels p.c.                                   430
Residual                                                   794
This analysis suggests that the 1980-85 investment plan could result in
about 800,000 tons of fruit and table grape production which would have to be
absorbed either by export markets or through additional domestic consumption.
About 400,000 tons equivalent of all fruit and table grapes can reasonably be
expected to be exported (Chapter VI), but the risk remains that, if the
Government's 1980-85 investment program is implemented in full, Romania could
face an oversupply of fruit by 1990. As indicated in Chapter VI, this problem
would not arise as a consequence of investments planned through the end of
1982, but there is a risk that investments planned from 1983 to 1985 could
result in over production in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Such problems
of oversupply could be particularly acute for apples and table grapes for
which later planned investments are especially large. This raises questions
as to (i) whether plantings planned for 1984 and 1985, and possibly 1983,
should be made and (ii) whether related investments in new orchard nurseries
are required. Against this background, the Romanian authorities should review
their consumption and export targets for 1990 before undertaking further
orchard investments after the project. During negotiations, it was agreed
that the Government will carry out detailed domestic and export market studies
to assist in making future orchard investment decisions, and that it will
submit full reports of there studies to the Bank for review and comment by
June 30, 1982.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Concept and Objectives
5.01      The project is a credit scheme designed to support increases in
Romanian consumption levels of fresh and processed fruits from an average
of about 47 kg p.c. for 1976-78 to about 95 kg p.c. by 1988. Project invest-
ment concentrates on seven fruit species (apples, plums, pears, peaches,
apricots, and sweet and sour cherries) which accounted for about 36 kg p.c. or
77% of domestic fruit consumption in 1976-78. The primary objective of the
project is to support an increase in domestic consumption of these species to
about 71 kg p.c. by 1988. While oriented primarily toward the domestic
market, the project would also permit increases in fruit export where export
opportunities exist. The project would support application in Romania of
modern, intensive orchard technologies proven commercially elsewhere. These
technologies will generate earlier commercial production and higher yields
than traditional lower density plantations. Modern methods will improve labor
productivity, and inclusion of irrigation in most orchards will reduce vulner-
ability to water deficits experienced in most summers. Modern controlled
atmosphere cold storage facilities are included to extend fresh fruit consump-
tion into the late winter and early spring. Technical assistance for handling,
storing and processing fruit will help to increase fruit quality and marketing.
B. Project Content
5.02      The project consists of (i) a 2-1/2-year tranche of Romanian invest-
ment commitments for 29,820 ha of new orchards, (ii) 19 modern fruit packing
and controlled atmosphere cold storage facilities, and (iii) technical assis-
tance to help improve fruit handling, storage, and processing, and for applied
research in mechanization of fruit production and harvesting. These invest-
ments would be undertaken between mid-1980 and the end of 1982. A more
detailed description of the project and its phasing is given in Annex 1.
5.03      The orchard components of the project comprise 89% of the proposed
investment and would be made under new, higher density planting systems,
reflecting commercial application in Romania of technologies already applied
commercially elsewhere in the world. The table below summarizes orchard
investments included under the project:

The average size of apple and pear orchards would be about 60-70 ha, and
the remaining species planted at lower densities would have an average orchard
size of about 100-120 ha. The typical subproject would contain more than one
such orchard farm unit, with about 120 subprojects averaging about 250 ha each
expected to be financed under the project. Items under each subproject would
generally include land preparation, farm fencing, planting stock, farm irriga-
tion systems where required, fertilizer and pesticide storage, fruit storage
and packing sheds, water supply, farm equipment, farm headquarters yard and
offices, and fertilizer and pesticides needed during the investment period.
Rainfall in most areas is inadequate (with water deficits generally experi-
enced in Jvly, August and September) and most subprojects would include on-
farm irrigation. Where technically feasible, species and varieties would be
combined within a single orchard to spread labor requirements over a longer
season. Apples, pears, plums and cherries would be planted on sloping lands,
generally in the Carpathian foothills, replacing existing substandard orchards,
hay pasture or low producing cereals (see Map). Peaches and apricots would be
planted in the plains area of the southern and western parts of the country
replacing older substandard orchards or field crops (see Map). Land previously
under old orchards would be rotated to cereal or other field crops for 2 to 3
years before replanting in order to permit decay of old tree roots, thus
reducing the risk of disease carry over.
5.04      The project would include 19 modern fruit packing and controlled
atmosphere cold storage facilities (see Map). Each facility would have
capacity to sort and pack 15,000 tons of extra and first quality apples
annually, 5,000 tons of which would be retained in the controlled atmosphere
cold store and 10,000 tons of which would be shipped to fresh markets or
conventional stores elsewhere in the country. Construction of eight of these
facilities would begin in 1981 and 11 in 1982; all would be in operation by

to be used as discussed in Annex 1.

1984. They would be located with convenient access from orchards in fruit
producing areas and would, in combination with 5 such facilities already under
construction, bring total controlled atmosphere storage to 120,000 tons of
static storage capacity. They have been designed primarily for apples as the
species with the best long-term storage characteristics and emphasized in the
absence of citrus as the main fruit for fresh consumption in late winter and
early spring. They would, however, also be used for sorting,.packing, pre-
cooling and short-term storage for the other fruits harvested earlier in the
season.
5.05      The technical assistance component would consist of equipment and
training needed to improve the quality of fruit handling, packing, transport,
storage and processing and orchard mechanization in Romania. Included in
the component would be (i) equipment for central research laboratories and
regional quality control laboratories for the Research Institute for Market-
ing of Fruit and Vegetables, (ii) pilot plant processing and packaging facili-
ties for the same Institute, (iii) specialized equipment to develop and
evaluate precooling handling and storage methods for fresh fruits, (iv) equip-
ment for applied research in mechanization of fruit production and harvest,
and (v) training of professional and technical staff in new quality control
and laboratory techniques. The technical assistance component to be imple-
mented under the project will include US$1.8 million to improve the quality of
final product delivered to the market through improved handling, storage and
processing; the remaining US$0.2 million of the component will be directed to
applied research in orchard mechanization aimed at improving labor productivity.
C. Project Costs
5.06      The estimated total cost of the project is US$323.9 million including
an estimated US$87.0 million or 27% in foreign costs. Project cost estimates
are based upon nine investment models (eight for orchards and one for storage)
using prices prevailing in mid-1980, and include US$1.6 million in taxes and
import duties on items expected to be imported directly under the project.
Physical contingencies for these investments have been taken at 4% of base
costs. Local price contingencies have been taken at 1% p.a., reflecting
Romania's controlled prices and low internal rate of price increases. Foreign
price contingencies have been taken at 5.25% for the second half of 1980, 9%
for 1981, 8% for 1982, 7% for 1983-85 and 6% thereafter. Project costs are
summarized in the table below:

D. Financing Plan
5.07      The financing plan for the project is summarized in the table below:

Cooperatives                   50.0                    15
BAFI and cofinanciers         223.9                    70
IBRD                           50.0                    15
Total                         323.9                   100
The proposed Bank loan of US$50 million equivalent would cover 15% of the
estimated total costs, and 57% of the estimated foreign costs, of the project.
The subborrowers contributions would be 11% of total costs, and the remaining
74% would be financed by the Government (BAFI) and possible cofinanciers. 1/
1/   With assistance from the Bank, BAFI will be sounding out commercial banks
on cofinancing possibilities under the project. Similar procedures for
three recent agricultural projects has resulted in US$300 million in co-
financing.



- 19 -
As in the recent Third Livestock Project (Ln 1764-RO), State farms and enter-
prises would not be required to contribute to the financing of their sub-
projects. Cooperatives would continue to finance about 30% of subproject
costs.
5.08      The Bank loan would be for 15 years including 3 years grace.  Terms
of any cofinancing are not yet determined but are likely to be more stringent
than those of the Bank.
VI. MARKETS AND MARKETING
6.01      Consumption of fresh and processed fruit in Romania to date has been
restrained by Government policies emphasizing investment in other areas and
limiting imports of items for consumption. This has been consistent with
the overall development plan, high savings and investment rates, and limita-
tions on consumption generally. Fruit production has shown only moderate
increases in the past decade,-and imports have been limited to small amounts
of citrus and tropical fruits (about 2-3 kg p.c. p.a.) which cannot be produced
locally. Consumption has thus been constrained by available supply to levels
well below those which would otherwise have prevailed. The market for fruits
in Romania is characterised by shortages (especially in the off season winter
months), rationing by line when fruit is in short supply, and sale of poor
quality fruit in the absence of adequate supplies. Consumption of domestically
produced fruit (including table grapes) for 1976-78 averaged 44.2 kg p.c.,
with overall consumption including imported citrus and tropical fruits of
about 47 kg p.c. for the same period. Detailed allocations of the uses of
domestic fruit production for these years are presented in Annex 2, Table 1.
6.02      The project, together with parallel investments planned for other
fruits and table grapes through the end of the project investment period
(end 1982), would permit a doubling of the consumption level to about 95 kg
p.c. by 1988. The main elements of this increase are presented in the table
below:

These consumption allocations are based upon the peak production forecast for
all fruit and table grape investments through the project investment period, 1/
but exclude production from later investments as described in para 4.18 above.
A summary of the production forecast for project species is given in Annex 2,
Table 2. More detail of the consumption allocation for 1988 is given in Annex
2, Table 3.
Domestic Market Size
6.03      The current supressed level of fruit consumption in Romania is not
a reliable basis on which to assess the potential size of the Romania market
for fruit in the long term, and appraisal has relied primarily on international
comparisons for this purpose.  The best data available for such comparisons
was prepared by FAO in 1977 2/. This data for 1972-74 average fruit and table
grape consumption in a number of countries with similarities to Romania is
summarized in the table below:
1972-74 Fruit Consumption
Including          Excluding
Melons             Melons
-----------kg p.c .---------
Greece                             156.8                106.4
Turkey                             141.0                100.4
Spain                              124.4                 98.3
Bulgaria                           120.4                101.1
Italy                              134.2                118.9
Portugal                            77.2                 75.7
Hungary                              75.8                67.2
Yugoslavia                          65.6                 50.9
Melons are to some extent substitutes for other fruits and are included in
most fruit consumption statistics. Their inclusion in appraisal comparisons
could, however, distort the analysis, particularly as Romania produced only
58,000 tons (or 2.7 kg p.c) of melon in 1978. The market analysis has there-
fore been based on comparisons of fruit consumption excluding melons. The
1/   Maximum production from project investments is expected in 1991, when
the slower maturing plums and cherries reach full production; however,
the moderate increases in project production from 1988 to 1991 would
be more than offset by anticipated declines in older orchards. Peak
production for all investments (old and new) through the end of 1982
is forecast for 1988, and this benchmark year has been selected for
the market analysis.

1972-74 series is the latest available which permits such a distinction and is
for this reason considered (despite its age) the best basis for appraisal.
This approach may lead to some understatement of potential Romanian consumption.
6.04      Country to country comparisons show little correlation between fruit
consumption and income levels. In fact, some of the higher income countries
have lower consumption, and vice versa. For example, in 1972-74 the Benelux
countries had a consumption level of 69.9 kg p.c., Denmark, 54.4 kg p.c.;
France, 72.9 kg p.c.; West Germany, 94.3 kg p.c.; the United Kingdom, 45.3 kg
p.c., and the United States 100.1 kg p.c. These levels are in marked contrast
with most of the southern European countries. Differences in consumption
levels are heavily influenced by local factors such as the seasonal avail-
ability; fruit prices; consumer preferences, habits and customs; and avail-
ability of possible substitutes for fruit and fruit products. Against this
background, the southern European fruit producing countries are the best group
of comparators in considering the level of fruit consumption which may reason-
ably be expected in Romania.
6.05      A straightforward comparison of consumption levels already achieved
in a number of the fruit producing countries of southern Europe leads to the
judgement that consumption in the range of 95 to 105 kg p.c. can reasonably be
expected for Romania by 1990, but that the Romanian consumption target of 129
kg p.c. (para 4.16) is high by international standards. In this context, the
95 kg p.c. level anticipated for 1988 in paragraph 6.02 appears reasonable.
6.06      As a supplement to this straightforward country-to-country compari-
son, demand projections have also been prepared using a composite of historic
consumption levels in Yugoslavia and Hungary as the base. The lack of income
and consumption correlations among countries does not imply the absence of
such correlation within any given country, and income elasticities of demand
for fruit have been developed for a number of countries in the Region. 1/
Application of these in Romania, however, requires assessing what historic
Romanian consumption levels would have been in the absence of the supply
constraint. For this purpose, Yugoslavia and Hungary have been taken as
comparators, although both countries may also suffer from some unmet demand.
Both countries are temperate zone producers and have a distribution of species
somewhat similar to that in Romania. Yugoslavia provides a market-determined
level of consumption for a country with similar income level and emphasis on
savings and investment; Hungary provides the case of a similar, centrally
planned country which has placed greater emphasis on fruit production and
consumption. The average consumption level in these two countries for 1972-74
was 59 kg p.c. (excluding melons), ranging between 51 kg p.c. for Yugoslavia
and 67 kg p.c. for Hungary. Using real growth rates of personal income in
Romania of 5% for 1974-79 and 4.4% from 1980 onwards, 2/  and an income
elasticity of demand for fruits of 0.7, the expected consumption level pro-
jected from this composite base would be 101 kg p.c. in 1990. Using the
1/   World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 321, March 1979.
2/   Estimates by Country Economic Staff.



- 22 -
Hungarian base of 67.2 kg p.c. alone, projected consumption of all fruits
would be 115 kg p.c. in 1990; using the Yugoslav base alone, 87 kg p.c.
Although this analysis is of necessity rather approximate, it reinforces the
judgement that Romanian consumption of the order of 95-105 kg p.c. is reason-
able for 1990. The same analytical approach including melon consumption
results in expected consumption of 121 kg p.c. in 1990. The overall level of
fruit production from the project, and that from concurrent investments
planned for other fruits and table grapes, can be marketed successfully.
6.07      As a matter of national policy deriving from foreign exchange
constraints, Romania limits fruit consumption almost entirely to species
which it can produce domestically. Fruit imports are planned to remain about
constant at 3 kg p.c. through 1990. The share of fruit consumption from local
production is expected to increase from 94% in 1976-78 to 97% by 1988. In
the absence of significant imports of citrus and tropical fruits, this policy
results in heavy emphasis on the project species and especially on apples.
Apples are the primary fruit relied upon to meet winter and early spring
fresh consumption needs, more typically met in other countries by a much
wider range of fruits including substantial amounts of citrus and tropical
fruits. Superior storing characteristics make the apple the best available
species to meet fresh consumption needs in these seasons. In 1976-78, the
project species accounted for 76% (35.8 kg.p.c.) of all fruit consumption,
including 39% (18.4 kg p.c.) for apples. These proportions would remain
essentially unchanged under the project, with project species accounting for
75% (71 kg p.c.) of consumption including 41% (39 kg p.c.) for apples in
1988. By international standards these proportions are high, but they are
acceptable given the special context and policy constraints in Romania. The
1988 consumption levels expected for the project species (especially for
apples) are higher than the corresponding 1972-74 consumption levels in other
countries with wider availability of citrus and tropical fruits. This pattern
of consumption is determined by Romanian policy restrictions on fruit imports
and the related substitution of apples for such fruit. In this context, the
species distribution under the project is judged to be acceptable.
The Marketing System
6.08      Increased consumption of fresh and processed fruits will require
complementary investment in packing, storage and processing facilities. The
table below summarizes the extent to which facilities will be required to
support increased consumption of fresh fruits in 1984 (the year in which proj-
ect packing and storage investments will first be fully utilized) and in 1988
(the year of peak production under the project):

After allowance for the direct consumption by producers, the requirements for
cold storage (both conventional and controlled atmosphere) have been taken at
one-third of annual fresh consumption of all fruits. In Romania's temperate
climate, non-refrigerated storage meets the storage needs for consumption in
November and December, and cold stores are geared to meeting the demand for
fresh fruit from January to May. Conventional cold stores would be used for
the winter consumption; the controlled atmosphere stores would be used largely
to meet early spring consumption needs. As noted above, apples would be the
major species stored for winter and early spring consumption. When the new
controlled atmosphere cold stores financed under the project are all in use
in 1984, there will be 307,000 tons of fruit storage capacity as follows:
Conventional Stores in 1979                   141,000 tons
New Conventional Stores                        46,000
Controlled Atmosphere Stores                  120,000
Total                                         307,000 tons
This capacity will be adequate to handle the expected market volume. As
part of the controlled atmosphere facilities, 360,000 tons of sorting and
packing capacity would be added to the national system. This will meet the
increased requirements for project species but complementary facilities
will be required for other fruits and table grapes. Current processing
capacity covering both vegetables and fruits is adequate through the early
1980's and the Romanians plan to construct 10 new processing plants in the
1981-85 plan period. Increases in storage and processing capacities through-
out the 1980's are essential to achieving the consumption objectives of the
project, and during negotiations, it was agreed that Romania will invest in
handling, storage, and processing facilities adequate to market production
from the project.
Fruit Exports
6.09      While the project is geared predominantly to the domestic market,
the Romanians can be expected to seek export markets where available in
order to earn foreign exchange. Exports of project species for 1976-78



- 24 -
averaged 88,000 tons annually or about 7% of total production. About 54,000
tons of this amount was exported fresh, with roughly 45% going to Western
Europe, 40% to Eastern Europe and 15% to other countries--including about
6% to those of the Middle East. Processed exports for this period were
34,000 tons, for which country of destination data are not available.
Preliminary estimates for 1979 show 137,000 tons (10% of estimated production)
of exports, of which 92,000 tons were fresh and 45,000 tons processed. This
represented 10% of estimated production of project species. Romanian fruit
exports to date have suffered from poor quality and reputation in export
markets, but the quality of fruit exports is expected to improve with Romanian
efforts to this end supported by sorting and packing investments and technical
assistance under the project. Growth in Romanian fruit exports in the 1980's
is expected to shift away from Western Europe toward Eastern Europe and (if
politically stable) the Middle East. As a result of agricultural policies of
the Common Market, most fruits are expected to be in plentiful supply there,
with market opportunities limited to special niches for off season and early
season fruits, and for selected varieties such as certain red apples which are
not grown extensively in the Common Market. Romania will have some oppor-
tunities in this market, and there is also some growth potential in the
Scandinavian markets. As a general assessment, however, Romania enjoys no
special seasonal advantages in serving this market, and its entry is likely to
be limited to selected varieties not widely available within the market. In
addition, Romania's competitive position in the Common Market would be weakened
by the likely accession of Greece, Spain and Portugal.
6.10      Romania is well placed along with Bulgaria and Hungary to serve the
Eastern European market, and of the three has the smallest market share and
has taken least advantage of this potential. Unfortunately, data on overall
consumption and production in these markets were not available to the appraisal
mission, and the Romanian authorities have no studies of these markets. Other
sources indicate that fresh fruit imports of project species by Eastern Europe
for 1972-74 (latest data available) were 542,000 tons. A rough analysis
indicates that this level is likely to increase by at least 50 to 70% by
1990. The growth potential of the Eastern European fresh fruit market is
thus of the order of 270,000 to 380,000 tons in this period. The Middle
Eastern market is more difficult to assess both because of political uncer-
tainties and because of the shortage of reliable data. Fresh fruit imports of
project species by Middle Eastern countries in 1972-74 were about 100,000
tons, and this level could easily double by 1990. Demand for processed fruits
in these markets is expected to behave similarly. While precise specification
of final markets in the late 1980s would be unrealistic, the Romanians can
reasonably expect some export increases. Appraisal has been based upon the
assumption that exports of project fruits could reach 268,000 tons (11% of
forecast production) by 1988, or an increase of 131,000 tons above the esti-
mated 1979 level. Such an increase can reasonably be expected to be achieved
over nine years, although the actual species distribution of exports may vary
somewhat from those shown in Annex 2, Table 3. There may well be greater
potential for Romanian participation in these markets; however, these prospects
need to be assessed much more thoroughly by the Romanian authorities before
committing further investments oriented toward export markets. While Romania
may be expected to seek to exploit export markets to earn foreign exchange,
the project has not been oriented toward export markets.

VII. TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH
A. Production Technology and Research
7.01      The intensive orchard investments under the project have been
patterned on technologies already in commercial use in some of the more
advanced fruit producing countries of Europe. The main advantages of these
higher density orchards over lower density classical orchards are (i) much
more rapid achievement of full production (5 years for apples instead of about
10) and (ii) improved labor productivity in pruning and harvesting smaller
trees. In some cases, modest increases in peak yields over those in a mature
classical orchard can also be expected, but there are physical limitations
on the maximum size of fruit bearing canopy and hence yields in either type
of orchard. Planting densities under the project are compared with those
of typical classical orchards in the table below:
Typical              Average
Classical            Project
Orchards             Orchards
----------trees/ha----------
Apples                          180-250             1,000-1,667
Pears                           180-250             1,250
Peaches                         200-250               740
Apricots                        180-200               700
Plums                           180-200               500
Sweet Cherries                  180-200               500
Sour Cherries                   200-300               834
Apples would be planted at the highest densities.  Dwarfing rootstocks
developed at the East Mailing Research Station in the U.K. and now in wide
commercial use would be used in all of the apple orchards.  The planting
density of any individual orchard will depend upon the specific rootstock/
scion combinations to be used and upon local growing conditions.  Dwarfing
rootstocks for other species are either much less effective in limiting
tree size and not widely in use (pears and peaches), or not available (plums,
apricots and cherries). This accounts for the generally lower average
densities at which these species would be planted. The project would support
commercial application in Romania of technologies which are established
elsewhere, and Romania would become one of the leading countries in use of
high density orchards.
7.02      Following the international trend in orchard technology, Romania has
been conducting production research on high density plantings for over a decade.
It has a well organized and comprehensive fruit production research program
directed by the Orchards Trust at its headquarers in Pitesti. Field trials



- 26 -
are conducted at Pitesti and at 21 field stations which are distributed
widely in well defined fruit production zones throughout the country. The
research program has tackled a wide range of technical issues confronting the
fruit industry, including variety trials, pruning methods, irrigation systems,
and alternative systems of planting orchards. All of these areas of research
are important in relation to modern orchard management systems, although
issues concerned with planting systems and the intensity of planting have
created the greatest interest because of the sweeping changes now being intro-
duced in Romania and in other fruit producing countries. While the technical
side of orchard research has been quite good, research on commercial and
economic applications has been neglected. Technical research findings have
dominated Romanian decision making on applications of high density orchards
with a tendency toward wholesale adoption of very high density plantings
without adequate documentation of commercial and economic experience with any
particular planting system. There is a major opportunity for Romania to
broaden its good technical research to include thorough investigations of
the commercial and economic aspects of its application. Included in the
technical assistance component of the project is US$200,000 for applied
research in mechanization of fruit production and harvesting.
7.03      Most project orchards would be provided with irrigation, without
which yields would be both lower and more erratic. Romania's fruit producing
zones have water deficits in most years during July, August and September.
The need for and the feasibility of irrigation for each new orchard would be
reviewed by the Romanians as part of normal subproject evaluation.
B. Storage Technology
7.04      The controlled atmosphere cold stores to be financed under the
project would be modern facilities designed to internationally accepted
standards, and would be located in rural areas near orchards in the fruit
producing zones (see Map). They would increase fruit storage life by reduc-
ing oxygen content within each store from about 20% to 3%, while controlling
nitrogen at 94% and carbon dioxide to 3%; temperature would be held in the
range of 0-4 0C. These facilities have been designed primarily to extend
apple storage life through the early spring, in order to extend the period of
fresh fruit consumption. Apples will generally be stored in these facilities
from September and October through April and May; other species, picked
earlier in the season, will also be precooled or stored temporarily until
the facilities are needed for apple storage. Each of the storage units will
also have complementary sorting and packing facilities, also financed under
the project.
C. Fruit Marketing Technology
7.05      The quality of final fresh and processed fruit products offered
to both domestic and export markets suffers from poor quality facilities and



- 27 -
inadequate expertise in the post-harvest handling, storage and processing
chain. The technical assistance component of the project includes US$1.8
million for equipment and staff training needed to improve applied research
and pilot fruit processing plants. GEDH and its Research Institute for
Marketing of Fruit and Vegetables would be provided with scientific equipment
for its central research laboratory, its regional quality control laboratories
and for pilot plants.  The objectives in providing this equipment would be to
improve studies concerned with controlled atmosphere storage, vitamin, mineral
and pesticide residues, packaging film sealing and permeability, and research
on proteins and amino acids. Specialised equipment would also support quality
control studies concerning fruit texture, color, flavor, nutritional proper-
ties and storage stability. Equipment would also be made available to assist
with development of pilot plants concerned with improved packing and packag-
ing, processes for improving yields and quality of dried, frozen, canned and
bottled fruits, development of new processed products, and production of fruit
juices. Specialised equipment provided under the project would also be used
to develop and evaluate pre-cooling, handling, and storage practices for the
fruit industry. Training of professional and technical staff would improve
their knowledge of new quality control and laboratory techniques.
VIII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
8.01      BAFI would be the Borrower under guarantee of the Socialist Republic
of Romania and about 140 individual subprojects would be implemented by State
enterprises and cooperatives after thorough appraisal by MAFI and BAFI. As
with previous Bank financed projects in agriculture in Romania, this project
would be administered by BAFI through its 39 district branches. BAFI would
be responsible for overall project supervision and monitoring. Earlier Bank
financed projects which are similar in approach to the proposed project are
being implemented smoothly under BAFI.
8.02      Several agencies of MAFI would be responsible for implementation of
individual subprojects. An estimated 70 cooperatives and 50 State farms would
carry out the orchard subprojects. The Orchards Trust would have overall
technical responsibility for these subprojects, and would provide technical
assistance and advice to staff of the subproject farms. The 19 controlled
atmosphere cold stores would be implemented by Judet-level Fruit and Vegetable
Enterprises of the Commercial Directorate of GEDH. The post-harvest portion
of the technical assistance component of the project (US$1.8 million of the
total) would be implemented by GEDH and its Research Institute for Marketing
of Fruit and Vegetables. The production and harvest mechanization portion of
the technical assistance component (US$200,000 of the total) would be carried
out by the Orchards Trust.  Although these arrangements may appear complex,
similar arrangements used for earlier Bank-financed projects in Romania have
proved satisfactory.



- 28 -
B. Lending Policies and Procedures
8.03      BAFI would examine all proposals for subprojects to be financed
under the project to determine their technical feasibility and financial
viability. Detailed subproject investment proposals would be submitted to the
branches or to BAFI's head office, depending upon the size of investment, in
accordance with normal BAFI procedures and delegation of subloan approval
authority. All subproject investment proposals would have to be cleared by
the responsible MAFI agency before review by BAFI. BAFI would prepare an
individual summary analysis for each investment subproject, including key
operating and investment indicators. Prior to disbursement under the proposed
loan, BAFI would submit to the Bank for its approval (i) individual summaries
of representative investment subprojects for the first three orchards of each
of the project fruit species and for the first three controlled atmosphere
storage facilities, (ii) a summary for any subproject for which the estimated
total cost is greater than Lei 70 million (US$3.9 million), and (iii) a
commercial justification for larger orchard plantations (60 ha and larger for
apples, peaches and pears, and 100 ha and larger for other species) to be
planted at densities greater than the average for the project. It was agreed
during negotiations that evaluation of these subprojects would be undertaken
as outlined above and according to a format acceptable to the Bank.
C.  On-lending Terms
&.04      Under existing regulations, BAFI would lend to cooperatives up to
70% of investment costs at terms of up to 20 years including up to 10 years
grace. BAFI would lend up to 100% of investment costs for orchard and storage
investments by state enterprises with terms up to 17 years including 7 years
grace. Repayment terms for the controlled atmosphere cold storage facilities
would be 12 years including two years grace. As under previous projects, BAFI
would have the flexibility to make automatic roll over adjustments required
for subproject implementation. Funds for the technical assistance component
would be the responsibility of MAFI and would be transferred to MAFI and later
repaid directly to BAFI from the State budget.
8.05       Interest rates would be the same as those charged by BAFI for similar
investments and those adopted for onlending under pievious Bank financed
projects. Loans extended to State enterprises would be at 4%, except for
interest during construction which would be at 2% p.a. Interest on investment
subloans to cooperatives would be at a uniform 3% p.a. The weighted average
interest rate on BAFI loans made under the project would be about 3.6% p.a.
BAFI's financial and administrative costs of providing these loans would be
about 3.5% p.a., and BAFI would cover its costs under the project.
8.06      As a result of centralized controls over domestic prices, Romania
maintains the domestic inflation rate on retail prices of about 1% per year
and it is expected to continue through the end of the 1981-85 Five-Year Plan.
This 1% annual rate of increase takes into account the past increases in



- 29 -
building and equipment costs since 1963. No significant further increase is
anticipated during project implementation. The total project cost estimate
includes a price contingency on local costs calculated at 1% p.a. In view of
the above, BAFI lending operations under the project would be undertaken at
real interest rates that are positive. Interest rates play no role in alloca-
tion of resources and little role in influencing individual investment deci-
sions in Romania's socialist sector. Lastly, the level of interest rates
does not influence the level of capital intensity employed in investments,
since project design and technology choices are standardized by MAFI on the
basis of Romanian technical and economic evaluation, and applied in all
investment projects nationwide. It was agreed during negotiations that BAFI
would implement the project under the lending policies, procedures and terms
described above.
D. Procurement
8.07      Equipment and materials equivalent in cost to the proposed Bank loan
of US$50.0 million would be procured under the proposed loan. It was agreed
during negotiations that items listed in Annex 2, Table 4 and costing US$50.0
million including contingencies would be procured in accordance with the
"Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits - March
1977." US$48 million of the items noted in the list would be procured through
international competitive bidding (ICB), and US$2.0 million of equipment and
training for the technical assistance component would be procured through
limited international tendering after soliciting bids from suppliers in at
least three member countries including Switzerland. Romanian manufacturers
would be allowed a perference of 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever
is lower. The application of preference is not expected to significantly
affect the result of bidding on the proposed project. It is expected that
foreign suppliers would win contracts for about US$16.4 million (US$14.9
million under ICB and US$1.5 million through limited international tendering)
of chemicals, cold storage equipment, pilot plant equipment and laboratory
equipment not manufactured in Romania. Other items to be procured through
international competitive bidding (about US$33.1 million) are available
domestically and, based on experience with previous Bank-financed agricultural
projects, it is expected that the Romanian manufacturers would be successful
in bidding for these items. An estimated US$0.5 million of items procured
through limited international tendering is expected to be of Romanian origin.
The Bank would not finance construction works under the project; these would
be carried out by the Romanian Construction Trusts, which are experienced and
familiar with local conditions, methods and regulations. This practice has
been acceptable to the Bank for the previous Bank-financed projects because
due to the regulated wages and prices of materials, the Romanian construction
costs are likely to be less than those which might be bid by international
contractors.



- 30 -
E. Disbursements
8.08      Bank disbursements would extend over an estimated 5-year period.
The loan is expected to be committed in 2 1/2 years by the end of 1982. The
forecast of quarterly disbursements is shown in Annex 2, Table 5. Disburse-
ment of the proposed Bank loan would be made against 20% of BAFI disbursements
for approved subprojects and 100% of the costs of the technical assistance
component. The disbursement percentage for orchard investments has been
established to disburse the Bank loan in 5 years, even though 12% of subloan
amounts on the slower maturing species would actually be disbursed only in
years 6-8. Disbursement for an estimated 140 subprojects will be made against
certificates of expenditure, the documentation for which will not be submitted
for review but will be retained by the Borrower and made available for inspec-
tion during the course of Bank supervision missions. This procedure has been
used for credit components of six earlier loans to Romania. BAFI is expe-
rienced with this type of disbursement application and its accounting and
administrative procedures are satisfactory. BAFI keeps separate accounts
for all project expenditures including those related to goods and services
financed out of the proceeds of Bank loans. These accounts have been audited
according to procedures acceptable to the Bank. Supervision missions make
spot checks of the documentation retained.by BAFI and this would continue for
the orchard project.
F. Accounts and Audit
8.09      The existing accounting and auditing procedures in Romania are
quite strict and satisfactory. BAFI's accounts are subject to audit by
internal inspectors and an annual audit by inspectors from the Ministry of
Finance and the Court of Superior Control. The Court, which reports directly
to the President of the country, conducts an independent audit of BAFI's
accounts and of results of audits by inspectors from the Ministry of Finance.
BAFI's submissions of audited accounts have been received promptly and have
been satisfactory. During negotiations, it was agreed that BAFI will submit
to the Bank an annual audit report satisfactory to the Bank within 6 months of
the close of the fiscal year.
8.10      BAFI would keep separate accounts for all project expenditures,
including those related to goods and services financed out of the proceeds of
the proposed Bank loan. These accounts would be audited according to exist-
ing procedures. During negotiations, it was agreed (i) that BAFI would cause
its subborrowers under the project to maintain separate project expenditure
accounts satisfactory to the Bank, (ii) that BAFI would maintain summary
accounts of all project expenditures and would make these available to Bank
supervision missions, and (iii) that a report on the project accounts, includ-
ing reimbursements requested against certificate of expenditure, audited by
the Ministry of Finance, would be submitted to the Bank annually within 6
months of the close of the fiscal year.



- 31 -
G. Monitoring
8.11      BAFI maintains detailed records for each subborrower of financial
and production results relative to subproject appraisal expectations which it
uses in its subproject supervision. In order to measure overall progress of
project implementation in relation to objectives, goals, and schedules estab-
lished for each component, BAFI would submit quarterly reports to the Bank
within 45 days of the close of each quarter. These reports would include
data on progress of construction of all physical facilities, progress in the
procurement of equipment and materials, and data on project expenditures and
fruit production. Information would be collected on each component and
consolidated into an annual report, for which coverage would include data on
the number of enterprises and farms financed; the type, size and ownership of
each; and incremental fruit production. Since its own procedures require BAFI
to assemble such material and data, the incremental cost of monitoring the
project would be negligible. BAFI would also furnish to the Bank a project
completion report not later than 12 months after the expected completion date
for the project. BAFI would prepare its report in accordance with guidelines
and format agreed during negotiations. Assurances regarding these matters
were obtained during negotiations.
H. Environmental Impact
8.12      The project will not increase the area under orchards, and a marginal
decrease in this area is even expected as a consequence of orchard intensifica-
tion. There will therefore be no displacement of other farmland. Adoption of
modern practices for the lands remaining under orchards will have a beneficial
environmental impact through measures such as terracing and improved water
utilization which will reduce erosion. Pesticide and fertilizer use would
increase under the project and could increase the levels of pesticides,
nutrients and salts in ground water and surface streams. The impact of
increased use of chemicals is expected to be minimized through modern orchard
management practices in their selection and application. Modern irrigation
management would similarly be expected to control the level of salts in
surface and groundwater. During negotiations it was agreed that the project
would be implemented with due regard to the environmental impact of the
selection and use of insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and fertilizers.
I. Role of Women
8.13      Romanian policy establishes the principle of equal employment oppor-
tunity for women in the work force. Application of this policy has resulted
in women comprising an estimated 30; of the orchard farm managers, 70% of farm
economists and 60% of the work force. The project has no specific component
designed according to differentials based on sex of intended beneficiaries,
but it is expected that women will benefit as much as men.

IX. PROJECT BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Production and Prices
9.01      The main quantifiable benefit of the project would be increased
fruit production above the levels which would have prevailed without the
project. Incremental production under the project would reach a maximum
of 528,000 tons in Year 13 (1992) (Annex 2, Table 6).  This would include
235,000 tons of apples, 25,000 tons of pears, 62,000 tons of plums, 26,000
tons of sweet cherries, 38,000 tons of sour cherries, 98,000 tons of peaches
and 44,000 tons of apricots. The most important fruit produced under the
project would therefore be apples, with 45% of the total, peaches with 18% and
plums with 12%.
9.02      Incremental production would build up relatively quickly especially
for apples and pears because of the adoption of intensive planting systems.
The build up in yield per hectare for each species is shown below:

For each species Year 1 covers the calendar year during which initial prepara-
tory work would be done with planting taking place in the autumn. Year 2
covers the first full growing season. Trees would be replanted before
yields dropped substantially towards the end of their productive life. It
has been assumed that the total productive life of the different species
would range from 19 years for peaches, 20 years for sour cherries and apricots
and 25 years for apples, pears, plums and sweet cherries. In the short term
the project would have some negative impact on production for old orchards
would be uprooted to make way for new ones. However, this initial decline
would not be important for these old orchards are estimated to yield only
about two tons per hectare at present. For the "without project" situation it
has been assumed that these old orchards would have continued in production
with declining yields for 10 years. They would then have reverted to natural
grazing.



- 33 -
9.03      All fruit produced under the project would be sold at Government
controlled prices. These prices are uniform throughout the country, although
there are several grade differentials and premiums are paid for fruit which
is exported. As the administered Romanian prices bear little relation to
fruit prices in international markets, and as fruit is a widely traded commod-
ity, economic prices were estimated for each type of fruit. These prices
were established in relation to prices received for fruit exported by major
fruit producers in Europe to member countries of the European Community during
the four years 1975-1978. In this analysis Italy was the most important
country used as a reference point, for Italy is a major exporting country for
all of the fruit to be grown under the project. However, price data from
other European countries, including Yugoslavia, Greece, Spain and Hungary was
also taken into account in the analysis.  Data from European markets was used
both because these are the nearest major fruit markets to Romania and because
good statistics were available for these markets. In calculating economic
prices for fruit some reduction below the average price received during the
1975-1978 period has been taken into account where it was felt that prices
were likely to decline in future. The following percentage declines in price
were used--apples 5%, plums 5% and apricots 8%. The prices for the other
species of fruit were not expected to decline.
9.04      The financial and economic prices used for the appraisal are shown
in the table below.

Apricots                    2,880            7,120           11,895
The proportion of incremental production which would be used for consumption
in Romania has been valued on the basis of economic prices estimated at import
parity, for imported fruit could be regarded as a substitute for locally
produced fruit.  Incremental production destined for export has been valued
at export parity. All of these prices have been estimated ex-farm, i.e. the
export parity prices are the prices for fruit in international markets less
all of the costs incurred for packing, transport and marketing between the
farm and the international market. The import parity prices ex-farm are
equivalent to the cost of fruit in international markets plus the cost of
transport to the principal Romanian markets less the costs which would be
incurred for farm to market transport and marketing costs if similar fruit
were produced in Romania.

9.05      For all species of fruit to be produced under the project the
economic prices were higher than the administered Romanian prices. In the
case of apples, pears, plums and peaches the economic prices at export parity
ranged from 25% above the Romanian price to 82% higher. All of the remaining
economic prices were more than double the Romanian prices. It is difficult
to understand the rationale behind the Romanian price structure for fruit
which apparently was based originally on a cost plus accounting formula. For
all of the fruit species production models indicate that the investment and
operating costs are similar. The main differences between the models are on
the revenue side, especially the age of the trees when they start production,
the yield at maturity and the price of fruit. In these circumstances prices
determined on the basis of a cost plus formula for slow maturing low yielding
species of fruit such as cherries and apricots should be much higher than
those for fast maturing high yielding species such as apples and pears. These
characteristics are evident in international markets for fruit but not in
Romania. For example, in Romania apricots produce about half the yield of
apples and take almost twice as long to come into production yet the price
of apricots is only 8 percent higher than that for apples. But in European
markets apricot prices approach twice the level of apple prices. For cherries
prices in Europe are between two and three times the price of apples while in
Romania the price of sweet cherries is only about 30% higher than the price of
apples. There are of course other factors affecting prices in European
markets such as the degree of perishability of different fruits.
B. Financial Analysis
9.06      The financial analysis of the project deals primarily with the
capacity of sub-borrowers to service debt on their loans from BAFI, and only
secondarily with the rates of return of the various types of subprojects
under Romania's administered pricing system. Romanian investment planning is
oriented heavily toward meeting physical production targets, while analysis
of individual projects and technologies relies primarily on a benefit cost
ratio at full production. There is no provision in the methodology or in
the pricing system to take account of the time value of money. Against this
background, the financial rates of return (using the prices noted in para.
9.04 above) for the various type of project investment are as follows:
Financial Rate
of Return
Fruit storage          17%
Pears                  16%
Apples                 14%
Peaches                 9%
Plums                   2%
Sour Cherries           1%
Sweet Cherries         -3%
Apricots              -15%



- 35 -
Given the nature of the pricing system in Romania, the low or negative returns
for plums, apricots, and sweet and sour cherries do not draw into question the
desirability of the investments; in fact, these show quite good returns in the
economic analysis below.
9.07      The low and negative financial returns do, however, indicate that
subborrowers would have difficulty or would be unable to service their 3%
(cooperative) and 4% (State farm) BAFI subloans from cash flow derived from
project investments. This is fundamentally a problem of the administered
prices for the four species. Combinations of species in the same orchard (for
example, apples and pears, peaches and apricots, or sweet and sour cherries)
would also result in marginal returns for all typical combinations except
apples and pears. In many cases, other operations of a farm could probably
carry the debt service on the orchard investment, and BAFI would not lend
without reasonable assurance of repayment. For the four species in question,
however, current average farm-gate prices would provide insufficient cash flow
to service BAFI debt on the related investment. In order to achieve a 5%
financial return, the price of plums would have to be increased by about 12%,
that of sour cherries by about 18%, that of sweet cherries by about 35% and
that of apricots by about 53%. Such price increases would permit subborrowers
to service BAFI debt from orchard revenues. During negotiations it was agreed
that the' prices for these species would, by the time of their initial produc-
tion under the project, be established at levels adequate to enable loan
beneficiaries to service their subloans out of the net cash flow generated
from the orchards.
C. Economic Analysis
9.08      The overall economic rate of return for the whole project, including
29,820 ha of orchards and 19 fruit packing and storage depots is estimated to
be 27%. Project costs and benefits are summarized in Annex 2, Table 7. The
rate of return from the fruit production component would be 27% while the much
smaller component for fruit packing and storage would have a return of 17%.
9.09       In the economic analysis costs and benefits have been discounted
over a period of 25 years except for investments in production of peaches,
apricots and sour cherries whose productive lives would be 19, 20 and 20 years
respectively. Appropriate adjustments have been made in order to estimate
economic prices for tradeable commodities. The most important of these adjust-
ments was concerned with the estimation of economic prices for fruit, as des-
cribed in para. 9.03. Eighty-five percent of incremental fruit production
has been allocated to the domestic market with distribution by species, as
follows: apples, 81%; pears, 85%; plums, 90%; cherries, 69%; peaches, 97%;
and apricots, 91%. Economic prices have also been estimated for fertilizers
using World Bank Commodity Price Forecasts (May 1979). Costs and benefits
associated with the small technical assistance component have not been included
in the economic analysis primarily because it was not possible to quantify the
likely benefits from this component. In addition to the benefits which have



- 36 -
been quantified in the economic analysis, the project would provide other
benefits including some reduction of the total area under orchards and release
of land for other uses, a large amount of employment and more varied and
better quality diets for very many consumers in Romania. At full development
it is estimated that the new orchards to be established under the project
would provide employment to about 19,500 people. About 20% of these would be
employed full time while the remainder would be hired on a daily basis to
undertake seasonal tasks, especially picking fruit. The project would there-
fore provide a large amount of employment to people living in nearby villages.
At present the old orchards which would be uprooted to make way for the new
orchards are very unproductive and provide little employment.
9.10      Economic rates of return were also estimated for investments in
each species of fruit, as indicated below:
Economic Rate
of Return
Pears                                 39%
Peaches                               32%
Apples                                30%
Sweet cherries                       26%
Sour cherries                        24%
Apricots                              22%
and  Plums                                 18%
These are the average rates of return assuming that the proportion of fruit
destined for the local market would be the same as shown in para. 9.09.
The rates of return would be somewhat higher if all fruit were used in the
domestic market and were valued at import parity. In this case the rates of
return would vary from a low of 19% for plums to a high of 40% for pears.
Conversely, rates of return would be lower in the least favourable situation
with all fruit valued at export parity. The economic rates of return based on
export parity prices would vary from 12% for plums to 26% for pears.
D. Project Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
9.11      Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to see how the rate of return
would be affected should circumstances be less favourable than expected. This
analysis showed that the project would still have an adequate rate of return
even if large adverse changes occurred in the major parameters involved.
Switching values were calculated which indicated that the overall rate of
return for the whole project would fall to 9% if:
Overall benefits were decreased by            44%
Total costs increased by                      86%
Investment costs increased by                313%
or Operating costs increased by                 118%



- 37 -
It is considered extremely unlikely that any adverse changes of this magnitude
would occur. The switching values indicate that the rate of return is not
sensitive to changes in project costs. Total costs would have to be increased
by 86% before the rate of return fell to 9%. An even greater increase would
be required before any individual component of costs caused similar reduction
in the rate of return. Thus, even though a lack of data precludes the use of
conversion factors or shadow prices for most items of project-cost, such as
labor, their inclusion would not have materially reduced the rate of return.
The project is subject to certain risks but these are small. The level of
average fruit yields expected is realistic, although in certain years yields
could suffer from factors such as spring frost, hail damage or excessive
atmospheric moisture. There is also a small risk that fruit yields and
quality would be somewhat below expectations if new intensive orchards were
not managed, especially pruned, as well as expected, or if these orchards were
not provided with adequate quantities of fertilizers, insecticides or fungi-
cides (para. 2.08). During negotiations, it was agreed that the Government
will provide sufficient quantities of fertilizers, insecticides and fungicides
to assure the application of sound agronomic and commercial practices in
project orchards. In certain years yields might also be depressed in some
places if conditions were exceptionally dry and irrigation water supplies were
limited. However, none of these factors is likely to depress yields seriously.
Sensitivity analysis indicated that if fruit yields (or prices) were 20% lower
than expected the rate of return from the fruit production component would
fall to 22%. The risk that project investment or operating costs would be
significantly different from appraisal estimates is considered small. How-
ever, if all costs for the fruit production component were 20% higher than
expected the rate of return from this component would still be 24%. The rate
of return from the project would be lower if prices for fruit fell in inter-
national markets. This would affect the rate of return both because prices
received for fruit exports would be lower and because lower economic prices
would be justified when valuing locally consumed fruit. However, likely
declines in international fruit prices have already been taken into account
when economic prices for fruit were estimated and, as mentioned above, even if
fruit prices did decline by 20% the fruit production component of the project
would still show a return of 22%.
X. RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01     During negotiations, it was agreed that:
(a)  The Government will carry out detailed domestic and
export market studies, and submit these to the Bank
for review before June 30, 1982 (para 4.19);
(b)  The Government will invest in fruit handling, storage
and processing facilities adequate to market the production
from the project (para 6.08);



- 38 -
(c) BAFI would evaluate subprojects under the procedures specified
in para 8.03 and according to a format acceptable to BAFI
and the Bank (para 8.03);
(d) BAFI would implement the project under lending policies,
procedures and terms agreed with the Bank (paras 8.04-8.06);
(e) Procurement of items specified in the list of goods would
be in accordance with Bank guidelines (para 8.07);
(f) BAFI will submit an annual audit report satisfactory to the
Bank within 6 months of the end of each of its fiscal years
(para 8.09);
(g) BAFI and subborrowers will maintain project expenditure
accounts satisfactory to the Bank, will make these accounts
available to Bank supervision missions, and will submit an
audited report on these accounts within 6 months of the end
of its fiscal year (para 8.10);
(h) BAFI will provide quarterly project progress reports and a
project completion report (para 8.11);
(i) The project will be implemented with due regard to its
environmental impact (para 8.12);
(j) The Government will review its prices for apricots, plums,
and sweet and sour cherries, and will establish revised
prices at levels which permit subprojects for these species
to service BAFI loans (para 9.07); and
(k) The Government will provide to subproject orchards sufficient
quantities of fertilizers, insecticides and fungicides to
ensure the application of sound agronomic and commercial
practices in these orchards (para 9.11).
10.02     With the agreements summarized above, the project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$50 million equivalent for a term of 15 years including 3
years grace.

/1   See para. 2.
75   See para. 3.
2.        New apple plantations would be established at two principal levels
of intensity on orchard farm units averaging 60-70 ha each.  The more intensive
system would be planted with 1667 trees per ha and this would account for
about 70% of all new plantings. This system would be established in the most
favorable areas where, for example, soils were of high potential and irrigation
water was available. About 30% of new apple plantings would be less intensive
with 1,000 trees per ha. In general these less intensive orchards would be
established in areas of lower potential than those allocated to the most
intensive orchards. In many cases, however, the two planting systems would be
used on different types of terrain and soils in the same orchard. Apple
orchards at an average density of 1,667 trees per hectare would be planted
with 4 meters between rows and 1.5 meters between trees in each row. They
would be grown on M-106 rootstocks with spur type scions (about 40% of the area
planted) and on M-9 and M-26 rootstock with standard type scions (about 30% of
area planted). Rows would be trellised using cement posts and galvanized steel

Page 2
wire. Steeper slopes would be terraced to facilitate mechanization. Invest-
ment would be phased over 3 years. Commercial yields would be obtained in
year 4, full production in year 6. The main advantage of the high density
planting (1,667 trees/ha) over a lower density is the much higher level of
production during years 4 to 6. There also are significant labor savings in
the high density plantings as trees are kept short and compact, and thus,
ladders are not needed in pruning and harvesting operations. Such high
density plantings are possible in apples by using Malling rootstocks which
dwarf the tree and by managing growth through skillful pruning.
3.        Apples orchards at an average density of 1,000 trees per hectare
would be planted with 4 meters between rows and 2.5 meters between trees on
row. They would be grown on M-106 rootstock with standard type scions, and
the relatively more vigorous growth for this rootstock/scion combination
accounts for the lower density of planting. In other respects these orchards
would be quite similar to those at an average density of 1667 trees/ha. The
less intensive orchard would take longer to reach full production and produce
a lower yield at maturity. The 1,000 trees/ha orchard would start to come into
production in the fifth year (fourth growing season) and reach full production
in Year 7. Production from the 1,667 trees/ha orchard would build up in
a similar way but would be one year ahead of the 1,000 trees/ha orchard at
each stage. Although the yield at maturity from the 1,000 trees/ha is only 20
tons/ha compared with 30 tons for the 1,667 trees/ha, this difference is due
primarily to the fact that the less intensive orchards will be established on
poorer soils, not to the difference in intensity.
4.        Pear orchards planted at an average density of 1,250 trees/ha
would be planted with 4 meters between rows and 2 meters between trees on row.
Dwarfing rootstocks available for pears (primarily Quince A and Quince C)
are less effective than those for apples and hence the relatively lower
planting densities. The average size of pear orchard subproject would be
60-70 ha. Rows would be trellised using cement post and galvanized steel
wire. Steeper slopes would be terraced to facilitate mechanization. Invest-
ment would be phased over 3 years. Commercial yields would be obtained in the
third growing season and full production in the fifth. The advantage of the
high density planting (1,250 trees/ha) over the more traditional plantings is
about 25% more yield in the third through fifth growing seasons. However,
once the surface is fully covered with tree growth, the sixth or seventh
growing season yields should be quite comparable and remain so for the produc-
tive life of the orchard.
5.        Peach orchards at a density of 740 trees/ha would be planted with
4.5 meters between rows and 3 meters between trees on row. There are no
effective drawfing rootstocks for peaches.  The relatively wider row width
(considered the minimum commercially acceptable distance) would reduce the
risk of shading out. The average peach orchard size would be 100-120 ha.
Investment would be phased over 4 years. Commercial yields would be obtained
in the fourth growing season, full production in the seventh. The advantage
of high density planting (740 trees/ha) over the more traditional 400 trees/ha
is about 3 times more yield in the fourth and fifth growing season and twice
the yield in the sixth season. Once the surface is fully covered by trees, in



- 41 -                        ANNEX I
Page 3
about the seventh growing season, yields should be quite comparable and remain
so for the productive life of the orchard. Another purpose of high density
planting in peach is to crowd the trees so they will remain smaller and more
compact, thus reducing labor costs by minimizing the use of ladders in pruning,
thinning and harvesting. Maintaining compact trees by skillful pruning in
high density plantings is absolutely essential to prevent over, crowding and
"shading out" of fruit producing wood.
6.        Plum orchards at a density of 500 trees/ha would be planted with
4 meters between trees and 5 meters between trees on row. The average size
of subproject orchard would be 100-120 ha. Investment would be phased over
6 years. Commercial yields would be obtained in year 7, full production in
year 10 (the sixth and ninth growing season). The advantage of a higher
density planting (500 trees/ha) over the more traditional planting of 200
trees/ha is about 2.5 times more production in the sixth through eighth
growing season. Once tree growth has essentially covered the surface, in
about the eighth or ninth growing season about 20% higher yield may be
expected from the higher density planting since the surface area will be more
fully covered with trees. This continues for the remaining productive life of
the orchard. There are no suitable dwarfing rootstocks for plums, and the
higher density plantings must be carefully managed, particularly in pruning,
to avoid "shading-out" of fruit bearing wood.
7.        Apricot orchards at an average density of 715 trees/ha would be
planted with 4 meters between rows and 3.5 meters between trees on row.
Average orchard subproject size is expected to be 100-120 ha.  Investment
would be phased over 5 years.  Commercial yields would be obtained in the fifth
growing season and full production in the eighth. The advantage of the high
density plantings (715 trees/ha) over the more traditional 200 trees/ha is
about 3.5 times more yield in the fifth and sixth growing seasons and 50% more
in the sixth. Once the surface is fully covered, yields should approximate
20% higher for the remaining productive life than in a 200 trees/ha planting
providing skillful pruning is used to prevent over crowding and subsequent
"shading out" of fruit bearing wood.
8.        Sweet cherry orchards at an average density of 500 trees/ha would be
planted with 4 meters between rows and 5 meters between trees on row.
Average orchard subproject size would be about 100-120 ha. Investment would
be phased over 6 years. Commercial yields would be obtained in the sixth
growing season and maximum production in the tenth. The advantage of higher
density planting (500 trees/ha) over the more traditional planting of 180
trees/ha is about 2.7 times higher production during the sixth through tenth
growing seasons. Once the surface is essentially fully covered with tree
growth in about the ninth growing season, yields should approximate 10 percent
more in the higher density plantings and remain so for the remaining produc-
tive life of the orchard. The higher density plantings require careful
management particularly in pruning, to avoid "shading out" of fruit bearing
wood.
9.        Sour cherry orchards at an average density fo 834 trees/ha would be
planted with 4 meters between rows and 3 meters between trees on row.



- 42 -                       ANNEX I
Page 4
Average orchard subproject size would be 100-120 ha. Investment would
be phased over 5 years. Commercial yields would be obtained in the fifth
growing season and full production in the eighth. The advantage of higher
density planting (834 trees/ha over the more traditional planting of 250
trees/ha) is 3 times higher production in the fifth through seventh growing
seasons. However, once the surface is essentially covered with tree growth,
yields should be about the same, or even up to 20% higher in well managed
orchards and remain so for the remaining productive life of the orchard. The
higher density plantings require careful management, particularly in pruning,
to avoid "shading out" of fruit bearing wood.
10.       Further details on orchard investments under the project and related
production models appear in Annex 1 of the Project Implementation File.
Fruit Packing and Controlled Atmosphere Cold Storage Component
11.       The project includes nineteen modern fruit packing and controlled
atmosphere cold storage facilities, each with an annual throughput capacity
of 15,000 tons of extra and first quality fresh apples, and a static storage
capacity of 5,000 tons. Construction of eight of these facilities would
begin in 1981, and 11 in 1982. Each would be completed in two years, with
initial operations of the first group in 1983 and the second in 1984, would
include the construction of a new industrial, cold storage facility complete
with receiving, sorting and packing equipment and a controlled atmosphere
system in the storage rooms. Apples will be hand picked at the degree of
ripeness established for each variety, field sorted, and packed into box-
pallets for transport to cold storage plants. The facilities would be
designed for efficient product flow and ease of cleaning. The area adjacent
to the fruit sorting and packing (processing) room would be hard surfaced
to allow for parking of trucks and trailers loaded with box-pallets of fruit
(apples) prior to off-loading. This area would also be of sufficient size
to accommodate storage of empty box-pallets (1.2 m x 1.0 m x 0.74 m). Fork
lifts would be utilized for off-loading and moving the box-pallets of fruit
(about 300 kg) within the processing room and the cold storage plant. The
processing room (648 m2) would be of masonry-steel construction with a con-
crete floor and would be built at one end of the cold storage plant. The
processing room would not be air conditioned. Sorting equipment would be
installed to size the fruit prior to packing. Inspection tables would be
included to allow for visual grading. Tables would also be provided for
packing fruit for export into wood and corrugated boxes. Packaging equipment
would be included for packing consumer size individual bags of fresh fruit.
12.       The cold storage plant would be single-story except for a small
two-story section which would house the employee locker rooms and the admin-
istrative offices. The plant would be a relatively new technical design which
would utilize prefabricated panels made of galvanized corrugated steel sheets
for the interior and exterior walls and would be filled with mineral cotton
type insulation. The panels would be secured to steel columns and girders
and sealed to retain the controlled gas atmosphere inside each chamber.
The interior walls in the cold chambers would first be covered with expanded
polyurethane for insulation and then plastered for moisture protection.  The



- 43 -                        ANNEX 1
Page 5
floors would first have a layer of insulation and then covered with reinforced
concrete sufficient to support about 1.7 tons per square meter. The ceiling
in the chambers would be about 7.5 meters above the floor, high enough to
stack 9 box-pallets of fruit. The box-pallets wold be stacked in such a way
to allow free air circulation (20-30 cm from the wall and about 5 cm between
rows) within the chamber.
13.       There would be 12 chambers (12 x 24 m = 288 m2) each with a single
door facing a corridor which runs from the processing room to the rear of the
plant. Eleven of these chambers would be equipped with controlled atmosphere
equipment to reduce the normal air environment of oxygen from about 20% to 3%.
The controlled atmosphere environment would be obtained through the use of the
hydrocarbon fuel burner system in which a gas burner serves as an oxygen remover
mechanism and producer of C02 and water vapor. Since water vapor aids in
retarding dehydration of the fresh produce, it is desirable to have as much
water vapor as possible to enter the atmosphere. The resultant excess C02
which is not desirable in the storage area is continuously scrubbed from the
atmosphere with activated charcoal absorbers. The burner, C02 scrubber and
the refrigeration equipment would occupy about half the area in the 12th,
12 x 24 m, chamber. The refrigeration system would utilize ammonia gas as the
refrigerant. The system would use the indirect cooling method to cool each
chamber thus minimizing the possibility of contaminating the stored fruit with
ammonia gas. Ethylene glycol would be chilled by the evaporator in the engine
room and then be circulated for cooling, in the storage chambers. Each chamber
would be equipged with separate automatic devices to control the temperature
(0°C to plus 4 C) and the gas atmosphere (oxygen 3%, carbon dioxide 3%, and
nitrogen 94%).
14.       Electric power would be supplied from high voltage lines from munici-
pal sources. Water would be supplied from the same sources or when necessary
from wells provided at the site. Steam and hot water would be supplied from
coal fired boilers located on site. Sewage water would be treated when neces-
sary and would be discharged into municipal systems or if necessary into a
septic tank located on-site. A tank would be provided on-site for storage of
butane gas which would be used in the controlled atmosphere hydrocarbon burner.
Conventional reciprocating ammonia refrigeration compressors would be installed
to provide cooling for the cold storage plant. The ventilation system would
be installed in the corridor with automatically controlled vents for cooling
each chamber. Automatic recording devices would be located in the corridor
outside each chamber. Complementary facilities would include offices, store-
rooms, gatehouse, employee locker room, sanitary facilities. weighbridge,
lunch room and coal and ash storage. Additional discussion of this component
and related investment model appears in Annex 2 of the Project Implementation
File.
Technical Assistance Component
15.       The project would include quality control, applied research and
training programs to support improvement in handling, storage and processing
of fruit. Items to be financed would include:

(a) Equipment for a central research laboratory, regional quality
control laboratories for the Research Institute for Marketing
of Fruit and Vegetables. These would be strengthened to
service packing, processing, storage and packaging facilities
located throughout the country. Provisions would be included
to purchase new and improved scientific equipment to support
controlled atmosphere, vitamin, mineral, pesticide residue,
packaging film sealing and gas permeability properties,
protein and amino acid studies. Specialized equipment necessary
to support quality control effort in texture, color, flavor,
nutritional properties, storage stability, non-destructive
testing, and bacteriological determinations.
(b) Pilot plant processing and packaging equipment to develop
(i) packing and packaging for fresh and preserved fruit and
vegetables, (ii) processes for improving yields and quality
of dried, frozen, canned and bottled fruit and vegetable
products, (iii) new product lines including infant foods,
(iv) new processing methods including use of alternative
energy sources, (v) processing for producing a large variety
of quality fruit juices and (vi) cost effective alternative
materials for packaging and storing fresh and processed fruit.
(c) Specialized equipment used to develop and evaluate precooling,
handling and storage methods on the shelf life of fresh fruit
from the farm through the packing station, cold storage facility
to the domestic retail market and/or to the importer of exported
products.
(d) Specialized equipment for applied research in mechanization
of fruit production and harvesting.
(e) Training of professional and technical staff in new quality
control and laboratory techniques.
