MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE EDA TO THE EXECUtIV  DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR A RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
I.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Republic of Benin for SDR 7.0 million, the equivalent of US$9.8
million, to help finance a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The credit would
be on stanard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. Part I of the document discusses
Benin's development issues and prospects, the key priorities of the economic reform
program at the macroeconomic and sector levels, and the Bank Group assistance strategy.
Part II of the document describes the proposed Credit.
PART I: COUNTRY POLICIES AND BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE
STRATEGY
A. BACKGROUND
2.   Benin is a West African country of five million people with a total GDP of about
US$2 billion (1992). Its economy is highly open and strongly dependent on primary and
tertiary activities. The primary sector, which accounts for 37 percent of total GDP,
provides the country's largest export commodity: cotton. A large teriary sector
dominated by commerce accounts for 50 percent of the country's GDP, and its dynamic
re-export activities account for 64 percent of the country's total export revenues. In
contrast, the country has a small secondary sector which barely accounts for about 13
percent of GDP.
3.   Unlike many other CFA zone countries, Benin implemented an ambitious reform
program, and achieved an average real growth rate of 4 percent for 1991-93, with real
per capita income increasing by 0.8 percent annually during the same period. On
January 12, 1994, the parity of the CFA franc, which had rer .ined fixed at CFAF
50/FF 1 since Benin's independence, was changed to CFAF 100/FF1. To take advantage
of the positive effects brought about by this action, the G'wranment, with IDA and IMF
assistance, quicldy adopted and implemented a program of economic measures to
reinforce the reforms achieved in the past years. A thorough review of Benin's
development performance was presented in the Policy Framework Paper (PFP)
distributed to the Board on March 14, 1994 (Report no. SecM94-251).
4.   To reflect the changing environment created by the parity change, the Country
Assistance Strategy presented below aims to promote a private sector supply response and
to strengthen the market orientation of the economy by supporting policy measures which
are critical for the country's long-tern prospects: ?ublic france management, human
resource development, and the public sector's administrative capacity to implement the
reforms.

B. RECENT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PERFORMANCE
5. Upon assuming office on April 4, 1991, following the first multiparty elections,
the Government of Benin adopted a strong economic reform program. This program has
been supported by IDA through a Second Structural Adjustment Credit (approved in June
1991), and by the IMF through a three-year ESAF (approved in January 1993).
6.   Benin's economic performance has been very positive since 1989. The new
development strategy centering on the rationalization of the role of the state has produced
positive results. In addition to the resumption of growth, substantial progress has been
achieved in improving the population's living standards, and adjusting the economy
through structnual reforms. The policy dialogue with the IMF and the Bank has been
strengthened as demonstrated by the continued support of both institutions since 1989.
7.   The objectives of the Government's adjustment program were to: (i) create the
conditions for a sustainable recovery of economic activity, leading to a projected real
growth rate of 4 percent per year by 1993; (ii) improve the Government's financial
position by generating a balanced primary budget in 1991 and a surplus thereafter; (iii)
contain the rate of increase of domestic costs and prices to about 2.5 percent a year so
as to improve external competitiveness, given the fixed exchange rate; and (iv) improve
the balance of payments position by pursuing policies to provide incentives for an
expansion of exports and efficient import substitution. Reforms were implemented in the
following areas: restructuring of the tax system; liberalization of the price, trade and
fimancial sectors; reform of the public administration and rationalization of the public
enterprises sector; and improvements in agriculture, education and economic
management.
8.   The results of the program have been encouraging. Real GDP has grown at an
annual rate of 4 percent during the 1991-93 period. A primary budget surplus of 2.2
percent of GDP was attained in 1993. The overall budget deficit (on a commitment
basis, excluding grants) fell to 4.7 percent of GDP for the same year, a substantil
improvement from the 10 percent level of 1990. The inflation rate (measured by the
implicit GDP deflator) was limited to an average of 3 percent for 1991-93. And, thanks
to increasing export revenues, the balance of payments current account deficit was
contained at 9.8 percent of GDP in 1993, as compared to 8.2 percent in 1992, despite
a substantial decline in world cotton and oil prices.
9.   The tax reform has simplified the tax system, broadened the tax base, and
improved tax adminitation. The corporate profit tax rate was reduced from 48 to 38
percent to provide incentives for private sector investment, and a single rate value-added
tax (VAT) of 18 percent covering most goods was introduced in May 1991. The VAT
was later extended to the telecommunicatons sector (1992) and petroleum products
(1994), to simplify tax collection, and now represents 11 percent of total Government
revenues.

10. Deregulabon and trade reforms. Price controls were lifted for most commodities
in 1991, and removal of most quantitative restrictions and simplification of import tariffs
implemented. All import licensing requirements were eliminated in March 1993 and, to
improve the customs administration, the Government contracted a pre-shipment
inspection company in 1991 to help increase and secure customs revenues. The
performance of the pre-shipment system was recendy reviewed by the Govermnent and
the Bank, and the Government has adopted the recommendations of the review on
revenue collection and the customs administration. Most export taxes were abolished in
1993, and most duty exemptions were elinminated l. In January 1994, the tariff structure
was simplified (there are four rates ranging from 5 percent to 20 percent, with a
temporary zero rate for re-exports).
11. Following the collapse of the banldng sector, the Govermment implemented a
financial sector reform program aiming at: (i) the restoration of the sector's viability
through portfolio restucuing (iquidation of the state banks and recovery of their
assets); (ii) the improvement of financial intermediation; (iii) the opening of banking
activity to the private sector; and (iv) the rehabilitation of the rural credit network. All
state-owned banks were closed and the system was opened to private investors. A
program to recover assets from liquidated banks and to reimburse depositors was
iniated.  Confidence in the barking system has been restored as shown by the
substantial increases in new commercial banks and in private deposits. Five private
banks have been established and are now operating. Financial intermediation remains
nevertheless limited as 99 percent of deposits and 79 percent of credits to the economy
were short term (less than two years) in 1992, and the ratio of credit to deposits was still
a low 21.8 percent at end-1993.
12. External debt. Once of major concern, Benin's extenal debt situation has
significantly improved. Over the last three years, Benin has not contracted new
commercial debt. It has furthermore proceeded to buy-back part of its commercial non-
guaranteed debt, at a 15 percent discount, for a total amount of US$4.76 million. Benin
became eligible for aid under the Special Program of Assistance for Africa in 1989.
Benin has rescheduled its debt with the Paris Club in 1989, 1991 and '993, and official
bilateral creditors have moved increasingly towards providing grants  ther than loans.
As a consequence, total debt service obligations, which accounted for 34.8 percent of
exports in 1992, have falen to just 17 percent in 1993. TotaJ debt outanding and
disbursed (DOD) accounted for 68.9 percent of GDP in 1993, and the sbare of
multilaterals represented 49 percent of the total. IDA's share of DOD is 31 percent.
13.  The Govemment also implemented a major public administrtion reform with a
view to reducing the wage bill and increasing overall efficiency. The main elements of
the reform were: civil service reduction, strict limits on new hiring, and performance
audits of the Ministries of Finance, Education, Health and Rural Development. The civil
Exemptions for selected necessity goods, were introduced on a temporary basis,
as an accompanying measre to the devaluation in January 1994.



- 5 -
service voluntary departure program, initiated in 1989-90, has enabled the Government,
with donor assistance, to reduce the proportion of the wage bill in fiscal revenues from
79 percent in 1991 to 58 percent in 1993. Under the 1992-93 departure program, close
to 5,000 persons (including a large number of temporary employees) have left the civil
service. Given the success of the program, the Government intends to make additional
audits of remaining ministries as the next step in its long-term strategy of administative
reform.
14. Public enterprise sector. Between 1990 and 1992, eight public enterprises were
privatized, 14 were liquidated and II were offered for privatization. The Government
has undertaken a number of diagnostic studies to rehabilitate/restructure additional
enterprises and is currently resucuring the telecommunications and postal agency
(OPT), the social security fund (OBSS), and the Cotonou port administration (PAC). It
is also committed to improve the performance of the electricity and water utlity (SBEE).
As of end-1993, the Govenzment's portfolio was reduced to 15 commercial and industrial
enterprises and 12 administrative agencies. The Government is now attempting to
privatize the insurance parastatal SONAR and exploring action programs to deal with the
situation of three major loss-makdng enterprises: the sugar factory (SSS), the cement
plant (SCO), and the palm oil processing enterprise (SONICOG). The profitability of
SSS and SCO will be reassessed in the context of the devaluation, and a divestiture
sttegy has been agreed upon for SONICOG.
15. Given the importance of cotton, the Government's program emphasized the
rehabilitation of the sector as the major contributor to economic growth in the medium-
term. In addition to the introduction of an efficient producer price system, the
Government, with IDA support, improved the extension services and introduced
measures to increase the productivity and cost efficiency of the parastatal SONAPRA.
Cotton output increased from 20,000 tons in 1l'82/83 to 200,000 tons in 1992/93 and is
estimated to reach 270,000 tons in 1993/94. Despite these results, further development
of the cotton sector in the medium term is constained by the existing ginning capacity
estimated at 170,000 tons.
16. The Government also introduced measures to improve the public sector's
adminitrative capacity. The budgeting process has improved with the adoption of new
budget procedures and a unified presentation for the budget. However, project execution
and implementation remain problematic. The rate of execution of the 1993 PIP is
estimated at 68 percent. The difficulties which still hamper program implementation
include: (i) slow disbursement of counterpart fimding for externally-financed projects;
(ii) lack of coordination between agencies (Ministry of Planning, project managers and
executing agencies, and debt management agency) and inadequate monitonng
arrangements by the Ministry of Planning; (iii) inefficiencies within the debt management
agency (delays in processing and authorizing disbursements); and (iv) cumbersome and
inefficient procurement mechanisms. The IDA-fmanced Pre-Investment project (FY91)
is assisting the Government in improving investment project preparation and creatng a
pipdine of investment projects. Further improvements are expected with the assistance
of the IDA-financed Economic Management projec. (PAGE), approved by the Board in



-6-
November 1993, and with the expected adoption of a procurement code. These issues
are being addressed with an effort to improve financial management and investment
programming for each sector and within each ministry.
17. Poverty reduction. Benin's social indicators are among the lowest for Sub-
Saharan Africa. The illiteracy rate stands at 77 percent, and as of 1992 the enrollments
rates in primary szhools and in the secondary education system were ordy 47 percent and
11 percent, respectively. Despite overall food self-sufficiency, it is estimated that
malnutrition affects 18 percent of the population and about 30 percent of children.
According to the Poverty Assessment, fifteen percent of the population is absolutely poor
on the basis of the income needed to satisfy minimal nutritional requirements and other
expenses such as clothing, fuel and household wares. Another 15 percent is believed to
be vulnerable to poverty, including female headed households (at least 20 percent of the
total), old people and children without family ties, farmers and fishermen without access
to natural resources, refugees and retenched civil servants. Life expectancy is 49 years
for men and 51 years for women. Infant mortality is high, 131 per thousand births, and
much higher for children under the age of five: 147 per thousand.
18. Despite these poor social indicators, the policies implzmented under the adjustment
program have allowed an improvement of living standards. Real GDP per capita
increased from US$365 in 1988 to US$411 in 1993. Higher cotton producer prices and
the improved capacity of the sector raised income among the rural population. In the
urban areas, to counteract the negative effects of the civil service reform program, the
hiring freeze and the restructuring of public enterprises, several measures have been
implemented. First, severance pay was provided to the departing civil servants. Second,
a training program which provides assistance to workers affected by the restructuring of
public enterprises was initiated. Third, a labor-intensive public works program directed
towards rehabilitating and expanding the road network and sanitation system in Cotonou
and Porto Novo provided employment for some 1,500 persons. Fourth, an employment
and enterprise promotion unit has been set up with assistance by UNDP to promote the
creation of small and medium-scale enterprises. Fifth, a rehabilitation program under
SAL II addresses the needs for basic social infrastructure, such as rural roads, primary
schools and community health dispensaries. Finally, a Social Fund has been established
to finance priority health and education expenditures.
19. In order to mitigate the immediate negative effects of the devaluation on the poor,
the Government has decided to: (i) maintain the prices of generic essentiad drugs at pre-
devaluation levels through selected subsidies and temporary suspension of the import
tariff (5 percent); and (ii) continue to exempt agricultural inputs from import duties.
20. Because of the important steps taken by Benin to stabilize public fmances, contain
costs and inflation, and liberalize trade, the positive results achieved so far will be
reinforced by the devaluation of the currency effected in January 1994. The gains in
external competitiveness will help Benin deepen its structural adjustment of the economy,
and accelerate growth rates through export expansion and efficient import substitution.



- 7-
The Governnent has reinforced its overall adjust- - zit strategy, as negotiated with the
IMF and the Bank in the context of the recently approved PFP.
C. EXTERNAL ENVIRONM4,14T
21.  Despite the production and GDP gains mentioned above, Benin's development
remains vulnerable to the external enviromnent, which is characterized by a high
dependence on one major export commodity (cotton), sensitivity to economic policies and
developments in neighboring countries, other C.FA zone countries and Nigeria, and acute
reliance on foreign financing for the investment program.
22. CGtton represents 25 percent of the country's total export earnings, and 74 percent
of domestic export earnings. The producer price system and the sector reforms
introduced by the Government have resulted in productivity increases which have allowed
for substantial output increases despite declining world prices. Jnvestments in rural road
infrastrcture and ginning capacity could bring about additional cost reductions for the
sector. Nevertheless, the country's long-term balance of payments prospects will remain
uncertain, unless the current dependence on cotton exports is reduced.
23. Export diversification in agriculture and in the manufacturing sector is, therefore,
a Government priority. The devaluation of the CFA franc, imnprovements in the
performance of the public sector, and the recently-adopted trade reform should help
Benin develop alternative sources of export growth as well as efficient import
substitution, as they all contribute to reducing distortions in the incer.tive framework for
private activity. The Government has requested the Bank's assistance to identify new
agricultural products which could be internationally competitive and to help promote
private sector initiative in those activities.
24.  In 1993, re-export activities accounted for 66 percent of Benin's total exports,
while trade with Nigeria provided 50 percent of total customs revenues in 1992.
Thanks to its dynamic re-export sector, Benin has been able to take advantage of
smuggling oppornmities offered by the foreign exchange control and trade restictions
imposed in Nigeria, such as import prohibitions on rice, flour, wheat and certain textiles.
Before the devaluation of the CFA franc, trade with Nigeria was supported by the large
parallel financial market in Benin, which ensured Nigerian importers with unlimited
access to foreign exchange, and in particular to CFA francs. In return, the nairas in
circulation in Benin fueled the demand for Nigerian goods. While the devaluation of the
CFA franc, combined with appropriate trade reforms, would promote import substitution
and domestic exports, and increase incentives towards formal activities, the prospects of
the re-export sector remain uncertain, given the unpredictability of developments in the
exchange rate and trade policies of Nigeria.
25.  Reliance on external fnancing for the investment program. The share of the
domestic fnancing of the investment budget remains insufficient at 8 percent for the 1993
ptablic investment program (PIP). Despite improvements in the structure of public
expenditures, a large proportion of non-wage recurrent costs is still being externally



- 8-
finnced under the PIP. Under the adjustment program, the Government is committed
to increase its financing of non-wage expenditures in the social sectors and of the total
investment program. While adjustnent takes place, external financing of the investment
program will continue to be crtical. In the context of the SAL II measures, budgetary
allocations to non-wage current expenditures in the social sectors have improved; they
will, howeve., need to be significantly increased to achieve the development objectives
of the Government.
D. COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES
26. To maintain and accelerate the improvement of the overall welfare of the
population, Benin will need to keep its GDP growth rate above the population's growth
of 3 percent per year, and to increase access to basic social services. The economy is
currenty characterized by: insufficient export diversification, a narrow industrial h'ase
and low level of domestic savings and investment (respectively, 3.2 percent and 13.9
percent of GDP in 1993). Furthermore, without a significant improvement in the
incentive framework, better public infrastructure and services and a strengthening of the
administrative services, the potential for sustainable growth will remain limited. Given
these constraints, the Government's development strategy is centered on further
rationalizing the role of the public sector, to create an environment favorable to private
sector activity and to improve the provision of social services through increased quality
and coverage.
27. The Government's rural development strategy was discussed with the donor
community at a seminar held in Cotonou in 1990. The agreement reached at the seminar
was confimed in the Letter of mral development policy of May 1991. The stra's
objectives are to: (i) increase export earnings through improved competitiveness and crop
diversification; (ii) redefine the role of the state while improving the efficiency of its
intervention; (iii) promote poverty alleviation improved food security; and (iv) preserve
Benin's natural resources and enviromnent.
28. The cotton sub-sector policies constitute a good example of what is needed for a
strong supply response: a pricing system guaranteein; t floor price to producers, supply
of inputs on credit, reorganization of the production responsibilities towards the farmers,
and divesting the public sector from actual production. In line with the sector
rehabilitation efforts implemented so far, the Goverment has decided to promote further
private sector initiative by allowing the private sector 'J build, operate and manage
giming facilities. SONAPRA's 2 capital will be opened to farmers; input distribution
has been opened to private sector operation; and the transfer of marketing to the farmers'
unions will be continued. In contrast, palm oil production bas been declining as a result
of the aging of the plantations, a chronic water deficit limiting yields, declining
profitability in relation to other production, and very low prices on the international
market. Experience in other countries has shown that palm oil production and processing
2National Agricultural Promotion Company (Soci6t6 nationale pour la promotionl agricole)



-99.
have proved to be viable only in small-scale operations. The Govemment is, therefore,
in the process of transferring the plantations to the cooperatives, and reassessing the
profitability of the sector and of the SONICOG in light of the devaluation.
29. Diversification of agricultural exports is expected to come from the promotion of
such non-traditional exports as pineapples, yams aid vegetables. Increased food
production will also benefit from the exchange rate adjustment, allowing local producers
to rec ,ture the domestic market lost to unofficial imports from Nigenra.  The
Govermnent will promote production o7 tradable goods through: (i) improved
infrastructure (rural roads) and agriculture extension; (ii) improv-d services to the private
sector, especially information on prices and markets and mdrket studies; and (iii)
improved access to credit for small and micro-enterprises. In line with its public sector
restructuring strategy, the Government will no longer engage in direct productive
activities.
30. The Government's transport sector strategy was discussed with IDA and other
donors during a November 1993 round table meeting in Cotonou. The Government's
strategy aims at: (i) safeguarding the competitiveness of the Benin transit corridor by
improvmg the country's road network; (ii) maintaining rural and urban infrastructure
through the restructurig of the Road Fund and traffic safety and management; (iii)
establishing priorities for new investments; (iv) improving the planning, programming
and management of investments capacity; and (v) expanding private participation in
public works.
31. The Government will also implement its rural water supply sector strategy. A
Letter of Sector Policy has been presented to IDA in the context of the Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Project. This strategy would allow the Government to increase the
impact and use of safe water and sanitation facilities, whie ensuring long-term
sustinabiity by developing private capacity to provide these services, refonning overall
sector management and financing through decentralization of decision-makig at the
community level.
32. In 1990, the Government adopted an education sector strategy, which was
subsequendy presented to IDA in a Letter of Sector Policy in the context of the second
Strcural Adjustment Credit and the Education Development project (scheduled for
Board consideration on May 17, 1994). The sector program puts emphasis on primary
education and girls' enrollment. It aims at increasing the gross enrollment rate in public
prmary schools from 51 percent in 1993 to 59 percent by 1999. In parallel, the
scholarship policy was reviewed in order to reduce the share of scholarships m sector
expenditures. Moreover, the Ministry of Education has been reorganized in order to
improve overall fancial and administaive management. Under this strategy, salary
expenditures are expected to be reduced from 83 percent of the education budget in 1993
to 70 percent by 1999.
33. In the context of the IDA-finaziced Health Services Development project (FY89),
the Government adopted a health sector policy. Key elements of the strategy include:



- 10-
strengtiening the administrative and financial management of the sector, improving sector
coordination and beneficiary participation, improving the quality and coverage of basic
services, expanding family planning, and developing indicators to monitor program
implementation and impact. The on-going IDA project is assisting the Government in
implementing this strategy.
34. The Government will review its poverty reduction strategy in view of the results
of the Poverty Assessment. The main elements of the strategy are expected to include:
(i) measures to ensure adequate delivery of basic services through continued rehabilitation
of facilities; (ii) promotion of employment and income-generating activities for the
poorest segments of the population; (iii) development of social indicators and of a
monitoring system; (iv) continued emphasis on the provision of primary education and
health services; and (v) promotion of a population policy.
35. Macroeconomic Prospects. Economic growth, which was estimated at 3.3 percent
in 1993, is expected to be reduced to 2.2 percent in 1994, before increasing again to 5
and 5.8 percent in 1995 and 1996, respectively. The improvements would be due to
continued strong perfonnance in the cotton sector and an anticipated increase in the
investment rate following the restoration of external competitveness. Private investment
is projected to increase from an estimated 6.5 percent of GDP in 1993 to an average of
8.6 percent over 1994-1996. Such real GDP growth rates would allow a real per capita
income growth rate of 2.5 percent in 1996.
36. The agricultural sector will remain the main source of growth, with the more
efficient cotton sub-sector leading the expansion. Despite the positive results achieved
thus far, cotton production in the medium term is constrained by the environmental limit
to further extensions, and will also depend on the ability to extend the ginning capacity
beyond the current limit. Growth prospects for food crops, fruits and vegetables will
depend on the extent of the improved competitiveness resulting from the devaluation,
(particularly relative to Nigeria), the efficiency of input supply and extension services
outside of the cotton sector, and the improvement in marketing and distribution channels.
37. Growth in the industrial sector, which is likely to remain modest, would be led by
the small and medium-scale enterprise sector, and come from: (a) new activities spurred
by the devaluation, and (b) increased overall efficiency through continued
rehabilitation/restructuring c' public enterprises, in particular in the cement, textile and
palm oil processing industries. Regarding petroleum, a further decline in production is
expected unless additional investments are made to maintain current production of the
Seme field at 1 million barrels per year. Further development of the tertiarv sector will
mainly depend on the safeguarding of Benin's comparative advantage in transit and
transport activities, on economic developments in these sectors in Togo, and on
developments in Nigeria. Trade and transit activities would also benefit from continued
liberalization efforts in order to establish positive incentives towards formal (rather than
informal) activities.



-11-
38. The public finance situation is expected to improve as the Government continues
to: (i) reform the tax system; (ii) improve public expenditure management and budgetary
procedures; (iii) reform the civil service and contain the wage bill; and (iv) increase the
efficiency of public investment. The domestic paymnts arrears are expected to be
eliminated over the 1994-96 period. The overall budgetary deficit is projected first to
increase to 10.8 percent of GDP in 1994 but to fall to 8.9 percent in 1995 and 8.1
percent in 1996, as revenue collection is improved through the tax and trade reform.
39. After the January 1994 exchange rate realignment, the deficit of the current
account of the balance of payments is expected to increase from 9.8 percent of GDP in
1993 to 14.4 percent in 1994, but to 11.5 percent by 1996, helped by a continued strong
performance of cotton exports, the development of food crops and of non-traditional
exports as well as the expansion of re-exports activities. After a decline of 2.2 percent
in 1993, exports are projected to grow by 2.2 percent in 1994 and by an average of 6.8
percent a year in 1995-96, while imports would first decline by 8.7 percent in 1994 but
increase by an average 5.2 percent per annum in the following two years. External
financing, although important -- the cumulative gross financing gap is estimated at
US$288 million for the 1994-96 period -- is not a major constraint. The PFP scenario
identifies its financing as IDA contributions (US$64 million), use of IMF resources
(US$75.1 million), and bilateral donors financing (US$89.9 million). The remaining gap
is to be financed by debt relief (US$21.4 million), and additional donors contribution
(US$39 million).
E. IDA COUNTRY ASSISTANCE
40.  Since the adoption of the structural adjusment program, the policy dialogue with
the Government has significantly improved and has been extended to address sector
reforms. Through economic and sector work (ESW) and technical support, IDA has
assisted the Govermment in defining its development strategy. IDA will support the
above strategy by increased ESW, its lending program and a systematic review of
portfolio performance.
41. The main macroeconomic and sector objectives of IDA assistance are to: (i)
encourage and support the private sector supply response; and (ii) ensure adequate
provision of basic social services. The main development constraints will be addressed
on a cross-sector basis so as to: (i) integrate the need to reinforce the
administrative/institutional capacity in the sector; (Ci) support the new role of the state
as a facilitator and promoter of an appropriate environment for private activity; (iii) draw
attention to the impact on the environment and the protection of natral resources; and
(iv) promote women's participation in economic activities. The lending program will
contnue to promote a participatory approach and involvement of beneficiaries as was the
case with severl projects (Community Based Food Security project of FY94, Rural
Water and Sanitation project of FY94).
42. In order to increase public savings, the Govermment will continue to control the
wage bill tightly. Combined with current efforts in resource mobilization (through the



- 12-
tax, trade and tariff reforms), this will enable the Government to increase its contribution
to the investment program. Public investment is projected to grow from 7.4 percent of
GDP in 1993, to an average of 10.7 percent in 1994-96, while increasingly reflecting the
Government's priorities to improve and maitain the country's infrastructure in the
transport and telecommunications, health and education sectors.
43. The Government intends to consolidate the progress it has made in creating an
enabling environment for private sector activity through (a) improvements in the
economic and social infrastructure, and (b) rationalization of the incentive framework,
including tax and tariff reform, modification of the regulatory, legal and institutional
environment for private initiative, and improvements in financial intermediation. This
framework should also contribute to attract increased foreign investment as the
economy's competitiveness improves and the profitability of investment increases.
44. In the health sector, the Govenmment is committed to improve the delivery of
prinary social services, rehabilitate and maintain health centers, and improve the sector
management capacity through institutional stengthening. The Government will adopt a
population policy and extend family planning services. In the education sector, the
Government will further reallocate resources from personnel expenditure towards
equipment and rehabilitation, give priority to primary education, introduce more
selectivity in university education, and reform the sector so as to make it more
responsive to and in line with, the labor market constaints and needs.
45. Economic and Sector Work. The sector lending program will increasingly rely
on analytical sector work. Our understanding of the economic environment and potential
for growth will be enhanced by a Country Economic Memorandum which will be
discussed with the Government in late FY94. A Public Expenditure Review is planned
for FY95. Sector work will increasingly be used to deepen and promote sector reforms,
prepared in close collaboration with the Govermment and the donor community. Progress
in implementing the reforms and the strategy for rural development will be reviewed at
a Round Table meeting in September 1994. The Transport Strategy, which was
presented at a seminar in November 1993, will be fully developed by end FY94. The
Government's private sector promotion strategy will be reviewed and discussed at a
donor Round Table scheduled for September 1994. The Poverty Assessment will be
discussed with the Govermment by end FY94. A Gender Issues Paper is planned for
FY95.
46. Lending Strategy. In support of the stabilization efforts of the 1989-1991 period,
adjustment operations (two strucr adjusment credits) accounted for 52 percent of total
commitments, while investment lending was mainly oriented towards the rehabilitation
of infrastructure, the  suctuing of the cotton sector, and the health sector. With the
consolidation of the adjustment reforms, lending (FY92-94) increasingly supported the
mrual sector (33 percent of lending), infrastucture (30 percent) and the social sectors (25
percent). With adjustment operations accounting for 32 percent of total lending, the
FY95-97 portfolio will support the Government's efforts to increase the role of the



- 13-
private sector (19 percent), while addressing enviromnental protection (9.5 percent) and
population, health services and nutrition (9.5 percent).

47. IDA Lending Program, FY95-97. The FY95-97 lendig strategy has been
adjusted in view of the parity change so as to help Benin maximize the benefits of the
enhanced exernal competitiveness. Assuming satisfactory performance, total lending for
PY95-97 under the base case scenario is expected to be in the range of US$125-155
milion, of which adjustment lending would account for 32 percent. This 'base case"
program  is founded on the satisfactory conuation of the reform  program, to be
implemented in the context of the proposed structual adjustment operation SAL m. A
high case scenario would be triggered by an acceleraton in implementing the reforms,
and would be sustained by timely disbursement of the adjustment credits' second tranches
and significant improvements in procurement and disbursement of counterpart funding.
Failure to meet satisfactorily these criteria would prompt a reduction of the lending
program to a low case scenaro, concentrating on the projects direcdy targeting poverty
alleviation and delivery of primary social services.

Development;                                 practices, demonstrated by a shortening of delays
for awarding and signing of contracts.
3) Significant improvement in the disbursement of
counterpart funding for externally-financed
projects, in line with sector priorities.
Low Case.                                    1) Policy slippage, as demonstrated by failure to
reach agreement with the IMF, shown by the
FY95: Environment; Population and Health;    periodic IMF reviews of the program
2) Delays in inplementing structural reforms
under SAL m and PSD, demonstrated by delays
in disbursing the second tranches by more than
eight months.
3) Significant deterioration of procurement
practices. Delays in disbursing the counterpart
funding for externally-financed projects due to
reasons other than budgetary constraints.
48. In view of the reforms already implemented over the past two adjustment
programs, structural adjustment lending for FY95-97 will focus on fiscal and financial
policies and on improving the economic environment for the private sector. Remaining
sectoral reforms will be addressed thiough specific sector operations. The base case
scenano includes two adjustment credits: a SAL HI and a Private Sector Development
operation. The investment projects are in the following sectors: transport, population and
health, environment, and agriculture. Under the high case scenaro, additional
operations would include: a telecommunication sector project, an energy sector project,
a public enterprise sector management project, a women's initiative pilot project, and a



- 15-
labar force development project. The low case scenario lending program would
concentrate on the population ama health and environment sectors.
49. The objectives of the proposed Structural Adjustment Credit (SAL m, FY95)
are to assist the Government in implementing its reinforced reform program as presented
in the PFP. It will focus on key macroeconomic obstacles and constraints to growth and
private sector development, mainly by: (i) further improving public expenditure
management in order to increase the share of non-wage recurrent expenditures; (ii)
improving resource mobilization through the tax and trade reforms, so as to increase
government revenues as a share of GDP (currently at 12.6 percent), and to eliminate
disincentives to private sector activity; and (iii) reforming the fmancial sector so as to
increase available resources for investment.
50. Promotion of Private Sector. IDA will assist th- Government to establish an
overall favorable environment and adequate infrastructure wo promote private enterprise.
The proposed Private Sector Development (PSD) operation (FY95) will help reform the
regulatory and incentve framework, improve the functioning of the legal system, and
streamline the institutional setting for promoting private initiative. The Government will
further pursue its private sector development strategy through other sector operations:
a Transport Sector project (FY95), an Energy Sector project (FY96), a
Telecommunications project (FY96), and an Agriculture Sector project (FY97). A
Labor Force Development project (FY97) would help promote vocational training and
improve technical skills in line with the needs of the labor market and the growing
private sector.
51. Promotion of Basic Sodal Services. The Bank recently approved two important
projects: the Community Based Food Security project (April 12, 1994) and the Education
Development project (May 17, 1994). The Rural Water and Sanitation project presented
with this Strategy Note will significantly improve safe water supply and sanitation to the
rural population. The proposed Population and Health project (FY95) will address the
population constraint by promoting a national family planning system and improving the
health and nutrition status of women and children.
52.  Areas of Spec  Emphasis. The Government has prepared with Bank assistance
a National Environment Action Plan, which was adopted in 1993. IDA will assist the
Government to implement the recommendations of the action plan through a proposed
Environment Support Program (FY95). A Public Enterprise Sector Mtanagement project
(FY96) will pursue the rehabilitation of remaining public enterprises and the improved
management of the current state portfolio. The promotion of women's activity and
initiatives is being addressed within each sector project, such as those on Private Sector
Development, Rural Water and Sanitation and Food Security. In order to tackle the
specific constaints to women's role on development, a Women's Initiative Pilot project
(FY97) has been initiated. This project will be based on the results of the Gender Issues
Paper, in particular regarding legal issues. Institutional capacity and administrative
reform wiU also be approached on a cross sectoral basis; each project includes a sector
capacity building and management strengthening component.

53.  Portfolio Implementation and Management. Since 1969, Benin has received
IDA credits, totalling US$498 million (net of cancellations), of which US$140 million
were undisbursed as of April 12, 1994. The current portfolio consists of 16 projects, of
which one sttuctural adjustment credit, representing a total Bank commitment of
US$240 million. Total disbursements for FY93 were US$37 million and US$10 million
for FY94 as of April 28, 1994. The portfolio is concentrated in the following areas:
agriculure, road construction and maintenance, energy, economic management,
education and health, and to a lesser extent port expansion, urban and rural water supply,
development of small- and medium-scale enterprises, forestry, public enterprise sector
rehabilitation, telecommunications, and rural savings and credit. In the 1970s, the Bank
Group's dialogue with Benin was limited and conducted in the context of individual
lending operations. With the approval and implementation of SAL I and SAL II,
considerable progress has been made in extending the policy dialogue to macroeconomic
issues as well as to sector development issues e.g. education sector reform, agriculture
strategy, transport sector strategy.
54. The main issues affecting project implementation are: (i) delays in decision
making; (ii) inadequate administrative procedures resulting in insufficient delegation of
authority; (iii) insufficient information flows between agencies; (iv) inefficient internal
organization of ministries; and (v) inefficient procurement practices. Although overall
status rating is satisfactory (1.9), these bottlenecks contribute to reduce the
implementation capacity in Benin.
55.  The annual portfolio reviews (ARPP) revealed: (i) d.elds in effectiveness: on
average, project effectiveness is delayed by 11 months, reflecting for some part the
delays in obtaining ratification of the project and credit agreement by the Parliament
where the Government does not hold a majority; (ii) prcurement issues: after substantial
delays, the Govemment has adopted a Procurement Code, which has been agreed by the
Bank, and has recently presented it to the Parliament for discussion and ratification.
Besides technical difficulties such as the drafting of bidding documents, evalpation of
bids and negotiations of contracts, unjustified delays in contract awarding and signing
continue to delay project execution and implementation. The use of implementation
manuals and implementation schedules is expected to help improve the procurement
process. A p    ent seminar was held in Cotonou in March 1993, and a joint
regional p                    seminar took place in April 1994 in Abidjan (C6te
d'Ivoire); (iii) counterpi1 funding issues: the 1992 Country Implementation Review
(CIR) identified the lack of coordination between the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry
of Plan and the sectoral Ministries as the man cause of inadequate budgetary
disbursement of counteWrpart funds, and the recent review of the PIP confirmed this. The
Goverment has recently created a special unit at the Ministry of Finance to monitor and
ensure timely availability of counterpart funds; (iv) dsbursement lags: significant
disbursement lags are explained by initial delays in project effectiveness. Other delays
stem from inefficiencies within the debt management agency, CAA. Poor administation
of the special accounts by the CAA, has significantly hampered project implementation
and has slowed down disbursement. During the 1993 Annual Meetings, an agreement
was reached with the Government whereby future special accounts would be opened in



-17-
commercial banks and managed by project managers. Furthermore, an action plan
agreed with IDA to restrucure the CAA, will be finalized with the Govermnent in the
context of the Economic Management project. To initiate an action program dealing with
the disbursement problems, a regional seminar took place in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire) in
April 1994, in which Beninese project managers participated.

56. Role of the Resident Mission. Following the successful June 1992 CIR, the
Resident Mission will initiate the FY95 Country Portfolio Performance Review. Over
the last year, local staff have been trained in both procurement and disbursement at
Headquarters; they will become increasingly involved in the quality control of
disbursement and procurement documents, and will be able to provide direct assistance
to Government on these matters.
57.  Involvement of Beneficiaries.  Borrower ownership and involvement of
beneficiaries has progressed with the preparation of recent operations. In the Urban
Management and Rehabilitation project, residents of a neighborhood were involved in
project design; the Community Based Food Security project and the Rural Water Supply
and Sanitation project are demand driven and directly involving local communities.
58. FIAS, IFC and MIGA. In 1992, the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS)
undertook a review of the investment climate in Benin. The report presented a thorough
analysis of the investment code and of the commercial and employment legislation; it
identified a number of obstacles to private sector operation and presented
recommendations for reforms. On the basis of this study, the Government has reviewed
the pertinent legislation, and it intends to introduce the necessary reforms to improve the
overall environment for private sector activity, in the context of the upcoming SAL HI
and the Private Sector Development operation.
59.  IFC became involved in Benin in 1991. Total net commitment held by IFC
amounted to US$0.9 million as of March 31, 1994, of which US$0.55 million in loans
and US$0.35 million in equity participation. Equity participation is in the banking sector
(Bank of Africa-Benin) and to a lesser extent in fish processing (SOBEP). Loans were
approved for the same SOBEP and for a pineapple plantation (Fruitex). IFC is currently
considering a loan in the leasing sector (BeninBail) for an amount of US$0.14 million.
IFC's participation is expected to increase as a catalyst to promote foreign investment in
Benin.
60. Benin signed the MIGA convention on April 17, 1986, but has not yet ratified the
agreement.
61. Aid Coordination. Next to IDA, the European Union and the United Nations
system are Benin's most important multilateral donors. France remains the larges. source
of bilateral aid, but Switzerland and other OECD countries including Germany, Norway,
Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States also provide significant support.
Regional aid institutions such as the African Development Bank and Fund, the West
African Development Bank (BOAD) and the Arab aid agencies have a growing presence
as well. In its aid coordination role, IDA assisted the UNDP in organizing a Round
Table Meeting in April 1992 to mobilize financing for Benin's medium-term public
investment program. As a follow-up, Sector Round Tables have been scheduled for key
sectors, and are expected to be completed by end 1994.



- 19-
62. Relations with the IMF. As noted earlier, the IMF approved its first-year SAF
program for Benin under which SDIR 6.26 million was provided in June 1989, the
second-year SAF in July 1991, and a three-year ESAF in January 1993. The IMF mid-
term review of the first-year ESAF program (August 1993) was satisfactory. On the
basis of this review and the outcome of the PFP negotiations, the IMF has approved the
second year of the ESAF in March 1994. The PFP scenario assumes IMP allocations
to reach a possible US$75 million for 1994-96.
F. AGENDA FOR BOARD CONSIDERATION
63. Main Risks. As presented above, Benin's external environment will continue to
constitute the major risk of slowing the reform process and preventing the achievement
of the poverty reduction objectives. This risk is, however, mitigated by the policy
agenda adopted by the Government to increase the diversification of the economy and to
reduce its vulnerability.
64. The assistance scenario faces three additional risks. FM, because of the upcoming
elections and increased political pressure and resistance, in particular in the context of
the recent devaluation, some policy slippage may occur in the management of the wage
bill and in the firther reduction of personnel expenditure. The Government is, however,
committed to reinforcing the adjustment of the economy, as demonstrated by the adoption
and implementation of the reforms presented in the PFP. Second, notwithstanding the
adoption of the Procurement Code by the Parliament, delays in significantly improving
procurement practices, would continue to slow down the execution of the investment
program, and to act as a disincentive for private initiative. To mitigate this risk, the
Government has agreed to train staff and project managers, who now regularly attend
procurement seminars. IDA will closely monitor progress in procurement practices,
which constitutes a trigger point for a low case lending program.  Third, failure to
improve the quality and sector allocation of the Public Investment Program could reduce
the impact of the economic program on the welfare of the population and, in particular,
on the poor. In tur, the slowdown of the reform program could jeopardize the
disbursement of the external resources needed to sustain the investment program. The
Bank will continue to review the quality and sector allocations of the PIP under the next
structural adjustment credit. The timely disbursement of IDA lending will, in turn, help
mobilize needed external resources.
65.  Criteria for Assessig Progress. In view of the above-mentioned risks, progress
in the following prionty areas will be regularly reviewed: (i) fiscal discipline,
containment of the wage related expenditures, the levels of public investments and non-
wage rcurrent costs, in particular in the social sectors; (ii) adoption of the reforms for
the private sector; and (iii) portfolio management with a particuiar focus on procurement,
disbursements and provision of counterpart funds for projects. Delays in meeting SAL
Im and the PSD pre-Board conditions and delays in disbursing the respective second
tranches in excess of eight months would imply policy slippage and would result in the
reduction of the lending program (para. 47 above).



- 20-
66.  Summary Asseswnent.  Since the adoption of the first structural adjustment
program, the Bank has been instrumental in mobilizing external resources to help Benin
meet its development objectives. The second phase of the adjustnent program confirned
the Government's commitment to embark on an ambitious reform program to consolidate
the market orientation of the economy. As explained above, results so far have been
encouraging. After this transition period, Benin is now entering a new phase of its
development as its new democratic system settles. The necessary consensus building
with a diverse Parliament has, however, introduced delays in meeting pre-set
performance objectives.  As the electoral deadlines approach, pressures on the
Government to relax its reform stance may increase. As demonstrated by the adoption
and the initial implementation of the reforms contained in the PFP, the Govermnent is
nonetheless committed to fully exploiting the new environment and opportunities created
by the devaluation of the currency after some 40 years. Continued strong IDA support
will, therefore, remain critical in helping the Goverunent consolidate past achievements
and further implement the conditions for sustainable development.
PART H: THE PROPOSED PROJECT
67. Sector Background. The rural population of 3.1 million, scattered in 3,500
villages and 23,500 smaller settlements, represents 60 percent of Benin's population.
Forty-four percent of the rural population has potential access to modem water points
(about 3,200 boreholes equipped with handpumps and 1000 modem wells) under the
responsibility of the Directorate of Water (D)11 of the Ministry of Mines, Energy uid
Water (MEMH), but 25 percent of the handpumps are not in working condition. In
addition, those water points are seldom used during the rainy season and the daily
consumption during the dry season is less than four liters per person, compared to a daily
consumption of 35 liters in Cotonou. SBEE, the national water/power utility, provides
water services to the urban population and to residents of large villages. SBEE's small
piped systems, albeit correctly maintained, are also under-utilized by villagers. Adequate
rural sanitation facilties are almost non-existent. The health situation has not improved,
as it is apparent from the very large number of Guinea worm cases and from the
prevalence of waterborne and water-washed diseases. The sector is still totally dependent
on foreign fmancial and technical assistance.
68. The sector faces four issues: (a) Ownership: the development of rural water and
sanitation services has followed a supply-driven public works approach. The central
government and donors have taken all investment-related decisions without involving
local communities. Donors' preferences have dictated technology and type of services
(handpumps, open wells, standposts or small networks) imposed on the villagers.
(b) Local Capacity Buiding: rural water supply (RWS) projects have been prepared by
international consultants and contracted by large-scale foreign firms, using heavy
equipment or carried out on force account by DH, which has not supported the
emergence of local contractors and consultants. In turn, this has created a bias against
using simpler and low-cost technologies based on the improvement of traditional sources



-21 -
of supply and precludes small communities to have access to safe water. (c) Sanitaion
and Hygiene Educafion: sanitation has usually been neglected in RWS projects and the
few construction programs focusing on on-site sanitation failed to attract interest because
of the excessive costs of the latrines proposed to villagers. The hygiene education
message delivered during community development sessions has been too ambitious in
regard of the limited time spent by extension workers--usually civil servants--with the
communities. Follow-up sessions have not taken place after the commissioning of the
facilities and most of the message is lost. (d) Sustainability: funding has not been
available for monitoring and supervising the use and maintenance of rural water facilities.
Apart from the central funding of its staff costs, DH has not received any budget and had
to act as a subcontractor of RWS projects to finance its operational needs. These policies
have reflected a widespread view that the performance of the sector is only related to the
number of water points constructed regardless of their use or their operating condition.
69. Recognizing the limited impact and lack of sustainability of RWS facilities, DH and
SBEE proposed a new development strategy, approved by the Government in March
1992, which calls for a bottom-up approach to the construction and maintenance of water
facilities and for a drastic change in the role played by the public sector. The latter
should no longer directly provide rural water supply and sanitation services, but rather
act as a promoter and a facilitator of services. The strategy is based on the following
principles: (a) decentralization of the decision-making process to the village level, with
special emphasis on the participation of women; (b) financial participation of the
communities towards initial investment costs, in line with their willingness to pay for a
given type of service; (c) reduction of construction and maintenance costs; (d)
privatization of construction and operation and promotion of local execution and design
capacities; and (e) integration of sanitation and hygiene education in RWS projects.
70. Project Objectives. The main purpose is the demonstration of the new sector
strategy, whose objectives are: (a) to maximize the impact and use of safe water supply
and sanitation facilities in rural areas; and (b) to ensure that the future development of
the sector will actually respond to the demand of rural populations. The adoption of a
decentralized approach would help ensure that investments are demand-driven. This
requires to create an enabling environment for local contractors and consultants, for
commercializing village-level operated and maintained (VLOM) pumps and spare parts
through private networks and for promoting affordable solutions for on-site sanitaton.
71. Project Description. The project comprises four components: water supply for
rural communities in two regions (59 percent of project costs net of PPF refinancing),
provision of VLOM pumps to cover the needs of all RWS projects (II percent of project
costs), sanitation and hygiene education for rural communities (14 percent of project
costs) and capacity building (16 percent of project costs). Water supply facilities would
include some 310 point sources (200 new and 110 rehabilitated) and about ten small
piped systems in two regions (Zou and Atlantique departments). The number and type
of the water facilites to be provided is indicative as rural communities would initiate
their own individual projects with the assistance of local NGOs. Funding would also be
provided for the execution of some 200 point sources carried out by UNICEF with local



-22 -
contractors in the Zou department. In addition the project would supply some 1,500
VLOM handpumps to cover the needs of all RWS projects carried throughout Benin
during the implementation period, in order to lay the ground for efficient operation and
maintenance in the four regions not directly affected by the project. Sanitation facilities
would be constructed in schools and health centers, in parallel with the implementation
of a training and marketing program for promoting on-site sanitation systems for
households and communities. Hygiene educadon would be incorporated into the
promotion, mobilizaton and traiing program for communities interested in improving
their water supply and sanitation facilities. Capacity building through training and
communication campaigns would target all actors of the sector that would have to acquire
new skills in promoting, planning, constructing, managing and monitoring rural water
supply and sanitation facilities.
72. Project Financing. The Project cost of US$15.0 million equivalent would be
financed as shown in Schedule A. The IDA credit of US$9.8 million equivalent would
finance 65 percent of total project costs. The Government of Denmark would provide
US$4.0 million on a grant basis under joint co-financing arrangements with IDA. The
Govermnent of Benin would finance US$0.5 million and the communities would provide
US$0.8 million towards the investment costs of improved water supply and sanitation
facilities. Procurement arrangements and disbursements are shown in Schedule B.
73. Project Implementation. To develop ownership, the village would submit an
application to improve water supply to the regional unit of DH (SRH). After review, the
SRH would contract one local NGO--or a joint venture between a NGO and local
consultants if the technical solution is complex--to assist the community to mobilize and
to prepare a project document that would provide the preliminary design of the facilities
and a description of the operation and mainenance arrangements. The SRH would then
prepare the procurement documentation and packages for boreholes, large wells and
piped systems. Villages would contract local artsans or provide in-kind contribution for
the simpler works and would also contract directly the distrbutor of handpumps for
delivery and ins,allation. The NGO would train the community in managing and
maintaining its water facilities and provide follow-up support and would carry out the
hygiene education program throughout the process.
74. DH would be the executing agency of the project. A small team set up under the
General Manager of DH prepared the Implementation Mamnal and is launching the
communication and dissemination campaigns. The teams of the SRHs (comprising
engineers, community development specialists and accountants) would manage the project
at regional level, program the construction contracts and delegate supervision to local
consulting engineers. An international NGO would manage the training program with
the collaboration of Beninese institutions experimented in participatory methods and
provide periodic assistance to the supervision and evaluation of the activities of local
NGOs.
75. DH would delegate the implementation of the Sanitation component to the
Directorate of Hygiene and Sanitation (DHA) of the Ministry of Health which has set up



-23 -
two regional teams (comprising one planner and two trainer/promoters for construction
and hygiene education). The teams would: (a) develop training and promotional
materials and train masons and small contractors who would be licensed to construct and
promote on-site facilities; (b) initiate the program for the construction of facilities in
schools and health care centers in association with a specific hygiene education and
enviromnental sanitation program; and (c) develop an extensive marketing and promotion
campaign to increase demand for improved facilities.
76. Project Sustainability. The overall project concept is geared to ensure greater
sustainability. The demand-driven approach would create genuine ownership of the
facilities by the villagers. Operation and maintenance of the water systems would be
independent of government's subsidies or technical inputs. The sysiematic recourse to
the local private sector and local organizations in executing works and providing goods
and services would further enhance the sustainability of the project. In addition, the
integration of water supply, sanitation, hygiene education and capacity building would
maximize the health benefits and ensure a long-term impact.
77. Lessons Learned. This would be the first free-standing rural water project
supported by IDA in Benin. The design of the community-based approach essentially
builds on the experience gained in preparing and executing RWS projects in West Africa,
particularly C6te d'Ivoire and Ghana. The experience of RWS projects financed by other
donors in Benin has been thoroughly reviewed during the preparation of the strategy
document and has confinmed that: (a) the participation of communities to niaintenance
activities greatly increases the availabifity rate of handpumps, but does not bring by itself
a sensible improvement of the use of water facilities; and (b) the expectation that the
health benefits of improved water supply could be easily perceived by the villagers and
would in turn reinforce the sustainability of the services has not materialized. The
portfolio of IDA-supported projects in Benin has faced for some time generic country
issues related to procurement and disbursement practices as well as to the lack of
counterpart funding and of adequately trained accounting staff in the civil service. They
are addressed by incorporating in the design of the project specific solutions tested in
recent operations to: (a) facilitate access of small contractors to public contracts and
streamline disbursements from the Special Account (Urban Rehabilitation and
Management Project-Cr. 2338-BEN and Second Water Supply Project-Cr. 1721-BEN);
and (b) establish decentralized accounting systems (National Resource Management
Project-Cr. 2344-BEN).
78. Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA has been mainly active in urban areas, with
the Second Water Supply Project (Cr. 1721-BEN). More recently, the West Africa
Group of the UNDP/World Bank Water and Sanitation Program (RWSG-WA, Abidjan)
assisted the Government in formulating the sectoral strategy in accordance with principles
outlined in the Africa Region RWS Seminar of May 1990. IDA's participation would:
(a) reinforce the Government's commitment to policy reforms; (b) help to eliminate
bottlenecks created by conflicting donors' interests, particularly in technological choices;
(c) bring about a more comprehensive perspective of the respective roles of the public



-24-
and private sectors and of local conmunities within the framework of Benin's structural
adjustment process.
79. The project is in line with the country assistance strategy presented to the Board
at this time, which emphasizes private sector promotion as well as the provision of basic
infrastructure. The project is closely linked to the other two FY94 investment operations
in Benin, the Food Security Project (Cr. 2601-BEN) and tile Education Development
Project and shares with the former project a common approach by supporting local
development initiatives and promoting a partnership between the Government and NGOs.
80.  Agreed Actions.  Before Negotiaons: (a) an international NGO has been
contracted to manage training activities; (b) the teams of the SRHs and of the regional
sanitation units have been selected; and (c) a draft letter of sector policy and a draft
Implementation Manual have been trasmitted to IDA (these documents were discussed
and agreed upon during negotiations). Agreement on the discntuation of force account
by January 1, 1995 and the divestiture of DH's drilling rigs before January 1, 1996 vas
obtained during negotations. Before  ffectiveness: (a) the contract for supplying
handpumps would be awarded; (b) the Special Account would be opened by DH in a
commercial bank; (c) a Project Account would be opened with an initial deposit of CFAF
30 million; and (d) auditors would be appointed and an accounting and budgeting system
would be set up in DH.
81. Environmental Aspects. The project has been assigned to category B. An
environmental study was carried out in January 1994, the conclusions of which are
summarized as follows. Improvement of sanitation facilities and hygiene education
would bring improvements of the village environment and particular attention should be
paid to design and execution of the physical works to mitigate potential negative
envirommental effects. Groundwater resources to be mobilized will be minimal.
Wherever higher yields or spring water would be tapped, hydrogeological investigations
will be conducted to ensure sustainabiity and adequate management of resources. Water
quality will be tested and monitored. The interactive design and implementation process
should also result in better siting of point sources in regard of potential contamination
and better management of water point surrounds. Technological options focus on
renewable energies (handpumps and solar energy). The project does not include dams
or resetdement.
82. Poverty and Program Objective Categories. By targeting rural communities and
particularly small communities which could not have access to safe water and improved
sanitation, the project would benefit the poorest strata of population. Women would be
the primary target of the mobilization process as the sustainability of cost recovery
mechanisms would depend on their contributions. As such, they would be encouraged
by the NGO teams to grasp opportnities to participate at all levels which would help
them develop skdlls in decision-making and in management, which will be applicable in
other domains.

83. Project Benefits. The primary outcome of the project should be to create an
enabling environment for the provision of sustainable basic infrastructure planned,
designed and managed at grassroots level, which could be easily replicated throughout
the country. Project benefits would consist first of time saved by women and children
in fetching water which would translate into improved productivity and greater
opportunities for education and training. Health benefits would be generated by the
extended use of safe water sources in conjunction with sanitation and hygiene education.
Moreover, the promotion of small contractors would create new employment
opportmities in rural areas through the use of more labor-intensive execution methods.
84. Risks. Main risks pertain to: (a) the capacity of DH to adjust to its new
responsibilities and its commitment to not interfere with communities' decisions; and (b)
the effectiveness of NGOs and other private actors in dealing with decentralized
communities and cooperating with governmental entities. To mitigate these risks,
strengthening of DH and SRHs through selection and training of key personnel is already
takng place through PPF financing. NGOs and private contractors would also be
prequalified and trained well in advance of the start-up of field operations. The training
program will be extended throughout the implementation phase to allow for self-
evaluation and exchanges of experience and lessons between the various actors, and
complemented by the feedback from the external monitoring team.
85. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

Disbursements
The bulk of the portfolio has been put in place since Benin's move to a democratic
government and a market-oriented economy in 1991. Credit effectiveness and, for that matter,
project implementation of some operations have been delayed because of the insistence of the
newly elected Parliament, in which the Government only hold a small majority, to review in
detail the related legal documents. Moreover, project implementation issues, such as poor
administration of special ascounts and non-compliance with the Bank's procurement procedures
have slowed down disbursements. A country implementation review in June 1992 addressed
these and other issues and agreed upon specii:Y corrective actions, such as carrying out an audit
of the government debt management agency (CAA), restructuring of some projects and
organization of a disbursement seminar for project coordinators which took place in February,
1993. A Bank procurement seminar was also organized in April 1993 and a new Procurement
Code has been submitted to the Parliament. The reorganization of the CAA is expected to be
completed shortly. Moreover, in September 1993, the Government agreed to improve
management of special accounts, formerly administered by the CAA. Special accounts would be
opened and maintained in a commercial bank, in line with Bank's Disbursement Departnent's
recommendations. A country portfolio performance review is scheduled for FY95.
