PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
PROVINCIAL AND COUNTPY ROADS PROJECT
(LOAN 2228-KO)
EVALUAT ION - fiUR
Obiectives
The objective of the Provincial and County Roads Project was to support
Government's policy of promoting economic development in rural areas by reducing
transport costs through the improvement of the county or tertiary road network
(Overview para 2.1). The major components of the project aimed to:
(a) improve about 1,000 km of provincial and county roads;
(b) set up and provide equipment for road maiitenance organizations at
provincial and county level;
(c) introduce and train ull involved in the use of Double Bituminous
Surface Treatment (DBST); and
(d) strengthen the capability of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA)
to manage, plan atnd maintain the roads for which it is responsible and improve
traffic safety.
IM21ementation grerience
The Provincial anid County Roads Project was appraised in May 1982 and
the loan became effective in Mar-h 1983. The Bank Loan (2228-KO) for the
project, as signed, was US$125.0 million; a total of US$0.674 million was
cancelled; the final net loan amounted to US$124.3 million.
All the civil works contracts progressed well and were completed on
schedule (Overview para 4.1), although there were initial problems with quality
control as the contractors, all Korean, were not used to working strictly to a
specification, and the local consultants were not used to enforcing it.
Supervision of construction was progressively strengthened during the project as
weak points emerged and the final quality of the work was good.
There was considerable initial resistance to the use of DBST, largely
because its capabilities and advantages were not known (Overview para 3.2).
Once contractors and consultants became familiar with the technique, DBST became
accepted as an economical surfacing for roads with low traffic levels.
Because of the prevailing international contracting situation, low bidb
were received for the civil works contracts which enabled a further 580 km of
roads to be improved (Overview para 4.2). In order to give time for these works
to be completed the loan closing date was extended by one year.
There were considerable delays in the procurement of the road
mainterance equipment, the scope of which was severely cut back and eventually
delivered about 3 years late (Overview para 3.2c and 4.3).



-vi-
All technical assistance components went well (Overview para 4.5), but
the introduction of Unscheouled Transport Services (UTS) was not very successful
(Overview paras 4.4 and 4.6d).
Overall, the project was a success (Overview paras 5.1 and 5.3). From
the physical aspect, it more than achieved its objectives and its results had a
noticeable impact in the intended areas. A significant proportion of the
te,rtiary road network was improved to all-weather quality, transport costs
reduced, maintenance orgennizzation.s ctk'hizd '.. every pravvince and preparatory
work carried out to improve other aspects of the transport sector in subsequent
projects.
The overall economic rate of return, estimated at appraisal to be 31%,
based on 1006 km of roads, is now estimated to be 28.8% based on the 1586 km
improved (Overview para 5.2).
Sustainabilitv
With traffic increasing faster than forecast and the introduction of a
proper maintenance system for provincial and county roads, it is expected that
the project will maintain or even exceed the forecast level of net benefita
throuaghout .ts eaconojic life (Overview paras 7.1 and 7.2).  Its final success
depends on the continued growth of the Korean economy providing a spur to the
growth of traffic and on the timely and adequate provision of maintenance funds
to keep the roads irn good condition.
Findinas and Lessons
The main objectives of the Provincial and County Roads Project were
achieved in an efficient and timely fashion.
The Bank learned sone valuable lessons (Overview para 7.2) on project
preparation and the need to be flexible in the design and during implemcrtation.
The Borrower also learned useful lessons (Overview para 8.4) related to future
highway planning, the importance of good supervision of civil works and the
advantages to be gained from the introd&ction of unfamiliar techniques.

KOREA
PROVINCIAL AND COUNTRY ROADS PROJECT
(LOAN 2228-KO)

1. haclzK2!an
1.1  For the past two decades, the transport system in the Republic of Korea (ROK)
has been strained by the demands of raptd growth and has required massive public
sector investments in infrastructure. The Government allocated up to 23% of its
total capital expenditure to expand and modernize transport infrastructure from 1967
to 1977, tapering down to about 15% in the Fourth (1977-81) and Fifth Plans (1982-
86). The Sixth Plan (1987-91) allocation for transport sector investments is at
about the same level. Investments have tended to be concentrated on the Seoul-Busan
axis where most industrial development is taking place and in other corridors
serving the northeastern and southeastern parts of Korea.
1.2  Substantial changes in the modal distribution of traffic for the period from
1966 to 1985 can be illustrated by traffic statistics. The previously dominant role
of the railways (82% of ton-km in 1966) has been replaced by a more balancrd
distribution of traffic among rail, coastal shipping and road for freight and .mong
road and rail for passenger transport. iJuring this period, ror freight tratiic, the
road and coastal shipping shares of total ton-km increased from 8% to 40% and from
10% to 29%, respectively, while movements by rail, although showing growth in
absolute terms, fell to 31% of total ton-km. Tthese changes reflect both the
economic advantages of the various modes and the different growth rates of the
industries served, as rail and coastal shipping became concentrated on long distance
traffic and bulk cargo. For passenger traffic, rapidly expanding personal incomes
have generated large increases in personal travel, mainly by public transport such
as express trains and buses. About half of all passenger traffic is in urban areas.
High taxatl..1 of private cars and gasoline has limited car ownership to a level
significantly below that of other countries with comparable incone levels, but has
not deterred rapid growth in road transport. Between 1966 and 1985, the rail share
of total passenger-km fell from 43% to 25% while tht road share increased from 56%
to 73%.
1.3  ROK's basic objective in the past has been to increase and modernize the
capacity of the transport system in line with the projected traffic growth and to
avoid major bottlenecks. This objective has been largely achieved. The present
system is reasonably balanced and traffic is in general allocated economically among
the various modes. Another objective of the investments in tran3port has been to
pursue. broader concerns in ROK's spatial and economic planning. Considerable
efforts have been made to develop new industrial complexes in coastal areas, to take
advantage of Korea's natural potential in harbors and to exploit low-cost coastal
shipping whilc avoiding excessive congestion on road and rail. Projects are now
better designed, construction quality has improved with the rapid expansion of the
construction industry, and maintenance systems have been established for the road
network and have been strengthened for the railways.



-viii-
1.4  'n its efforts to ensure that appropriate development priorities were
reflected in the allocation of scarce transport resources, the Government has in the
past tightly regulated the sector, with a restrictive licensing system for operators
in road transport and shipping, and administered pricing for all transport
activities. Korea's vehicle fleet has been kept small due to tbe policy of high
taxation of cars and high prices for gasoline.
1.5  Tne large ir-vestments in transportation infrastructure have been complemented
by a considerable effort to improve the efficiency of the transport system, through
the estsUolishment and strengthening of institutions to plan, construct, maintain and
operate the facilities and services. In the public sector, institutions such as the
Korean National Railroad (KNR), the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) in the Ministry of
Construction (MOC), the Korea Highway Corporation (KHC), and the Korean Maritime and
Port Administration (KMPA) have been established or strengthened in many instances
with increasing financial and managerial responsibility as semi-autonomous public
corporations. In the private sector, a highly efficient contractor system has
evolved for civil works, which system reflects both the policy of competitive
bidding in the award of contracts, and the large volume of construction that has
been carried out in Korea during more than 20 years. In 1982 there were some 500
firms capable of handling a broad range of public works and the number has increased
since then. Furthermore, with Government encouragement, the major construction
firms have successfully expanded their construction activities overseas.
1.6   The Bank has played an active role in advising and assisting the Korean
authorities in pursu'ng their transport objectives. Despite considerable efforts,
spatial planning of he transportation system was, in 19062, still hindered by
generally inadequate interagency coordination, a comparatively limited expertise in
planning and economic appraisal techniques, and in the capacity to undertake
appropriate longer-term pre-investment studies. Recent projects have improved this
situation but there is still some way to go. The Bank has provided, through various
projects, active support and finance for technical assistance for a range of
feasibility and planning studies relating to national transport development, urban
transportation needs and inter-modal alternatives along major traffic axes in
addition to more conventional engineering design work for proposed projects.
1.7  Pricing policy and the regulatory framework k..ve been a feature of Bank-
Government dialogue for many years. In the 1970s, emphasis was given to supporting
Government's efforts to establish agencies such as KNR and KMPA on sound financial
bases, with investment planning linked to appropriate tariffs and charges in regard
to rail transport and ports. The Bank has also assisted Government in the review of
transport and traffic regulation, notably in regard to licensing of common carriers,
road vehicle taxation, axle loading and similar issues relating to road transport.
The Provincial and County Roads Project (Loan 2228-KO) deepened and broadened the
Bank's involvement in the road subsector by extending assistance, for the first
time, to MOHA, which deals with the maintenance of provincial roads and the
maintenance and improvement of county roads. This new involvement also provided the
Bank with an opportunit- to improve coordination of road planning between MOC and
MOHA, and strengthened the basis for a highway sector loan (Loan 2392-KO), which was
approved in 1984.

2.    Proiect Obiectivas and Descrlption
2.1   Prolect Objectives.  Until the early 1980s, most of the investment in highway
rehabilitation and maintenance had been directed towards the major routes, the ex-
pressways and national highways, with consequent neglect of the provincial and
county (gun) roads, which were in a poor condition. The major objective of the
project Was to support Government's policy of promoting economic development in
rural areas by reducing transport costs through the improvement of the county or
tertiary road network.  The setting ap of organizations at central and local levels
for the maintenance of provincial and county roads was also seen as an essential            I
step for the long-term protection of the investments being made. The project
assisted the Goverment in carrying out the first phase of MOHA's overall program by
promoting improved integration of the planning of the road system by carrying out a
review of reaid investment plans to ensure that county road development was
coordinated with the development of the national and provincial road networks. A
further objective of the project was to promote the adoption of a low-cost surfacing
technique, Double Bituminous Surface Treatment (DBST), which was not then used in
Korea, by training local contractors and engineers in its use. KOHA staff were also
to be trained under the project in road planning and coordination, transport
economics, equipment management, financial management and accounting. The project
aimed to help Goverrment to improve road safety and transport services in remote
areas.
2.2   Project Description.  The Project, as appraised, consisted of:
a.    improvement of about 1,000 km of provincial and county roads of vhich
about 820 km were to be paved and the remainder gravel surfaced;
b.    setting up and providing equipment for organizations at central provin-
cial and county administrative levels to implement a road maintenance
program;
c.    consultant services for: (i) supervision of county road improvemant
works; (i,) technical assistance for the provincial and county road
maintenance program; (iii) detailed engineering of an additional 1,000
km of county roads; (iv) the implementation of an on-site training
program for Korean contractors, consultants and MOHA and HOC staff in
the use of DBST; (v) a study for the integrated investment planning of
the road system; and (vi) a road safety study; and
d.    provision of overseas fellowships for the training of MOHA staff in road
planning and coordination, economic analysis, equipment management,
financial management and accounting.
3.    Prolect Destin and Organization
3.1   To address the perceived needs for the improvement of the tertiary roads, a
project was identified in June 1979. Preparatory studies were carried out, for
provincial roads under the Third Highway Project (Loan 1203-KO), and for county
roads under the Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1640-KO).  It was intended that these



F-'
studies should lead to sector lending projects, but eventually it was seen that
project lending was a more appropriate vehicle for the tertiary roads, while sector
lending was more appropriate for the improvement of national roads, and this led
eventually to the formulation of the Highway Sector Project (Loan 2392-KO). After
some delay, the Project Brief for the Provincial and Coutaty Roads Project was issued
in July 1981, the project was appraised in May 1982, loan negotiations took place in
November 1982 and the Board approved the project on December 23, 1982.
3.2   The design of the project d'irectly addressed the needs as defined by the
Government and its concepts fitted readily into the plan to develop the capabilities
of NOHA. There were three main I.ssues that had to be resolved during project
preparation and loan negotiation stages:
a.    There was considerable initial resistance to the use of DBST, largely
because its capabilities and advantages were not known. The suspicion
of this "new technology" persisted well into the implementation stage.
Whereas MOHA's consultants, supported by the Bank, recomended that 70%
of the roads should be surfaced with DBST, MOHA wanted less than 20% so
treated. A compromise of about 30% was eventually reached.
b.    Associated with the use of DBST, the Bank's view was that the
construction standards being applied to the roads were too high in view
of the already high cost of road construction in Korea and efforts were
made to persuade MOHA to reduce them in order to limit the total project
cost. Traditionally the only type of surfacing that was considered to
be acceptable in Korea was asphaltic concrete (AC), which contributed to
the high costs. The Bank was partially successful in reducing standards
on some roads to obtain an acceptable rate of return and thus include
these roads in the project.
c.    The maintenance component was also the subject of much discussion, as
views on the amount of equipment required for this important task varied
widely between the Bank, which wanted more, and MOHA, which wanted less.
Eventually a compromise was reached somewhere between the two views with
the proposal to set up pilot schemes in three provinces, followed by the
establishment of maintenance organizations in all provinces, with
adequate equipment to carry out the task.
3.3   The project was well designed by MOHA, who used foreign consultants in the
lead roles for the various components, with much support from local consultants,
thus helping to strengthen this part of the construction industry. Although this
was the first Bank project to be executed by ONHA, roles and responsibilities were
clearly defined from the outset and MOHA gained the necessary experience very
quickly.
3.4   The project, as first envisaged, was very large, having a foreign cost element
of $290 million. As the Bank could only provide $125 million, the project was put
together in as flexible a manner as possible so that components could be dropped if
co-financing for $165 million could not be arranged. Various sources were
approached without success and finally the component covering the improvement of



-xi-
national roads was taken out and included in the Highway Sector Project (Loan 2392-
KO), which followed this project.
4.    Prolect Implementation
4.1   Road Construction and Imnrovement.  The project got off to a good start.
Since prequalification of contractors had been carried out during project
preparation, bids for the construction contracts were invited in February 1983 under
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) arrangements and were received in April
1983. Contract awards were made in May/June 1983 and much of the right-of-way had
been acquired by July 1983. The necessary consultancy contract for construction
supervision was arranged by April 1983. From thereon the contracts progressed well
and were completed on schedule, although there were initial problems with quality
control as the contractors, all Korean, were not used to working strictly to a
specification, and the local consultants were not used to enforcing it. Supervision
of construction was progressively strengthened during the project as weak points
emerged. There was inadequate laboratory equipment to test the compaction of base
and sub-base layers, a vital factor in road construction, but even more so for DBST
roads, where the surfacing does not contribute to the strength of the pavement. The
DBST itself was often not well laid because of a lack of proper equipment and/or a
lack of experience on the part of contractors and consultants. There were some
failures of the DBST because it was laid too late in the year and had no time to
cure properly before the winter. By the time the original 1006 km of roads were
complete, all these deficiencies had been rectified and both supervision and
workmanship had improved greatly. This improvement was due not only to thorough
training in DBST by the French consultants, but also to the contractors importing
the correct equipmestt and to more laboratory equipment being obtained for the
supervising engineers.
4.2 Continuation Project. Because of a downturn in international construction
activity, in which Korean firms were heavily engaged, unexpectedly low bids were
received for the initial tranche of construction contracts. The bidding was held
under ICB and the Korean firms priced their bids in the expectation that some
foreign firms would participate because of the international situation, but, in the
event, no fcreign firm did participate. The resulting low prices, combined with a
reduction in the quantity of maintenance equipment procured under the project (para
5.3), resulted in an uAncommitted balance of about $30 million in the loan funds. In
January 1987, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) requested the Bank that this balance be
used to improve further lengths of road, on the basis that such a move would be
fully in accordance with the initial aims of the project and that most of the roads
to be included had been previously studied, but had been cut out of the project in
order to limit the overall cost. The Bank approved this request in February 1987
and the Loan Agreement was amended in April 1987. MOHA proceeded to invite bids for
the improvement of an additional 580 km of road. By 1987 it had become clear that
no foreign bidder would bid for a civil works contract in Korea, so the Bank
permitted the bids to be invited on the basis of Local Competitive Bidding (LCB).
In order to allow these additional contracts to be completed, the loan closing date
was extended in April 1987 for one year to December 31, 1988. Some of the
improvements consisted of upgrading a few of the roads surfaced with DBST during the
first part of the project by applying a layer of AC. The reasons for such instances



-xii-
varied, but more commonly it was because traffic on the road had increased much more
than expected or because the road was in one of the colder areas of the country and
the DBST surface was being severely damaged by snow-clearing equipment. One
important problem emerged during this work relating to the upgrading of roads from
the lowest paved standard, P1, to a higher standard, P2 or P3. The formation width
for P1 roads is 6.5 m for a pavement width of 5 m. When upgrading to P2 or P3,
which should have formation widths of 7.5 or 7.7 m for pavement widths of 6 or 6.2
m, it is not practicable to inexpensively widen the formation by 0.75 m on each
side, so the resulting 6 or 6.2 m pavement was left with virtually no shoulder.
This situation is dangerous for traffic and results in an unsatisfactorily supported
edge to the roadway construction, and should be corrected in any further upgrading
operation by amending the road standard specifications to give Pl roads a formation
width of 7.5 m.
4.3   Road Maintenance.  Foreign consultants to carry out the maintenance component
of the project were appointed in July 1983. Appraisal of this component had been
carried out when no provincial maintenance organizations existed. The quantities of
equipment that were to be procured under the project reflected this situation. In
March 1983, however, provincial organizations were established and equipped with a
minimum amount of equipment financed from another source. The scale of equipment
provided under the project was accordingly cut back by ever 80% from the appraisal
quantities. It took MOHA some time to decide on the amount of equipment to be
procured and this, combined with delays over the approval of bidding documents,
resulted in the award of equipment contracts being almost 3 years late. Funds
allocated for maintenance never reached the desirable levels advocated by the Bank
because of Government policy that gave a higher priority for the allocation of
available funds to road improvement and constrttion rather than to maintenance.
4.4   Unscheduled TransRort Services (UTS).  The introduction of UTS in rural areas
made a slow start and was eventually made a condition of effectiveness of the
Highway Sector Project (Loan 2392-KO). The condition was met, but the number of
services that started (nine) was a small fraction of the expected number (at least
one hundred) which would have formed a good sample for an assessment of this type of
service in Korea. The Bank had hoped to see the inauguration of a widespread
service similar to that operating with success in other countries, such as the
Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia etc. The full reason behind the lack of response
from entrepreneur operators is not clear, but several factors may have been
contributory:
a.    initially, no government agency was prepared to take full responsibility
for the setting up of the UTS; there were jurisdictional problems
between MOHA and the Ministry of Transport (HOT); MOHA did not want to
invade the territory of MOT, and MOT did not display much interest;
b.    there was inadequate publicity;
c.    potential operators were given little guidance and were unsure of the
financial merits of the scheme;
d.    legal measures to place operators on the same footing as scheduled bus
operators were not put in hand; and



-xiiL-
e.    the rigors of tBe Korean climate prevented the use of the relatively
cheap open-topped pickup or jeep type vehicle used in warmer countries.
After some delays, a tour of several other countries to see UTS in operation was
arranged in 1985. The participants returned with enthusiasm for the scheme and HOT
thereupon took a greater part in trying to establish UTS in Korea, but the concept
has not yet caught on in a substantial way.
4.5   Studies1
a.   A Traffic Safety Study was carried out by a consultant employed by HOHA.
It was completed without any problems in April 1984.
b.    An Integrated Road Investment Planning Study (IRIPS) was undertaken by
consultants employed by the Ministry of Construction (HOC). It was
completed in October 1984. The main issue that arose during the study
was a difference of opinion between the consultants and HOC on the most
suitable means of obtaining the coordination in planning which was the
aim of the study. The implementation proposals put forward in the final
report were made part of the Action Plan for the Highway Sector Project
(Loan 2392-KO).
4.6   The main variances between planned and actual implementation have been
summarized above. The following discusses the principal causes for the variances:
a.    The problems which arose with the construction contracts were all
largely foreseen and measures had been incorporated into the project to
mitigate them. A DBST training program for contractors, consultants and
MOHA staff had been arranged, foreign consultants were employed in order
to allow time for the Korean consultants to gain experience in the
effective sapervision of road works and laboratory equipment was
provided. Whereas the unexpectedly large increase in traffic on some
routes had not been foreseen, measures had been incorporated into the
project by way of IRIPS to mitigate such a situation in the future
through the encouragement of integrated highway planning which would
help to pinpoint those roads where traffic might be diverted off the
national highways. The damage caused by snow-plows to DBST surfaces was
a factor that was apparently not foreseen and provides a lesson for the
future.
b.    The downturn in international construction activity, which resulted in
low bid prices and the consequent surplus in the loan funds, was sudden
and unexpected and could not have been foreseen during appraisal,
whereas the risks of high prices had been allowed for.
c.    The delays that occurred to the implementatiou of the maintenance
program could not have been foreseen for the following reasons:
i.    Although there had been differences of opinion about the scale of
the program during project preparation, all parties were finally



-xiv-
in agreement after negotiations. The unexpected provision of some
maintenance equipment from the general budget upset the agreed
scale of provision and then MOHA took some considerable time to
assess what its requirements were. On the other hand, during
appraisal it was acknowledged by all parties that funds allocated
to road maintenance were insufficient for the roads existing at
that time, a situatior that would only deteriorate as more roads
were upgraded and maintenance became more necessary and costly.
Provision was made in the loan agreement to ensure that the
Government would progressively increase maintenance funds. The
covenant (4.03(b)) covering this matter states that "adequate"
funds should be provided. While maintenance funds were
progressively increased, the Government's interpretation of
wadequate" was at variance with the Bank's interpretation, which
expected a higher level of funding.
ii.   In order to create more uniform and internationally acceptable
procurement documents, the Bank, at the time of the implementation
of this project, tightened up its review systems for bidding
documents and issued its standard bidding documents for works and
for goods. Procurement procedures and documents, which had
previously been accepted by the Bank, came under review and
changes were often required. The Office of Supply for the
Republic of Korea (OSROK), the Government procurement agency, was
asked to make changes to the maintenance equipment bidding
documents, which were drafted in a previously accepted format, but
no longer conformed to the new, stricter requirements for Bank
procurement. This situation provoked a lengthy exchange of views
between OSROK and the Bank, and resulted in a delay of some months
to the issue of the invitation for bids for the supply of this
equipment. This dela, could not have been foreseen, but
underlines the importance of the Borrower being aware from an
early stage of the up-to-date requirements of the Bank in relation
to bidding documents.
d.    Unscheduled Transport Services (UTS).  Although appearing as a covenant
(3.07) in the loan agreement, this component does not appear to have
been considered in depth during appraisal. It received only a brief
mention in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), and is not listed in the
project description in the SAR. It should have received closer scrutiny
during appraisal, in which case more would have come to light on the
legal framework and responsibilities for such a service and its
implementation would have been on a sounder footing. It is nonetheless
surprising that UTS did not achieve a rapid success in Korea, where
conditions seemed well suited.



-xv-
4.7   Several significant decisions were taken which assisted project
implementation. These included:
a.    using foreign consultants as the lead firms for construction supervision
and for the maintenance component ensured acceptable standards of
workmanship and the opportunity for Korean firms to gain valuable
experience, to the extent that they became capable of designing and
supervising the additional road improvement works without the assistance
of foreign consultants;
b.    approval of the use of surplus loan funds for the improvement of a
further 580 km of provincial and county roads, hence increasing the
physical achievement of the project by over 50%;
c.    the use of ICB for the initial list of road contracts, which contributed
towards low bid prices; and
d.    insistence on the production of good quality maintenance equipment
bidding documents, which delayed the procurement process somewhat, but
paved the way towards a better understanding by OSROK of the Bank's
views on fair and acceptable bidding documents.
5.    Prolect Results
5.1  Overall, the project has been a success.  From the physical aspect, it has
more than achieved its objectives and its results have had a noticeable impact in
the intended areas. A significant proportion of the tertiary road network was
improved to all-weather quality, transport costs reduced, maintenance organizations
established in every province and preparatory work carried out to improve other
aspects of the transport sector in subsequent projects. The objectives changed
during implementation only te the extent that about 50% more roads were improved
than originally intended, because of the savings which occurred during the bidding
for the original work program and from a cutback in equipment purchases.
5.2   The overall economic rate of return, estimated at appraisal to be 31%, based
on 1006 km of roads, is now estimated to be 28.8% based on tha 1586 km achieved. It
is expected that the final rate of return will be even better, because traffic is
increasing faster than forecast. It is, however, interesting to note that the
Government's determination to surface only 20%-30t of the roads with DBST, instead
of 70% as recommended in the feasibility study, was economically less beneficial,
even when the costs of overlaying many of these roads with AC, after only a short
period, is taken into consideration. Staged improvement would have yielded a higher
economic return, but would havel been more disruptive to traffic (Table 5-2 of PCR,
page 44).
5.3   The impact that the project has made includes:
a.    strong recommendations to Government for a policy for the integrated
planning of highway investment, which was being carried out in an



-xvl-
uncoordinated fashion by at least three separate agencies (NOC, KHC and
MOHA);
b.    development of a road traffic safety policy;
c.    further strengthening of the construction industry through the
experience gained by consultants in evaluation, design and supervision,
and by contractors in carrying out work to a strict specification;
d.    improvement of the physical environment by the paving of roads to reduce
the polluting and damaging effects of dust and mud, and the economic
costs and discomfort of travelling over rough roads;
e.    development of the technological skills of the construction industry by
the introduction of DBST as a low-cost paving method, by the use of
modern materials testing equipment and the use of appropriate
construction plent;
f.    improvement of access for farmers and rural communities to markets for
their products;
8.    introduction of UTS to coummunities previously without a means of motor
transport to nearby towns; and
h.    development of the capability within MOHA at both national and
provincial levels to manage projects of this type and to carry out
effective maintenance of their road inventories.
6.    -roiset Sustain&abiLit
6.1 With traffic increasing faster than forecast and the introduction of a proper
maintenance system for provincial and county roads, it is expected that the project
will maintain or even exceed the forecast level of net boneflts throughout its
economic life. Its final success depends on the continued growth of the Korean
economy providing a spur to the growth of traffic and on the timely and adequate
provision of maintenance funds to keep the roads in good condition.
6.2 There is a decided risk that the maintenance funds would be reduced if there
is a downturn in the economy. This issue has been addressed in the most recent
highway projecty, which includes a major road maintenance component based on a
Highway Maintenance Management Study completed in December 1987.
Korea - Road Improvement Project, approved on May 16, 1989.



-xvil-
7.    Bkerfr
7.1   The overall success of the project can be attributed in part to the good
performance by Bank staff during the whole project cycle. The firmness displayed
over the introduction of DBST has greatly benefitted the Korean road construction
industry, and will continue to do so as it is the ideal surfacing for lightly
trafficked rural roads. Although the Bank failed in its attempt to persuade the
Government to surface up to 70% of the roads with DBST, the final outcome of the
project, although economically less beneficial, was less disruptive in the long run.
On many of those roads which the Bank wanted to have a DBST surface, traffic built
up at a faster rate than forecast and many more roads would have had to have been
overlaid with AC after only a short period. Supervision missions were sent to Korea
on a regular basis and the staff changes were kept to a minimum, thus enabling good
relationships to be built up over a period of time.
7.2  The main lessons to be learnt by the Bank are:
a.   when deciding upon the growth rate for traffic in a country with a
rapidly expanding economy, like Korea's, it is easy to be too modest and
to underestimate the rate (para 5.6a);
b.    it is important to insist on a thorough training program when
introducing an unfamiliar technology (para 5.1);
c.    in order to obtain the best return on a successful project, flexibility
in the design of a project, as well as a readiness to be flexible over
enlarging the content of a project, are important ingredients (para
5.2); and
d.   the failure of the UTS to achieve widespread acceptance is probably
because of its incorporation into the project without adequate
preparation (para 5.6d).
8.   Borroer PerfonmQance
8.1   The Borrower and its implementing agency, MOHA, performed well during the
project. Bearing in mind that this was the first Bank project to be undertaken by
MOHA, it learned very fast and improved its performance as the project went on. The
initial resistance to the use of DBST was more due to a lack of knowledge of the
technique than to an inherent resistance to change, for MOHA demonstrated itself to
be flexible and able to adapt to changing circumstances as the project developed.
8.2   MOHA eased the task of project preparation by readily providing the
information requested and its performance during implementation improved steadily.
At first the provincial offices had difficulty in adequately supervising the
contracts and in maintaining the necessary standards of quality control, but as the-
gained experience, the contract management improved.
8.3  Government staff resources were generally over-stretched and therefore much
use was made of consultants, both foreign and Korean. The agencies worked closely



-xvlii-
with their consultants and relied heavily on them, generally following their advice,
but not always.
8.4  The main lessons to be learnt by the Borrower are:
a.   the implementation of the recommendations of IRIPS will have far-
reaching benefits on future highway investment planning by more
accurately determining from the outset the likely traffic, including
that diverted 7rom nearby routes, and the standard to which roads should
be improved without the necessity for upgrading them within a short time
(para 5.6a);
b.    the upgrading of roads from P1 standard to P2 or P3 is presently
difficult because of the width of the formation of a P1 road;
consideration should be given to amending the standard for the P1
formation width from 6.5 to 7.5 m to overcome future upgrading problems
(para 5.2);
c.    the use of experienced supervisors to implement high standards of
quality control, particularly of compaction of the base and sub-base, is
an important element in ensuring that a road will not break up during
its design life (para 5.1);
d.   the employment of foreign experts should be encouraged when new or
unfamiliar techniques are being introduced (Para 5.1); and
e.    it is important that low-cost techniques, such as DBST, are encouraged
and used wherever the situation allows, in order that costs are kept to
a minimum, with little or no reduction in serviceability (para 4.2).
9.   Project Relationshin
9.1  The excellent relationships that have existed between the staffs of the
Borrower and the Bank, during both preparation and implementation phases, has been
one of the factors which has contributed towards the success of the project. It
created good teamwork, in which each party displayed the flexibility to accede to
the other, when necessary, for the good of the end product.
10. ConsultinZ Services and Contractors
10.1 On the advice of the Bank, the Borrower employed foreign consultants in the
lead roles initially, thus enabling the Korean consultants, who were working with
the foreign consultants, to gain experience in designing and supervising road works,
so that eventually they successfully carried out these tasks on their own. The
consultants all performed satisfactorily.
10.2 Contractors and suppliers also played a major part in the implementation of
the project. All the civil works contractors were Korean, even though procurement
was by ICB. Initially, while both contractors and local consultants were becoming
used to working to a specification under the overall supervision of foreign



-Xix-
consultants, standards of worbmunsh4l varied greatly, but as the work progressed,
quality control improved so that it was good by the later stages of the project.
Suppliers of equLpment, who were both Korean and foreign, generally performed
satisfactorily.
10.3 This project was good for the Korean consultants and contractors, who learnt
much a.bout working to an acceptable international standard of quallty control. The
introduction of new techniques, notably DBST, were of benefit not only to the firms
that took part, but also to the whole construction industry.
11. Proiect DocgMenMation and Dats
11.1 The covenants contained in the loan agreement were reasonable and the Borrower
had little difficulty complying with them.
11.2 The Staff Appraisal Report provided a useful reference framework during the
implementation of the project.
11.3 The information for the completion of the PCR was readily available. MOHA
helped greatly in this respect and provided a timely completion report, based on the
old format, which forms the main body of the PCM attached.

KOREA
PROVINCIAL AND COUNTRY ROADS PROJECT
(LOAN 2228-KO)
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Improvement of provincial and county roads
1.01 The objective of the project is to support Government's policy
of promoting economic development in rural area by the reduction of
transport costs through the improvement of the provincial and county roads
network which have been neglected till the end of the Fourth Five year
Economic Development Plan (1977 - 1981).   The prcject aims to better
the transport means between the county centers and populated town areas
with the primary and secondary road networks, consequently reducing the
transport costs of the farm products and promoting off-farm income
opportunities for the rural population by providing inexpensive access
to secondary urban centers.   The project is rates as high priority
among Fifth Five year Plan and project roads are located in 80 of the
139 counties distributed throughout all 9 provinces.   The proposed
improvement standards at the appraisal stage are AC surfacing(600Km),
DBST surfacing(260Km) and gravel surfacing(146Km), depending on the
configurations of the forecast traffic.
B. Technical Assistance for the Maintenance Program
1.02 In order to solve the problem of the rapidly deteriorating
condition of provincial and county roads MORA, during September 1979
through February 1981, empioyed consultants(BCEO0, France and Saman,
Korea) financed under the Fourth Highway Project, to prepare a five-                     ;
year maintenance program(1983 - 1987) for the provincial and county
roads, basic objective of which is to have effective maintenance
organizations in place at central provincial and county levels by 1987.
The program has been schmed to be introduced Initially on a pilot
basis in three provinces, Gangweon, Jeonnam and Gyeongbug, in order
to test the new organizational functions, systems and operational
techniques. Technical assistance for the maintenance program will include
procurement of road maintenance equipment for the program.
C. Consultant Services
1.03 Consultant services have been provided for (i) the supervision
of provincial and county roads improvement works, (ii) technical assistance
for the implementation fo the provincial and county roads maintenance
program, (i1i) detailed engineering of the additional 1.000Km long provincial
and county roads networks, (iv) assistance in introducing the technique, (v)
road safety study and (vi) assistance in providing overseas training
program for the MOHA's staff.   Consultants services will be discussed
separately under appropriate paragraph In the following chapter.

The project has been launched in April 1983 and have been completed by the
end of June 1989. Duration of each project component is as follows:
(a) Supervision of provincial and county roads improvement works
(May 1983 - June 1989)
(b) Technical assistance for the provincial and county roads maintenance
program (August 1983 - July 1986)
(c) Detailed engineering of additional 1,00GKm of provincial and county
roads (August 1983 - August 1984)
(d) Road safety studies (June 1983 - April 1984)
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Iuprovement of Provincial and County Roads
2.01 Origin, Preparation and Appraisal
In order to support Government Policy of Promoting economic development
in rural areas by means of reduction of transport costs through the
improvement of the provincial and county roads network, MORA has undertaken
feasibility studies on rural roads aiming to select priority roads
network for improvement financed under Fourth Highway Project(1979 - 1981).
Through this study approximately 2,000Km provincial and county roads
networks have been selected as priority improvement roads.  Of these 2,000Km
rural roads, a detailed eaglneering studies for the first 1,000Km rural
roads networks have been completed (1981. 9 - 1982. 9) as a part of tasks
of the Fourth Highway Project(Loan No. 1640 - KO).  MOHA, responsible for
preparing the project, employed consultants (ECEOM, France and 12 Local
consultant firms) to engage in detailed engineering, where foreign
consultants were to play a role of supervising, setting up of design
standards, issuing design guidelines and reviewing the engineering works
prepared by the local consultants. In performing the engineering works,
information and data obtained through the county roads screening study
(1979 - 1981), updated wherever necessary. Taking into account the
location of roads, traffic and regional condition final engineering out
put were classified into three categories of the improvement standards.
They were asphalt concrete surfacing(about 600Km), DBST surfacing
(about 260Km) and remainder gravel surfacing, totalling 1,006Km in 99
contract sections.   With regard to the detailed engineering it is
noteworthy to mention that DBST surfacing technique was introduced to the
country for the first time.  The consultants(BCEOMI)  therefore, prepared
design g,idelines based on the data and information made available to
them by LCPC(France). As it was well understood between MDHA and the
Consultants that personnel of the provincial.administrations would be
filling the role of supervisory staff, assisted by the supervion
consultants, for the improvement works, engineering works were prepared in
such details to be fully comprehending by provincial engineers, both in
technical and managerial aspects. Further, DBST surfacing improvement
method which have been recommended by the Bank was accepted by MORA on the
road sections where traffic was rather low at the design phase, but



-4-
envisaging further improvement when traffic might warrant in the future.
All in all, project preparation was carried out at normal pace and was
completed within the scheduled time-frame.  Detailed engineering study
started in September 1981 and was completed in Septemb'r 1982, with
the consultants furnishing the MOHA a complete set of tender documents.
Appraisal of the project was made by the Bank on the basis of the Bank
Loan.
2.02 Targets and Goals
The project was the first package of the MOHA's long-term development
program for the improvement of provincial and county road networks, with
the second package of improvement for 1,00OKm of provincial and county road
networks following immediately, detailed engineering study of which was
also included in the project Loan Agreement(para. 2.01). As emphasized
before project was rated as priority program of the Fifth Five-year
Development Plan of the counatry for the regional economic promotj.on and
development. The Key assumptions made in the forecasts of the project
was traffic volume ou the road sections subjected to the improvement,
which turned out to be quite realistic in terms of the increase in traffic
volume considered due to the road improvement.
Provincial and Countv Road Maintenance Program
2.03  Included also in the project is the setting up of organizations
at central province and county levels for the maintenance of provincial
and county roads. In order to overcome problem of rapidly deteriorating
condition of provincial and county roads MOHA, in late 1979, employed
consultants(BCEOM, France and Saman, Korea) financed under the Forth Highway
Project (loan No. 1640 - K0), to prepare a five-year maintenance program
(1983 - 1987) for the provincial and county roads.   MORA accepting. in
general, recomuendations of the study has employed consultants(KAHPSAX,
Denmark) to provide technical assistance in establishing the organizations,
systems and operational techniques of the maintenance program.  The
maintenance program has been schemed to be introduced initially on a
pilot basis for the full program in three out of the nine provinces,
namely, Gangweon, Jeonnam and Gyeongbug in order to test the functions,
systems and operational techniques of the new organizations to be set
up through the technical assistance by the consultants. In line with
this task an agreement has been made among the Bank and MORA that the
financing by the Bank will be provider for the technical assistance,
procurement of maintenance equipment for the program and overseas training
fellowship for MORA staff while MORA will provide the recurrent costs of
the provincial and county roads maintenance program.   Consultants services
(1983. 8 - 1986. 7) have started in August 1983 for 24 month-period, to
be completed by the end of July 1985.  The initial contract have been
duly completed at the end of July 1985, as scheduled.  However, as
agreed on among the Bank and MODA, the contract have been extended for
one full year in order to ensure that the reporting and working procedures
developed by the Consultants have been fully implemented in the pilot
provinces prior to their introduction for implementation in the remaining
provinces.   The scope of technical assistance focused on all aspects of
nd       P                   The e                   of



- 5 -
services are to help MOHA establish effective organizations at central and
local levels to efficiently plan, develop and maintain provincial and county
roads by (i) assisting in the implementation of provincial and county road
maintenance program, (ii) providing MOHA with technical assistance in the
fields of road management, and (iii) training central, provincial and
county personnel (Ref. Consultants Final Report, July 1986).   As to the
procurement of road maintenance equipment, actual procurement has fallen
short of the original estimates, taking into account the numbers and
conditions of the existing equipment in operation.   Due to budgetary
constraints and delays in procurement of the new equipment, the actual
maintenance accomplishments have fallen short of the original targets.
Nevertheless, the project has contributed to a significant heightening of
the overall maintenance standard on provincial and county road networks
in Korea.   Physical out put of equipment procurement and maintenance
works undertaken in three pilot provinces are given in AnnLex I and 2.
Detailed Engineering of Second 1,00O-m Roads
2.04 In order to improve the second 1,00OKm provincial and county roads
which have rated among 2,000Km priority improvement roads resulting by
the county roads screening study(1979 - 1981)9 MORA employed consultants
(Ingeroute, France and Saman, Korea) in order to carry out detailed
engineering for the improvement works.   The consultant, in oompliance
with the Terms of Reference prepared by MOHA, subcontracted the major
part of the field surveys and engineering studies to 14 local consulting
firms, while consultants filling the role of supervising, setting
improvement standards, issuing design guidelines and reviewing engineering
works prepared by the local consulting firms.   The objectives of the
consultants services were (i) to carry out feasibility studies in order
to select the appropriate road by road Improvement standards, (ii) to
produce the detailed designs, specifications and tender documents and
(iii) finally, to up date the economic and financial analysis.   Final
engineering out put was 1,033Km provincial and county roads network in
127 road sections (117 contract sections), consisting of asphalt concrete
surfacing (745Km), DBST surfacing(263Km) and remainder gravel surfacing
(25Km).   The consultants services started in late August 1983 and
completed in August 1984, with consultants furnishing MOHA all tender
documents.   The project study was appraied by The World Bank and
implemented under Highway Sector Project(Loan No. 2392 - KO), all but
eight(8) contract sections which were implement under provincial and
county road project(Loan No, 2228 - KO).
2.05 In August 1985, while improvement works of the provincial and
county roads financed under Highway sector Loan (Loan No. 2392 - KO) were
in progress, it was agreed among MORA and the Bank that additional works
be added to the project but detailed engineering be financed under
Loan 2228 - KO.  Additional works consisted of extensions to the ongoing
project road sections by 89Km(25 road sections) and 30 new road sections
(19ORm).  An additional consultant team was added to the construction
supervision consultant in order to carry out the detailed engineering
for the improvement.   Major part of the field surveys and engineering                     _

studies were subcontracted to eight local consulting firms selected by
MOHA.   Engineering studies commenced in late August 1985 for four-month
period, completing the services in late December 1985. with submission of
contract and tender documents (Ref. Consultants Final Report, December 1985).
Provincial and County Road Continuation Pro1ect
2.06 In late October 1986, while the improvement of provincial and county
roads under Highway Sector Project was undergoing, an agreement was made
among MOHA and the Bank to use balance remaining under Loan 2228 - KO to
Improve provincial and county roads.   Pre-feasibility studies of the
additional roads for improvement were carried out by the Consultants
(Saman, Korea and Ingeroute, France) from December 1986 to February 1987,
selecting about 39OKm (57 road sections) for imprcvement.   All these
pre-selected roads were ex-ension of the road sections improved previously
either under Provincial and County Roads Project(Loan 2228 - KO) or Highway
Sector Project (Loan 2392 - KO).   In order to carry ott detailed engineering
for the improvement of the roads, MORA employed the consultants(Saman, Korea)
who were serving as supervision consultants of the Highway Sector Project, and
services comu_nced on April 27, 1987 for four-month period, scheduled to be
completed by August 1987.   The consultant formed a separate team to carry
out engineering studies.   In compliance with the Terms of Reference of the
consultant contract, basic engineering works were sublet to eight local
engineering firms selected by HORA while the consultant filling the role
of supervisory responsibilities, such as setting the improvement standards,
issuing design guidelines and reviewing the engineering works prepared by
the subcontracted firms.   Physical out put of the engineering studies was
377.4Km (57 contract sections) in all, consisting of asphalt concrete
pavement (304.4Km) and 73Km gravel roads (Ref. Consultants Final Report,
August 1987).  The engineering study was completed on August 26, 1987,
with consultant submitting to MORA all contract and tender documents.
Traffic Safety Studs
2.07 The Korea Traffic Safety Study was undertaken for MORA as part of
an IBID financed Provincial and County Roads Project.   The main objectives
of the study were (1) to comment upon the improvements necessary in
procedures for the collection and analysis of traffic accident statlstics
and (il) to prepare an action plan for reducing the high rate of traffic
accidents In Korea.  The study was undertaken in 3 phases and involved
critical examination of present traffic police procedures for the
collection, storage and analysis of traffic accident data and a broad
ranging appraisal of many other activities related to traffic safety in
Korea.  Discsstions between IBRD and MONA indicated that specialist traffic
safety advice would be required to assist the Korean Government to establish
priorities and to prepare and Action plan for the improvement of traffic
safety in Korea.  The Overseas Unit of the Transport and Road Research
Laboratory in England was consulted and on its recoummndation, Mr. Alan
Ross an independent traffic safety consultant was appointed Traffic Safety
Adviser to assist MOHA in undertaking the Korean Traffic Safety Study.
The study com_nced on 25th June 1988 and has been undertaken during 3
visits of the Traffic safety Adviser to Korea.   Consultations were held
with numerous organizations and individuals and personal visits were made
to all provinces and major cities in order to obtain a thorough understanding



-7-
of the present systems.   During each visit of the Traffic Safety Adviser,
Working Papers were produced to present interim recommendation and
suggestions for improvement.   In addition Workivg Papers No.3 was prepared
specifically on the subject of Traffic Accident. Costs to show the resulting
economic loss to Korea.   These documents were presented to IBRD, MHA and
Road Traffic Safety Association(RTSA) officials, thus offering opportunities
during the course of the study for these organizations to commnt on the
general direction of the study furing Its progress.   The study was
completed in April 1984 (Ref. Consultants Final Report, April 1984).
III.   IMPLEMENTATION
A. Construction of Provincial and County Roads
OriRinal 1,006Km road
3.01 For the original 1,006Km provincial and county roads improvement
construction contracts were made on May 20 through June 1, 1983 over 101
contract sections.   The works stated timely and proceeded under normal and
steady pace.   However, in November 1984, about one month before scheduled
completion date, an agreement was made among HOHA and the Bank for additional
works to 30 of the project road sections.   The additional works consisted
of extension of road sections by 82Km and the construction of 15 new bridges
over 30 project road sections.   It was agreed among MOHA and the Bank that
construction supervision for the 30 road sections be carried out by the
supervision consultants for the Highway Sector Project(Loan 2392 - KO) which
was scheduled to comence in March 1985.  By the end of the scheduled
completion time, therefore, the Certificate of Completion was made to 71 out
of 101 contract sections.   Furthermore, eight road sections(93.5Km)
originally included in the Highway Sector Project were transferred to
be Implemented under the Provincial and County Road Project(Loan 2228 - KO),
making alotgether 38 road sections(175.5Km) to be carried over to be worked
on in 1985.   Of these, 23 road sections were completed in 1985, 15 road
sections in 1986 and the remaining two road sections in 1987.  The reasons
for these changes(for the 30 road sections) were caused entirely by intention
to improve more of the roads with the funds made available by under-bidding.
Actual Physical outputs of the road improvement for the original 1,006Km road
are given in Table 5 by each improvement standard.   The Table also gives
hypothetic economic rates of return on alternative improvement standards.
Continuation Proiect
3.02   For 57 road sections(para. 2.06), bidding was made on September 30,
1987 throughout the 9 provinces.   After evaluation of the bids and
agreement by the Bank, construction contracts were made on October 24
through November 1, 1987.  The works started innediately and proceeded
under normal and steady pace.  Of these 57 road sections 52 road sections
were completed by the end of December 1988, scheduled completion date,
and 5 road sections by end of June 1989.  The reasons for the delay in
completion date for these 5 road sections was caused by the changes, such
as, changes in pavement standards, extension to the road sections,
construction of new bridges, which were realized at close to the scheduled
completion date.

Implementation Schedule
3.03   The actual implementation of the project in whole was quite
closs to the original schedule as set forth at the time of the project
appraisal but for the procurement of the maintenance equipment, which was
delayed by some 24 month-tlme.   The main reasons for the delay were
exceptionally long time involved in deciding the numbers and types of
equipment to be procured with the proper considerations given to the numbers
and conditions of the existing equipment on hand in operational condition
(para. 2.03).   Although the implementation schedule for the provincial and
county road !iprovement project was set from May 1983 through December 1986 at
appraisal time, the construction contract for the original 1,006Km (101 contract
sections) was set December 31, 1984 as the completion date.   All 101 contract
sections could have been completed within the above contract completior date
but for the additional works added to 30 of the project road sectioxis in
November 1984, so close to the contract completion date.   Be that as it may,
71 contract sections, valued at 77.5X of the total project contract amount,
were completed by the contract completion date.   Of the remaining 30 road
sections where additional works were added and eight road sections transferred
from the Highway Sector Project (Loan 2392 - KO) and included in the Project
(para. 3.01), 36 road sections valued at 892 of the total contract amoun,.
were completed within the given completion date of December 31, 1986.
Two road sections which failed to meet the given completion time were due
to the further additional works.   These two sections were completed in
April 1987.   All in all the whole project road sections as originally
:ntented and later revised were completed.   With due considerations given
to these unexpected events, the original time schedule should be deemed
quite realistic.
3.04   The actual implementation of the contir.uation project Involving
57 contract sections(para. 2.06) also fell behind the original schedule
which was set the end of January 1989.   The reason for the delay was caused
by the additional works added to some of the project roads in late April 1988.
The additional works consisted of about 23Km extensions to 8 of the project
road sections and chang of the gravel surfaced road to asphalt concrete
pavement surfacing in one section.   Because of the additional works only
52 out of 57 road sections vLlued at 962 of the total contract amount were
completed within the given contract completion tim. The remaining five
road sections were completed by the end of June 1989.  At end of the
provincial and county roads project total works completed were a little
over 1,586Km in 166 road sections compared to the original 1,006Km in 101
road sections, over 158% accomplishment.
Le2orting
3.05   Throughout the construction period monthly progress report was
prepared stating construction activities, quality control of the works
carried out, recomoendations issued by the consultants aiming to Improve
works procedures and financial statement of the relevant month.   These
reports were extremely benefitial to the supervisory personnel to watch
over contractors' working procedures and Improving quality of the works.

Procurement
3.06   All biddings were executed following international competitive
bidding procedures, but no foreign contractors participated in bidding.
Although international competitlve bidding procedures caused some delays
in implementing the works because of the time required for the contractors
prequalification notice and bid announcement, the procedures helped in
reducing the contract costS.  For the improvement of provincial and county
roads and technical assistance for the maintenance program, consultants
were employed.  The consultants teams were jointly formed with foreign
and local consulting firms, which were formed by mutual agreement among
MOHA and the Bank.   Foreign consultants were selected on the basis of
their experiences in Korea in the similar tasks and remnerations were
remunerations were set on the basis of international levels.   Local
consultants were selected among leading firms in the country with wide
range experience in the similar tasks.   It should be mentioned here that
only local consultants were employed for the continuation project(57 road
sections) for both detailed engineering and construction supervision.
Costs
3.07   Actual costs of the project roads were closely monitored by means
of variation orders which were computated and verified upon occurrence of
all variations in the contract amounts. therefore, the costs actually
incurred were quite correct.   .'he expected costs of the original 1,006Km
roads were estimated at W110,366 million equivalent to US$148,143 thousand
(at US$1-745) excluding contingencies.   However actual costs at final
construction time, it turned out to amount W134,994 million equivalent to
US$167,265.9(at US$1-807.06) because of the additional works (para. 3.01)
consisting of extensions of the road sections, bridge structures and other
incidental costs.   Moreover, eight additional road sections amounting
to W13,553 million equivalent to US$16,793.4 thousand and 57 road sections
of the continuation project(para. 3.02) amounting to V43,877 million
equivalent to US$43,877 thausand were added to the project, thus, making
the project 1,586Km in 166 contract sections with the final construction
costs of W192.424 million equivalent to US$238,426 thousand(Table 2).
As stated above the cost overruns were caused mainly by the increased scope
of the project.   It should be admitted that there were a slight increase
in unit prices by normal price increases over six-year time period;
detailed engineering in 1982, 1984 and 1987 wherein the design cost
estimates were made for original 1,006Km, 23Km of eight road sections and
377Km of 57 road sections, respectively.   The cost overruns for the
improvement of the roads were met with underruns by procument of road
maintenance equlpmant and contingencies.   Contingency allowances estimated
at appraisal tim were adequate to meet the lncreased costs of the project
for foreign component of the cost but fell below for local component of the
cost mainly due to the fluctuation of the foreign currency exchange rate.

Financial Sources
3.08   Actual expenditures amounted to W205,296.8 millions against the
original expectations estimated at W180,281.6 millions including contingencies,
exceeding the original estimates by some 13.9% point.   The overruns were
caused by the improvement of roads, where originally intented 1,006Km had
been increased to 1,582Km.   Another overruns were incurred by engineering of
the roads which were increased to 1,600Km against originally intended 1,000Km.
These overruns, when looked at proportionally against oricdnal estimates and
actual expenditures of the project in whole, the improvement of the provincial
and county roads increased from 82.4% to 93.7X and engineering of the
provincial and county roads from 1.42 tc 2.4%.   A sumnarry of project costs
and implementation schedule for major components of the project is given
in the following tables.
B. Training of the Contractors and MOHA's Staff
t.   
In the Country Training
3.09   In introducing DBST technique into the country a comprehensive traing
program was prepared (June-July 1983).   Training program carried out during
February to August 1984 consisted of theoretical seminars, practical
demonstrations, trial sections and on-the-job training.   In theoretical
seminars text in five modules with Supporting slides were used.   For trial
sections, three provinces were selected, where two adjacent provinces had
participated.   On-the-job training was carried out all DBST road sections,
giving out notices beforehand to all contractors whose DBST sections located
nearby Overseas Training.
Overseas Training
3.10 A total of nine overseas training for MONA's staff had been
undertaken on separate time periods.   Except one occasion of one-year
long-term traiaing in England, all the rest of the overseas traing was
for short-term training of the period ranging from 14 to 15 days in USA and
European countries, England, France, Sweden, Switzland and West Germany.
Number of trainees participated were 54 in all throughout 1984 - 1989.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
4.01  MORA, as agreed on during negotiation of the Loan 2228 - KO.
established Road Maintenance Section in MORA to be responsible for overall
management of the maintenance activities over all nine provinces.
Further, during 1985 Provincial Road Maintenance Offices had been strengthened
in man-power and laboratory equipment.   In addition, mobile laboratories
mounted on the trucks were provided to all provinces so as to enable to
perform on the spot quality tests of the works at the construction sites.
All provincial administrations established additional construction sections
under road divisions to strengthen construction supervision and management.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01   The purpose of the present final evaluation is to determina the
economic returns of the project, using actual investment costs and traffic
volumes.  The road by road evaluation is made through the "with-without"
approach as was in the case of original evaluation aE appraisal time.
The only differences at this final stage would be that the evaluations are
made using actual costs and traffic while the original evaluations were
made on the basis of estimated costs and traffic.   Table 3 shows actual
traffic volumes on each road section and original and final estimates of
economic rate of return are shown in Table 4.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01  As stated previously(para. 2.01) the project was rated as top-priority
among the Fifth Five year Plan and the resultant project in the light of
Sixth Five year Plan more than justifies the pr6ject. Although the scope
of the project exceeded the original intention by more than 1501, the size
of the project was not overly burdensoma to MONA, considering the project
times involved.   In conclusion the project was we11 designed, implemented
within the capacity of the provinces.   Throughout the duration of the
project, Mission from The World Bank made periodic visits to Korea to
review the works and management of the project. Number of visits by the
Bank ranged between two to four times per year, depending on the work load
mnder progress.  The Mission's visits were timely and its reviews of the
project was quite helpfull.
