IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
SECOND PUBLIC WORKS AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
CREDIT No. 2369-SE
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Public Works and
Employment Project in the Republic of Senegal, for which Credit 2369-SE in the amount of SDR
28.5 million (US$39 million equivalent) was approved on May 21, 1992 and became effective on
January 27, 1993.
The credit closed on June 30, 1997, following a one-year extension. It was fully disbursed, and
the last disbursement took place on August 14, 1997. Counterpart funds from the Government
totaled US$7 million and municipalities contributed US$ 10 million. Cofinancing was provided
in the order of US$29.35 million by Germany (KfW), Canada (CIDA), the European Union
(PPGE) and France (FSD).
The ICR was prepared by Leslie Pean (Sr. Projects Officer), staff from the Executing Agency
(AGETIP). Rumana Huque (Consultant) also provided assistance. The ICR was reviewed by
Mahmood A. Ayub (Country Director, AFC 14). Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's
final supervision/completion mission that took place between January 27 and 30, 1997 (the
Mission's Aide Memoire is presented in Annex A). The ICR was discussed with the Borrower
during the last supervision mission. It was updated and submitted to the Government for
comments on September 1997; no comments were received. Comments from the Senegal
Country Team and Technical Specialists have been incorporated in this ICR.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
SECOND PUBLIC WORKS AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
CREDIT No. 2369-SE
EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
1.    In 1989, the Government of Senegal decided to undertake a public works and
employment project in an attempt to generate employment. With IDA's support, the first Public
Works and Employment Project (Cr. 2075-SE) in the amount of SDR 20 million was approved in
December 1989, which became effective in March 1990. The Agence d'Execution des Travaux
d 'Interet Public contre le Sous-Emploi (AGETIP) was created as an independent non-profit
institution in April 1989, to execute the project. AGETIP spearheaded a new initiative, the
concept of delegated contract management or Convention de Maitrise d'ouvrage deleguee. The
success of this initiative as a tool to increase local absorptive capacity and to involve small
contractors in project execution led the Government to request IDA's assistance for a second
project in March 1991. AGETIP's demonstrated effectiveness during the 1990-1993 period
reinforced continued support by the donor community, led by IDA.
2.    This second project, larger than the first one in terms of financing, conforms with
Senegal's desire to proceed with decentralization. Further, elections in 48 municipalities in
November 1990 and the inception of the Association des Maires du Sinigal (AMS) has led to an
active effort to develop programs in each of the municipalities. Leaders of these local
governments requested the assistance of AGETIP to help them plan and structure interventions to
rehabilitate and improve living conditions. Action plans for their municipalities were to include:
(a) basic urban infrastructure (paved roads, primary and secondary canals for storm drainage and
sanitation); (b) slum upgrading and restructuring (roads, potable water, street lights); and (c)
basic economic infrastructure and community facilities (covered markets, bus stations,
slaughterhouses, public parking).
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.    Based on its experience during the first phase (AGETIP I, Cr. 2075-SE), this second
credit (generally referred to as AGETIP II) included specific components in addition to public
works execution and employment. These were: (a) the continuation and decentralization of
AGETIP activities in secondary cities; (b) the development of pilot activities to test the feasibility
of AGETIP's approach in other areas; (c) the organization of training for the municipalities and
the small and microenterprises engaged in project implementation; and (d) making AGETIP a
sustainable agency covering its operating costs on a fee basis.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
4.    Achievement of objectives: The IDA credit and beneficiary contributions amounted to a
total of CFAF 24.671 billion or about 30.5% of AGETIP's entire portfolio. Some 348 sub-
projects were financed through the credit and 99.91% of the credit was disbursed by project



ii
closing. Government counterpart funds represented 3.1% of the total portfolio (CFAF 2.089
billion), financing 53 sub-projects. The labor ratio for government counterpart funds was 34.32%
and 71% of the funds were disbursed by this date.
5.    Economic Evaluation. Economic rates of return were calculated for a representative
sample of sub-projects. The sample consisted of 5 categories of projects: roads, drainage,
revenue-generating projects, rehabilitation of public buildings, and construction of simple
buildings (health centers, etc.). The classification into categories enabled the analysis to take into
account the different duration of the economic life of each type of sub-project, the different O&M
requirements, etc. The study included a sensitivity analysis of two scenarios, based on an
increase in the total investments in the sub-projects. The analysis revealed the following
economic rates of return:
Drainage works:                  3.7% to 13.2%
Roads works:                     25.8% to 30.4%
Revenue-generating works:        14.4% to 33.8%
Rehabilitation of public buildings:    5.4% to 12%
Construction of public buildings:  16% to 20%
6.    These rates of return, based on recently completed works by AGETIP, are in general
above the 12% required for World Bank projects (for a minimum duration of 10 years),
indicating that the choice of sub-projects made by the Agency has been justified from an
economic point of view
7.    Costs and delays. Although borrower commitment remained strong throughout project
execution, it was not possible to meet the original municipal contribution of 50% of project costs.
Some progress was achieved as certain large municipalities like the Communaute Urbaine de
Dakar were able to pay 50%. However, these commitments were paid only with great difficulty.
On average, municipal contributions tended to be far lower than this estimate. The project design
was too ambitious and did not take into account that the municipalities do not have direct access
to their own revenues. As a result, the project did not disburse during the first year and these
delays were only solved through payment of the municipal contribution with outside donor
contribution (Canada) and by amending the required municipal contribution from 50% to 10%.
The Agency has recruited and retained technically competent and skilled personnel selected
competitively from the private sector. All financial audits have been unqualified and technical
audits have demonstrated that all works are completed within the standards and requirements of
the profession. The Agency has also been able to reduce its operating costs and maintain it
within 5% of project costs.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATIONS, AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
8.    AGETIP continues to offer meaningful support to project implementation in several
sectors. In addition, the success of the operation ledthe Government and the Bank a follow-up
operation, i.e. in the Urban Development Project, approved by the Board in November 1997,
which involves resource mobilization and urban planning prior to sub-project implementation by
AGETIP.



iii
9.    AGETIP has shown unequivocally that it is possible to have a private autonomous
agency capable of executing public works efficiently and effectively, without the help of external
technical assistance. The success of the projects undertaken by AGETIP (which include but are
not limited to this credit) has strengthened the position of AGETIP as an executing agency for
Government projects and has confirmed the usefulness and efficacy of the concept of delegated
contract management.
10.   With regard to a separate component of the project, improving public procurement, the
difficulties of general procurement laws have become apparent not only through this project but
through AGETIP projects in other countries as well. A lesson to be drawn is that AGETIP
projects per se are perhaps not the best instrument through which general government
procurement processes can be reformed. Through this project, Government has demonstrated its
willingness to streamline and make more transparent the procurement process of specific sectors
(namely the building and construction industry, and increasingly, health and education).
However, to try and expand this to the rest of the economy in one fell swoop might be too
optimistic a goal for one sector investment project. General procurement reform is being
undertaken in the context of improved portfolio management.

SECOND PUBLIC WORKS AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECT
CREDIT No. 2369-SE
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Background
1.    In 1989, the Government of Senegal decided to undertake a public works and
employment project in an attempt to generate employment. With IDA's support, the first Public
Works and Employment Project (Cr. 2075-SE) in the amount of SDR 20 million was approved in
December 1989, which became effective in March 1990. The Agence d 'Execution des Travaux
d'Interet Public contre le Sous-Emploi (AGETIP) was created as an independent non-profit
institution in April 1989, to execute the project. AGETIP spearheaded a new initiative, the
concept of delegated contract management or Convention de Maitrise d 'ouvrage deleguee. The
success of this initiative as a tool to increase local absorptive capacity and to involve small
contractors in project execution led the Government to request IDA's assistance for a second
project in March 1991. AGETIP's demonstrated effectiveness during the 1990-1993 period
reinforced continued support by the donor community, led by IDA.
2.    This second project, larger than the first one in terms of financing, conforms with
Senegal's desire to proceed with decentralization. Further, elections in 48 municipalities in
November 1990 and the inception of the Association des Maires du Sen2gal (AMS) has led to an
active effort to develop programs in each of the municipalities. Leaders of these local
governments requested the assistance of AGETIP to help them plan and structure interventions to
rehabilitate and improve living conditions. Action plans for their municipalities were to include:
(a) basic urban infrastructure (paved roads, primary and secondary canals for storm drainage and

basic economic infrastructure and community facilities (covered markets, bus stations,

A.    Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
Al.   Project Objectives
3.    Based on its experience during the first phase (AGETIP I, Cr. 2075-SE), this second
credit (generally referred to as AGETIP II) included specific components in addition to public
works execution and employment. These were: (a) the continuation and decentralization of
AGETIP activities in secondary cities; (b) the development of pilot activities to test the feasibility
of AGETIP's approach in other areas; (c) the organization of training for the municipalities and
the small and microenterprises engaged in project implementation; and (d) making AGETIP a
sustainable agency covering its operating costs on a fee basis.

4.    The Credit financed the investment operations of AGETIP for three years. As detailed in
the Staff Appraisal Report (Report 10421-SE, May 1, 1992), the project consisted of three
principal components involving short-term employment creation and laying the groundwork for
long-term development and management of municipal revenue-earning infrastructure in Senegal.
The three components were:
(a)   Continuation and expansion ofAGETIP's workprogram of public facility and
infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance in urban areas to be carried out under labor-
intensive schemes by local contractors (90% of total project costs). AGETIP agreed to
decentralize its activities and set up two regional offices in Saint Louis and Ziguinchor.
Municipalities benefiting from sub-projects executed under the project would finance
50% of the cost of these sub-projects, and in order to encourage municipalities with
strong management skills, it was decided to introduce an "incentive fund" (fonds
d 'incitation).
(b)  A program ofpilot activities designed to test the applicability of AGETIP's principles to
other areas: (i) a revenue-generating infrastructure program (markets, slaughterhouses,
bus stations, cold storage houses and public parking) to test the application of AGETIP
procedures to other municipal infrastructure; (ii) a public procurement program to
improve the efficiency of procurement of goods for public purposes (hospital and school
furniture and sanitation equipment) designed to be executed by small artisans; and (iii) a
rural investment program for support of rural investment.
(c)   Training and studies to finance training services offered to local contractors, a training
program for local engineering firms and beneficiaries, a monitoring and consulting
component to closely monitor the progress of the project, a study and selective audit of
the Public Investment Program to analyze existing procurement legislation and practices,
a technical assistance package to assess the feasibility of establishing a mutual guarantee
company for small contractors and a program aimed at increasing grassroots participation
in urban infrastructure maintenance.
A2.   Evaluation of Objectives and Risks
5.    The project supported the policy of the Government of Senegal to execute small works in
urban areas through labor-intensive techniques using local small and medium enterprises. The
project was the continuation of an on-going Public Works and Employment project that was a
safety net to deal with the negative impacts of the adjustment program. The project intended to
go one step further to help municipalities improve urban management by offering them a vehicle
to execute their projects with their financial participation. The project responded positively to
municipal constraints in sub-project execution by providing the municipalities with an avenue to
address: (a) the absence of capacity to prepare studies and design works; (b) insufficient capacity
to award and manage small contracts; and (c) insufficient capacity to monitor works and evaluate
results. The implementation of these objectives was well within the capacity of AGETIP.
6.    The major risks in meeting the project objectives were: (a) the Agency's administrative
costs after the project; (b) political interference in the day-to-day management of AGETIP; and
(c) AGETIP's future. To adequately minimize these risks, the project's appraisal work focused



3
on: (a) specific measures for cost recovery, such as the introduction of a service fee by the
Agency for the execution of works; (b) the preparation of internal control mechanisms and
appropriate supervisory procedures; and (c) provision of a range of options to AGETIP's
management from breaking up the activities of AGETIP and decentralizing into smaller units at
regional levels, to privatization.
B.    Achievement of Project Objectives
B1.   Degree of Achievement of Objectives
7.    The IDA credit and beneficiary contributions amounted to a total of CFAF 24.671 billion
or about 30.5% of AGETIP's entire portfolio. Some 348 sub-projects were financed through the
credit and 99.91% of the credit was disbursed by project closing. Government counterpart funds
represented 3. 1 % of the total portfolio (CFAF 2.089 billion), financing 53 sub-projects. The
labor ratio for government counterpart funds was 34.32% and 71% of the funds were disbursed
by this date.
8.    Creation of employment. Achievement of this objective has been substantial.
* 150,860 jobs were created for an average duration of 37.6 days (i.e. 5,672,377 person days of
employment created).'
* The average salary was approximately CFAF 95 562 for an average of 37.6 days, or CFAF
2,661 per day (for an annual salary of CFAF 60,500 for 11 months of work). Taking into
account the devaluation of the CFA in 1994, and comparing AGETIP's salary as a percentage
of annual per capita income (US$400) for the country as a whole, AGETIP is able to provide
about 47% of per capita income. This indicates an improvement over the performance of
AGETIP I, which provided workers with 33% of the annual per capita income.
* The labor ratio for AGETIP as a whole (including financing from other donors) was 25.51%.
9.    The majority of the laborers hired through AGETIP projects came from very
disadvantaged groups of society with little prospects for employment in the current economic
situation of Senegal, notably unskilled or semi-skilled workers, workers retrenched from the
public service who were not able to find employment elsewhere, and recently graduated students.
As many of these groups often support families of ten or twelve people each, the employment
created has had an important impact on the containment and alleviation of poverty in the country.
10.   Creation of infrastructure. Physical achievements as a result of this project have been
substantial. AGETIP, through financing from both this credit and from other donors, has
contributed to the rehabilitation and construction of numerous public buildings (including
I Disbursements in 1993 were slow due to problems with beneficiary contributions. However, employment
picked up considerably in 1994, 1995 and 1996. Employment doubled from 1994 to 1995 and tripled from
1995 to 1996, to reach 14,645 person years in 1996, more than double the number envisaged in the SAR
for that year.

hospitals, health centers, classes, stadiums, youth centers, etc.); rehabilitation of over 100 km of
urban roads; cleaning and rehabilitation of drainage and sewage canals; monthly sand and
garbage collection in 20 communes; and improvement of the urban environment through the
creation of parks, among others.
11.   Improving public procurement. One of the objectives of the project was to improve the
efficiency of Government procurement of goods for public purposes through reforms in the
Public Procurement Code. Achievement of this component has been negligible. AGETIP has
fulfilled all its obligations for implementation of this component, including hiring consultants,
completing related studies, and making recommendations to Government for reform of the
Procurement Code. However, the final decision to reform the Code has not been taken by
Government. The Ministry of Economic Modernization, which has been the main interlocutor
for the reforms throughout the process, has proposed that a law be passed on the issue of the
reform rather than the relatively simpler process of passing a decree. However, the Ministry of
Economy and Finance feels that the preparation of such a law falls under its jurisdiction, and now
wants to be in charge of the process. This conflict of competency between the two ministries has
resulted in a complete deadlock in the process of reform of the Code.
12.   Private sector development. The achievement of this objective has been substantial.
AGETIP has actively promoted the creation of small and micro-enterprises. As the following
table shows, under AGETIP I, 1220 enterprises and 292 engineering firms had been registered
with AGETIP. Since AGETIP II, 854 new enterprises and 100 additional engineering firms have
been registered.

Received contracts                   159         31
Total disbursements to enterprises and engineering/consulting firms during AGETIP II amounted
to CFAF 56.5 billion (for an average contract of CFAF 25 million). This figure is four times that
achieved during AGETIP I. With a 64% increase in the number of enterprises during this second
phase, and a 48% increase in the number of new engineering firms, this implies a much greater
distribution of income going to enterprises. The average amount of business received by the 379
SMEs stands at CFAF 124 million since the inception of AGETIP (compared to CFAF 45 million
at the end of AGETIP I), and for engineering firms, about CFAF 15 million (compared to CFAF
4 million for AGETIP I).
13.   Through the project, the Agency organized a training program to develop the technical
and managerial capacities of enterprises. A total of 3,853 individuals from 400 enterprises and
42 consulting firms participated in these training sessions. In addition, a Mutual Guarantee
Company for enterprises in the building and construction industry was created through the



5
establishment of Mutuelles Regionale de Credit d'Epargne et de Garantie in each of the 10
regions of Senegal.
14.    The building and construction industry. The contribution of AGETIP to the building
and construction industry has increased from 2.7% of total production in this sector during the
first phase (AGETIP I) to 13.2% of total production at the end of AGETIP II (this assumes an
average annual growth of 5% in the sector, outside of AGETIP activities, from 1994 to 1996).
While the contribution to the industry in terms of total production is modest, AGETIP has
unquestionably contributed to the creation and promotion of 148 small and micro-enterprises,
accounting for 50% of the businesses of small enterprises, and 75% of the businesses of micro-
enterprises. This demonstrates that AGETIP has been successful in opening up the barriers to
entry for small and micro-enterprises into the building and construction industry. These
enterprises, usually consisting of less than 10 salaried staff, have also had a spillover effect on the
promotion of informal sector firms ("tdcherons," artisanal workers, mechanics, etc.). AGETIP
has had an impact not only on small businesses, but on the entire spectrum of enterprises in this
sector. Of the approximately 200 enterprises that received AGETIP contracts in the second
phase, 45 enterprises (22%) received 70% of the total value of contracts. These enterprises
included the 4 largest enterprises in Senegal (Class D), 13 medium enterprises (Class C) and 24
small enterprises (Class B).
15.   Institutional development. AGETIP has been involved in the implementation of several
projects funded by IDA in the sectors of education, health, nutrition, and transport. AGETIP has
also been useful in the re-structuration of projects in the agriculture sector and the formulation of
a private sector development project.
16.   Impact on otherAfrican countries/AFRICATIP. The institutional model that AGETIP
represents has proved to be transferable in situations outside of Senegal also and the AGETIP
concept has had wide replication in other African countries. Twelve countries now have
AGETIP-type agencies, based on the concept of delegated contract management. These
countries have formed an association called AFRICATIP which meets regularly to exchange
experiences, ideas and best practices among the different agencies.
B2.   Economic Evaluation
17.    Economic rates of return were calculated for a representative sample of sub-projects.
The sample consisted of 5 categories of projects: roads, drainage, revenue-generating projects,
rehabilitation of public buildings, and construction of simple buildings (health centers, etc.). The
classification into categories enabled the analysis to take into account the different duration of the
economic life of each type of sub-project, the different O&M requirements, etc. The study
included a sensitivity analysis of two scenarios, based on an increase in the total investments in
the sub-projects. The analysis revealed the following economic rates of return:
Drainage works:                   3.7% to 13.2%
Roads works:                      25.8% to 30.4%
Revenue-generating works:          14.4% to 33.8%
Rehabilitation of public buildings:  5.4% to 12%
Construction of public buildings:  16% to 20%



6
These rates of return, based on recently completed works by AGETIP, are in general above the
12% required for World Bank projects (for a minimum duration of 10 years), indicating that the
choice of sub-projects made by the Agency has been justified from an economic point of view.
C.    Major Factors Affecting the Project
18.   Factors subject to government Control.
*  Counterpartfundsfrom the municipalities. Although borrower commitment remained
strong throughout project execution, it was not possible to meet the original municipal
contribution of 50% of project costs. Some progress was achieved as certain large
municipalities like the Communaute Urbaine de Dakar were able to pay 50%. However,
these commitments were paid only with great difficulty. On average, municipal contributions
tended to be far lower than this estimate. The project design was too ambitious and did not
take into account that the municipalities do not have direct access to their own revenues. As
a result, the project did not disburse during the first year and these delays were only solved
through payment of the municipal contribution with outside donor contribution (Canada) and
by amending the required municipal contribution from 50% to 10%.
*  Borrower commitment. It is encouraging to note that from the beginning, Borrower
commitment has remained strong in terms of observing a "hands-off' policy over the
management of the Agency. Government control has taken place at intervals but was never
excessive. The process of decision-making in the Agency remained autonomous and
independent, not only in terms of procurement but also in the areas of personnel management
and, most importantly, in the area of conflict resolution with contractors, suppliers, NGOs,
and consultants.
19.   Factors subject to implementing agency controL The Agency has recruited and retained
technically competent and skilled personnel selected competitively from the private sector. All
financial audits have been unqualified and technical audits have demonstrated that all works are
completed within the standards and requirements of the profession. The Agency has also been
able to reduce its operating costs and maintain it within 5% of project costs.
D.    Project Sustainability
20.   The issue of sustainability must be unbundled to be really realistically tackled.
Sustainability can be measured at three levels: sustainability of the institutional model,
sustainability of private sector growth and continued employment generation, and the
sustainability of sub-projects.
* Sustainability of the institutional model seems likely. Actual activity of AGETIP in terms of
project execution and contract management for other entities demonstrates that AGETIP has
proven itself to be a well functioning, efficient organization, and has no problems attracting
funding from both Government and donors. The fact that this institutional model has already
been replicated in 13 different countries in Africa, and seem to be functioning effectively in



7
almost all of them also demonstrates the sustainability of this model of delegated contract
management.
* Sustainability of promotion of SMEs and employment generation seems likely. As shown
above, the project has resulted in a large increase in the numbers of enterprises/contractors
and consulting firms in the national building and construction industry. The quality and
performance of these enterprises and firms have also improved as a result of training
programs financed through the project which have enabled better supervision of contractors
by engineering/consulting firms (attested in the technical audit of January 1997). The
Agency is also becoming more rigorous in its selection criteria, again imposing improved
performance in the industry. Thus, the project has contributed not only to growth of SMEs,
but the building up of their technical capacity and performance. As long as the Agency
continues to use small and medium enterprises to carry out works, employment generation
will also be assured.
*  Sustainability of sub-projects is uncertain. Sustainability of sub-projects depends on the
initial quality of the infrastructure created and on its subsequent operations and maintenance
(O&M). As mentioned above, the quality of works has been improving through training
programs. However, more can be done on this front. One suggestion is to strengthen
technical audits and institutionalize them as have been done with financial audits.
Sustainability of O&M remains a problem. O&M is not in AGETIP's mandate. The entity
that commissions the works (usually the municipality) has full responsibility for O&M.
Although municipalities are currently contributing to some of the investment costs of the
project, they nevertheless continue to lack the technical and financial resources to carry out
O&M effectively. Unless the finances of municipalities improve, sub-project sustainability
will remain uncertain. Another important factor in sub-project sustainability is community
participation. Where communities have not been involved in the planning and
implementation decisions of sub-projects, O&M by communities has suffered. AGETIP has
been criticized for not involving (or even informing) communities in the sub-projects it
carries out. However, community participation, especially in decision-making, is also largely
the responsibility of municipalities.
E.    Bank Performance
21.   In project identification, preparation and appraisaL The Bank's performance in
helping the Borrower identify, prepare and appraise the Project was satisfactory. The SAR was
thorough with considerable attention to the sectoral background and to the experience of the first
project. However, the estimated capacity of municipalities to contribute to project costs was too
optimistic, and, following a year of no disbursements, the credit had to be amended to allow a
10% municipal contribution (versus an original requirement of 50%). The closing date of the
project was also extended by a year.
22.   In project supervision. The performance of the Bank vis-a-vis the Agency has been
satisfactory. Disbursements have taken place with minimum delays, IDA has been flexible (in
terms of extension of project closing, amendments to municipal contributions following the
devaluation, etc.), and supervision has been regular. There were some delays, including the
revision of the ceiling of the Special Account, which caused the Agency problems, particularly in



8
terms of delays in payments to enterprises. The Agency feels that, having been functioning well
for seven years, the amount of control that IDA continues to exercise over the Agency is
excessive.
F.    Borrower Performance
23.   Performance of Government. The performance of the Borrower is rated satisfactory.
The full amount of counterpart funds amounting to 3.1% of project costs (or CFAF 2 billion) was
paid. The Government has respected the autonomy of AGETIP and has not interfered in any way
in the normal operations of the Agency. Relations between AGETIP and Government are
excellent. However, with the deadlock over the reform of Procurement Code, one component of
the project has not been achieved.
24.   Performance ofAGETIP. The performance of AGETIP as an autonomous executing
agency has been highly satisfactory. AGETIP has disbursed the credit in an efficient and
effective manner. Its success can be partly attributed to the commitment of the Director General
(who was involved with the project from the very beginning) and the expertise of its staff. The
Agency has enjoyed considerable autonomy from Government, and has not abused this privilege.
All audits (financial and technical) have been unqualified. The Agency has followed closely the
guidelines set by the Manual of Procedures (some amendments needed to be made to the Manual
of Procedures, such as evaluation criteria for bids, which the Agency carried out in an efficient
manner). Operating costs have remained low at less than 5% for the duration of the project.
Over 90% of works are completed within budget and 95% of works are executed on time.
G.    Assessment of Outcome
25.   The outcome of the project is highly satisfactory. Most targets were met. The project
has achieved and indeed surpassed most of its objectives regarding employment creation,
development of the private sector, as well as physical infrastructure created. While the jobs
created through AGETIP have not necessarily led to a massive reduction in the number of
unemployed, the project has certainly contributed to reducing the rate of unemployment. It has
contributed importantly to improving the quality of life of the population and reduced poverty
through the incomes generated, greater access of the population to physical infrastructure relating
to health, education, and social activities, and an improved urban environment. Although not a
part of this credit, during this second phase, AGETIP has been entrusted as the implementing
agency for two other Bank projects in the health and education sectors (in addition to carrying out
contracts for specific components of a variety of other projects from both the Bank and other
donors), enabling the Bank to have a greater impact in the social sectors through an already
existing institution that has proven itself to be efficient and effective.

H.    Future Operations
26.   AGETIP continues to offer meaningful support to project implementation in several
sectors. In addition, the success of the operation led the Government and the Bank to a follow-up
operation, i.e. in Urban Development Project, approved by the Board in November 1997, which
involves municipal resource mobilization and urban planning prior to sub-project implementation
by AGETIP.
I.    Key Lessons Learned
27.   AGETIP has shown unequivocally that it is possible to have a private autonomous
agency capable of executing public works efficiently and effectively, without the help of external
technical assistance. The success of the projects undertaken by AGETIP (which include but are
not limited to this credit) have strengthened the position of AGETIP as an executing agency for
Government projects and have confirmed the usefulness and efficacy of the concept of delegated
contract management.
28.   Some specific lessons learned from this operation include:
*  The importance of evaluating the performance of the firms and enterprises hired by the
Agency and the need for more flexibility in the system of remuneration for their services.
*  The need for stricter follow-up in the payment of contractors within the shortest possible
time.
*  The critical importance of strict management of the technical and financial databases of the
Agency, with continuous updating, and close follow-up of key indicators for implementation
and performance.
29.   With regard to a separate component of the project, improving public procurement, the
difficulties of general procurement laws have become apparent not only through this project but
through AGETIP projects in other countries as well. A lesson to be drawn is that AGETIP
projects per se are perhaps not the best instrument through which general government
procurement processes can be reformed. Through this project, Government has demonstrated its
willingness to streamline and make more transparent the procurement process of specific sectors
(namely the building and construction industry, and increasingly, health and education).
However, to try and expand this to the rest of the economy in one fell swoop might be too
optimistic a goal for one sector investment project. General procurement reform is being
undertaken in the context of improved portfolio management.
