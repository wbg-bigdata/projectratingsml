                         ratio had improved to almost 76 per cent. The bulk of the un-disbursed funds relateto payments due at various stages of deployment of the Government Integrated Financial
                         Management andInformationSystem(GIFMIS)which are to be made against specific milestones/deliverables. A level two project restructuring(involving the reallocation of project
                         resources across expenditure categories and a revision to some of the monitoring indicators)has just been completed;although the counter-signed copy of the project amendment

                         Under the Public Resource Management and Anti-Corruption Component, the project has made further progress.One of the key elements of this component is the installation and
                         operationalization of the GIFMIS for the federal government.Following a delayed procurement process, the contract for the installation of the GIFMIS was awarded toHewlett Packard
                         Nigeria Ltd.in May 2011. A design blueprint was consequently prepared and was fully accepted by the government inDecember2011. The GIFMISinterface with theCentral Bank
                         (CBN) for budget execution and cash management (Treasury Single Account functionality) has beenfully tested and has been operational since April 2012, using a stop-gap solution
                         (Remita) as the CBN RealTime Gross Settlement(RTGS) system is yet to be operational. Thus, budgetary releases to 93 MDAs are now done from the Central Bank through the
                         GIFMISsystem and for these 93 MDAs, budget performance reports and monthly financial statements are now available on a real-time basis.89 more MDAs would be added to this
                         GIFMIS budget execution system by October 1, 2012. GIFMIS interface with the personnel andpayroll system (IPPIS) has been fully designed but is yet to be tested and operational.
                         Also, through ERGP support to the FederalTreasury Academy, anew Public Financial Management (PFM) qualification framework for the Nigerian public service has been
                         developedand the new four-stage PFM curriculum is now being delivered at the the Treasury Academy. The first batch of students under theCertificateProgram (Stage 1) completed
                         their course in July and a next batch are to be admitted. Furthermore, the Federal InlandRevenueService (FIRS), through the support of key advisers and a strengthened
                         Modernization Department supported by the project,has been able to improve on its tax administration, leading to higher capture in the tax net. The number of taxpayers
                         uniquelyidentified in the tax database continues to increase rapidly and non-oil tax collections have exceeded their targets thus far in2012.Furthermore, as a result of the current
                         public procurement regulatory framework that has been supported by the project, publicprocurement policies and practices have shown some improvements: National Standard
                         Bidding Documents developed by the BureauofPublic Procurement (BPP) are now being used by government agencies and can even be used in Bank-financed procurements and
                         theBPPpublishes federal government contract awards on its website throughout the year.The National Council for Public Procurement(NCPP)which is to consider and approve public
                         procurement policies and more generally oversee the activities of the BPP remains tobe inaugurated, five years after the enactment of the enabling Public Procurement Law. The
                         project also continues to contribute toenhancing the investigative skills of the Economic & Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Financial Intelligence Operatives.

                         Underthe Civil Service Reform Component,the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) has proceeded to implement a Performance ImprovementFacility (PIF) scheme for the
                         federal public service. In the first wave supported under the project, sixteen Ministries,Departmentsand Agencies (MDAs) will have various innovative service improvement initiatives
                         (mostly ICT-based) financed under the scheme.Theconduct of two civil service-wide diagnostic studies which had been much delayed largely by procurement capacity challenges,
                         havenow reached very advanced stages. The BPSR will hold stakeholder dialogue sessions before end-September 2012 to validate theoutcome of these studies which aim to help
                         define elements for further civil service reforms. More generally, the project hascontributed to an improvement in the professional/non-professional staff mix in the project's pilot civil
                         serviceMDAs.

                         Asindicated in the last ISR, the strengthening of statistics component is essentially completed with virtually all funds expended onactivities to strengthen the National Statistical
                         System. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) now has a more professionalworkforce and produces more reliable and timely statistics which are published on its website. While
                         there remains a lot of scopeto cover, the NBS is way ahead of where it was before the project's intervention in terms of data production.

                         Under the airportssafety component, the Ministry of Aviation has succeeded in constructing an operational area perimeter fence of 13 km in length aswell as additional perimeter

                         roads of 1.8 km. The perimeter fence and roads being constructed for the Port Harcourt airport hasbeen much delayed and the Bank has now asked the Ministry of Aviation to take
                         the necessary steps to terminate the constructioncontract being financed by the project due to contractor non-performance. The aviation sector institutional reform study has
                         beencompleted but is to be validated through a stakeholder workshop. Due to various challenges, this workshop is yet to take place butwill take place in th next few weeks.

                         Some components still have much grounds to cover and efforts need to be strengthened fromall sides (the Bank and client sides) to accelerate implementation over the final five
                         months of the project's life. Most notableis the Strengthening of External Audit/Office of the Auditor-General for theFederation (OAuGF) component which lost two-and-a-halfyears of
                         implementation due to a problem with ineligible expenditures. This is more so because this component contributesappreciably to the achievement of the PDO.The Bank PFM team is
                         working very closely with the OAuGF to ensure speedy implementationof this component. Also, the full roll-out of the GIFMIS is being hampered especially because the initial stage of
                         the roll-out wasfraught with teething problems. There are also elements of resistance to the new system from certain quarters.Furthermore, theOffice of the Special Assistant to the
                         President on Civil Society Coordination which had been implementing theProcurement Awarenessand Capacity Building of Non Government Actors sub-component of the
                         procurement reform was not re-established after the newgovernment regime came in to being in May 2011. Thus, this component has stalled. The Bank has variously recommended

                         president on civil society and international media has been appointed but itis not likelythat this office would be able to quickly pick up the sub-component.

                         Over the remaining five months, the project will focus onthe full roll-out of the GIFMIS (for which about US$19 million remains committed); including the hiring of an advisor to
