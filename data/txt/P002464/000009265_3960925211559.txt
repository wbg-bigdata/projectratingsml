MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Somalia:
Northwest Region Agricultural Development Project - Phase H
(Credit 1538-SO)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Somalia - Northwest Region
Agricultural Development Project - Phase HI (Credit 1538-SO) prepared by the Africa
Regional Office. In current circumstances the report could not be sent to the Borrower for
comments.
The project continued activities assisted under the first phase approved in 1976 (Credit
635-SO), which were designed to improve small rainfed farms (PCR dated November 18,
1992). Physical implementation ceased after three years because of civil unrest, when about a
third was completed. With the outbreak of civil war the project was suspended and the
Credit was closed half disbursed.
As conditions precluded field visits to the project area after 1988, the ability to
prepare a PCR with up-to-date findings was limited. However the project records should
have enabled a more in-depth review of the contentious issue of appropriateness of the basic
technology of the project. The report was sent by the Africa Regional Office to cofinanciers
(IFAD and EEC) for comments, but none were received. It is intended to audit the project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SOMALIA
NORTHWEST REGION AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
(CREDIT 1538-SO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report for the Northwest Agricultural Development Project Phase
II in Somalia for which Credit 1538-SO in the amount of SDR 10.7 million (US$ 10.6 million equivalent)
was approved on January 8, 1985. Due to the civil war in the country the project was suspended in
March 1991, three months before the official closing date of June 30, 1991. SDR 5.7 million remains
undisbursed. The last disbursement was on June 11, 1992. The credit account cannot be closed because
the special account cannot be reconciled. In addition to the IDA credit, the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (FAD) provided a loan of US$ 7.0 million, and the European Economic
Community (EEC) a grant of US$ 5.4 million as cofinancing for the project.
Parts I and III of the report were prepared by the World Bank, Agriculture and Environment
Division, Country Department II, Africa Regional Office. A draft could not be sent to the Borrower for
comment. Copies were sent to the cofinanciers but no comment has been received.
Due to the security situation in Somalia, no field visits could take place. The report was based
on the Staff Appraisal Report, Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank Memoranda.

NORTHWEST REGION AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
(CREDIT 1538-SO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The project objectives were to: (i) increase the small rainfed farmer's income and subsistence
through improved production of grains by soil and moisture conservation, adaptive research, extension,
farmer training and the supply of inputs; (ii) increase fruit and vegetable production from small irrigated
gardens through construction of new gardens, rehabilitation of existing gardens, technical support,
research, extension and the supply of farm inputs and; (iii) strengthen local institutional capacity to
implement projects and to improve services to farmers.
Proiect Design and Preparation
2.    The Bank's involvement in the development of the Northwest region started with the Northwest
Region Agricultural Development Project (NWRADP I Cr.635-SO). NWRADP II was designed to
further the development of the region. A fundamental flaw of the project was that it was based on the
belief that NWRADP I was a success. However, when a completion report was issued in June, 1992,
it concluded that project results were inconclusive. An economic rate of return could not be calculated
because of conflicting crop data from project management and consultant surveys. The second phase
project was aware of the lack of data on crop production and included support for monitoring and
evaluation of crop yields.
4.    Another lesson drawn from the first project was the finding of a 1982 consultant survey which
showed that bunding was most effective on lowland areas but not in areas with less than 3 percent slope.
Since lowland areas account for only 16 percent of the project area, the consultants expressed doubts over
the widespread construction of bunds, and suggested other soil conservation and water harvesting
measures in addition to bunding. NWRADP II took this into account by expanding soil and water
conservation works to include terracing and contour hedging as well as bunding. A pilot watershed
management program was also introduced to deal with the ecology of an entire area.
5.    A Project Management Unit (PMU) established under the first project was to continue to
implement the second phase. For longer-term institutional building, the project planned to integrate PMU
services within existing national institutions after the mid-term review. However, with the escalation of
armed conflict, this mechanism could not be tested out.
6.    Security had been an ongoing problem for many years in the Northwest Region. The appraisal
mission was fully aware of it. But the full scale outbreak of civil war in the area in June 1988 could not
have been foreseen at the time of appraisal although security was recognized as an ongoing risk.



- iv -
Project Implementation
7.    The project had a good start. The overall implementation during the first year was on schedule
and efficient. However the situation deteriorated during 1987 because the Govermment replaced the PMU
general manager with a person who was not qualified. This was aggravated by the political and social
unrest. In mid-1988, fighting erupted in the regional capital. PMU staff were evacuated to Mogadishu,
and all field activities stopped. When the security in the northwest did not improve, the Ministry of
Finance requested the Bank to terminate the project in December 1990, six months before the official
closing date. However, the Government was overthrown shortly afterwards and IDA suspended all
ongoing credits to Somalia in March, 1991.
8.    About 65 percent of the planned bunding was completed. Due to the civil war and the weakness
of PMU's monitoring and evaluation capacity, only one yield survey was carried out, which was
insufficient to verify the economic returns of bunding. Little data was available on the expansion of
dryland farming extension and research. The irrigated component developed 75 new one-hectare irrigated
gardens and rehabilitated an equal number of them, exceeding appraisal targets of 50 in each case. Under
the water component, a total of 23 water points for human and 15 for livestock were built. It was
estimated that about 80 percent of the planned quantities of farm inputs and equipment supplies were
procured, although many reportedly did not reach the project area. To support the PMU, the project
provided vehicles and office furniture as planned. The use of technical assistance was about 50 to 60
percent of the appraisal provision. The project also trained 15 staff overseas.
Project Results
9.    The project was not completed because of the civil war. In the absence of production and other
data, no conclusion can be made on the appropriateness of the project interventions in terms of technology
and institutional-building. However, the project undoubtedly provided impetus to agricultural activity
in the northwest of Somalia throughout the 1980s.
Sustainabilitv
10.   The question of project sustainability remains unanswered since most of the project actions were
interrupted.
Lessons Learned
11.   The main lessons are as follows:
(a)    Before launching an expanded second phase project, there should be an objective
evaluation of the results of the first phase. The Bank should resist pressures to rush prematurely into
financing a follow on project;
(b)    Given the deficiency in monitoring and evaluation in the first project, a yield survey
should have been one of the first priorities. However, this was not done until the third project year;
(c)    Once a project is seriously jeopardized, orderly resolution of issues resulting from the
curtailment of contracts should proceed immediately, as occurred in this case. Other winding down
activities, such as recovery of the initial deposit of the special account should also be initiated.

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
Project Identity
Project Name         :     Second Northwest Region Agricultural Development Project
Credit No.                  1538-SO
RVP Unit                   Africa Region
Country                    Somalia
Sector              :      Agriculture
Background
1.    The Somali economy in the 1980s was dominated by the livestock sector, which provided a living
to the large nomadic population and generated 35 percent of GDP. Exports of live animals represented
about 80 percent of total exports. Crop production generated 8 percent of GDP and roughly the same
share of exports. Rainfed crop production was based primarily upon sorghum. Crop production under
controlled irrigation was centered on bananas, sugar cane, rice and maize; production under flood
irrigation comprised mainly maize and sesame.
2.    The Bank's assistance strategy was to assist the Government of Somalia (GOS) to devise and
implement policies and programs to improve the efficiency of the public and private sectors, to improve
the macroeconomic framework for domestic and external resource mobilization and allocation, improve
pricing and administration and marketing system , and to increase production and exports. Its lending
operations included both sectoral adjustment programs supporting policy reforms and productive
investments and rehabilitation programs. Over 30 percent of total IDA lending was for agriculture,
focusing on agricultural extension, drought rehabilitation, range management and rural development in
specific regions.
3.    The Northwest region of Somalia covers an area of about 3.5 million ha, but only about 100,000
ha of land (situated mainly along the Ethiopian border) was potentially cultivable. Agriculture was almost
exclusively practiced under rainfed conditions. Pressure on land resources was high, and was exacerbated
by restricted access of Somali nomads to traditional grazing in the neighboring Ogaden region and the
presence of thousands of refugees from disputed border territories. Consequently, the GOS's strategy



- 2 -
for development of the Northwest region placed emphasis on a balanced regional development through
the sedentarization of nomads and the stabilization and economic exploitation of available natural
resources, particularly by improving rainfed agriculture.
4.    The Banks's involvement in the development of the Northwest region started with the Northwest
Region Agricultural Development Project (NWRADP I, Cr. 635-SO). NWRADP I was implemented
between 1976 and 1985 and at completion, it was considered a successful project, although no formal
evaluation had been done. NWRADP II was designed to further the development of the region.
Project Objectives and Description
5.    Objectives: The main objectives of NWRADP II were to: (i) increase the small rainfed farmer
income and subsistence through improved production of grains (sorghum and maize) by soil and moisture
conservation, adaptive research, extension, farmer training and the supply of inputs; (ii) increase fruit
and vegetable production from small irrigated gardens through construction of new gardens, rehabilitation
of existing gardens, technical support, research, extension and the supply of farm inputs and; (iii)
strengthen local institutional capacity to implement projects and to improve services to farmers.
6.    The first two main objectives of NWRADP II were identical to those under NWRADP I, whereas
the third objective emphasized the integration of the various support service operations into the national
institutions, such as extension, input supply, credit and marketing.
7.    Description. NWRADP II comprised the following activities: (a) expansion of the present soil
and water conservation works onto 25,000 ha of accessible cultivable farmland in the region and a pilot
watershed program based on selected catchments; (b) provision for, and expansion of, advisory services
to all dry land farmers in the project area; (c) the improvement and operation of the adaptive research
facilities of the Aburin rainfed crops experimental farm; (d) the development of an additional new 50
small irrigated one-hectare farms; (e) the provision for, and expansion of, advisory services to existing
and newly developed small irrigated farms; (f) the establishment and operation of a new site for irrigated
adaptive research; (g) the establishment of 100 human water points and 50 livestock water yards using
boreholes equipped with hand pumps wherever possible; (h) the provision of annual farm inputs, ox-
drawn farm implements and irrigation equipment in conjunction with the private sector and also where
medium term credit was required with the Somali Development Bank; (i) the provision of technical
services and training; (j) the continuation of support to the Project Management Unit (PMU), and; (k)
the continuation of financial support to a pilot research program and preparation of the semi-mechanized
rainfed agricultural development at Kurtun Waarey and Sablaale.
8.    In 1990 it was decided by the Bank and GOS to add another component to support the preparation
of a National Environment Action Plan (NEAP).
9.    Total project costs over a five-year period, were estimated at US$ 25.6 million. The IDA-
approved credit for US$ 10.6 million was to fund 42 percent of these costs, while IFAD, EC and the
GOS were to contribute US$ 7.0 million (27 percent), US$ 5.4 million (21 percent), and US$2.6 million
(10 percent) respectively.
10.   Project funds were expected to be invested in rainfed agriculture components (47 percent of base
costs), irrigated components (14 percent), farm input and equipment supply components (17 percent) and



- 3 -
support to the PMU (12 percent). The balance of the base costs was to be utilized for water points (3
percent), training (4 percent) and semi-mechanized rainfed agricultural development (3 percent)
components.
Project Design and Organization
11.   A fundamental flaw of the project was that it was based on the belief that NWRADP I was a
success. Although a project completion report had not been done at the time, the preliminary judgement
was that NWRADP I was successful because project data on yields indicated significant increases and the
actual bunding achieved was much higher than appraisal estimates. However, when a completion report
was finally issued in June, 1992, it concluded that project results were inconclusive. An economic rate
of return could not be calculated because of conflicting crop data from project management and consultant
surveys. The second phase project was aware of the lack of data on crop production and included support
for monitoring and evaluation of crop yields.
12.   Another lesson drawn from the first project was the finding of a 1982 consultant survey which
showed that the effectiveness of bunding varied for different terrain. It found that bunding was most
effective on lowland areas but not in areas with less than 3 percent slope. Since lowland areas account
for only some 16 percent of the project area, the consultants expressed doubts over the widespread
construction of bunds. In their view, other soil conservation and water harvesting measures would have
an impact on crop production at least as significant as pure bund construction. NWRADP II took this
into account by expanding soil and water conservation works to include terracing and contour hedging
as well as bunding. A pilot watershed management program was also introduced to deal with the ecology
of an entire area.
13.   Project implementation arrangements were also similar to those of NWRADP I. A PMU
established under the first project was to continue to implement the second one. It was a unit separate
from the existing government structure, and was headed by a Somali General Manager supported by an
expatriate technical assistance team. While this arrangement facilitated project implementation in the
short-term as consultants were hired whenever there was a skills deficiency, it did not contribute to
longer-term institution building. NWRADP II recognized the importance of a gradual transfer of the
various services, such as extension, research and input supply, to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).
The integration of PMU services within existing national institutions was to be considered at the mid-term
review. However, with the escalation of armed conflict, this institution-building mechanism could not
be tested out.
14.   Security had been an ongoing problem for many years in the Northwest Region. The appraisal
mission was fully aware of it, but since NWRADP was successfully implemented despite the security
problems, it was considered an acceptable risk. The SAR discussion on project risks focused on the
provision of salary incentives, housing and other benefits to reduce hardships to project staff. The full-
scale outbreak of civil war in the area in June 1988 could not have been foreseen at the time of appraisal
although security was recognized as an ongoing risk.
Project Implementation
15.   The IDA credit for the project was approved in January 1985 and became effective in July 1985,
one month after the NWRADP I closed. The project had a good start. The overall implementation



- 4 -
during the first year was on schedule and efficient. By September 1986, 4,159 ha had been bunded, 17
percent of the target. Four water points for human and 12 for livestock were completed, and 12 were
under construction. Preliminary designs for civil works were submitted to and agreed by the donors.
Most machinery and equipment were on order and some were ready for shipment. All aspects of the
project were proceeding as foreseen at appraisal.
16.   The situation deteriorated during 1987 because of a decline in the dedication and capacity of
project management. Without notifying IDA and IFAD, GOS replaced the PMU general manager in May
1987 with a person who did not have the technical competence and experience required for his position.
As a consequence, implementation during the remainder of 1987 was unsatisfactory. Actions agreed with
the Bank mission were either ignored or delayed. Little progress was made on the Pilot Watershed
Management component. Building and training programs were behind schedule. The standard of field
supervision by PMU deteriorated. Moreover, seven vehicles purchased under the project were missing.
Simultaneously, the working conditions in the project area began to deteriorate as a result of the
aggravating political and social unrest, leading to a high turnover of project staff. Attempts to retain staff
by offering salary and other incentives failed.
17.   In mid-1988, fighting erupted between the opposition and government troops in Hargeisa, the
regional capital. PMU staff were evacuated to Mogadishu, and all field activities stopped. GOS held
a review of the project and submitted to the Bank an action plan for continuing some project activities
in the Awdal region, where security was better. A Bank supervision mission found the action plan
impracticable and recommended that project activities be confined to: (i) resolving issues resulting from
the forced suspension of contracts; (ii) the preparation and implementation of the external training
program as identified in the SAR; (iii) restarting some limited activities on a small scale, with local
resources in the Awdal region which would also serve to maintain a presence of the project in the north
and facilitate the assembly of scattered staff and equipment; (iv) providing financing to meet the
remaining contractual financial commitments, financial obligations resulting from the cancellation of these
contracts, the services of the financial controller, external training, and urgently needed repairs and spare
parts for the limited operation in the Awdal Region; (v) the preparation by the financial controller of a
detailed and specific list of items for IDA/IFAD financing which would follow the above principles.
18.    When the security in the northwest did not improve, the Ministry of Finance requested the Bank
to terminate the project in December 1990, six months before the official closing date of June 30, 1991.
Steps needed to recover the special account and pending expenditures from the IDA credit and IFAD loan
were agreed with the Bank. However, shortly afterwards, the civil war spread to Mogadishu. With the
overthrow of the Government in early 1991 and the country's inability to service its debt, IDA suspended
all ongoing credits to Somalia on March 15, 1991, including NWRADP II. However, since the special
accounts were not reconciled, the credit accounts could not be closed.
19.    The final project costs cannot be estimated due to a lack of data on GOS financing. IDA
disbursement was US$6.3 million, 59 percent of the credit amount. IFAD disbursement was US$4.6
million, 66 percent of the loan amount. EEC disbursement was about US$2.0 million, 37 percent of the
grant allocation. Data in the Bank's files showed the physical achievement of each component as follows.
20.   Rainfed component. The initial targets for aerial photography and detailed mapping, financed
under the PPF, were respectively exceeded. Based on extensive discussions during supervision missions,
the Bank and project management reached agreement on substantial issues of bunding, including their



- 5 -
location and design. By the end of 1987, about 65 percent of the appraisal targets for bunding were met.
21.   In 1987, a Bank supervision mission observed the increasing extent of bunded but uncultivated
land. No agronomic causes could be found at the time to justify fallow on bunded land. The mission
suggested the M & E consultant find out the scope of the land involved, from which GOS could decide
whether to engage a social anthropologist to determine the real causes of fallow.
22.   Equipment and vehicles to be provided under the project were fully procured, but little data was
available on the expansion of dryland farming extension and research. Extension was handicapped by
lack of staff mobility and housing problems. There were not many extension activities till mid-1987.
23.   Irrigated component. Seventy-five new one hectare irrigated gardens were developed and an
equal number of them rehabilitated, exceeding appraisal targets of 50 in each case. It is not known
whether the horticultural extension service was expanded to five teams as indicated in the appraisal report.
Eighty ha of land was developed at Baki for the new horticultural research farm as against an appraisal
estimate of 30 ha only, but the construction of housing, storage facilities and other buildings was not
completed.
24.   Water Points. The construction cost of human water points was much higher than appraisal
estimate mostly because of the expenses on waterproofing. The management therefore decided to use
containers to reduce the cost of the waterproofing problem. Five sites were selected for using containers
in 1988. Due to the war, the project could not reach the appraisal target. A total of 23 human water
points were built at completion, 23 percent of the appraisal target.
25.   For livestock water points, siltation control was the major problem at the beginning. Following
the recommendation of the Hydraulics Research Institute, the siltation rate was reduced and so was the
construction cost. The management planned to import vetiveria grass for silt filtration since it was used
successfully in soil conservation projects in other countries. At completion, 15 livestock water points
were finished, representing 30 percent of the target.
26.   Farm inputs and equipment supplies. Input distribution at the beginning was confined to
irrigated areas where management supplied inputs directly to farmers. At the end of 1987, project
management appointed an input supply and marketing specialist to develop the distribution system and
to assist in establishing a new credit system. It was estimated that about 80 percent of the planned
quantities of farm inputs and equipment supplies were procured, but almost three-fourths of the procured
quantities (with the exception of those financed by EC) reportedly did not reach the project area. An
estimated 10 percent of the inputs financed by the EC were either damaged, lost or stolen. From the
quantities procured and supplied to the project area as stated above, it was estimated that about 60 percent
of the needs, as planned at appraisal, for the irrigated area were met.
27.   Training. The project was to provide overseas training for 33 staff. 15 staff were sent for
training. When IDA operations were suspended in 1991, one student financed by the project was still
overseas. Since there was no government authority to submit withdrawal applications to the Bank, the
credit could not be used to finance the completion of his studies. For humanitarian reasons, the Bank
used its own discretionary funds to finance the remainder of his program.
28.   Support to PMU. Vehicles for PMU were procured and house and office furnishings completed.



The use of technical assistance, including short-term consultancies under this as well as under other
components was estimated to be about 50 to 60 percent of the appraisal provision. In early 1989, when
it became clear that field activities could not be resumed, the contracts of all but two consultants were
terminated. The services of the two retained consultants were respectively for the preparation of the
contribution to the mid-term review and for the control of finances.
29.   PMU's monitoring and evaluation capacity was weak. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit was
not functioning effectively during the first two years. Evaluation of results in dryland farming was
critical in deciding the development impact of the project but had been neglected until mid-1987 when
the Bank mission insisted that a yield survey should be carried out. A monitoring and evaluation expert
was hired to devise tests. The survey revealed no significant difference in sorghum yields between
bunded and unbunded fields in the 1987 Gu season. Project management planned to repeat the survey
in 1988 using the identical methodology so as to obtain comparable data under different rainfall
conditions. However, this was overtaken by the civil war. The economic justification of the investment
for the bunds construction, a major part of the project, was therefore not verified. The belief that
bunding improved yields was based on the sustained demand for bunding and project recordings.
However, there was increasing evidence that a reason for the high demand for bunding was that farmers
felt they were gaining the right to land tenure by participating in the project.
30.   Other components. Funds allocated for semi-mechanized rainfed agricultural development were
fully disbursed. The National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) was prepared. The first drafts of the
task force report were scheduled to be submitted by the end of 1990. This did not happen due to the civil
war, but a report was prepared by a group of about ten task force members in July 1991 in Nairobi.
31.    Cost Recovery. Down payment made by farmers prior to the bunding of their fields was
satisfactory. But subsequent collection by the Treasury Department of GOS was much delayed. Till the
end of 1987, six months after the amount had been due and payable, the collection work had not started.
The partial recovery was an improvement over the first project, which did not recover any costs.
Project Results
32.   The project was not completed because of the civil war. In the absence of production and other
data, no conclusion can be made on the appropriateness of the project interventions in terms of technology
and institution-building. However, the importance of the project to the development of the area
throughout the 1980s was important in that it undoubtedly provided impetus to agricultural activity in the
northwest of Somalia.
33.   The study of government recurrent expenditures, geared to help the GOS overcome recurrent cost
problems through appropriate reforms in the budgeting and planning process, was not carried out. Also,
the terms of reference for the feasibility studies on watershed control and small scale irrigation
development, both financed under PPF, were inadequately prepared to ensure the required quality of
work.
Project Sustainability
34.   The question of project sustainability remains unanswered since most of the project actions were
interrupted. Cost recovery was started but was incomplete. The extent of the damage to project works

is not known.
Bank Performance
35.   The Bank's performance until the emergence of serious security problems was generally
satisfactory. Since the evacuation from Hargeisa in mid-1988, it had concentrated on finding workable
solutions to minimize project implementation problems and to wind down project activities. When the
Government was overthrown in early 1991, most contractual issues had been resolved. The other IDA-
financed Somali projects that did not go through this winding down period resulted in a number of
contractor's claims. However, there was not sufficient time to reconcile the special account and the credit
account could not be closed.
Borrower's Performance
36.   GOS replaced the general manager without notifying the Bank. From then on, implementation
progress declined because the new PMU head was not qualified for the job. The PMU's performance
was further weakened by the civil war. However, the dedication of the staff was remarkable in spite of
the difficult conditions. Other deficiencies in the Borrower's performance included inadequate allocation
of counterpart funding, failure to audit accounts on time (the 1985/86 account was not audited till the end
of 1987) and the impressment of project vehicles for purposes unrelated to the project.
Project Relationship
37.   The Bank maintained good relationship with GOS and PMU staff through its resident mission.
The Bank's and the Borrower's relationship with other relevant parties, such as IFAD, EC and
consultants were generally satisfactory.
Consulting Services
38.   Under the PPF, consultants carried out: i) an aerial photography/topography mapping; and ii) a
watershed management plan/irrigated garden development plan. The performance of the consultants on
aerial photography/topography was satisfactory. The recommendations of the watershed/irrigated garden
development plan, however, appeared unrealistically sophisticated in the Somali context and far too costly
for implementation.
39.   The performance of technical assistance consultants was generally satisfactory. Monitoring and
evaluation had a good start but could not be completed. Architects satisfactorily assisted the PMU with
building procedures until construction activities stopped. Services of a hydraulics research institute were
successfully used in improving the design of water points.
Project Documentation and Data
40.   Project files at Bank Headquarters revealed that the information relating to the IDA credit and
the IFAD co-financing was satisfactory but the files contained little to no evidence on coordination of
project matters with the EC. Some of the monthly, quarterly and annual progress reports were missing
from the files.

Lessons Learned
41.    The main lessons are as follows:
a.     Before launching an expanded second phase project, there should be an objective
evaluation of the results of the first phase. The Bank should resist pressures to rush
prematurely into financing a follow on project;
b.     Given the deficiency in monitoring and evaluation in the first project, a yield survey
should have been one of the first priorities. However, this was not done until the third
project year.
c.     Once a project is seriously jeopardized, orderly resolution of issues resulting from the
curtailment of contracts should proceed immediately, as occurred in this case. Other
winding down activities, such as recovery of the initial deposit of the special account
should also be initiated.

Note:    Under the 'Semi-Mechanised Agricultural Development' component, the project provided a lump sum of USS 600,000 to enable the
Ministry of Agriculture to continue with the program of testing semi-mechanised rainfed technology. In addition, by mutual agreement
between WB and Government, it was decided in 1990 that the project should support the preparation of a 'National Environment
Action Plan'.
