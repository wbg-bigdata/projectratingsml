IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Enterprise Development
Project (EDP) for which Credit 1975-GM in the amount of SDR 7.3 million (US$10 million
equivalent) was approved on December 22, 1988. and made effective on April 27, 1989 The
Borrower's right to make withdrawals under the Credit was suspended on December 15, 1994 after
the Borrower failed to refund the amount of US$97,562 disbursed under the Credit for
expenditures not supported by adequate documentation. The Credit was closed on July 10, 1996,
nearly two years ahead of the original closing date (June 30, 1998). The final disbursement was
made on July 9, 1996, following which an amount of SDR 1,168,149.96 (US$ 1,698,174.64
equivalent) was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Mrs. Sherri Archondo and Mr. Pierre Morin, Industry and
Energy Division, Western Africa Department, Africa Region. It was reviewed by Mrs. Silvia B.
Sagarn, Division Chief, Mr. H. Harald Burmeister, Portfolio Manager, and Mr. Emmerich M.
Schebeck, Operations Adviser.
Preparation of the ICR began during the Bank's completion mission, October 27 to
November 4, 1995. It is based on materials in the Project file, including the Staff Appraisal
Report, Memorandum of the President, Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports,
progress reviews and monitoring reports by the Borrower. The Borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by participating in the ICR mission and commenting on the draft ICR. The
Borrower did not prepare its own evaluation of the Project.

Backaround
i.    In 1985, the Government of The Gambia (GOG) embarked on a comprehensive Economic
Recovery Program (ERP) which was supported by two IDA Structural Adjustment Credits (SAC I
and SAC II). Several liberalization measures were undertaken. One of these was improved
management of the public sector, targeting especially reform of the Public Enterprise (PE) Sector
and restructuring of the Gambia Commercial Development Bank (GCDB). To complement the
ERP, the GOG reviewed the investment code, simplified its administration, and streamlined
company registration procedures. As a result, existing biases against the private sector were
removed and small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) obtained better prospects for
development. The GOG also adopted a general strategy on parastatal divestiture and initiated the
divestiture program. The Enterprise Development Project (EDP), supported by IDA, was designed
to enhance the role of two major actors in the country's investment and growth process: SMEs, a
sector with high growth potential, and the banking system. EDP was to provide, over a ten-year
period, an integrated package of financial resources, training, and technical assistance (TA) to
reduce the size of the PE sector, improve the health of the financial sector, and promote the
development of SMEs.



Proiect Obiectives               ii
The EDP had four principal objectives: (i) enhance the role of the private sector in the economy
thereby generating employment and nurturing the development of Gambian entrepreneurs; (ii)
improve the performance of the largest bank, the Gambia Commercial and Development Bank
(GCDB), and increase the participation of financial intermediaries in the financing of private
enterprises; (iii) continue the PE reform program; and (iv) develop the capacity of banks and SME
support institutions to prepare, appraise, and supervise SME projects, and provide extension
services to SMEs. The Project also addressed the needs of women entrepreneurs and facilitated
their access to credit. These objectives were to be achieved through three project components: (a) a
human resources development component, provided through local institutions, for SMEs and women
entrepreneurs on technical matters and project preparation and management; for Government
agencies responsible for administering the new investment code; and for participating commercial
banks in project preparation and appraisal. This component was to enable the GOG to implement
the restructuring of GCDB and provide training to GCDB's staff; (b) a line of credit (LOC) for
financing SME investment projects; and (c) a PE reform component to support the Borrower's
ongoing PE reforms.
iii.    Project objectives were clear, but overly ambitious. The EDP was aimed to address too
many problems, all equally important, and had a negligible impact on enhancing the role of the
private sector, on generating employment, and on nurturing the development of entrepreneurs.
Implementation Experience and Results
iv.    The Project achieved some of its objectives. It supported the liquidation of the GCDB and
the privatization of four PEs. It helped implement performance contracts in four PEs, and
supported the Gambia Women's Finance Association (GWFA) in its micro-credit extension to
nearly 250 women entrepreneurs. EDP also assisted MDI to provide training to nearly 200
persons, mostly civil servants, and provided funds to build 15 classrooms and a library.
v.     The EDP did not (i) contribute to increasing private sector participation in the economy
and thereby generate employment; (ii) assist the development of Gambian entrepreneurs; (iii)
improve the performance of commercial banks/financial intermediaries in the financing of private
enterprises or strengthen the capacity of banks and other institutions to prepare, appraise, and
supervise SME projects and provide extension services to SMEs. The restructuring of the GCDB
made very little progress due to the lack of GOG commitment. It took concerted efforts by major
donors to convince the GOG to privatize the GCDB. The LOC was not utilized and was canceled
in March 1993. After the PE reform component had been successfully executed and LOC was
canceled, the Project, left with only the human resources development component, lost focus and
momentum. The financial management of EDP was a source of concern almost from the
beginning; ineligible expenditures were made as well as disbursements for inadequately supported
expenditures. Audit reports were qualified and consistently late. This resulted in the suspension of
disbursements in December 1994. For these reasons, achievement of EDP's objectives was
negligible and project outcome is considered unsatisfactory.
vi.    An important factor that affected project implementation from the start was the difference
in views and perceptions between the Government and the Bank on project activities. The EDP
was prepared during implementation of SAC II and, at the time, the GOG viewed the Project as an
additional source of support for the implementation of SAC II. Soon after effectiveness, however,
the Government realized that the EDP would cover its needs only partially and presented numerous
requests to undertake activities not envisioned in the scope of the Project. The Bank insisted that
the EDP focus on the agreed development objectives.  This created tensions between the



Government and the Bank which lasted for the duration of the Project. When it became apparent
that the Project faced serious problems, substantial efforts were made by both parties to restructure
the Project, but without success.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations. and Key Lessons Learned
vii.   The sustainability of EDP's very limited achievements is uncertain. The benefits of
training were significant for GWFA but the long-term viability of this Association is uncertain.
The companies divested by the GOG may be viable in the future, but improved management will
be sustained only if there is continuing management commitment and effort to do so. Lack of
Borrower commitment, deficiencies in project preparation, and loose, ineffective Project
management arrangements had a substantial negative effect on project outcomes.
viii.   Two important lessons can be learned from the EDP experience for project design and
implementation. The first lesson is that projects should be well-targeted, with clearly stated
objectives supported by relevant activities to achieve them. If a project has many objectives, they
should be prioritized. The EDP had too many objectives (i.e., development of the private sector,
improvement of the financial sector, and reduction of the PE sector), all equally important. Some
objectives were not supported by investments to assure that they could be achieved. The limited
success that EDP did have (e.g., the PE reform) was because of the sharp focus of objectives and
activities that were clearly defined.
ix.    The second lesson is that project implementation and management arrangements should be
carefully defined even if a project appears to be relatively simple and easy to execute. The
appraisal of the EDP assumed that TA, training, and a LOC would suffice to achieve project
objectives. For example, commercial banks were not involved in the analysis of their training
needs and, as a result, they did not participate fully in the Project's training programs. Similarly,
the need for a LOC was not fully assessed; since there was no demand for financing of new SME
investments, it was canceled. Finally, the appraisal did not take into account that a project such as
the EDP, with many beneficiaries required a competent and well-staffed management structure to
ensure an adequate level of supervision, monitoring, and follow up.

REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. BACKGROUND
1.    In 1985, the Government of The Gambia (GOG) embarked on a comprehensive Economic
Recovery Program (ERP) which was supported by two IDA Structural Adjustment Credits (SAC I
and SAC II). Under the ERP, the GOG introduced a floating exchange rate, abolished price
controls, liberalized interest rates, and adopted a divestiture program to reduce the size of the
Public Enterprise (PE) sector. These reforms, together with the revision of the investment code and
its administration process, streamlining of company registration procedures, and lifting of import
and export controls, remnoved several policy and administrative biases against private small- and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs) and significantly improved their prospects for development.
2.           As a result, the private sector was booming. In 1988, formal and informal SMEs
accounted for about 50% of GDP. Formal SMEs were active mainly in trading and other services,
tourism, construction, and fisheries, and provided about half of the employment in these sectors.
Informal establishments, which accounted for a large part of the private sector, were significant in
generating income and employment, especially for women. Despite ERP's main achievement of
improved macroeconomic environment, with easy convertibility of the Dalasi and market-
determined interest rates, the shortage of money for term lending for productive investments in the
private sector persisted. In addition, the commercial banks' limited capacity to appraise and
supervise investment projects and the shortage of technical and managerial skills among SMEs
were perceived by the GOG as major obstacles to private sector development. The GOG decided
to take further measures, primarily in PE reform and privatization and in the financial sector, to
create conditions favorable to private sector development and improve the viability of SMEs. The
IDA-assisted Enterprise Development Project (EDP) was designed to enhance the role of two major
actors in the country's investment and growth process: SMEs, a sector with high growth potential,
and the banking system. EDP was to provide, over a ten-year period, an integrated package of
financial resources, training, and technical assistance (TA) to reduce the size of the PE sector,
improve the health of the financial sector, and promote the development of SMEs.
B. STATEMENTIEVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
3.    The EDP had four principal objectives and one targeted objective:
(i) enhance the role of the private sector in the economy thereby generating employment
and nurturing the development of Gambian entrepreneurs;



2
(ii)  improve the performance of the largest bank, the Gambia Commercial and
Development Bank (GCDB), and increase the participation of financial intermediaries in
the financing of private enterprises;
(iii) continue the PE reform program;
(iv) develop the capacity of banks and SME support institutions to prepare, appraise, and
supervise SME projects and to provide extension services to SMEs.
The project would also start addressing the assistance needs of women entrepreneurs and
facilitate their access to credit (targeted objective).
4.    These objectives were to be achieved through three project components:
(a) a human resources development component (US$2.67 million) carried out through
local institutions, to provide support for SMEs and women entrepreneurs in technical
matters and project preparation and management; training for staff in Government
agencies responsible for administering the new investment code; and training also for
participating commercial bank's staff in project preparation and appraisal.  This
component was also to enable the GOG to restructure the GCDB and provide training to
GCDB's staff.
(b) a line of credit or LOC (US$5.0 million) in the Apex unit at the Central Bank of The
Gambia (CBG) to finance SME investment projects; and
(c) a PE reform component (US$1.18 million) to support the Borrower's ongoing PE
reforms through (i) TA to the National Investment Board (NIB), an independent
Government body, to strengthen its role in monitoring PEs and the PE divestiture
program, and implementation and supervision of performance contracts; and (ii)
improvement in corporate planning and management in selected PEs.
5.    Project objectives were clear, but they were overly ambitious since the EDP was aimed to
address numerous problems, all equally important. Project objectives were appropriate and
consistent with the GOG's efforts to stimulate economic growth and increase employment while
limiting the short-term negative socioeconomic impacts of adjustment on the population. They
supported IDA's policy-based lending in The Gambia by encouraging changes and reforms to
stimulate private sector growth and reduce the drain of PEs on public finances.
6.    EDP was not inherently demanding on the GOG, although it required steadfast
commitment to carry out the divestiture of GCDB and of the 18 PEs slated for privatization. The
Project was complex because it targeted many beneficiaries including several institutions in the
public and private sectors, and required effective coordination and interaction among several
players that is often fraught with mutual distrust but also high expectations. The Project faced
many risks, some of which were properly assessed. However, the most important risks that did
materialize during implementation had not been properly assessed. These were that: no new
investment projects would develop, despite the availability of financing, training, and technical
assistance; that the Management Development Institute (MDI) would not have the capacity to
develop private-sector oriented programs; and that the implementing agency would not be able to
coordinate Project activities because of its loose arrangement, lack of management capacity and the
sizable number of beneficiaries involved.

C. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
7.     Achievement of EDP's objectives was negligible. The EDP failed to promote significantly
the development of SMEs and thereby generate employment, to reduce substantially the size of the
PE sector and improve its performance, or to improve the health of the financial sector. The most
noteworthy achievements of EDP were: (i) training of 240 persons in customer relations (95
commercial bank staff); entrepreneurship (55 persons); human resources development (50 civil
servants and persons from the private sector); and corporate planning (25 persons); and the
construction of 15 classrooms and a library at MDI, which are being used primarily by civil
servants and PE employees;(ii) the privatization of four PEs, which reduced the burden on public
funds, especially on the part of the GCDB; and preparation of performance contracts for four
utility companies; and (iii) the evolution of the GWFA to its current stature and competence to
manage a portfolio of 200 loans; in this respect, the EDP effectively addressed the training and TA
needs of women entrepreneurs and facilitated their access to institutional credit.  But these
achievements were far short of EDP's promising expectations. Following is an assessment of each
of EDP's components in achieving the objectives.
(i)    Human Resources Development
Achievement in this area was negligible.
8.     MDI accessed EDP funds to offer nine courses on project planning and management,
targeting the NIB and GWFA staff. No specific programs were developed for the Indigenous
Business Advisory Service (IBAS) or the Industrial Development Unit (IDU) staff, two services in
the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Employment (MTIE), although they may have benefited from
some of the regular programs MDI offered. Neither did MDI develop training programs for the
commercial banks, except in customer relations; the banks had their own in-house training
programs on project appraisal and had no interest in the training offered by MDI. EDP therefore
did not contribute to increasing the commercial banks capacity to appraise and supervise SME
investment projects.
9.     GWFA used EDP funds to deliver its training courses and workshops in basic business
skills and management and to expand the outreach of its micro-credit programs to about 250
women entrepreneurs. GWFA trained some of its Board members in credit management and five
staff members in general management and rural finance Although there was no precise yardstick
to evaluate this training, GWFA's customer service and performance improved markedly. For
example, in 1993, loan application approval took three months and the Board reviewed all
applications. The process now takes one week; the Board reviews loan applications in excess of
5,000 Dalasis (about US$500), a GWFA committee reviews those between D2,000 and D5,000
(US$200-500), and a loan officer makes decisions on those under D2,0001.
10.   Although short- and long-term training abroad was not envisioned under the Project, seven
civil servants (three in IDU and four in NIB) went for short-term training, and six civil servants
Additional Project funds were provided to the GWFA to finance a survey to determine the needs of its
target groups, propose an action plan to meet those needs, develop a credit policy, and to buy vehicles and
computers. The association has a growing loan portfolio and a repayment rate that is impressive by
international standards. Some 88% of loans are paid on time and another 4% are paid within 30 days of
their due date.



4
(one each in IDU, IBAS, and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (MFEA), and three in
NIB) for long-term training. The GOG has expressed its satisfaction with this training.
(ii)    Apex LOC for SMEs
11.   This component was not implemented and was canceled in March 1993. The Apex LOC
was intended to finance the foreign exchange and some local costs of investments made by eligible
SMEs. As originally designed, it was the largest project component representing 54% of the total
project cost. Implementation of the LOC faced difficulties because of a lack of bankable projects,
cumbersome procedures (taking 12-15 months to process a loan request -- initial investment
appraisal by a commercial bank, reappraisal by the CBG, and a review by IDA), and the
availability of alternative, cheaper funds from depositors (an average cost of 8% vs. 13% for the
LOC). These factors led the GOG to request cancellation of the LOC in March 1993. Until then,
only one project for a loan value of US$100,000 had been financed.
(iii)   Public Enterprise Reform
12.    EDP achieved mixed results in the area of PE reform:
Monitoring of the PE sector: Achievement of this objective was negligible. There is no evidence
that the NIB used EDP funds to improve its capacity to monitor the PE sector. The absence of
adequate monitoring and supervision has been a source of concern and the MFEA is taking over
this function. Until now, the GOG has not fully benefited from the expected improvements in the
PE sector since the PEs remaining in the state portfolio refuse to pay their income taxes and
dividends.
Divestiture: The four divestitures supported by EDP amounted to a substantial achievement in the
GOG's PE reform program. EDP was to provide assistance to the NIB to manage the PE reform
program encompassing the divestiture of 18 PEs.2  The EDP along with other donors' projects
contributed to the shrinking of the PE sector to a core group of public utilities. This led to a
reduction in PE borrowings as well as the elimination of budgetary subsidies to the PEs in 1993.
Performance contracts: The preparation of performance contracts and consulting services for
upgrading the management and operations of, and establishing monitorable performance targets
for, four PEs was a substantial achievement of project objectives. These PEs are: the Ganbia
Public Transportation Company (GPTC); the Garnbia Production and Marketing Board (GPMB),
which received US$425,000 of the total US$980,000, and was later privatized; the Gamnbia
Telecommunications Corporation (GAMTEL); and the Social Security, Housing and Finance
Corporation (SSHFC). However, no formal evaluation was made of the likely impact of the
performance contracts on the profitability or management of the targeted companies. The GOG is
encouraged do this evaluation.
Improvements in selected PEs: Achievement of this objective was negligible. There is no evidence
that EDP financed any activities in this area. TA was provided to some PEs before their
2 The other 14 divestitures were financed by SAC II and other donors' funds: US Agency for
International Development, UK Overseas Development Administration, and the European Union.
Divestiture operations included 11 total sales: two sales of minority shareholdings, three lease agreements,
and one partial privatization. One additional PE put up for sale received no offers. The three lease
agreements were nullified following the change in Government in July 1994.

privatization, and some improvements in their management and financial operations may have
resulted from the preparation and implementation of performance contracts.
13.   The NIB accessed EDP funds to organize seminars on human resources management,
corporate planning, and management; to participate in International Investment Promotion
seminars and conferences; and to prepare publicity/advertising materials with a view of promoting
foreign investments in the Gambia.
D. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Most of the factors affecting the EDP were under the shared control of the GOG and the
Bank.
14.   The first factor that substantially affected the Project from the very beginning was that its
objectives were too broad. The GOG and IDA had rather different views and perceptions of the
purpose of EDP. The Project was prepared during implementation of SAC 11 and, at that time, the
GOG saw EDP primarily as providing additional resources for implementing SAC II. Soon after
Credit effectiveness, the GOG realized that EDP would cover its needs only partially. Despite
numerous GOG requests to undertake activities not envisioned in the project, IDA insisted that
EDP implementation continue to be focused on the agreed upon development objectives. This
disagreement raised tensions between the Government and IDA that lasted throughout EDP's
implementation. Misunderstanding could have been avoided if EDP objectives had been more
focused and an execution plan prepared and agreed upon early.
The second factor that substantially affected the EDP was the quality of project
preparation which led to a poor design of both the project components and the management
arrangements.
(i) While the EDP included specific measures to improve GCDB's performance, continue
the PE reform program, and develop the capacity of banks and SME support institutions to
prepare and appraise SME projects, it had no activities or means to enhance the role of the
private sector and increase the participation of financial intermediaries in the financing of
SMEs.
(ii) In addition, the GCDB rehabilitation subcomponent was not well-designed because of
weak analysis. The lack of GOG's political will to deal with GCDB's non-perfbrming
portfolio3 was not properly assessed. It was well-known in the Bank that the GCDB was
not viable and it should have been decided that GCDB could not be privatized and had to
be liquidated instead.
(iii) The absence of an early assessment of the number of bankable SME projects that
lacked term-financing would have raised doubt about the need to create the LOC that, in
effect, was virtually unused.
(iv) The interest of intended beneficiaries was not adequately evaluated. The lack of
interest on the part of commercial banks and other financial intermediaries to use funds
available through the EDP to make loans to SMEs was nearly universal, with the
3   Project Completion Report on SAC II (Credit 2032-GM), dated April 22, 1994, page vi.

exception of the GWFA. Interest was also lacking in the other GOG services, such as
training, provided under EDP; the targeted project beneficiaries, such as IBAS and IDU,
used the resources only for foreign training. These factors should have been identified
during project preparation and incorporated into the Project design.
(v) EDP's management arrangements were extremely loose. The Project was to be
implemented by a Coordination Committee (CC) headed by the Permanent Secretary in the
MFEA. Day-to-day management was entrusted to a civil servant in the MFEA who was to
devote only part of his time to this task. The absence of a full-time Project manager, at
least in the early stage of the Project, resulted in the lack of coordination among the
various beneficiaries and jeopardized project success. As a result, some project activities
were not carried out, for example, the improvement of financial intermediation in areas
outside of Banjul and training of GOG agencies' staff (IBAS and IDU). Serious problems
that arose in EDP's financial management were either undetected or left unresolved.
Without effective management to oversee implementation, and an implementation schedule
or performance indicators among the comprehensive legal covenants that would serve as a
yardstick to measure achievements and progress, EDP could not have achieved success.
E. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
15.   The sustainability of EDP's limited achievements is uncertain. Benefits resulting from (a)
the human resources development component, primarily training, may have some long-term effects,
possibly for the GWFA. However, GWFA's viability is uncertain; even though it is projected to
break-even by the year 2002, at this time there are no assurances that financing will be available to
cover its yearly operational budget of D800,000 (about US$8,000). Foreign training provided to
civil servants in IBAS and IDU may also have long-term effects if those trained are employed in
positions that utilize their skills. MDI physical facilities while upgraded, still lack some essential
equipment (e.g., audio-visual, generator, and air conditioning). MDI continues to target the public
sector in its training programs and depends exclusively on the State budget; no mechanism has
been devised to ensure cost recovery for its programs. (b) PE reform component: All the
companies targeted for divestiture were privatized.  In principle, these achievements are
sustainable. But in three cases, the leasing agreements that had been made were subsequently
canceled, which again raised doubts about the Borrower's commitment to the reforms.
Improvement in the management of selected PEs, if it happened at all, is sustainable only if there is
a continuing management commitment and effort to sustain it.
F. BANK PERFORMANCE
16.    Bank performance in project identification was satisfactory.  The Bank attempted to
satisfy the GOG's objective of increasing the role of the SMEs and the banking sector in the
economy. The need to provide an integrated package of resources to enhance the role of the SMEs
and build on the reforms made through SAC II was clearly identified.
17.    Bank performance in project preparation and appraisal was unsatisfactory. The Bank did
not draw GOG's attention to the need to have a limited number of objectives, well-supported by
components that include appropriate and relevant activities. Nor did it draw GOG's attention to the
necessity of an execution plan and performance indicators to monitor progress in implementation.
The training needs and the willingness of each of the beneficiaries to use EDP funds and to
cooperate among themselves was poorly assessed. For example, the risk of the GCDB failing to



7
implement its rehabilitation program was not well assessed. Given the poor financial and
administrative state of the GCDB, project appraisal should have focused on its immediate
liquidation rather than restructuring. The Bank was deficient in not following up on its own
analysis of GCDB's condition that had concluded that liquidation was unavoidable. Time and
resources that were spent on studies of the GCDB could have been saved. No assessment was
made of the number, size, and other characteristics of potential, bankable SME projects to be
financed through the LOC. In addition, no follow-up assessment was made of SME credit needs to
ensure that setting-up the LOC was still warranted at the time of Board approval. At Credit
effectiveness, the liquidity of the commercial banks was such that the LOC was redundant. The
appraisal of the proposed Project management arrangement and the capacity of the Borrower and
implementing agency to execute the Project was also deficient. All these factors contributed to the
Project's poor outcome.
18.   Bank supervision of EDP was deficient. The Bank devoted, on average, 11 staff weeks
per year for supervise the EDP, or a total of nine supervision missions during over a six-year
period. Early in the Project, liquidation of the GCDB and the status of the LOC became serious
center stage issues that detracted attention from the fact that the EDP was not meeting its
objectives of job creation and nurturing the development of Gambian entrepreneurs. It was not
until November 1993, almost eight months after the LOC was canceled, that the Bank realized that
as a result of this cancellation, EDP had lost its focus and momentum and needed to be
restructured or canceled. The Bank devoted substantial resources to support GOG's efforts to
revive the EDP. Discussions were intense and difficult; disagreements with the GOG could not be
resolved. The Bank felt that the undisbursed portion of the credit should be devoted exclusively to
development activities. The differences in perception of the Project's objectives between the Bank
and the Borrower as well as within the Bank contributed to making supervision cumbersome and
ineffective.
G. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
19.    Borrower performance was generally unsatisfactory during project preparation and
appraisal. Project beneficiaries were not sufficiently involved in the project preparation. The
GOG had no strategic plan nor a clear policy for private sector development or for improving
financial intermediation and credit delivery in the country. A more in-depth analysis of the
financial system would have indicated that some of the project components, such as the LOC, were
not needed.
20.   The Borrower's performance during project implementation was also unsatisfactory.
Because there had been no implementation plan, it proved difficult to pursue project objectives
purposefully. For example, in November 1989, 18 months after Credit effectiveness, GOG's
reluctance to privatize the GCDB, became a serious implementation issue that was resolved under
donors' concerted pressure. It was only in 1992 that the issue of the LOC was raised; it had
scarcely been accessed and was finally canceled in March 1993. After the cancellation of the
LOC, the Government started to carry out activities that were not envisioned in the scope of the
EDP, such as closing the accounts of Gambia Utility Company (GUC), a study on the insurance
sector, and long-term-training of a Ministry of Finance official. The performance of the GOG
during the discussions on EDP restructuring was also unsatisfactory. This, among several other
implementation problems, led to the mutual decision by the Bank and the Borrower to cancel the
EDP Credit in September 1995.



8
21.    EDP's financial management was highly unsatisfactory. The GOG furnished IDA with
the required audits for the periods ending December 1993, 1994, and 1995 but they were all
qualified and consistently late. Audit reports for 1992 showed the lack of proper accounting
systems, inadequate records, and insufficient supporting evidence for expenditures. Audit reports
for 1993 indicated that the problems had persisted and that additional expenditures were made with
insufficient supporting evidence.  As a result, in December 1994, the Bank suspended the
Borrower's right to make withdrawals under the Credit which remained in effect until the closing
of the Credit.
H. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
22.    EDP was one of the first operations in the Bank's Western Africa Department focusing on
private sector development. Based on the evaluation of the five objectives, the overall outcome of
the Project is unsatisfactory. This assessment is based on determinations that: (i) EDP did not
directly contribute to increasing employment opportunities or the number of Gambian
entrepreneurs; (ii) participation of financial intermediaries, other than the GWFA, in lending to the
SMEs did not increase and the apex LOC was a failure; (iii) EDP did not help develop the capacity
of the banking sector and support institutions to appraise and supervise SME projects. However
the liquidation of the GCDB put an end to its making loans that would later become a drain on
public finances; and (iv) the training component was only partially used. EDP achieved some
success in privatization and PE reform and in helping women entrepreneurs, but these
achievements were not significant enough to affect the overall judgment of unsatisfactory Project
outcome.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
23.    Two important lessons can be learned from the EDP experience for project design and
implementation.
The first lesson is that projects should be well-targeted, with clearly stated objectives supported by
components and relevant activities to achieve them. If a project has many objectives, they should
be prioritized. The EDP had too many objectives (i.e., development of the private sector,
improvement of the financial sector, and reduction of the PE sector), all equally important. Some
objectives were not supported by investments to assure that they could be achieved. The limited
success that EDP did have (e.g., the PE reform) was because of the sharp focus of objectives and
activities that were clearly defined and could be monitored.
The second lesson is that project implementation and management arrangements should be
carefully defined even if a project appears to be relatively simple and easy to execute. The
appraisal of the EDP assumed that TA, training, and a LOC would suffice to achieve project
objectives. For example, it did not do an adequate analysis of the training needs of commercial
banks and, as a result, these banks did not participate in the Project's training programs.
Similarly, the need for a LOC was not fully assessed; since there was no demand for financing of
new SME investments, it was canceled. Finally, the appraisal did not take into account that a
project such as the EDP, with many beneficiaries, could not rely exclusively on a Coordinating
Committee for timely execution and project success. Nor could the proposed management
structure ensure an adequate level of supervision, monitoring, and follow up.

Preceding operations
Rural and urban enterprises    The main objectives of this Credit were to provide foreign  1978  Completed
project                    exchange resources for financing small- and medium-scale
(Cr. 0814-GAM)             enterprises including those in the rural sector; and to
strengthen the institutional capacity of The Gambia
Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB) so as to
make it a viable development finance institution.
Urban management and       The main objectives of the project were: (a) to strengthen  1984  Completed
development project        the Ministry for Local Government and Lands (MLGL),
(Cr. 1443-GAM)             the Banjul City Council (BCC), the Kanifing Municipal
Council (KMC) and the Social Security and Housing
Finance Corporation (SSHFC), to improve management
and operational efficiency; and (b) to demonstrate the
feasibility of extending basic infrastructure, low-cost and
affordable serviced land and shelter to the bulk of the low-
income population, and generate foreign savings wherever
possible, through the use of indigenous materials.
Simultaneous operation
Structural adjustment      The SAL I program can be divided into two distinct groups  1986  Completed
program                    of actions, the first being addressed to the problem of the
(Cr. 1730-GAM,             over-extended public and parapublic sector, its
CA022-GAM)                 inefficiencies, and its cost to the current and capital
budget; the second group being designed to improve or
reform conditions of growth for the productive sectors of
the economy, especially agriculture, to remove
disincentives for private investment, and to rehabilitate the
banking system.
Following operation
Second structural adjustment  The Credit supported the second phase of the        1989      Completed
credit                     Government's Economic Recovery Program (ERP), an
(Cr. 2032-GAM)             ambitious and far-reaching program of structural reforms.
It was designed to continue and deepen the reforms started
under the first phase of the ERP which were supported by
the First Structural Adjustment Credit (SAL 1).

APPENDICES
A. ICR Mission's Aide-Memoire



22
ICR Mission's Aide-Memoire
A mission comprised of Pierre Morin, PE Specialist visited the Gambia from October 28-November 4,
1995 to begin the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report. Mr. M. Foon, Special Assistant to the
Governor of the Central Bank of the Gambia participated in the mission on behalf of the Government.
A.    Project Objectives
1.    The main objectives of the proposed operation were to: (i) enhance the role of the private sector in the
economy thereby generating employment and nurturing the development of Gambian entrepreneurs; (ii) improve
the performance of the country's largest commercial bank and increase the participation of financial intermediaries
in the financing of private enterprises; (iii) continue the PE reform program; and (iv) develop the capacity of banks
and SME support institutions to prepare, appraise and supervise SME projects and to provide extension services to
SMEs. The project would also address the technical assistance needs of women entrepreneurs and facilitate their
access to credit.
2.    The Project comprised three primary components: (a) the credit component would finance the foreign
exchange and some local costs; (b) the human resources development component would be channeled through
local institutions involved in training and SME promotion; and (c) the public enterprise (PE) reform component
would support the Government's ongoing PE reforms. These components were designed to support Government's
efforts to encourage private initiative, stimulate economic growth, support the reduction of the size of the public
sector and increase employment.
3.    Most of the objectives of the Project have not been achieved or have been only marginally achieved,
although no criteria for judging the Project's output had been appraised in the MOP.
(i)    Apex line of credit to provide financing for SMEs
4.    The credit component would finance the foreign exchange and some local costs. The primary component
of project was the Apex line of credit which comprised approximately 50% of the total credit. This component,
due to lack of interest by the commercial banks was canceled as of March 1, 1993. By the date of cancellation,
only one project which comported a total sum of US$100,000 had been financed. The commercial banks
commented that the facility did not complement their lending objectives, which were largely public sector
oriented, as well as the fact that their formerly constrained liquidity positions had substantially improved. The
credit line was not used for two important reasons: (a) commercial banks maintained excess liquid positions and
used their own funds whenever a viable investment situation arose; and (b) the cost of refinancing through the
Apex line was higher and more cumbersome to administer than using their own funds. The improved liquidity
position in conjunction with the higher real interest rate and the cost of refinancing and administering the line,
constituted justification to cancel this component, which made up more than half of the total project credit.



23
(ii)    Human resources development component
5.    The human resources development component would be provided through: (i) local institutions involved
in training and SME promotion for SMEs and women entrepreneurs on technical matters and project preparation
and management; (ii) Government agencies responsible for administering the new investment code; and (iii)
participating commercial banks in project preparation and appraisal techniques. It would also allow Government
to implement a restructuring program GCDB and provide training to its staff.
6.    Strengthening of local training and extension institutions capabilities to appraise and supervise
development projects was to be largely through assistance to the National Investment Board (NIB) in SME
promotion and the Management Development Institute (MDI). The NIB had developed a comprehensive program
of investment promotion including advertising materials and workshops but had not engaged in extension services
to SMEs as defined within the terms of the Credit Agreement. The MDI had accessed EDP funding for its program
of classroom expansion. GWFA had accessed EDP funds to deliver its own basic training course and its efforts in
microcredit extension and recovery.
7.    Under this component was also included the rehabilitation of the Gambian Commercial Development
Bank (GCDB). The project would finance a diagnostic review of its operations and financial conditions;
strengthen its management and operational capabilities; and design and carry out the rehabilitation program.
Following the diagnostic review, in mid-1992, the GCDB was closed and subsequently liquidated (The bank had
been technically insolvent since 1983 and while several projects had been implemented in an effort to revive the
bank, its condition was not resusitatable). The Meridien-BIAO took over the good portfolio of the bank and an
Asset Management Recovery Corporation, financed by USAID was established to recover bad loans which were
transferred from the GCDB.
(iii)   Public Enterprises Reform
8.    Under this component, the project would assist the National Investment Board (NIB) to manage the
Borrower's public enterprise reform program including: (a) the valuations of holdings and preparation of
prospectuses and information circulars; review of corporate plans and performance contracts; seminars on the
performance of public enterprise reform programs; and (b) assist priority public enterprises to prepare corporate
plans and restructuring programs; and carry out financial  and management audits, improvements in
MIS/accounting and budgeting systems and financial and technical studies
9.    The public enterprise reform component was intended to provide financial assistance to the NIB for
consultancy services, training, PE diagnostic studies and logistic support, as well as assistance to selected private
enterprises for institutional upgrading and management support. The Project contributed to the privatization of
four PEs.
10.   The project also focused on the a need to upgrade their management and operational performance through
management contracts which incorporated monitorable performance targets. Several performance contracts had
been implemented including one on the Gambia Utility Company (GUC); the Gambia Production and Marketing
Board (GPMB) and the Gambia Port Authority (GPA).
11.   With the change in the focus of the original credit resulting from the cancellation of the sub-loan financing
and GCDB components the overall congruity of the project was affected. With the line of credit being canceled
and the liquidation of the GCDB, the amount of available funds was greatly reduced. Disbursements for the
project as June 29, 1995 totaled US$3.1 million approximately one-third of the project commitment.



24
B. Project Sustainability
12.    The benefits of the Project have been minimal and much uncertainty remains whether the little activity
which was undertaken through project financing will be sustainable. The companies targeted for divestiture have
been privatized and the Government has developed the experience to continue its program of divestiture. The
Gambian Commercial Development Bank (GCDB) has been liquidated and the AMRC (a by-product of its
liquidation) has had few successes in collecting bad credit owed to the GCDB; the line of credit which was
established to provide term credit for investment development has been canceled and banks continue to lend on a
short-term basis. Finally, the training component alone remains isolated and weak.
13.   To enhance the sustainability of these achievements, the Government should continue in its efforts on PE
reform, initiated under the ERP . Additionally, Government should seek methods to improve the quality of the
presentation of projects presented to commercial banks for financing. As banks continue to maintain that they are
willing to finance viable medium/long-term projects assistance should be given to entrepreneurs, through private
institutions to help develop project preparation and appraisal skills.
C. Overall Assessment
14       The overall outcome of the Project was unsatisfactory based on the evaluation of the four main
objectives of the project noted above. The assessment is based on the following elements: (i) lack of successful
utilization of the Apex line of credit; (ii) lack of restructuring of the GCDB, although liquidation was probably the
most cost effective approach to the bank's problems and (iii) mediocre utilization of the training component.
15.      The Project preparation was deficient because the needs for the line of credit and the needs of the
numerous beneficiaries were not well assessed. Countries often deem a line of credit to be necessary to increase
investment development, however, often the problem does not rest with the lack of resources, but is a source of
other factors, such as lack of viable (or well prepared) projects. In fact, the commercial banks determined that
there was no demand for term-financing and as a result of the cost of commitment for the credit line drained their
resources, the line of credit was canceled. Being the focal point of the credit, the rest of the credit started to
unwind until it lost focus of the original objectives.
16.      A strong implementing unit is necessary to ensure the success of a project. The implementing unit did
not fulfill its function that the various components of the Project were implemented in a timely and coherent
manner with the objective of translating the promotional and training efforts into viable investment projected
financed under the line of credit. Nor did it fulfill many of functions defined in its terms of references.
