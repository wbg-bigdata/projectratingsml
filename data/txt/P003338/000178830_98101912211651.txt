BURMA
APPRAISAL OF AN IN'AND WATER TRANSPORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
l.        The proposed project, together with a third railway project, will
be the Bank Group's first lending operation in Burma since 1961. Together,
these projects are designed to provide rehabilitation of essential transport
infrastructure which will assist the future development of the Burmese
economy.
ii.       The transport system of the country is dominated by inland water
transport and the railway, both serving the key economic ceaters of Burma
but traver,sing dIfferent terrain in doing so. These two major systems, of
which inland water transport is thp larger, complement each other rather
than compete for traffic. Tne road system, while important in some areas,
is of much less national significance and would require a substantial
investment in both infrastructure and vehicles to attain a major role as
a long-haul mode.
iii.      In all three modes, as well as in the small air transport industry,
state-owned organizations r.re dominant although, in the case of inland water
and road transport, private operators carry a substantial volume of the
traffic, particalarly on short-haul activities.
iv.       The Inland Water Transport Corporation (IWTC), a state-owned
corporation, operates on Burma's major navigable waterways. Cn the Irrawaddy
and its mair. tributary, the Chirndwin, and in the agriculturally rich areas of
the Delta, the Arakan and Moulmein, where inland water transport virtually
remains the only surface mode, the EWTC provides regular passenger and cargo
services. Thus it reaches out to most of the economically important areas
of the country.
v.        )1.- IWTC, while technically an autonomous entity, is controlled by
the Government through the Central Transport Corporation, the Chairman of
which is the Minister of Tr-nsport and Communications.  For all practical
purposes, the IWTC functions as a department of Government, the Managing
Director of the IWTC being responsible for day-to-day operations.
vi.       In the past ten years, largely due to a lack of sufficient foreign
exchange to purchase essential spares, repair materials and modern dockyard
equipment, the IWTC's fleet has suffered through inadequate maintenance,
resulting in poor availability and a substandard level of operating perform-
ance.
vii.      The project, costing an estimated US$24.0 million equivalent,
consists of the last two years of the IWTC's US$25.8 million Investment Plan
(1971/72 - 1974/75) and has a foreign exchange component of about US$16.5
million equivalent. The main items of the project constitute rehabilitation



- ii -
of the fleet through procurement of engines, spare parts and materials
(57x); procurement of vessels on replacement account (15%); rehabilitation
of dockyard facilities through procurement of equ!*ment, machinery and
tools (6%); provision of radio communication equipment and accounting
machines (3%); and technical z3sistance in the fields of management account-
ing and modern welding techniques (1%). Of the proposed Credit (US$16.3 million
equivalent) to be made to the Goverrment, US$15.8 million equivalent would b.2
re-lent to the IWTC and would finance 96% of the IVTC project's foreign ex-
change component (66% of the total). The Ibalance of the foreign exchange
requirement, amounting to about US$0.7 million equivalent, would be provided
from the Government's own resources for ongoing operaticns. Goods would be
procured through international competitive bidding, except for US$1.6 millilon
equivalent of spare parts for various existing engines. The project provides
sufficient funds for constructing six new vescels in foreign shipyards. Con-
siderable savings may be realized if biddel- choose to subcontract assembly
of up to three vessels in a Government-owned dockyard which has the facilities
for this work. In such an event the Credit would be indirectly financing a
small element of local costs estimated at not more than US$0.8 million. The
project would also finance the foreign exchange component (US$0.48 million
equivalent) of the procurement of essential navigational aids and associated
. q;costing about US$0.84 million equivalent) to be used by the Water-
ways Department (WD) in the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC).
viii.     The management of the IWTTC is generally satisfactory.  However,
there is scope for improving operations, particularly through a better manage-
ment information system.  The proposed Credit provides technical assistance
to develop ani implement such a system. While the IWTC has a skilled mainten-
ance staff, maintenance is hampered by insufficient spare parts and obsolete
facilities. The proposed Credit provides for spare parts, materials, and
essential equipment and for technical assistance to introduce modern welding
techniques.
ix.       Agreement has been reached on an earnings covenant designed to ensure
the IWTC's continued financial viability, and other undertakings designed to
achieve improvements in the IWTC's operating efficiency. The Government has
also confirmed that there will be no material change in the IWTC's Investment
Plan without prior consultation with the Associntion.
x.        The project has been found to be technically and economically
justified. The economic return for the project is about 24Z. Financial
results from operations in recent years have been satisfactory and have
en.bled the IWTC to make a reasonable contribution to its capital expenditure.
Forecast results show a decline in profitability during execution of the
project due to heavy defeLred repair and maintenance but in 1976/77 net
revenue should Le restored to a satisfactory level.
xi.       The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit
of US$16.3 mil.ion to the Government of the Union of Burma.



BURMA
APPRAISAL OF AN INLIND WATER TRANSPORT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Union of Burma and the Inland Water Transport
Corporation (IWTC) have asked the Association for a Credit of US$16.3
million equivalent to finance part of the foreign zxchange cost of the last
two years of the IWTC's Investment Plan for 1971/72 - 1974/75 (the Plan),
which, in turn, is part of the first Four-Year Economic Development Plan of
Burma, 1971/72 - 1974/75. The TWTC's investments during these two years are
estimated at K 115.6 million (US$24.0 million equivalent), with a foreign
exchange component of US$16.5 million equivalent. The project is designed
chiefly to replace vessels and engines and to procure spare parts, repair
materials and dockyard equipment. Rehabilitation of the fleet in this manner
would enable it to cope with the forecast traffic on completion of the Plan.
The proposed Credit of US$16.3 million equivalent would be made to the Union
of Burma to be utilized mostly by the IWTC, which is a Government enterprise.
The Credit would finance specific imported goods and would include US$1.6
million for non-competitive procurement of vessel spare parts; foreign
currency requirements for ongoing operations would be covered from the
Government's own foreign exchange resources. The proposed Credit also
includes financing of the forei-n exchange costs of navigational aids (US$0.48
million equivalent) to improve the efficiency of inland water transport.
1.02      This would be the first Bank Croup project in Burma in the inland
water transport sector and, together witlh the proposed Credit for the Burma
Railways Corporation (BRC), the fourch and fifth in the transport sector.
Bank Group lending operations in Burma have so far been limited to the
transport sector. A Loan for the Port of Rangoon in 1956 (Loan 140-BA,
US$14.0 million) helped finance the reconstruction of cargo berths and
storage facilities and the purchase of cargo-handling and floating equipment
for harbor operations. Two Loans (Loan 139-BA, US$5.35 million equivalent,
in 1956, and Loan 274-BA, US$14 million equivalent, in 1961) helped finance
reconstruction and the introduction of dieselization for the railway. All
three projects were satisfactorily completed. The Bank Group resumed
activity in Burma in 1971, and an economic mission visited Burma in the
spring of 1972. '.he proposed projects for the IWTC and the BRC will reintroduce
Bank Group lending in Burma. Other Bank Group assistance to the Burmese
transport sector is expected in the form of a UNDP-financed study ._f the
Port of Rangoon to investigate dredging requirements in the Port and its
access channel. The Bank will act as executing agency for this study and
terms of reference are being prepared.
1.03      This report was prepared on the basis of information supplied by
the Government of the Union of Burma and the IWTC and on the findings of a
January/February 1973 appraisal mission composed of Messrs. Y. Abe (economist),
J. Spencer (financial analyst), J.C. Duvigneau (engineer/economist) and R.Y.



Schemner (consultant-engineer). Two consultants from Lloyd's Register of
Shipping (UK), Messrs. G.A. Stewart and K. van Duffelen, also provided
information.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Burma's economic growth has been very slow; the average annual
increase in gross national product (GNP) has been about 3.67 in the
past five years. The economy depends primarilv on the agricultural and
forestry sectors, and 1972 per capita GNP is estimated at US$70 equivalent.
The country has a low level of internal and external savings, which is
reflected in the low level of investment. As a resut, there has been
inadequate maintenance and poor utilization of the available productive
capacity. The transport sector has been no cxception in this pattern. In
the last several years, there has been a grow,rng awareness at various Govern-
ment levels of the need to improve the situatio'n. Specifically, this is
reflected in the adoption of the current Economic Development Plan (1971/72-
1974/75) and the readiness to seek Bank Group assistance after an interval
of ten years.
B. Transport Sector
2.02      Burma's geography (see Map) is such that over the centuries
economic activities developed along the banks of the River Irrawaddy, its
tributary the Chindwin and the myriads of river-arms of the Irrawaddy Delta.
Thus, historically, inland water transport has been the most important element
of the transport sector. Railway construction, commencing late in the
nineteenth century, resulted in the creation of a second major transport
system linking the key centers of Rangoon and Mandalay, with branch lines
extending north to Myitkina, eastward into the Shan hills and westw.rd to
important towns on the Irrawaddy. However, the railway traverses different
terrain from the inland water system and hence is more complementary ..o
inland water transport than competitive with it. Later, roads were leveloped
which were, to some extent, competitive with both railway and inland water
transport routes but the development of the road system or the road transport
industry has not been emphasized with the exception of certain short- and
medium-haul services. The transportation system is essentially concerned with
moving the agricultural products of the Delta and Central Burma to such major
population and export centers as Rangoon and Bassein as w;ell as the less
fertile regions of Upper Burma. Forest products, minerals and oils move
southward from Central and Upper Burma to the Rangoon area for processing,
redistribution or export.



-3-
2.03      The transport sector has been suffering from a leck of capacity,
due m.:inly to inadequate repair facilities, lack of spare parts and materials
and insufficient procurement of ruplacement items. This has resulted in a
low level of efficiency in the various transport entities.
2.04      No detailed overall traffic data in terms of traffic flows,
passenger-miles and ton-miles rre available. However, according to the
Ministry of Planning and Finance (MOPP), the total volume of freight transport
grew at an average rate of 4% per annum between 1961/62 and 1971/72, reaching
about 44 million tons in the latter year (Table 1). The pattern of traffic
demand has remained stable over the past five years; agriculture, including
livestock, forestry and fisheries, accounts for about 70% of the total, and
mining and industry, 30%. In 1971/72, the MOPF estimated that about 62% of
total freight traffic was short-haul, carried mainly by small inland craft,
22% was medium-haul, and 16% long-haul. About 34% of total long-haul freight
is carried by railway, 30% by inland water transport, 18% by road transport,
and 13% by coastal shipping (see Table 2 for details). 1/ While these figures
cannot be regarded as strictly accurate, they provide a reasonable basis on
which to assess the role of each mode for the future. The i.-iland water
transportation system is described in the next section; the characteristics
of other modes, in Annex 1; traffic growth of the major state-controlled
transport agencies is shown in Table 3.
2.05      Road transport services are provided by the state-controlled Road
Transport Corporation (RTC) created in 1963 and by private operators who
collectively carry about 80% of road freight traffic, mainly short- and
medium-haul. The RTC is having difficulty in maintaining its capacity due to
lack of spare parts, and privately-owned vehicles are over-aged. The total
number of vehicles, including cars and motorcycles, Jas about 54,000 in 1971/72.
The road network covers about 16,000 miles of which 42% is paved, but the
roads are narrow and badly aligned.
2.06      The BRC operates a railway system composed of a main line from
Rangootn to Mandalay (385 mi) and ten branchlines, with a total of 1,949
route-miles. The tracks are generally in good condition; however, since
rolling stock and motive power are to a large extent over-aged and poorly
maintained due to a lack of spares and repair shop capacity, a major rehabili-
tation of equireent is called for. The proposed IDA Credit for the BRC is
designed to improve this situation.
2.07      The Burma Ports Corporaticn (BPC) operates the deep-water interna-
tional port at Rangoon and administers eight minor seaports along the
coastline. Although no capacity problems at the Port of Rangoon are foreseen
in the near future, the unstable and shallow access channel has been of some
concern to the Government, and the possibility of dredging an access channel
is being considered. The UNDP has been asked to finance a feasibility study
with the Bank as executing agency.
1,   Short-haul is defined by the Government as distances up to 25 miles, medium
from 25 to 75 miles and long 75 and ovor.



-4-
2.08      The Burma Five Star Shipping Corporation (BFSC) operates eight ocean-
going vessels totalling 69,000 dwt and six coastal vessels totalling 8,500
dwt. In addition, there are 180 privately operated coastal n~raft.
2.09      Burma has one international airport in Rangoon and 42 domestic
airports, of which only 34 are operated pLrmanently. Navigational aids are
of poor range and quality; maintenance and repair facilities are old. Burma
Airways Corporation (BAC) provides domestic and some international flights;
Burma is also served by other internat±onal airlines.  Most traffic is handled
at the Rangoon International Airport. Air freight traffic is minor.
C. Transport Investment and Policy
2.10      Public sector irtvestment in transportation, including road
construction, has been decreasing since 1966/67, and its share of such
investments decreased from 20% in 1966/67 to 1OX in 1970/71 (Table 4).
The three major modes - inland water, rail and road - received ahout 90%
of total transport investment. The overall level of investment has nct been
suiff"      co maintain capacity.
2.11      Since independence and most particularly since the advent of Llte
present Revolutionary Government in 1962, Governnent ;policy has been to
progressively nationalize the transport sectos, %ith the stated objective
of ultimately placing all forms of mechanized transport in the public sector.
Railway (BRC), air (BAC) and ocean-going transport (BFSC) are entirely
nationalized; private sector activity is allowed in trucking, inland water
transport and coastal shipping. The Government makes freight allocations
anong various transport modes, prohibits the replacement of imported equipment
bv private operators and l!mits the availability of stare parts.  The
allocation of Government-coatrolled freight traffic (e.g. rice, oil, coal,
cement, fertilizer) is made tarough the Central Movement Coordinatton Cowmittee
(24CC) by exhausting the ava4lable public sector capacity and satisfying
remaining demand through private operators who also are free to carry
decontrolled commodities. Spare parts for private operators are made avail-
able through the Ministry of Trade (MOT) but allocat4ons have been insufficient
to provide for proper maintenance of pr'ivate sectcr vehiicleo and zraft which
are generally quite old and in poor conditicn. lHowever, the role of thie
private sector will remain important in the foreseeable future, a-. the public
sector at present is sbort of capacity and the private sectcar moves a substan-
ttal _hare of transport demand.  It is estimated by the Ministry of Transport
atnd Communications (MOTC) that the private sector ncw accountq for about
40-60% of inland water transport 1/ and about 80% of trucking in terms of tons.
2.12      The transport sector, excluding highway planning and construction.
is under the authority of the MOTC; highway planning and construction come
under the Ministry of Construction. The MOTC is responsible for enforcing
Government policies regarding transportation by (a) approving the budgets

of the transport agencies in consulta4 Lon with the MOPF; (b) appointing
officers of the transport agencies; (c) setting tariff policy; and (d)
enforcing regulations for the operation of the sector. Annex 2 describes
the functions of agencies related to the transport sector.
2.13       In the transport sector as a whole investment priorities cannot
currently be analyzed adequately.  This is largely due to insufficient
information on traffic flows, operational statistics and costs and to some
extent the lack of expertise in collecting and analyzing information concern-
ing future transport demands. As initial steps which should eventually help
Burmese transport policy makers to make sound decisions on investment prior-
ities, the IWTC will receive assistance in improving accounting, costing and
management information under the proposed Credit. Similarly, the proposed
Credit for the BRC makes provision for some technical assistance in studies of
the optimum timing for phasing out steam locomotives and of the feasibilitv
of track doubling. The BRC will also be required to improve preparation of
operational and management statistics and appoint a working group to recom-
mend operational improve-nents.
D. Inland Water Transport System: History and Organization
2.14       Prior to Bur-ma's independence, inland water transport services
were maintained by private carriers dominated by two large British-owned
firms. the Irrawaddy and Arakan Flotilla Companies. After independence the
Government gradually took over the services of these two firms and created
a public body, now known as the IiTC, to operate all the major arterial
services and ensure regular water transport between all important points.
Until 1962, the small private operators carried goods al-d passengers in
direct competition with the Government operation. In that year, in line
with an overall nationalization policy, the Government placed restrictions
on the growth and operation of private carriers, limited their competitive
role vis-a-vis the IWTC, and started allocating freight traffic and necessary
spare parts as described in paragraph 2.11.
2.15       The private fleet registered with the MOTC is shown in Table 5.
Other detailed statistics are not available. Although the private fleet is
generally less reliable than the IWTC fleet because of poor maintenance and
weak enforcement of safety standards, it carries a very substantial share
of inland water traffic (between 40% and 60% of total passenger and 85% of
total cargo traffic), mainly on short-haul operations. Despite Government
policies, Burma will have to rely on private operators in the foreseeable
future, given the present lack of INTC capacity. In fact, the MOPF predicts
that the volume of freight traffic carried by private operators will increase
on average by 3% per annum.
2.16       The Marine Adminiitration Department (MAD) within the MOTC is
responsible for licensing of private carriers in the Rangoon and Delta
areas; the local Security and Administration Councils (SACs), in all other
r,_gions. The criteria for licensing, apart from, the general restriction



-6-
on entry into the industry, are seaworthiness of craft, qualifications of
captain and engineer, and the financial standing and mar.agerial qualifications
of ouners.  h1e MAD is also responsible for thc ainnual ir.sp- tion of all powerec
craft. Adequate inspection is difficult, particularly in the remote areas.
2.17      The Waterways Department (WD) within Lhe MOTC is responsible for
navigational aids and river dredging. These services are, at present,
maintained only on the Lower and Upper Irrawaddy and the Chindwin Rivers.
In other areas no navigational services are provided and in many areas where
they are available, the aids provided are not adequate to permi. night
sniling and vessel operations are therefore limited to dayiight hours. To
improve the situation, provision is made for procurement of navigational
aids in the proposed Credit.
III. INLAND WATER TRANSPORT CORPORATION
A. Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      The IWTC was, until March 1972, a board operating under the control
of the MOTC.  Recent changes within the Ministry resulted in the creation of a
Central Corporation of Transport and Communications (CCTC) which governs the
various Transport Corporations, including the TWTC. It is understood that
this change involves the gradual delegation of executive powers to the IWTC
nanagement while retaining overall control by the CCTC.  The Government
presently exercises control of the IWTC in staff, financial and budgetary
matters.
3.C2      T.e .'anaging Director, who is appGinted by the MOTC and is the
chief execucive, exercises his power through various Departments. The IWTC
fleet operations are carried out in five Divisions under the Transportation
Department: Cargo (including Rangoon-Mandalay passenger/cargo services),
Upper Burma (including Chindwin and Upper Irrawaddy services), Arakan,
Delta and Moulmein. Annex 3 and Chart 7593 describe the function and organi-
zation of the IWTC.
3.03      The management of the TWTC is generally satisfactory.  However, there
is scope for improving operations, particularly through a better management
information system. A good deal of raw Oita on traffic finance and costing
already exist but the IWTC lacks the means and expertise for processing and
analysis to make them useful for management purposes. The proposed Credit
provides for technical assistance to develop and implement a management
information system.
3.04      The basic level of staff remuneration in the IWTC, as in other
public sectors was revised in October 1972. The highest salaries are between
US$262-300 equivalent per month; the lowest, about US$19 equivalent. Since
there is a general shortage of jobs, the IWTC does not have any difficulty in



-7-
recruiting staff. The total staff costs in 1971/72 were about 25% of
operating expenses.
3.05      The number of permanent employees is about 9,500.  There are no
trade unions and strikes are not permitted. In general, officers display
excellent discipline, but in the lower echelons the rate of absenteeism is
rather high (20-25%).
B. IWTC Property
3.06      The present position with regard to IWTC property and the context
in which improvements are now planned are described in Annex 4. Spare parts
and materials both for ships and for dockyards have not been available in
quantities sufficient for necessary preventive maintenance and general
repair work. It is therefore likely that in the next few years the carrying
capacity of the passenger and dry cargo fleets, already somewhat depleted by
laid-up vessels (paras 3.12 and 3.17), will decline rapidly if funds are not
made available to repair the serviceable vessels and replace those which are
uneconomic to repair.
3.07      The IWTC presently has three different fleets (Table 6) consisting
of (a) 150 serviceable passenger/cargo vessels with a total static capacity of
about 46,000 passengers and 10,000 tons of cargo (Table 7); (b) the dry
cargo fleet, consisting of powered barges and barges pulled or pushed by
tugs, with a static total capacity of about 46,900 tons; and (c) the oil barge
fleet with an estimated total capacity of 53,300 tons (Tables 8-10). Past
acquisitions for the IWTC fleet indicate that the investment emphasis has
shifted, over the last decade or so, from passenger/cargo carriers to push-
barge trains for crude cil and petroleum products, to such an extent that
considerable over-capacity for the ' tter has existed since 1968. This has
been at thie expense of new ships fo. _nd/or maintenance of the dry cargo and
passenger fleets. Although in the majority of cases the hulls for passenger/
cargo vessels, barges and tugs are in reasonable conJition, some passenger/cargo
vessels require replacement. Engines for many vessels (except for the oil
fleet tugs) need proper maintenance and, in certain cases, replacement if the
vessels are to remain serviceable. Replacement of vessels and engines and
the procurement of necessary spare parts for engines as well as repair materials
are included in the project.
3.08      The IWTC's fleet lacks ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship radio
communication systems to ensure efficient operation. The systems to be
provided under the project are to be installed selectively.
3.09      The IWTC's dockyards for maintenance and repair of its fleet need
to be improved (Annex 4). Although the dockyard management and staff are
generally competent, much of the equipment is obsolete and there is a
critical lack of spare parts and materials. However, good facilities and
equipment are available in the under-utilized Sinmalaik Dockyard in the



-8-
Rangoon area, which is operated by the state-controlled Burma Dockyard
Corporation (BDC) within the HITC. To increase IWTC dockyard capacity and
efficiency, the Government is reviewing, from the point of view of overall
coordination, the operation of-dockyards in the Rangoon area to achieve their
maximum efficiency.  Agreement has been reached with the Government regarding
the implementation of a program to improve coordination of the operations of
the various dockyards.  To improve quality, the IWTC should appoint an
experienced shipyard welder to guide the staff on the application of modern
welding techniques in ship repair and building and it has been agreed that
such an appointment will be made by January 1974. The dockyard's capacity
is hampered by old ships lying within dockyard areas. Government administrative
rulings have made it difficult for the IWTC to exercise its right to scrap or
dispose of old vessels occupying valuable dockyard space required for repair
and maintenance of active ships and it has been agreed that the Government
will take action to correct this situation.
C. Operations and Traffic
. he IWTC provides regular pasbenger/cargo and cargo services on
the major navigable waterways throughout Burma. Tables 11 to 17 and Annex 5
show the operational and traffic-related data of the IWTC.
Passenger Operations
3.11      The IWTC operates 58 regularly scheduled passenger/cargo services,
covering 6,100 service-miles 1/ with the heaviest concentration in the Delta
Division, followed by the Upper Burma, Moulmein and Arakan Divisions. 2/
These services cater predominantly for passengers, but also carry some cargo.
3.12      The services are provided by 150 vessels, mainly diesel-driven,
with an average capacity of 235 passengers. These vessels are interchangeable
among the various Divisions, except, to some extent, for the Upper Burma
and the Arakan Divisions due to draft limitations in the former and specialized
coastal operating conditions in the latter.  Of the total operable fleet of
150 vessels, 18 were laid off throughout 1971/72 for lack of engine spare
parts and repair material. The remaining serviceable fleet was only avail-
able 72% of the year as each ship, on the average, was laid up more than
100 days for maintenance and repairs or waiting for spares and materials.
Engine breakdowns or groundings on badly marked rivers interfered with
regular schedules. The project is expected to improve this situation
substantially, as dockyards are modernized, spares and material become
readily available and rivers are better marked.
3.13      The utilization of the passenger fleet is maintained at reasonable
levels (80-95%) in terms of the proportion of sailing days to serviceable
1/   Total routeOmiles serviced.  Unduplicated mileage unavailable.
2/   Some passenger accommodation is also provided on the Rangoon/Mandalay
service operated by the Cargo Division.  Details on services are given
in Table 11 and Annex 3.



- 9 -
days but could be improved through a more flexible allocation of crews and
the provision of maintenance and bunkering at night. The average distance per
sailing day, however, is only about 65 miles, principally because of naviga-
tional conditions (limited night sailing) but also becaure of delays in cargo-
handling and restrictive labor regulations. Navigational aids and ship-to-
shore radio communications coordination provided for in the project will
improve this situation.
3.14      The average passenger load factor is about 50% which appears low.
However, this largely results from the long distances between major economic
centers requiring long hauls along rivers with many small villages. (The
overall ~.verage passenger journey is only about 45 miles.) Vesselb are
overcrowded when arriving at or departing from major communities but traffic
gradually diminishes between intermediate points. Some rescheduling of
services would improve the load factor. This, however, will take some time
to achieve and will, in the first instance, require an improvement in the
analysis and presentation of available traffic data so that appropriate
management decisions can be taken. The proposed project will provide for
an improved management information svstem.
Cargo Operations
3.15      The IWTC provides four basically different types of cargo services:
(i) liquid bulk; (ii) dry bulk and general cargo on cargo ships; (iii) general
cargo on the passenger/cargo fleet; and (iv) lighterage.
3.16      Liquid bulk, consisting mainly of crude oil and petroleum products,
is moved by 20 pusher tugs and 113 oil barges used as barge trains. The
fleet's availability is relatively high (82%, almost 300 days per year) but
could be improved further as most of the fleet is relatively new. The
utilization of the oil fleet is very low - only about 68% - due to the
inflexible assignment of pusher tugs to barge trains.  The distance per
sailing day of barge trains is 73 miles, but this could be improved by
increased night sailing through the installation of navigational aids on
the rivers. The load factor is about 5U% since an empty backhaul is involved.
3.17      Dry bulk cargo and part of the general cargo tr f fic are moved in
a varied fleet of 128 powered vessels and barges.  The availability factor
is /4% due to a lack of spares and insufficient or badly-equipped repair
facilities.  The utilization rate is a low 60% due tc insufficiencies in the
cargo distribution system not under the control of the IWTC and also to
idling days for crew rest and engine maintenance.  Distance per sailing day
is about 63 miles; the load factor, at about 65%, is reasonable. About half
of tile general cargo (in tons) is moved on the passenger-cargo fleet discussed
in paragraph 3.11. As this fleet caters predominantly for passengers, the
cargo load factor is only about 20%.
Passenger Traffic
3.18      Table 12 shows the IWTC's passenger traffic from 1961/62 to 1971/72.
During the period 1961/62-1967/68, traffic increased on average by 15% per



- 10 -
annum in terms of passengers and by 9% per annum in passenger-miles, due
mainly to increased movements in the Delta, Moulmein and Arakan areas. In
1967/68, IWTC passenger traffic reached a peak of 11.3 tillion passengers
and 290 million passenger-miles. The increase in passenger traffic in the
Delta area was due, in part, to the commencement of the Rangoon-Syriam
ferry service in 1962/63. If this service is excluded, the overall average
growth rate in this period was 10% in terms of passengers and 8% in passenger-miles.
In 1965 IWTC purchased nine new passenger vessels to cope with the increasing
passenger traffic. In 1967/68, the Delta Division passenger traffic accounted
for 39% of the total passenger-miles; the Upper Burma Division for 18%; Mtoulmein
foL 11%; Arakan for 9%; and the Rangoon/Mandalay service for 3%.
3.19      In 1968/69, passenger traffic declined sharply to 10.3 million
passengers and 236 passenger-miles, in consequence of a cyclone in the
Arakan area in May 1968, which sank or beached ten ships and damaged others.
In order to partly replenish the Arakan fleet, ships were withdrawn from
some long-haul Delta services and from the Upper Burma Division (Mandalay/
Prome), resulting in the discontinuation and/or curtailment of some 21 services
(Table 13). As a result traffic declined in those areas. Between 1968/69
and 1971/72, passenger traffic was static with a declining trend and in the
latter year a total of only 9.8 million passengers and 230 million passenger-
miles was carried, as the fleet continued to deteriorate.
3.20      Passenger traffic forecasts are given in Table 14.  They incorporate
the capacity increase through vessel renabilitation and renewals provided
by the proposed project. It is anticipated that by 1976/77 the passenger
traffic will reach 12.5 million passengers and 280 million passenger-miles,
with an average annual growth of 5%, in terms of both passengers and passenger-
miles, from the 1971/72 levels.  The composition of passenger traffic
by areas and distance will not differ substantially from thet of 1967/68.
These forecasts are reasonable.
Cargo Traffic
3.21      Table 15 shows the IWTC's total cargo traffic in terms of tons and
ton-miles from 1961/62 to 1971/72. Cargo traffic data by major commodities
are available only for the last four years and are shown in Table 16. The
IWl'C's total cargo traffic grew by 5% in tons and 6% in ton-miles during the
last decade.  The level of traffic was stagnant between 1965/66 and 1969/70,
but it increased during tile next two years, reaching 2.2 million tons and
440 million ton-miles with an average haul of 200 miles in 1971/72. The
growth rates for cargo traffic by major commodities and the proportions of
the total cargo were:

Total        6                9          100.0       100.0
3.22      Oil traffic increases were realized through the acquisition of new
barge trains (push tug with 4 barges) to cater for the increased production
of the oil fields along the Irrawaddy and the two refineries in Syriam (Rangoon)
and Chauk. Similarly rice and cement movements were increased through the
acquisition of new cargo capacity in recent years as rice and cement
production rose. The average haul for rice increased substantially, as
larger quantities were carried from the Delta to Upper Burma. General
cargo, about 50% of which is carried on passenger/cargo cervices, registered
little change.
3.23      Table 17 shows the Association's forecast for cargo traffic up to
1976/77. By that year the total traffic is expected to increase to 2.9 million
tons and 573 million ton-miles, at an average annual rate of growth of 6%
and 5%, respectively, providing that additional capacity, largely through
vessel rehabilitation, is realized as provided for in the proposed project.
The growth rates for the various commodities are forecast as follows:
Average Annual Growth Rates   Percent of Total Cargo
from 1971/72 to 1976/77             in 1976/77

Total         6                 5          100.0       100.0
3.24      The oil fields on the Irrawaddy show good prospects of achieving
a 6% growth rate. Rice and general cargo, which is to a large extent of
agricultural origin, are estimated conservatively at 3%, considering the
population growth of 2.5% per annum. The sharp increases in cement and
fertilizer result from new plants along the Irrawaddy, which will start
production in 1974/75 and 1972173, respectively.



- 12 -
D. Tariffs and Costs
3.25      Rates for freight traffic carried by the IWTC fall into th-ee
principal classes which are calculated on a telescopic scale according to
distance. Special rates apply on a point-to-point basis for certain commodities,
principally rice, cement and crude oil. All proposals for changes in
tariffs must be submitted to the cabinet through the MOTC; there have been
no general revisions of tariffs during the past ten years.
3.2b      Most commodities are carried at around the overall average of
Pyas 10.0 per ton-mile (about USJ 2.0 equivalent). Rates for the principal
commodities are:
Pyas per ton-mile
Oil                   10.8
Rice                   9.0
Cement                 6.8
General Cargo         10.5
Passenger revenue has remained steady during recent years at about Pyas 6.0
per pass-mile (about USJ 1.2 equivalent).
3.27      At present the IWTC has no satisfactory costing system and before one
can be established it is necessary to improve the processing of accounting
and statistical information; this is to be provided fcr in the proposed
Credit (para 6.06). While there may be some elements of cross-subsidization
of particular classes of traffic, total costs are fully recovered.
E. Financial Management
3.28      Although the  WtrC is a Corporation, for all practical purposes it
operates as a depart-lent of Government, all cash generazed is channelled to
Government through the Union Government Consolidated Fund (UGCF) and cash
requirementS for operations on investment programs is made available through
':he same Fund. Income tax on the IWTC's profits is levied at 99% so that with
the law as it presently stands it is not possible for the IWTC to have any
degree of financial autonomy.
3.29      Accounts of the IWTC are prepared on commercial principles and
are satisfactory; there are, however, several shortcomings in accounting
organization and management which are discussed in paragraphs 6.03 and 6.06.
3.30      Budgets are prepared annually for revenue, expenditure and
capital investment. These are submitted to the MOTC and the MOPF and they
are finally approved by the Council of Ministers in September each year
for the ensuing fiscal year which ends on September 30.



- 13 -
3.31      Preparation of annual accounts, which at the time of the pre-
appraisal mission (September 1972) was in arrears, has now been brought up
to date.  Accounts to 1970/71 have been finalized and provisional figures
have been presented for 1971/72. Audit of accounts by the Central Audit and
Inspection Office (Auditor-General's Department) has been completed for all
years to 1969/70 but auditors' reports are still not completed for the years
1968/69 and 1969/70. Audit of the 1970/71 accounts was completed in February
1973. The reason for these delays results from a Government instruction in
August 1972 that all accounts should be brought up to date; the IWTC presented
to the audit office three years' accounts during a period of only a few
months.
3.32      The mission discussed with the Director of Audit the standards
of auditin, and the qualifications of his staff, both of which are accept-
able. The Department is taking active steps to improve its organization. The
Deputy Director has a first-class professional qualification; there are at
least 40 locally qualified staff and the Auditor-General's Department conducts
its own training and examination programs.
3.33      During negotiations it was agreed that the IWTC will send to thie
Association copies of its unaudited annual accounts within four months of the
end of each fiscal year, to be followed by audited accounts with translations
in English of che auditor's report within six months of the end of each fiscal
year and accompanied by translations of exceptions and criticisms referred
to in the report.
IV. THE INVESTMENT PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.  The Investment Plan
4.01      The IWTC's Plan forms part of the first Four-Year Economic Develop-
ment Plan of Burma, i971/72 - 1974/75. Originally, the Plan amounted to
only K 51.8 million (LUSS1O.7 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange
component of K 31.6 million (US$6.6 million equivalent).  Some K 43.7
million was co be spent on fleet renovation and improvement. Subsequently,
the IWTC revised its Plan and the revised version, reviewed by the
Association, involves *"penditures of K 124.1 million (USS25.8 milion
equivalent) with an estimated foreign exchange component of USS17.5 million.
The first year of the original Plan has been completed; the second year has
already been budgeted in accordance with the original Plan. Expenditures
amounted to K 2.4 million and K 6.1 million respectively, mainly to complete
carry-over works related to bulk cargo fleet expansion and some civil works.
The composition and cost of the works now included in the Plan are shown in
Table 18.

B. The Project and the Proposed Credic
4.02      The project, consisting of the last two years of L.i TWTC's Invest-
ment Plan 1971/72 - 1974/75, aims to renabilitate the IWTC's fleet which has
been deteriorating rapidly and to increase its operation'. efficiency.
It includes rehabilitation of vessels through procurement of engines,
spare parts and materials; rehabilitation of docKyard facilities through
procurement of equipment, machinery and tools; provision of r.,dio communications
equipment and accounting machines; and technical assistance in management
a__:.ounting and modern welding techniques for the dockyards. The total cost
of the project is estimated at K 115.6 million (IJS$24.0 million equivalent)
with a foreign exchange component of about US$16.5 aillion, of which about
US$15.82 million would be covered by the propose(, Credit. The proposed
Credit would amount to 66% of the project cost ar.' 96% ot the foreign
exchange component.  In addition, the proposed Credit would finance for the
"'i of the MOTC the procurement of essential navigational aids and equipment
for the rehabilitation of vessels used in their inbstaliation and maintenance
as detailed in Table 19; the foreign exchange cost of' these items is about
US$0.48 million.  The total proposed Credit would, thierefore, amount to
US$16.3 million. A breakdown of the estimated project cost and items to
be financed by the proposed Credit are summarized in the following table
(see Annex 6 for detailed project description and Table 20 for details of
items to be financed by the proposed Credit):

4.03      Investments included in the project but not selected for the
proposed Credit will be financed by the Government's own resources and have
already been committed.
4.04      The project costs are based on the latest available prices and
inquiries from varicus sources. The estimated cost assumes that all equipment
and materials would be imported from abroad. Contingency provision has been
made on the basis of price increases of 5% per annum for both local and
foreign costs. Price contingencies represent about 8% of the Credit.
No provision for physical contingencies has been made as no civil works are
involved. The specifications of equipment requirements have been carefully
determined. Local costs include import duties (18-22% of CIF prices) which
are applicable to all imported items of the project.
'4.05     The IWTC is competent, with the technical assistance proposed in the
project for management accounting and welding, to carry out the project.
A time-phased implementation schedule is shown in Chart 7594.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
4.06      All items to be financed by the Association will be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with the procedures
of the Association, except for spare parts for various engines as necessary
cz economic and efficient operation of the fleet.  The total value of
,nro.-jrument for this purpose is estimated at USS1.6 million equivalent.
~. e   iocurenent of e:Ygines would be handled in two stages, the prequalifica-
LIor- ok suitably qualified manufacturers and a price tender, in order to
ac-_'itate evaluation of htis.
l. ()"    Contracts for the acquisition of passenger vessels would be awarded
thc basiv of international competitive bidding.  The Burma Dockyard
..rJraLion (BDC). a corporatiorn separate from the IWTC within the MOTC, has
thf, capaci-y to undertake 3ome work, mainly assembly, related to the con-
.;rtruc.Lon of up to tsree shlips during the project period. Foreign ship-
b:i.ders could tuerefore usefully subcontract some of the construction work
zo WYC; suich subcontracting would enable them to qucte moire attractive prices,
a tn'e savings in ocean freight charges fron transporting the parts rather
ti:an the fully assembled ships would be very substantial.  Furthermore the
experience would assist the Burmese dockyards in the future maintenance
or th.e vessels.  The BDC does not propose to enter into any joint venture
l-irangement; it would offer its facilities to the foreign ship-builders
aitthout exercising any choice itself. The degree of participation of the BDC
would bt decided by each foreign bidder, and in order to give each bidder an
equal opportunity, the BDC would be required to offer its facilities on
the same cost basis to all bidders. In order to encourage foreign
shipbuilders to enter into subcontracting arrangements with the BDC, the
Associatior agreed that in the evaluation of bids, a 15% price preference
wiLl be allowed on the portion of the contract to be subcontracted to the BDC.



- 17 -
Foreign bidders in submitting their tenders wil'l be required to give details
of the work to be performed locally by the BDC and details of the related
costs. These arrangements will safeguard the principle of equal opportunity
to all bidders. The project cost estimates assume that all vessels would be
constructed abroad. If up to three vessels are built locally, Credit dis-
bursements would indirectly include an element of local cost financing of
not more than US$0.8 million equivalent representing the portion of the
foreign contractor's assembly costs incurred in Burma.
4.08      As for procurement of equipment and repair materials, items would
be grouped together in packages suitable for competitive bidding. It is
proposed that the IWTC should procure the navigational aids and hand them
over to the WD for installation. These arrangements were confirmed with the
Government and the IWTC during negotiations. Procurement of the non-IDA-financed
items of the project would be made in accordance with the Government's standard
procedures, which are acceptable. No international preferential tariff
treaties would be applicable for procurement of any items included in the
proposed Credit.
4.09      Any savings under the proposed Credit would be used to finance
additional but similar project items subject to review and agreement with
the Association.
4.10      The estimated quarterly rate of disbursement (Table 21) is based
on the assumption that the proposed Credit would become effective by
October 1, 1973.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Economic Role of the IWTC
5.01      The inland water transport and railway services, both serving
the kev economic centers of Burma but traversing different terrain in doing
so, form the backbone of the transport system of the country. They complement
each other rather than compete for traffic. Road transport plays a lesser
role and is likely to do so for the foreseeable future since very substantial
investments would be required to place the road system in a competitive
position. The investment envisaged in the transport sector during the first
Four-Year Plan period and the typical freight traffic for various modes are
shown in Tables 22 and 23.
5.02      Presently, neither major transport system is able to fulfill its
proper role or to carry all of the traffic offered because of the deterioration
of its facilities. The proposed project for the IWTC and a similar one for
the BRC are designed to remedy this situation without changing the respective
roles of the systems.



- 18 -
B. Economic Benefits
5-.03     The IWTC project has two important components:
(a) fleet and dockyard rehabilitation, i.e., re-engining
program, supply of spares and repair materials, replace-
ment of aver-aged vessels or vessels recently lost in the
Arakan, modern dockyard equipment and technical asbistance
in welding; and
(b) items designed to improve operations, i.e., communication
equipment, navigational aids, accounting machines and
technical assistance in building a management information
system.
These investments will enable the IWTC to recover its lost capacity, increase
its efficiency and reduce operating costs, resulting in substantial benefits
to the country. If the project is not carried oit, operational standards
would not improve but would, in fact, deteriorate and maintenance and operating
costs would continue to rise as old and ill-maintairned equipment remained in
service. Furthermore, since the growing backlog of traffic would become
intolerable, the IWTC would have to resort to the uneconomic measure of pur-
chasing new equipment as an alternative to repairing out-of-service stock
with a useful remaining life span.
5.04      Thus, the economic benefits are calculated as differences in
costs between:
(a) costs without the proposed project - estimated increase in
maintenance and operating costs wi4th the present level of
efficiency plus some investments required to cater for
expected increased traffic in the future; and
(b)  estimated maintenance and operating costs with the proposed
project.
All these cec,ts are based on information supplied by the IWTC, and they are
reasoneLie. The rehabilitation of the IWTC's fleet would generate economic
oenefits in the form of maintenance cost savings and of defermant of some
new vessel procurement. Rehabilitation of dockyards are maioly to cater
for proper maintenance of the IWTC's fleet and this will improve availability
of vessels. Also improvements in communications and navigational aids will
increase the efficiency of the IWTC's operations.
s.o 0 "~  An assessment of the project as a whole shows that the total
economic benefits would yield an economic return of about 24%, which is
satisfactory. Detailed econouic return calculations are shown in Annex 7.
No attempt was made to derive separate economic returns for the various
components, as they are highly interdependent.

VI. FINANCES AND EARNINGS
A. Past Performance
6.01      Because of the wide diversification of the !WTC's operations and
the need to delegate accounting responsibility to a large number of out-
stations, it is no easy task to maintain an efficient accounting organiza-
tion or systems of budgetary and management control. In addition to this
general problem, the IWTC's accounting machines are out of use and beyond
repair, hence all records are prepared manually; monthly freight accounts
to users are despatched three months after the month to which they relate;
management and statistical information is generally produced on unreliable
bases and there are no monthly accounts or other eflective controls. In
spite of these conditions the revenue and expenditure accouncs for
1966/67 - 1971/72 (see Table 24) show improving net results from operations.
During this five-year period gross revenue has increased by 27%, while
operating costs have iucreased by 11%. Freight traffic, which accounts for
more than 70% of total revenue, has increased in volume by 30% while the labor
force has increased by only 3.5% and average labor costs by 4%. The return
on net fixed assets in use has increased from 6.7% in 1966/67 to 9.6% in
1971/72, but this has only been possible through deferment of investment in
new equipment.
6.02      Table 25 shows the source and application of funds for 1966/67 -
1971/72. Cash generation from operations amounted to K 100 million, and
increased working capiLal and debenture inteiest absorbed about K 50 million,
so that by normal standards about K 50 mil1ion could be regarded as having
been contributed to capital spending whici a,.ounted to K 98 million.  Since
income tax at 99% is charged on profits, the IWTC is dependent on Government
allocations of funds for its entire Investment Plan.
6.03      Summarized balance sheets of the IWTC for 1966/67 - 1971/72 are
shown in Table 26. Values of fixed assets are at cost and depreciation is
charged on commercial accounting principles. The most recent figures
include about K 3 million for nonexistent assets for which write-off
authority is required. Inventory values in the balance sheet do not appear
to be excessive but receivables, nearly all of which are due from Government
corporations, are steadily increasing. At the close of 1970/71 accounts,
about K 27 million was due to the IWTC for freight accounts which were more
than one year old.
6.04      No reliable cost figures are available for the various services
operated by the IWTC, so it is not possible to assess what degree of cross-
subsidization exists. The accounting specialist to be appointed will be
required to review the profitability of the various services operated bv the
IWTC and to make appropriate recommendations.



- 20 -
6.05      As a result of the foregoing review of accounting matters, it has
been agreed that the Government will make decisions on the IWTC's applications
for write-off of nonexistent or obsolete assets within aix months of the sub-
mission if applications. The Government has also confirmed that it will
instruct its agencies and corporations that old freight accounts due to the
IWTC should be settled by September 1973 and that other accounts should be
s2ttled within three months of presentation.
6.06      In regard to the appointment of an accounting specialist (see paras
3.03 and 3.27) it has been,agreed during negotiations that:
(a) An accounting specialist will be appointed by
January 1, 1974, and with support from the IrTC
counterpart staff will review and reform the Corp-
oration's accounting, statistical and management information
records and will make recommendations on the types of
machine accounting aids to be acquired by the IWTC. Provi-
sion for the cost of these specialist services and accounting
i-Ae-hines is included in the proposed Credit.  Draft terms of
. .erence for this assignment are shown in Annex 8.
(b) The Government will, in consultation with the Association,
authorize the IWTC to implement agreed recommendations of
the accounting specialist promptly after presentation of
quarterly progress reports.
B. Financing Plan

/1   Including items chargeable to revenue, K 22.5 million.
6.08      The figures in paragraph 6.07 show that the proposed Credit will
contribute 66% of total project costs, the balance being found from the
IWTC's own cash generation. Total foreign exchange costs amount to US$16.5
million, almost the whole amount being financed by the proposed Credit, the
small balance being already committed. It has bee.. agreed during negotiations
that the major part of the proceeds of the propoaed Credit (US$15.8 million)
will be re-lent by the Government to the IWTC, interest being charged at 6%
per annum and repayment being made over 15 years including a four-year grace
period. The financing plan makes provision for debt service on this basis.
The re-lending terms include a proviso that repayment of the loan by the IWTC
in advance of the respective due dates is permissible only to the extent that
the IWTC's cash generation in any year exceeds an amount equal to 1.5 times
the aggregate amount of the IWTC's debt service requirements for that year.
Items to be financed by the proposed Credit are detailed in Table 20.
6.09      The project has been defined as consisting of the last two years of
the IWTC's Plan for the four years 1971/72 - 1974/75, as detailed in Table 18.
The financing plan is satisfactory, but since the IWTC is dependent on the
Government for the allocation of funds for capital expenditure, it has been



- 22 -
agreed during negotiations that the Government will make available z l funds
required to complete the project and to enable the IWTC to operate efficiently
and to implement essential investment programs. It has also been agreed that
the IWTC will carry out its Plan and shall not amplify that Plan by additional
investments except as the Assoc'ation shall otherwise agree. Other capital
expenditures made before September 30, 1975, and not included in the Plan
will be restricted to an aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent of
US$0.5 million.
C. Financial Forecasts
6.10      Forecast revenue and expenditure accounts for the years 1972/73 -
1976/77 are shown in Table 27. Earnings from passenger and freight traffic
have been derived from the forecasts shown in Tables 14 and 17 which show
an average annual growth of about 5% in both cases. No provision has been
made for any increase in rates and fares. The forecasts for 1972/73 take
account of an exceptional increase in pay for low-paid workers, and for
future years an increase of about 2% in average wage costs has been assumed.
Forecasts presented by the IWTC assume an increase in the labor force from
9,500 in 1971/72 to 12,600 in 1976/77. Part of this increase is required
to staff existing doc'-yards, but the remainder, which is said to be required
to fill existing vacancies, should be carefully monitored to preserve the IVITC's
viability (para 6.15).
6.11      The operating ratio rises from 78 in 1971/72 to 85 and 90 in 1973/74 -
1975/76 and then falls back to 86 in 1976/77. The reason for this is the
exceptionally heavy maintenance costs in 1973/74 - 1975/76 through undertaking
deferred repairs which will be made possible through procurement of spares
included in the proposed Credit. In 1976/77 repair costs should return to
a normal level. Loan interest has been calculated at 6% on the proceeds
of the Credit made available to the IWTC. Return on net fixed assets in
use, which was 9.6% in 1971/72, is expected to fall to 4.3% in 1975/76 and to
recover to 6.1% in 1976/77 when full benefits from the project investment are
obtained.
6.12      Forecast balance sheets for 1972/73 - 1976/77 are shown in Table 28.
Receivables are assumed to decline considerably following a Government
instruction that outstandings are to be settled promptly; even so, amounts
outstanding will be more than double current liabilities.
6.13      A forecast source and disposition of funds statement for 1972/73 -
1976/77 is shown il. Table 29. Cash generation from the IWTC's operations is
estimated at K 99 million; after payment of debt service and income tax
and taking account of coi±ections of old receivables a surplus of K 42 mil-
lion is expected to be available to reduce Government's equity interest in
the IWTC. The Plan would therefore be entirely financed from the proposed
C--lit and from the IWTC's own cash generation. In effect the proposed Credit,
while providing valuable foreign exchange, will permit the release of local
funds to the Government for other development purposes.



- 23 -
6.14      Pensions and terminal gratuities are charged in the accounts
when paid to the recipients instead of being funded on an accrual basis.
During negotiations the Association was informed that the Government intends
to introduce in 1974 a national pension scheme covering all Government
employees, which should enable the IWTC to avoid the undesirable effects of
an unfunded scheme.
6.15      Since the proposed Credit is the Bank Group's first involvement
with the IWTC, the earnings covenant has been constructed in simple terms.
The objectives should be to ensure that earnings are sufficient to generate
cash for debt service and future investment. During negotiations it was
agreed that measures will be taken, including tariff adjustments if necessary,
which will enable the IWTC to achieve operating ratios for fiscal years 1973/74
- 1975/76 not higher than 90, and from 1976/77 not higher than 85. Achieve-
ment of the proposed operating ratios will mean that IrWTC should be able to
generate sufficient cash to meet all debt service and the cost of normal
replacements of capital equipment. It will also have the effect of controlling
increas.s in the number of personnel employed end at the same time avoiding
the need for incre"es in rates and fares. Annex 9 illustrates that the
proposed operating ratios would not be unduly difficult for the TWTC to
achieve.
6.16      It was also agreed that the IWTC will incur additional debt only
if debt service payments, including that on the re-lending of the proposed
IDA Credit and on any new loans or credits obtained by or made available to
the IWTC, are covered 1.5 times by the IWTC's cash generation from operations.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following principal
points:
(a)  coordination of operations at various dockyards and the
appointment of a technical specialist to improve ship
repair techniques (para 3.09);
(b)  appointrens of an accounting specialist to improve
accounting and management information systems (para 6.06);
(c)  terms on which the Government will re-lend to the IWTC
the proceeds of the proposed IDA Credit (para 6.08);
(d)  capital expenditure not included in the Plan to be restricted
to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$0.5 million (para
6.09); and
(e)  adoption of an earnings covenant and a limitation on future
long-term debt (oaras 6.15 and 6.16).
7.02      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit
of US$16.3 million to the Government of the Union of Burma.

APPRAISAL OF AN INLAND WATER TRANSPORT PROJECT
IWTC Property
A.   Fleet
1.        The IrTC presently has 150 serviceable passenger/cargo ships with a
total capacity of about 46,000 passengers and about 9,000 tons of cargo
(Table 7). These ships primarily carry passengers and their cargo-carrying
capacity tends to be under-utilized. About 50% are 20 or more years old
while another 43% are at least 15 years old. Though bv current standards
most of these ships are over-aged, in the majority of cases the hulls are in
reasonable condition and they have a considerable remaining useful life, but
many of the engines need either replacing or rehabilitating if they are to
remain in service.
2.        The dry cargo fleet, consisting of powered barges and barges
pulled or pushed by tugs, has a total capacity of about 46,900 tons of which
about 80% is represented by vessels 15 or more years old. While the hulls
of barges and tugs can be utilized in the future with only modest maintenance,
re-engining of a number of tugs and powered barges is urgently required.
The oil barge fleet, with an estimated total capacity of 53,300 tons, and
the corresponding push tugs are in reasonable condition.
3.        In order to improve the situation, the proposed project provides
for (a) procurement of about 120 engines required for re-engining about 90
ships, (b) procurement of about 40 engines for conversion of about 20 dumb
barges of 600-ton capacity into self-propelled power barges, and (c) procure-
ment of spare parts and materials to cater for a vast backlog of ship main-
tenance. Also, the project includes procurement of six passenger vessels for
replacement of obsolete vessels and those lost in the Arakan area in the
1968 cyclone and ship-to-shore radio ccmmunications equipment.
B.   Dockyards
4.        There are at present some 15 boat-building and repair yards be-
longing to various Government agencies. The IWTC c-wns and operates five dock-
yards with a total of about 2,800 workers. Two of these dockyards - Dalla
and Ahlone - are located in the Rangoon area and undertake '.oth repair and
construction. The others are in Mandalay, Akyab and Moulmein and their
operations are chiefly limited to repair services. Although the dockyard
management and staff are generally competent, the yards are equipped with
obsolete equipment (with the exception of Akyab, built in 1963, and some
portions of "foulmein that are presently being rebuilt) and critically lack
spare parts and materials. It is the ingennity and devotion of management



ANNEX 4
Page 2
and workers that keep the fleet running as it does under such difficult
conditions. In spite of their efforts, many vessels are laid up for 50%
of the time.
5.        The I1WTC is aware of these prohler.s but regards lack of foreign ex-
change as the basic cause. This, to a great extent, is true, but better
utilization of labor end correct appplication of modern shipbuilding tech-
niques could be brought about locally. One weakness very apparent in the
yards is in shipyard welding techniques. It is therefore recommended that
an experienced shipyard welder be appointed to guide the staff on correct
and -odern application of welding in ship repair and building.  It is con-
sidered that with modern equipment and materials to be provided by the
project, better equipped workshops and access roads, together with expert
guidance on welding techniques, the IW-TC yards will be able to cope with the
repair and maintenance of their fleet and carry out some new building too. The
procurement of new engines for the re-engining nrogram and of spare parts
for vessels will enable the I4TC to achieve a much higher rate of vessel avail-
ability.
C.   Terminals
6.        The IWTC's cargo and passenger vessels call at some 400 stations of
various types: some are timber jetties; a few are rei:iforced concrete
jetties; about 100 are floating pontoons (station flats); and some stations
have no berthing facilities and the vessels load and unlcd in midstream,
using the services of local crafts, efficiently operated by villagers.
7.        The MAD is in charge of building and maintaining the jetties; the
TWlTC places pontoons at stations where jetty construction is lacking or
uneconomical. Some stations are in poor condition and need major repairs.
Cargo loading and unloading is labor-intensive and quite efficient, and no
cargo-handling equipment is used or required at present.  Heavy lifts are
transported on specially designed pontoons (landing craft), the capacity of
which is sufficient for the near future.

Capacity and Operational Analvsis
A.   General
1.        To arrive at a uniform and consistent method of capacity evaluat-e.o
of the different fleet types (passenger, oil, dry cargo) with their many
different types of vessels, the following factors are introduced:
(a) Serviceable static capacity (number of passen"ers,
tons). Vessels laid off throughout a year are not
included in this figure. The serviceable stati.c
capacity divided by the total static capacirv is referred
to as the serviceability factor.
(b) In-Commission time (I/C days) (number of days). This
is the average number of days a vessel unit is avail-
able for service.  Out-of-commission time refers to
annual maintenance, repairs, laid-off-time, etc. The
ratio of I/C days to 365 days is referred to as the
availability factor.
(c)  Sailing days (number of days).  This is t,e average
number of days a vessel unit is actually operated. The
ratio of sailing days to I/C days is referred to as
the utilization rate.
(d)  Miles per sailing day (number of miles).  Tr:e. average
number of miles a vessel travels per sailing day.
(e) Load factor. This is the ratio of actual Dassenger--
(ton-)miles to offered passenger-(ton-)miles. The
latter can be computed by multiplying (a) x (c) x (d).
B.   Static Capacity
(a) Passenger Fleet
2.        The static capacity of the fleet (about 46,60() passengers), as
given in Table 7, refers to the short distance (S.P.) capacity of each ship
(trips of up to 15 miles one way). As most ships are engaged on long-distance
servfces, this capacity is reduced to between 60% and 70% of the S.D. eap;e y
Taking this effect into account, the practical passenger rlect capac'tv h.
34,550 passenczers (Table 1 of this Annex); i.e., 75% of total S.D. capacity.

(1) Oil Fleet
.The 20 pusher tugs ot the oil fleet service 113 oil barges, 81
of tc-h were built in 1956 or later, and there are still nore under construez-
tion.  Tec capacity calculations of the oil fleet are based, not on the total
:;tatic capdcjtv of the fleet, but on the maximum practical capacity per
nar:'e train tnder given navig,ational condlitions.  These yield a total of
^,t/  tonq.
(Ce) C.Tiro Fleet
S.        'I'lTe currcnt cargo fleet of 128 powered vessels consists of:
(i) 2;1 tuis which can tow one or two barges deprndtng on the type of naviga-
t-una  constraints, (ii) 57 powrered barges, which also can tow alongside
(r"  or two harges: (iii) 18 cargo shiis; (iv) four landing craft; andi (v)
* '.ht steam paddle-wheelers on passenger/cargo runs, which side-tow two
barges.  The litter will, un er the Plan, cease to tow barges, since the
Ir es:.ll be conver-.ed to :elf-rropelled units.
lie practical canacitv of the cargo fleet was discuissed with the IWTC
.!i- established at a total of aboxut 36,500 tons, taking into account combina-
ions. al p)cered and dumb craft, navigational constraints and predominant
tvnes of cargo.
C.   Onerational Eftitiencv
6.         Operational :-fficiency is related to such factors as availability
Factor, utilization rate and miles ner sailing day as defined above. The
:-urssed project is *iesigned to increase these factors.  Table 1 of this
i'.nnr., provides a summary o' the estimated practical capacity of the various
ilce-  I.ements for each year 1971/72 - 1976/77 inclusive with and without
t-h'  flect rehabilization prL'gram included in the project.  Table 2 of this
Anne:' shows the present operaticnal data anL capacity of the fleet and the
,r-,.crted figures for 1975/76 when the project is completed.
7.        By reducinn maintenance and annual repair time, including emergencies,
-2:jstfantially throulghi modernizing dockyards and improving the fleet and
c-eracions, the I/C days of the fleet will increase, raising the availability
cutr,r 4X 23% for tie nassenger fleet, F,y 3% for the relatively new oil fleet
ald o'v 167 for the dry cargo fleet.
The utilization rate (sailing days over I/C days) will grow
throegh Increased reliability and flexibility of the rehabilitated fleet
and crrough hetter coordination of the cargo fleet deployment and cargo
distrikution  (cargo fleets only).  Tne management information system and
t'ie r.-Alo comrmunication system are expected to make major contributions in
! lS fieldI. As the passenger fleet is tied to schedules, its utilization
-itt ts already quite high and will increase by only 4%.  However, the cargo



ANNEX S
Page 3
fleet now loses much time waiting for c_.rgo or laborers. The oil fleet has
a particularly low rate as tugs are assigned permanently to one barge train
instead of working on a shuttle basis. As each barge train consists of four
barges and normally the I/C time of the barges is higher than that of the
tugs, there are sufficient barges to permit the shuttling of tugs
to take over loaded barges at the terminal immediately after releasing a train
of empty ones. This type of opera,tion will yield a higher output per tug
since utilization will increase sub:tantially. Thus the utilization rate of
the oil fleet is expected to grow by 25%; that of the cargo fleet, by 16%.
9.        The average number of miles sailed per dav is assumed to remain
constant in the case of the passenger fleet, as a far-reaching rescheduling
of services would be required to improve the current fi!,ure and this could
be considered only after the management information system has been implemented.
For the cargo fleet, miles sailed per sailing day are expected to increase
by 10' or 11% through increased night sailings, higher speeds in navigation-
ally difficult stretches and inmproved coordination of fleet deployment and
cargo distribution.
10.       The load factor is already good under the given navigational and
geographic constraints but is assuried to increase by 6% for the passenger
fleet, resulting from improved reJiability of the fleet and the release of
the six paddle-wheelers, now used primarily as tugs on the Rangoon-Mandalay
passenger/cargo service, for full-scale passenger services. The conversion
of the dum!b barges now towed on this service into powered barges will increase
the efficiency and flexibility of this cargo 5ervice.

APPRAISAL OF AN INLAND WATER TRANSPORT PROJECT
Project Description
1.        The project consists of the last two years, 1973/74 and 1974/75
(and spillover to 1975/76), of the four-year Investment Plan of the IWTC.
The project is designed to rehabilitate the fleet to provide adequate
facilities for vessel repair and maintenance. It includes the following
items:
A.   The purchase of:
(a)  about 120 engines for re-engining up to 90 vessels of
various types with standardized equipment;
(b) about 40 outboard engines for conversion of about 20
dumb barges of 600-ton capacity each into self-propelled
barges for cargo transportation;
(c)  spare parts required for main and auxiliary engines of the
IWTC fleet;
(d) vessel repair materials, including steel plates and sections,
electrodes, copper piping, foundry material, marine paints,
etc., all urgently required to remedy a backlog of repairs;
(e) various types of equipment, machinery and tools required for
rehabilitation and modernization of IWTC dockyards and other
vessel repair facilities;
(f)  six passenger vessels (125 or 230 passengers per vessel) to
replace obsolete vessels and those lost in the Arakan area
in the 1968 cyclone;
(g) new accounting machines ior the IWTC head office;
(h) about 70 sets of ship-to-shore radios with accessories.
B.   The construction of buildings for office use and training purposes.

C.   The provision of the services of experts required to:  (a) assist the
IWTC's management with the review and reform of its accounting,
statistical and management information resources; and (b) institute
modern ship repair and welding techniques.
2.        The project also includes navigational aids for the river system
for the Waterways Department in the MOTC.

APPRAISAL OF AN INLAND WATER TRANSPORT PROJFCT
Economic Analysis
A.   General
1.        This economic analysis assumes that the present and forecast
traffic demand must be substantially satisfied if national economic develop-
ment plans are not to be imnpeded. The proposed project of fleet and dockyard
rehabilitation (Alternative I) has therefore been compared with the alterna-
tive of maintaining the fleet in its present condition and level of
efficiency and adding new vessels as required to meet increased traffic
demand (Alternative II).
B.   Traffic Demand
2.        Tables 14 and 17 provide forecasts up to 1976/77 for passenger and
cargo traffic, as prepared by the IWTC and the Association in conjunction
with the various Ministries concerned. These data have been used to calculate
capacity requirement estimates up to 1976/77. For the purposes of this exercise,
the traffic demerd is assumed to hold constant after 1976/7z' throughout the
remainder of the project life (15 years, includin- the project execution
period).
C. Capacity Analysis of thie Fleets
3.        Annex 5 explains the methodology used for the analysis of the
practical capacity o' the BITC's fleet and provides forecasts for improvements
in operational efficiency. The analvsis indicates that, if the project is
carried out, the IWTC will have a capacity margin of 9-14% above the forecast
demand by 1976/77.
4.        Under Alternative II, the IWTC would have to rely on the current
fleet and repair facilities under current conditions and add new capacity to
meet increased traffic demands. It has been assumed that a small increase
in operating efficiency will result, under these conditions, from the
pressure of traffic demand and improved deployment of the oil and dry cargo
fleets.  Tlus, it is assumed that:
(a) the passenger fleet would realize a 6% intrease in load factor
because of traffic demandl pressutre;
(b) the re-deployment of tugs and barge trains would increase the
utilization of the oil fleet by 25%; and



(c) improved cargo distribution patternQ wic.ild yield an
8% increase in the utilization of titi  drv -rgo fleet.
The improved efficiency assumed under (b) and (c) above is applicable to
both Alternative I and Alternative II. Table I of tsir Annex stummarizes
the practical capacity of the various fleet tvrDes nnv and in 1976/77 for
Alternatives I and II.
5.        The IW!TC estimates that if the project is not implemented, it will
have to write off about 307 of its total fleet (see Table 1 of Annex 5 -
"Without Rehabilitation Project").  This incluzYs vessels which still have
an economic life but where vital spare parts 'r new~Y enoines are lacking.
Th4- analysis incorporates a more conservative aprronc!h, however, and
provides for a write-off cf only 5% of passenger capacity and 5% of dry
cargo capacity.
6.        Despite this, and despite the above-de5:cr½bed irmprovements in
operational efficiency, the IWTC, under Alternative IT, would lhave to invest
immediately in new capacity in order to cope with tihe increasing traffic.
Specifically it would have to acquire 20 new passenoer vessels, one new oil
barge train and 15 new cargo vessels (see Table 1 ot this Annex).
1).   Investment Costs
7.        The economic investment costs of Alccrnative I (the project) are
presented in Table 2 of this Annex. They exclude the customs charges which
vary between 187 and 22Z of landed cost. The remaining life of the six new
passenger vessels in 1987/88 is expressed as a residual of 40% of original
costs.
8.        The economic investment costs of Alternative I  (without the project)
are summarized in Table 3 of this Annex. They c-nsist of the investment in
passenger vessels, oil barge trains and cargo ve:iels (K 2.4, 3.4 and 1.1
million respectively). The remaining life of z:beso -cssels in 1987/88 is
expressed as a residual of 40% of original costs.
E.   Operating Costs
9.        With regard to operating costs, the :o¶ic analysis considers
those which differ substantially for Alternative I and Alternative II,
namely:
(a) annual fuel expenses; and
(b) annual costs for maintenance and repair of vessels (hull
and engines, labor and material).
The differentials between Alternatives I and II are estimated coiservalively.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
10.        The economic cost of fuel amounted to K 8.64 million in 1971/72
and it is estimated that it will rise by 5% by 1973/74, yielding K 9.07
million.  However, the rehabilitation project (Alternative I) should result
in a decline to K 7.78 million by 1976/77. For comparative reasons it has
been held constant thereafter. Total fuel costs for Alternative II are held
constant at the 1973/74 level, i.e., K 9.07 million. The increase in passenger-
and ton-miles has been disregarded as it would apply equally in both cases.
11.       The total cost for maintenance and repair of the fleet excluding
customs charges in 1971/72 is:
(K million)
Labor      Material
Engine repairs                     2.2         2.16
Hull repairs                       1.2         1.84
12.        In Alternative I improved dockyard facilities and modernized
working methods would decrease total labor cost by about 30% (3.4 x 0.7 
K 2.38 million) by 1976/77. Further deterioration of the fleet is estimated
to increase labor costs by 3% p.a. thereafter. in the first three vears
total labor is assumed at 75% of this cost, as the labor cost of re-enginlng
vessels is already included in the project cost.  In Alternative II, labor
cost is estimated to rise by 3% p.a. in the first three years, by 4% p.a.
in the next four years and by 5% p.a. thereafter.
13.        Costs for engine parts under Alternative I are estimated at
half the current cost in the first year, no costs in years 2 and 3 and
70% of total current cost by year 5, as the proposed project includes such
parts for three years and by then the fleet would be in much better condiition.
From 1977/78 onwards this cost is estimated to rise by 3% p.a. In Alternative
II costs are estimated to rise from the current value at the same percentage
rate as in the case of labor.
14.       Hull material -ts provide- for three years in Alternative I, the
costs for which are included in the investment costs. Thus, material costs
for three years were subtracted from the first four years.  By then, the fleet
would be in much better condition, so that the full current value is only
reached three years later; from then onwards increases o 3% p.a. are
assumed. For Alternative II the full current cost is increased by a conserva-
tive 3% p.a. throughout the comparison period.
F.   Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivitv Analysis
15.        Table 3 to this Annex summarizes the investment and operating
costs of the two alternatives, leading to an econoric return of 24%, which
is satisfactory. This computation disregards the fact that the IWTC's
fleet in both alternatives is aging and that vessels would have to be
scrapped from  time to time.  This process would be much faster in Alternative



ANNEX 7

II, thereby adding additional substantial benefits in the form of deferred
investment under Alternative I. Other benefits disregarded in the quantifi-
cation are time savings for passengers and cargo due to reduced emergencies
(groundings, engine trouble, etc.) anid increased reliability of the existing
fleet.
16.       An overrun of the project's investment costs of 10% results in
a rate of return of 14%. However, in such a case it would be very likely
that Alternative II would experience similar investment cost increases.
kssuming the same investment cost overrun for both alternatives the rate
of return would amount to 20%.
17.       For the purpose of testing the sensitivity of the analysis to
a reduction in traffic carried, the annual traffic growth rate was reduced
from 5% to 3.5%, the minimum likely to be encountered. Under these conditions,
the number of new passenger and cargo vessels required under Alternative II
would be reduced as would be the overall level of operating costs. Under these
conditions, the rate of return would fall to about 10%.
A third sensitivity test assumed that the differential between vessel
:peraLing costs in the two alternatives has been overstated by 25%. In this
case the economic return of the proposed project would decline to about 12%.
In contrast, if operating costs have been undervalued by 25%, the rate of
return would approximate 36%.  These tests confirm that the project is econ-
omically justified.

Statement Showing the Effect of Achievement of Proposed Okerating Ratios
1973/74    1974/75    1975/76    1976/77

Ratio (%)                  90%         90%         9(%         85,
Resulting Net Revenue         6.7         7.0         7.4        11.6
Forecast Net Revenue          7.6         4.6         5.9        10.9
Improvement Required          -           2.4         1.5         0.9
Staff Costs
As forecast                  16.2        17.1         17.9        18.3
Estimate if total
strength controlled
to about 9,000 /1          14.9        15.5        15.8        16.1
Possible reduction in
costs                       1.3         1.6         2.1         2.2
The sbove statement is intended to illustrate the relatively small inmpact
of the proposed operating ratios on the IWTC's forecast results. The poten-
tial savings in staff costs, except for fiscal year 1974/75, are greater than
the required improverent in earnings. While it may not be possible to achieve
all the potential savings in staff costs, any other cost reductions or
tariff increases which might be required would be quite snall.
/1   In 1971/72 the reported strength was 8,314 and in 1972/73 proposed
strength is 9,500.
