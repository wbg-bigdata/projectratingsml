MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANI FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOSIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN/CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR A STATES' ROAD PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to India of US$170 million and development credit of SDR 62.2
million (US$80 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including a five-year
grace period, at the standard variable interest rate. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years' maturity, and
would help finance road improvements and institution building.
Background
2.       India's size and dispersed population has shaped an extensive
transport system comprising about 62,000 route-km of rail lines, 1.8
million km of roads, 10 major ports, 14 major airports (six handling
international traffic), 6,500 km of pipe-lines, as well as coastal shipping
and limited inland water transport. Road and rail dominate domestic
transport, accounting for 95% of freight and passenger-km, but with roads'
share steadily increasing. Total transport demand over the past 25 years
has been growing at an average annual rate of 6%, with higher growth rates
for road transport and civil aviation.
3.      Although India's transport infrastructure has continued to expand
over the years, its development has fallen well behind transport demand.
As an indicator of this situation, transport's share of public investment
expenditures has declined from nearly 24% under the Second Plan (1957-61)
to less than 13% under the current Seventh Plan (1986-90). Despite this
overall decline in the sector's share as a whole, investment in the road
subsector has grown steadily in real terms, and the Seventh Plan provides
for a 50% greater allocation than did the Sixth Plan. The thrust of the
transport investment plan is to modernise rail facilities, augment main
road capacity, extend the network of lower class roads and increase the
capacity of ports to handle bulks and containers, but with transport demand
expected to double by the year 2,000, much greater investments and
institutional improvements will be needed if this target is to be met.
4.       Road transport is presently growing at about 7-10% per year, and
this growth is likely to accelerate as a result of recent liberalisation
measures. Yet India has not only one of the lowest per capita road
densities in the world, but what does exist is inadequate. Of the total
1.8 million km network, the national network (32,000 km) carries about one
third of total traffic, but is single-lane for about one quarter of its
length. Some 1700 bridges are sub-standard and need to be rebuilt, nearly
22,500 km of two-lane road need a second two-lane carriageway now, and over
16,000 km need strengthening. GOI's Planning Commission estimates that in
1988 prices it would cost US$7.7 billion to rectify presently identifiable



-2-
deficiencies. The shortcomings are even greater in the state road system,
which, taking only the main road and major district road components,
accounts for a length of about 350,000 km.
RatLonale for Bank Involvemest
5.       The main objectives of Bank involvement in transport are to
improve planning and project execution, productivity and resource
mobilisatiou., shortcomings which are sector-wide. These issues are being
pursued in railways, where the Bank has a long standing relationship, and
in ports, but the main thrust of the Bank's future involvement would be to
consolidate its re-entry into the road subsector, having regard to the
large and growing role of road transport and the need to improve planning
processes, the quality of the main roads and the efficiency with which
construction and maintenance works are executed. Initially, the effort is
focussing on the heavily trafficked national highways and the main roads of
the states, where economic returns from road improvements are likely to be
highest and where the benefits from introducing international competitive
bidding and more appropriate construction technology appear greatest. The
issue of resource mobilisation in the subsector is being addressed by a
study of Road-User Charges/Vehicle Fleet Nodernisation (RUC/VDI), which is
being carried out by consultants under the current National Hiighay
Project, and which, among other things, will address such issues as the
magnitude and incidence of these charges in the context of India's funding
requirements for road expenditures. A draft final report of the study is
expected early in 1989 and it will have implications for state-financed as
well as the center's national roads.
6.      A significant breakthrough was made in 1984 in reaching a rapport
with Government of India on the issue of international bidding for road
contracts, a difference which has kept the Bank out of the road subsector
for nearly 25 years. Since then, the Bank has made two loans in the
subsector, one for national roads Loan 2534-IN of 1985), and one for rural
roads (Credit 1757-IN of 1987). National roads are centrally funded, and
rural roads, which are built to much lower standards and are basically
state-funded, are given such substantial assistance from the center by way
of poverty alleviation and employment generation programs that they account
for nearly 40% of total roads expenditures. By contrast, state roads, many
of which are earrying traffic loads equal to the national network, are
financed solely from the states' budgets, and receive little, if any,
assistance from the center. Moreover, in times of financial stringency, as
was the case last year in the drought-afflicted areas, state road
expenditures are cut so that funds can be diverted to the relief programs.
Proiect Objectives and Design
7.       This project, which would be the Bank's first operation in state
roads, provides the opportunity to pursue at that level the improvements in
planning, project execution and network management being introduced for
national highways and rural roads under the two ongoing projects.



-3-
8.       The Zollowing criteria were established for selecting states to
participate in the project:
(a)  relative need, in terms of per capita income and per capita road
density;
(b)  likely economic returns from road improvements in the state;
(c)  need to strengthen the state road authority; and
(d)  the desirability of demonstrating the efficacy of institutional
improvements and more appropriate construction methods under a
variety of conditions, in order to promote replication of the
project results in other parts of the country.
9.       On these criteria, therefore, the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh,
Rajasthan and Maharashtra were selected. Bihar is the poorest state in the
union and has the lowest per capita road density. Natural road-building
materials are scarce and sub-grades are poor. Uttar Pradesh is the most
populous, also among the poorest, with one of the lowest road densities and
poor subgrades. Rajasthan's per capita income is well below the national
average, but has one oi the more progressive road administrations, and is
representative of construction conditions found in the more arid states.
Maharashtra is a relatively wealthy state with per capita income about 30S
above the national average, but its maintenance efforts lag those of other
states and it has expressed particular interest in improving its roads'
administration.
Proiect Descrintion
10.      The proposed project would comprise:
(a) the widening and strengthening of about 2,300 km of mostly
single-lane road as follows:
(i) in Bihar, two roads totalling about 100 km;
(ii) in Maharashtra, seven roads totalling about 670 km;
(iii)  in Rajasthan, eight roads totalling about 850 km and the
widening to four lanes of one state road of 15 km; and
(iv) in Uttar Pradesh, four roads totalling 600 km.
(b)  the construction in Bihar of a major bridge across the Ganges
at Bhagalpur together with about 14 km of approach roads;
(c)  the procurement of equipment to assist the four states in
monitoring the condition and usage of their road networks and
to promote road safety; and



-4-
(d) staff training, technical assistance, and studies and
services by consultants which would:
(i) assist the PWD supervisory groups in each state by
delegating supervision of one or two of the project
contracts to consultants;
(ii) in all four states, introduce a pavement management
system based on parameters of soil type, pavement
condition, traffic, and local costs in order to
prioritize work programs in accordance with budget; and
(iii) in Maharashtra, a management study of PWD to determine a
more appropriate organizational structure in keeping
with the needs of its road networks.
Project Costs and Financing
11.      The proposed project will be implemented over a period of
about five years at an estimated cost of US$ 450.2 million. The
foreign exchange component is estimated to be US$ 127.4 million or 28%
of total costs. The cost estimates and financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Procurement and disbursement arrangements are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in India are shown in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Three maps highlighting the project are attached, IBRD
Numbers 20858, 20900, and 20921. A Staff Appraisal Report, "States'
Road Project," dated October 3, 1988 is also being distributed.
Agreed Actions
12.      As mentioned earlier, the Road-User Charges/Vehicle Fleet
Modernization Study - which is examining the possible need for raising
additional revenue from road users as well as the present structure of road
user taxation - is expected to be at the stage of draft final report early
in 1989. To the extent that recommendations of the Study are within the
competence of the States to implement, an understanding was reached that
GOI shall assist the states to carry out such recommendations as have been
agreed between GOI, the states, and the Bank. In this connection, each
state will furnish to the Bank by December 31, 1990 a time-bound action
plan for implementing such recommendations and take all necessary steps to
carry out this action plan.
13.      States normally arrange for supervision of road construction
contracts using their own personnel and resources. The supervision teams
tend to be unwieldy and not adequately responsive to the requirements of
large contracts. The project therefore provides for one or two, or a
package, of the project contracts in each state to be supervised by
consultants, and during loan negotiations an understanding was reached
regarding these arrangements. Each state will appoint such consultants by
June 1, 1989.



-5-
14.      Although, in all four states, project costs will represent a small
proportion of their total capital receipts, during loan negotiations, each
state agreed to inform the Bank annually of its road program for the coming
year so that it may be seen that new commitments are not being entered into
which might threaten the timely availability of counterpart funds for the
project,
Benefits
15.      The road improvements will reduce vehicle operating costs,
travel time, and road maintenance costs. The weighted average rate of
return for the road improvements is estimated at 32%. The new
Bhagalpur Bridge in Bihar will reduce trip lengths in the area of
influence by 40-100 km, avoid relatively high cost transshipment by
ferries, and stimulate development in the relatively backward region
north of the Ganges. It has not been possible to quantify all
benefits from the bridge, but the rate of return from those which can
be quantified readily is estimated at 20%. The overall rate of return
for the road improvements and the bridge, which together account for
97% of total project cost, is estimated to be 30%. Introduction of
network management systems will promote improved utilization of the
scarce funds available for road improvements and mainterance, but
these benefits are not readily quantifiable.
Risks
16.      From experience with recent projects, the main risk arises
from implementation delays. However, this risk is being minimized by
having the majority of the project contracts evaluated and ready for
award shortly after loan signature, as well as by arranging for the
first time for the supervision of some of the project contracts by
consultants, which should improve overall implementation of the road
components.
Recommendation
17.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association
respectively, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan and credit.
