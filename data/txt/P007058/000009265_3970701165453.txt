PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR - THIRD AND FOURTH DEVELOPMENT RANKING PROJECTS
(LOANS 1359-EC AND 1731-FC)
PREFACE
1.        This rePort reviews the performance of the Bank's Third and Fourth
industrial credit vro1ects made through the covernment of Ecuador, wainly to
the Corporacion Financiera Nacional (CFN), the National Industrial
Development Bank, and to Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo S.A. (COFIEC), Ecuador's
largest private development finance company (DFC). Included in these loans
were several small, new DFCs which qualified to access small percentages of
the loans that were set aside for their use. The report assesses the
progress wade toward achievement of the main policy and institution-building
ob.jectives which were integral to the design of the projects. Loan 1359-EC
was approved on Februarv 18, 1977, and the final closing date was June 30,
1q82. Loan 1731-EC was approved on June 17, 1979, and the final closiag date
was June 30, 1983. Small portions of Loans 1359-EC and 1731-EC (USS.2 and
USS1.1 villion, respectively) remained undishursed and were cancelled at the
loans' closing as suhprojects were reduced in scope. The existing pipeline
of subprojects was handled under subsequent loans.
2.        This project completion report was prepared`by the Bank's Latin
America and the Carihbean Projects Department on the basis of data obtained
during Bank missions to Ecuador in Auigust and October 1984. Comments
received from the Borrower have been reflected in the report.
3.        This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR - THIRD AND FOURTH DEVELOPMENT BANKING PROJECTS
(LOANS 1359-EC AND 1731-EC)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        Bank funds were committed and disbursed under the Third and Fourth
loans, after some initial delays, for the types of subprojects anticipated in
the appraisal. The geographic locations and estimated economic impacts of
projects were in line with expectations although subloans were, on average,
larger than expected (paras 3.05-3.07). Beyond that, several unpredictable
events affected the outcome of the loans and the achievement of its key
institutional objectives.
2.        In late 1981, while Bank funds under the Fourth loan were disbursing,
Ecuador's economy began to falter as a result of foreign exchange constraints,
high public sector expenditures, declining domestic demand, credit restraints
to the private sector and interest rate policies which hampered resource
mobilization and encouraged capital flight.   By 1982-1983, Ecuador was in the
midst of a deep recession made worse by catastrophic floods and droughts that
destroyed major food and fiber export crops and fueled inflation. Major deva-
luations in 1982-1983 resulted in a dramatic increase in DFCs' liabilities as
their estimated US$300 million in guarantees for private sector borrowing from
foreign banks became actual rather than contingent liabilities (para 1.07).
Thus, the debt/equity ratios of the banking system and of all DFCs involved in
the Bank's projects exploded. By mid-1983, all participating DFCs except CFN
were found to be in substantial violation of the 10 to 1 debt/equity covenant
of the Fifth DFC project (Loan 2096-EC), as the financial condition of the DFCs
weakened because of lower earnings from deteriorating portfolios and the higher
provisions taken to cover loan losses.   The Bank and the Government agreed in
May 1983 that Loan 2096-EC would be modified to help strengthen the DFCs'
equity positions and, in early 1984, that the Bank would continue to disburse
to DFCs exceeding agreed-upon debt/equity ratios, that the Government as
Borrower had no objections to this plan, and that the Superintendent of Banks
would advise the Government and the Bank should the financia. condition of any
DFC deteriorate further (paras 4.10-4.11).
3.        In that overall economic and financial context, a significant per-
centage of Bank-financed subprojects have experienced difficulties. About 13%
of the 82 projects financed under the Third and Fourth Loans are closed or in
liquidation while an additional 21% have experienced difficulties and are not
likely to achieve their projected financial and economic results. Ultimately,
some of these projects may fail. Bank lending in Ecuador has in the past,
however, encountered fair economic weather. Loans made under the Third and
Fourth projects were faced with an economic storm that fully tested the DFC
project preparation and appraisal process. The project appraisal and evalua-



- vi -
tion process was found wanting, but the mechanics of preparation or presenta-
tion of economic (ERR) or financial (FRR) rates of return were adequate. A
high percentage of projects failed because market and distribution research and
analysis were inadequate, and evaluations of executive and technical staff
capability to run new or complex enterprise were often poor (paras 3.12-3.16).
4.        The profitability, liquidity and financial structures of DFCs
continued to decline in December 1983 and in 1984 as portfolio problems
mounted. The debt/equity ratios rose from not more than 10 to 1 in 1982 to a
range of from 15 to I to 25 to I for the five private DFCs which are
participating in the program. In conjunction with Ecuador's regulatory and
financial authorities, the Bank and the participating DFCs are seeking to reach
agreement on the financial rehabilitation targets that would be conditions for
their participation in future loans. A major institutional rebuilding job
remains to be done, and some DFCs may fail to achieve rehabilitation targets.
The DFC system is currently supported by the Central Bank's (CBE) special
discount line and overdrafts. CBE is currently the source of 57Z of the
system's resources. Because o' the financial crisis, private DFCs have begun
to evolve into more complex financial organizations engaged in leasing, real
estate and commercial paper operations. Recently, DFCs have had to be flexible
in order to survive, and the standard DFC model is likely to disappear in many
cases (para 1.11-1.12).
5.        Overall, the Bank's Third and Fourth loans have provided DFCs with
about 3 to 4 point financial spreads. At the debt/equity ratios provided for
under the loans, financial spreads of 5 to 6 points were required by DFCs to
earn modest real returns of 3% to 4% on equity. In the past, the Bank has not
given ample weight to the risks inherent in term operations lending and the
need for DFCs to make reasonable returns on investments to maintain their long
term viability (para 4.09).
6.        The Fourth project's major objective of completing formal capital
market studies was not achieved (para 4.01). Retrospectively, the research
project on capital markets was excessively ambitious for CBE's available
professional staff to undertake at the same time that it was attempting to deal
with inflation, devaluation, financial system crises, interest rate policy and
declining resource mobilization. The study was probably also excessive in
scope since half of it addressed complex long term institutional issues with
low possible medium term benefits to the financial system. It was clear that,
in the context of 1982-1983 events, the issues raised in the Fourth loan on
capital markets were overtaken by the unpredicted deterioration of the
economy. However, progress was made by the Government in 1982-1984 on the
critical exchange rate and interest rate issues and on industrial policy
issues (para 4.02). A good financial sector data base was prepared under the
Fifth DFC loan, and a dialogue on financial sector issues was initiated with
the Government. Key interest rate and industrial sector policy issues are
under discussion in the context of preparation of a possible Sixth DFC Project.

ECUADOR - THIRD AND FOURTE DEVELOPMENT BANKING PROJECTS
(LnANS 1359-EC AND 1731-EC)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Industrial Sector Lending Activity.  Between 1971 and 1983, the
Bank made a total of seven loans to the Republic of Ecuador in support of the
industrial sector - broadly defined to include manufacture, agro-industrv,
fishery and small scale and artisan enterprises. These loans amounted to
almost USS215 million (net of cancellations). Five development banking loans
were channeled through an expanding system of development finance companies
(DFCs) to help finance medium and larger size industrial enterprise. Two
Rank loans (amounting to USS60  million) were channeled to artisans and small
scale enterprises (SSEs) through an SSE proiect unit (FOPINAR), established
as a second tier discount facility, in the Corporacion Financiera Nacional
(CFN), a Government-owned DFC. In addition, IFC made a small investment
(USS500,000) in Compania Financiera 'Fcuatortana de Desarrollo S.A.
(COFIEC),Fcuador's largest private DVF.  This Project Completion Report
reviews Loans 1359-EC and 1731-EC, the Third and Fourth Development Banking
Projects in Ecuador. These loans to the Republic of Ecuador were channeled
mainly through CFN and COFIEC. Several newly established nFCs, which
ultimately cualified to participate in the projects, used about 10% of the
Third and almost 18% of the Fourth Loan.
1.02      The Rank's First and Second Development Ranking Projects (Loans
721-EC and 930-EC), totaling USS28 million, were approved in December 1970
and June 1973, respectively. By June 30, 1976, almost 100% of the loan
resources had been approved for subloans for a wide variety of industrial
projects. More than half of the projects were for natural resource-based
industries in line with Ecuador's comparative advantages. A project
performance audit report (PCR) was prepared for the first two projects
(Report No. 2530 of June 1979). This report concluded that the projects were
successful in achieving their objective of increasing long term financing to
industry and in helping both CFN and COVIF.C, the main users of these
resources, to develop into stronger and more mature institutions with
improved subproject appraisal and supervision capabilities.  The PCR
recommended that, under futture DFC projects, more should he done to develop
Ecuador's capital market as a means of aiding domestic resource mobilization

rates that had been the focus of Bank attention.l/
1.03      Macroeconomic Setting and Sector Performance.  The Bank initiated
its first industrial lending operation in Ecuador in 1971 when the orocess of
transforming the economy from a predominantly agricultural to an increasingly
urbanized one was accelerating, and the roles of manufacture, commerce and
services were beginning to expand (Annex I, Table 1). During the decade of
1972-1982, as the Bank's first four industrial credit projects dishursed,
Ecuador experienced an almost 8% p.a. real growth in GDP, which was fueled bv
Government revenues from petroleum exports.I/ Real per capita GnP rose from
UJSS840 in 1972 to US$1500 in 1982, and about half of Ecuador's population,
mainly those living in urban centers, experienced real gains in their
welfare.
1.04      Manufacturing led Ecuador's growth during 1972-1982, increasing at
an average rate of 9.5%. Textiles and mineral products accounted for 22% and
13.52 of total growth while the food, beverage and tobacco sectors increased
by 8.5% p.2. and, together, accounted for a total of 35% of the growth of
manufacture. Ecuador's strategy for rapid growth through industrialization
appeared to he working, but, verhaps, at the expense of domestic agriculture,
which grew little (Annex 1, Table 2). Employment in manufacture grew at
about 4% p.a., while overall sector productivity increased at a high 5% n.a.
rate, as a result of increased capital intensification, better trained
management and technical staff, and improvements in transport and
communications infrastructure. All of these factors contributed to the high
63% growth in output per man hour during the decade and to the sector's
ability to operate profitablv, to expand investment, and to increase wage
rates.
1.05      GDP growth slowed to 4.5% p.a. in 1981 as petroleum prices and
demand for Ecuador's key commodity exports weakened, foreign exchange
constraints developed and the heretofore substantially stable parallel
foreign exchange rate began to rise well above the official rate. For the
first time since 1974, private sector Investment suffered a decline (26Z).
In 1982, the current account deficit of the balance of payments again
exceeded TJSS1 hillion, as it had in 1981.  Between 30% and 402 of this
deficit was financed by increased indebtedness of the private sector in the
1/  Under the Third Development Banking Project, the Rank had alreadv
attempted initial steps in this direction. The Loan Agreement called for
the Government to set up an office which would ultimately recommend ways
of strengthening Ecuador's capital market. Disagreement within Ecuador,
concerning under whose auspices the office would function, ultimately
prevented its establishment.
2j  Manufacture accounted for 20% of the real increase in (DP in the neriod
from 1970 through 1982. Petroleum accounted for 23% of real growth while
agriculture accounted for only 7.5X. Commerce and services (excluding
public administration) added 16% and 14% respectively to real GDP growth.

form of direct foreign debt or debt surported by guarantees from Ecuador's
commercial banks and DFCs. These guarantees financed short, as well as
medium and lon- term investments, including a portion of the boom in
commercial and residential construction. 3/ Ay early 1q82, DFCs had
accumulated an estimated TJS$100 million in direct foreign debt and ahout
US$320 million equivalent in guarantees of their clients' foreign debt.
1.06      Bv 1982, real growth in GDP was a low 1.7% as natural disasters,
low oil prices and closing international markets all combined to affect
Ecuador's economy negatively.4/ To stem the drain on Central Bank foreign
exchange reserves, the Sucre was devalued by about one-third (from S/25 -
US$1 to S/33 = USS1) at the end of 1982, just as the last portion of Loan
1731-EC was being disbursed. At that time, the level of direct and
contingent foreign exchange obligations held by the private sector increased
from about S/15.6 billion to S/20.6 billion. With high inflation, continued
shortages of domuestic credit, sharp declines in availability ot foreign
credit and a reduction in the supply of basic commodities necessary to fuel
Ecuador's agro-industries, the heretofore buoyant economy fell into a deeo
recession. In 1983, Ecuador experienced a 3.3% decline in CDP, along with a
7% per capita decline in consumption as prices accelerated from the
acceptable 10 to 15% experienced during the 197Os and early 1980s to about
50% p.a.
1.07     The subprojects financed by the Rank under the Third and Fourth
loans from mid-1978 through the end of 19R2, experienced sharp changes in
their uaderlying economic and business environments. Furthermore, Andean
markets (mainly Colombia, Peru and Venezuela) closed their doors to a variety
cf wood, leather, textile, metal and electrical/mechanical enterprises
established to serve them. In that overall recessionary business cycle
context, with foreign debt to the private sector through DFCs and commercial
banks inflated to about S/45 billion by further devaluations, the
3/ The shortage of foreign exchange and Governmental expansionary fiscal
policies crowded the private sector out of the tightened credit market.
Tne prevailing view of enterprises was that the Covernment would not
devalue; thus, enterprises reverted to dollar borrowing.
4/ In 1982, there was a sharp loss in fish vroduction and agriculture
production because altered ocean temperatures and weather conditions
created combinations of catastrophic floods and drought. These resulted
in losses of 222 of banana exports, 50% of cocoa and 41% in fish
products. Cotton, corn and other food grain and horticultural
production were also sharply affected, and food and other prices rose
sharply.

nFCs, along with most commerci-qi hanks, suffered a series of sharp financial
reversals as their loan portfolios deteriorated and thetr earnings hases
eroded along with their capital structures (Annex 4). To prevent a possible
failing of the financial svstem, the Government took steps to "sucretize" the
registered private foreign debt, which was converted into Sucre loans from
CRE to the banking system and matching Sucre obligation hy private industry
and commerce to the banking system.
1.08      Since the earlv 1960s, Ecuador's industrialization model and
incentive structure have been based mainly upon fostering import-substitution
industry. It is not surprising that industrial projects have proved to he
relativelv highlv dependent upon imported inputs, capital intensive and with
a low degree of export orientation (para 3.05). The use of an economic rate
of return (EMR) calculation for most Rank-financed projects under the Third
and Fourth loans was designed to filter ot1t Projects that could not produce
reasonably efficiently in world terms and, thus, to neutralize the negative
effects of industrfal policy. In that connection, since 1982 the Bank has
engaged the Government in substantive dialogue regarding industrial policy
under Loan 2096-EC (the Fifth Industrial Project). Policy improvements for
the sector are critical to the prospects of the Rank advancing additional
industrial projects. The new Government, which took office in August 1984,
has begun to maKe efforts to foster more efficient industrial development.
It has taken measures designed to ultimatelv unify the foreign exchange
market. has adopted a managed flexible rate regime (currently S/96 = US$1)
and has eliminated about one-third of the existing imDort restrictions.
1.09      Monetarv Policies and Capital Market Development.  Fcuador's
interest rate, exchange rate and fiscal policies of the past decade gave, and
still give, its citizens little incentive to place their savings in either
the commercial banking or the DFC svstem, or in Sucre-denominated financial
instruments. Ecuador's under-developed capital market system results from a
lack of firm policy regarding resource mobilization as well as: (a) the
country's still under-developed system of commercial banking which limits
commercial paper activity; (b) inadeanate regulatory, reporting and
supervision activity; (c) lack of insurance programs to protect depositors;
(d) insufficient corporate financial reporting and poor accounting and
auditing;and (e) lack of effective administration capable of enforcing
compliance with appropriate regulations. Inadequate disclosure rules further
inhibit the development of a broader market for commercial paper, eouity or
debt instruments. At the same time, the relatively low fixed interest
structure has stimulated levels of borrowing far heyond possible financial
savings, inducing Ecuadoran firms to seek credit abroad, thus increasing the
country's foreign exchange obligations and inhibiting domestic savings and
resource mobilization. These financial policies and institutional
inadequacies were unsustainable in the long run: they succeeded in the decade
from 1972 to 1982, while the p.,blic and private sectors could borrow abroad,
and collapsed when the international commercial banks closed their doors to
Ecuador.

1.10      The Fcuadoran banking svstem had only modest success in marshalling
Private deposits during the decade from 1972 through 1983.  The high real
growth of the F.cuadorian economv during the 1970s was not accompanied by a
corresponding use oF monev and savings deposits. Money supply relative to
CMfP grew modestlv during the early 1970s, peaked during 1976-1978, and then
fell. During 1q72-19R3, demand deposits grew at 7X per year in real terms,
while time and savings deposits actuially fell. During this period, however,
the private se.!tor increased investment by almost 10% per year in real
terms. The fLancial svstem was, therefore, financing a rapidly growing
economy while its ability to capture financial resources domestically was
sharplY limited.5/
1.11      nFCs became increasingly important as sources of credit to the
private sector in the period from 1q72 through 1983 as they dramatically
increased their share of credit to the private sector from 10.5% to 18.4%
of the total (Annex 1, Table 3). DFCs sharply expanded their resources from
S/620 million (ITSS24.R million equiivalent) to 8/37,000 million (rTSS422
million equivalent)61 from 1974 through 1983. Abouit two-thirds of this
change in their resource base occurred in 1982 and 1983 when total
liabilities of the system increased by S/21,60n million. Almost
three-quarters of this increase is accounted for by a massive increase in
DFCs' liabilities to CBE resulting from the program of -Sucretization'
(para. 1.07) and the inabilitv of DFCs to mobilize resources under the
existing interest rate policv. Thus, CBE currently provides almost 57% of
the total resources of the DFC system and controls its future.
51   CRE hecame the major source of credit expansion (Annex 1, Table 2).
During the 1970s, CBF was the major source of funds for state banks and
DFCs.  Thereafter, the dvnamic commercial hanking system also became
highly dependent upon CBE, which, by 1983, accounted for more than
one-third of commercial hanks' stock of credit.
6/   Using the free market exchange rate of USS1.00 = S/98.  The official
exchange rate In December, 1983 was S/54 = ITSS1.00.

1.12      Consistent with the disappearance of term resources and industry's
need for working capital rather than new plant and equipment, DFCs'
short-term Sucre lending also expanded sharply (S/13,600 million).
The net effect of these major changes in financial structure has varied among
DFCs (Annex 4).The svstem as a whole is now highly leveraged (debt/equity
ratios for DFCs range from 15 to 1 to 25 to 1) and volatile as reflected in
the deteriorating loan portfolios. Thus, the major effects of devaluation
and recession have been to alter the structure and soundness of the DFC
system. The effects of Ecuador's restrictive credit and financial policy
(including interest rates) have been to reduce the liquidity and
profitability of the financial system and increasinglv to turn -he private
DFCs and CFN into supplicants at CBE's discount windows.

II. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Loan Preparation
2.01      The Third project T(Loan 1359-EC) was intended to continue to build
on the achievements of the first two projects by providing term resources to
the industrial sector, expanding the size and scope of development finance
company activity and improving nFC capabilitv to appraise and supervise
projects. The Third project dealt witi the interest rate policV and its
effect upon resource mobilization and, for the flrst time, shifted the Bank's
focus to overall capital market objectives. These issues were identified and
properly dealt with during appraisal. The Third project advanced smoothly,
from the preparation and Loan Committee stages through negotiations. The
terms approved by the Loan Committee prior to negotiations (November 1976)
were accepted by the Ecuadorians with only two minor departures: (a) CFN's
proposal that )VCs be allowed to charge commissions at one percentage point
below the maximum allowed by the G,overnment regulations; and (b) the CRE's
proposal that CBE foreign exchange risk coverage fee be increased from the
Bank's proposed 1.5% to 2%. The acceptance of these points established a
basis for an average minimum financial spread for DFCs of about 3%. The
Fourth DFC project was intended to continue building upon the institutional
gains achieved under the first three projects while focusing more fully on
the achievement of capital market objectives. During preparation and loan
negotiations, the Bank proposed that CBE establish a second tier facility
which wouild inter alia: help determine eligibilitv under the loan of new
DFCs, approve their participation in the program, and review and approve
subprojects submitted hv eligible new DFCs for Bank approval.  CUE did not
accept this proposal indicating that its professional and management staff
was more than fullv occupied with operational work (para 4.04).  The Bank
accepted CBE's position and agreed to shoulder responsibility for subloan
review as well as for supervision of the eligibility of individual
financieras.
Loan Objectives
A. The Third Loan Sought to:
(i) Assist industrial sector growth bv providing long term
financing on reasonable terms and conditions to cover
foreign exchange costs of acceptable projects.
(ii)  Strengthen DFC's institutional capability to appraise the
financial and economic merits of industrial projects and
thelr supervision thereof.
(iii) Enbance the ability of the financial system to mobilize
and lend term resources by providing adequate interest
and commission rates, and financial spreads, as well as
limiting DFC short term operations.
(iv) Contribute to the development of the capital market.
B. The Fourth Loan Sought to:
(i) Stimulate development of an economically efficient
capital market so that financial institutions can



-8-
mohilize effectively and channel increasing amounts of
medium and long term resources.
(ii)  Encourage financieras to use additional resources to
finance efficient term investment projects.
(iii)  Promote competition in resource mobilization and lending
activity and achieve greater dispersion of Bank funds
(presumablv geographic and sectoral) by making them
available to qualified new financieras.
2.02      with regard to the industrial credits granted und%r the Third and
Fourth loans, it was expected that the proceeds of both loans would be used
to finance mainly larger and medium size companies, with a maximum of US$3
million of Bank funds to anv individual project and with an aggregate of not
more than US$5 million in Rank funds to any individual firm, and that a
substantial portion of the funds disbtrsed would go to finance resource-
oriented industries with backward linkages to agriculture or fisheries. The
Fourth loan estimated that about 80 subprojects would be financed, with an
average use of IUSS500,0M in Bank funds. The Third loan projected an average
ERR of 30Z, while the Fourth loan estimated an average ERR of over 20% and
that Rank funds would be used to finance about US$160 million (25%) in total
Investment.
2.03      With regard to development of sound DFCs:
(i)  Both loans projected that the financial spreads available
under the Bank loans would be adequate to provide profitable
operations for the DFCs when considered in conjunction with
the 8 to 1 debt/equity (D/E) ratio provided for under the
Third loan and the 8 to 5 to 1 to 10 to 1 D/E ratios
prescribed under the Fourth loan.
(ii)  TJnder the Fourth loan, special provisions were made to protect
CFN from assuming excessive foreign exchange risk. Under the
Third loan, special efforts would be made by CnFIEC to improve
its financial forecasting and budgeting procedures.
(iii)  Both loans provided for continued assistance to DFCs to help
them imDrove project appraisal and supervision processes.
Development of Capital Market
2.04      Capital market develepment was an objective of both loans.  The
Fourth loan specified that the process would be advanced by the establishment
of a svecial Capital Markets Study Unit (CMSTJ) within CRE which would carry
out the five major policy, legal, and regulatory or technical studies within
a 13-to-14 month period. The studies with first priority dealt with
(a) interest rate policy (liberalization), (b) resource mobilization and
(c) examination of methods to transfer foreign exchange risks to final
borrowers through a possible dollarization of loans financed with foreign
credit lines. The studies with second priority were scheduled to deal with
the whole range of issues affecting operations of capital market institutions



-9-
(security exchanges, etc.), giving greatest attention to defining more
clearly the specialized roles of the various financial institutions.
2.05      High long range henefits to Ecuador's economv were anticipated from
the successful completton of the proposed capital market studies and Lhe
appropriate reform that would follow. The risk envisioned was the
possibility that CNSIT would be slow to he formed and to get studies
under way. To minimize that risk, the establishment of CMSU was a condition
for Board presentation. Regarding institution-building objectives, no
specific technical assistance program to DPCs was proposed. The major users
of Bank funds ("FN and  OWIEC) were iudged to be strong and mature
institutions and that sYN would play a role in helping new financieras, and
that additional required assistance to TFCs, if any, wotild be provided during
Bank supervision and project preparation.
2.06      The extent to which these objectives were achieved is described in
Chapters 3 and 4 following.
III. UTILIZATION OF LOAN PROCEEDS
3.01      Resource Transfer.  Ecuador's Third Development Banking Loan,
1359-EC (USS26.0 million), was signed on February 18, 1977 and became
effective on August 9, 1977 after the Government, CBE and the DFCs had
completed the lengthy process of internal contracting and the clearing of
legal opinions. The US$26 million loan was initially allocated among CFN
(ISS13 million), COFIEC (USSIO million) and five newly created financieras
USS3 million). CFN and COFIEC committed their original project funds
rapidly and, after a slow start, disbursed them within six months of the
original disbursement schedule. The project closing date was extended twice,
however, at successive six-month intervals until June 30, 19R2, in order to
accommodate the delayed participation of the new financieras identified in
the appraisal report as Potential participants.' To assure fulfillment of
the project objective of Advancing the development of the new financial
intermediaries, the project was modified to permit these fFCs to access Bank
funds through CFN, which assisted them in meeting the conditions of
participation that initially proved to he too strict. It took from mid-1978
to mid-1980 to finalize agreements affecting the participation of the new
financieras, which ultimatelv disbursed their allocated portion of the loan
in mid-1982.
3.n2      Thirty-three subloans were financed under Loan 1359-EC, of which
CFN partially financed 9 investment projects totaling UJS$80 million, using
almost tTSS12.8 million of its USS13 million. The average bank loan per
project financed by CFN was a higher-than-anticipated USS1.42 million (See
(Annex 3, Tahles 1-6, for distribution of loans by type and size). COFIEC's
ITSS10.5 million disbursements under the loan were spread among 11 projects,
of which six consumed more than 85% of Rank funds and the average loan size
amounted to a high US$1.07 million. The new financieras used almost USS2.7
million of the loan to finance 13 medium size projects.



- 10 -
3.03      The Fourth Development Ranking Project (Loan 1731-EC), amounting to
US$40 million, was signed on necember 17, 1979. Disbursement started later
than anticipated during appraisal, again due to Ecuador's slow process of
drafting and approving internal agreements. Once the project finally
achieved effectiveness in September 1980, commitments and disbursements
surged, and the Fourth loan was fully committed by the DFCs by December 1980
and disbursed by December 1982, essentially in line with appraisal
expectation. The accelerated pace of commitment and disbursement under Loan
1731-EC is notable because the Bank raised its overall performance
requirements on subproject evaluation. For the first time, participating
DFCs began applying more complex economic analysis principles to their larger
Bank-funded subprojects, thereby becoming the first financieras among
Rank-assisted institutions to do so. ERR calculations initially Dosed some
methodological difficulty for participating institutions, which often
calculated border prices incorrectly and, less commonly, underestimated
shadow wages, insurance and other economic costs. During subproiect review
and supervision of the Fourth loan, Bank staff focused upon helping DFCs to
improve their overall understanding of ERR analysis, and the technical
quality of the financiera system's economic analvsis did improve (para 3.07).
3.04      The Fourth loan financed 49 suhprojects.  The new financieras
successfully disbursed about 90% of the USS7 million reserved for them in the
Fourth loan for 9 subprojects . CFN used 522 of the loan proceeds and
exceeded its originally allocated USS18 million nuota bv US$2.24 million,
processing 24 projects averaging TTS$3.4 million in total project cost and
USS843,700 in Bank financiig per snbproject. COFIEC received TJS$12.3 million
of its appraised USS14 million share, which was applied to 16 subvrojects
averaging US$3.9 million in total project cost and US$768,800 in Bank
financing per subproject. Ninety-seven percent of the Fourth loan was
disbursed by the June 30, 1983 original closing date.
3.05      Distribution of Loans.  As with the first two DFC loans, subloan
recipients tinder Loans 1359-EC and 1731-EC were mainly in resource-based
sectors. Textiles and footwear, paper and wood products, foods and
beverages, and mineral and chemical products accounted for 85% of all
participating companies under the Third loan and 75% under the Fourth loan.
Under these loans, however, activity shifted toward newer, higher technology
import substitution projects and toward several major Andean Pact export-
oriented operations. Almost USS25 million in total project financing was
devoted to building new or incremental plant capacity to service the Andean
Pact market (see Annex III for summary listing of projects). Winancing of
metal trade and light machinery increased under the Fourth loan. Bv the
conclusion of the Fourth loan, the portfolio composition of CFY and COFIEC
had diversified substantially among eight sectors, in line with appraisal
expectations. This tendency to broaden the hase of industrial coverage was
mirrored in the aggregate data for the project, and no one sector received
more than 20% of the total. Under the Third loan, 55% of CFN loans went to
new firms, while COFIEC tended to maintain a somewhat more risk-average
profile relending about 72% of Bank funds to established enterprises. lJnder
the Fourth loan more than half of both institutions' lending went to existing
firms.



- 11 -
3.06      Overall investment decisions in Ecuador's industrial sector
reflected the relatively high incentives offered to import substitution
industry as compared with export activity (Annex 1). lJnder the Third loan,
about 27% of CFN and COFIEC lending went to finance export projects (mainly
Andean Pact), while their financing for export industry was sharply reduced
to only 5% under the Fourth loan. Given the over-valued exchange rate that
prevailed since mid-1981 and the reduced level of incentives to export, this
situation was not surprising. During loan supervisions, the anti-export
policy bias, as reflected in the operations of the Fourth project, was
identified, and policy discussions were held with the Government. The Bank
addressed industrial and export policy within the framework of the Fifth DFC
project (Loan 2064-EC), which established a minimum 20% quota for export
projects and, more important, initiated substantive industrial sector policy
discussions and prepared major sector studies. Discussions were initiated
with the Government in 1982 which substantially improved the Government's
understanding of the fiscal and economic costs of existing policy. Until the
onset of serious foreign exchange problems in 1983, good progress had been
made on tariff and export policy, especially with regard to exchange
liberalization. The policy dialogue has continued in the framework of
potential further Bank industrial sector lending.
3.07      Economic Rate of Return (ERR).   For COFIEC subprojects in the
Third loan, ERRs averaged about 35%. Estimated ERR's were somewhat lower for
the Fourth loan (about 27%), reflecting Bank supervision of COFIEC's ERR
estimation processes and improvements in their border and shadow pricing
technique and application of proper methodology. CFN's projections were more
consistent, more guarded (with a mid-range of about 25% for the Third and 26%
for the Fourth loans) and more evenly distributed. Ex Post ERR calculations
on a 20% sample of non-failed projects under the Fourth loan showed an
average ERR of 15% compared with the 28% average projected for the sample.
Overall, by the end of the Fourth loan, all participating financieras had
developed adequate economic analytical skills. CFN had developed a
computerized model (which was adopted subsequently by other DFCs). The
technical quality of most economic analysis work for subprojects received
under the Fifth loan was acceptable until mid-1983. Since then, a decline in
the quality and organization of the subprojects submitted has been recorded.
This decline appears to be due, first, to the high turnover rate among nFCs'
professional staff and, second, to a DFC management's inabilitv to focus upon
the quality of project appraisal work in the midst of their financial
difficulties.
3.08      The US$59 million of the rUSS66 million loaned by the Rank through
the Third and Fourth loans disbursed by CFN and COFIEC helped to mobilize
US$220.0 million from other sources (equity US$100.2 million, other banks'
and suppliers' credits US$72.2 million and CFN and COFIEC ITSS47.6 million)
and resulted in USS279 million in total investment projects, more than had
been anticipated during appraisal. The Bank financed 21% of total project
costs rather than the 25% assessed during appraisal.  Average subproject cost
was slightly higher than anticiDated. Eighty-two subprojects were actually
financed under the two loans averaging US$800,000, indicating that DFCs still
continued to market their resources among the larger rather than small and



- 12 -
medium scale enterprises. This tendencV was reversed substantially as a
result of the Bank's small scale enterDrise (SSE) credit projects in which
all major DFCs participated, with the exception of COFIEC. DFCs disbursed
about US$15 million in SSE credits for an average loan amount of about
USS125,000 in the period from mid-19R1 through 1983.
3.09      T-ith the exception of several major projects in Cuenca (resulting
from a one-time policy thrust to sharply increase the pace of industrializa-
tion of that area), almost all other Third and Fourth loan subprojects were
located in Quito or Guayaquil. This was to he expected given the existing
high focus of activity in those industrial centers, the location of major
DFCs in those cities and the linkages between DFC management and the major
industrial groups centered in the areas. CFN subsequently adopted a more
aggressive regional posture through new branch operations in five secondary
cities. As competition stiffened, DFC lending became more diversified, which
Is reflected in the Fifth DFC project and DFC operations in the SSE Loans,
under which more than half of the loans were made outside of the two major
cities.
3.10      Procurement Procedures.  Rarely questioned by the Bank during the
first three loans, vrocurement procedures were lore commonly brought to the
Financiera's attention during the course of the Fourth. The experience
gained under the Fourth loan was reflected in Improved supervision under the
Fifth DFC loan as DFCs were required to provide a more detailed and clear-cut
procurement statement. During supervision of the subprojects submitted to
the Bank for approval, the more exacting standards were more uniformly
applied, especially when there was not an obvious arms length relationship
between the borrower and the vendor. In such cases, even the small -B
subprojects were carefully reviewed, and appropriate questions were raised.
3.11      Project Preparation and Evaluation.  By the end of the Fourth DFC
Project, the financieras collectively suct:eeded in establishing and/or
strengthening their subnroject preparation capabilities and, on the whole,
improved the organization and the financial and economic content of their
evaluation procedures. Information forwarded to the Rank on each prospective
client for Fourth loan proceeds was more comprehensive, more detailed and
better organized than that which had been generated as a consequence of the
Third loan, reflecting the efforts made during supervision to upgrade the
overall quality, content and presentation of aporaisal documents. At the
same time, subloan evaluation by the intermediaries still tended to he
economics, engineering and production-cost-oriented. Reports tended to
approach the more subjective, hut critical, issues of markets, risks and
executive capability in a mechanical, and often naive way. Reports were
often thin, or poorly done, regarding (a) market prospects and risks,
(b) distribution issues, (c) competitive challenges and (d) quality of
management.  These shortcomings in pro7ect analysis proved to be critical to
the outcome of a substantial number of these projects subject to ex Post
reviews.

3.12     Current Status of Subproiects.  E.cuador's economv plunged into a
broad recessionarv trough at the end of 1Q82 (paras 1.06 and 1.n7) just as
manv of the major projects financed under Loans 1359-EC and 1731-EC sought to
produce and reach markets. As indicated on Table 2 below, five of the 33
Proiects financed under Loan 1359-F.C and one of the 49 projects financed
under Loan 1731-EC totally failed to achieve profitablA --erations and have
heen closed or are in the process of liquidation, major reorganization or
sale.  Failed subloans financed from the proceeds of the Third and Fourth
loans represent about 13% (ITSSR.3 million) of the almost fTSS65 million
disbursed under these two loans.7/ Tn addition, 16 subloans involving 13
firms are classified as in difficulty, and it Is highly unlikelv that any of
these proiects will achieve Positive financial or economic rates of return;
some of them mnav have to liquidate. This group accounts for UJSS13.4 million
(21X) of the almost UTSS65 million dishursed. Thus, fully 34X of the
resources disbursed under the Third and Fourth loans are, in economic terms,
lost or at risk. It is noteworthy that all hut one of the subprojects
classified as failed or in substantial difficulty were financed by COFIEC or
CFN.  To date, only one of the projects presented to the Rank by the new
financieras is reported to be in difficultv.

3.13      A number of the main reasons for project failure under the Third
and Fourth loans were identified by the PCR mission, which conducted detailed
reviews of the documents of 23 companies (Annex 3, Attachment 1) ineluding 16
firms which either failed or were in difficulty and 7 enterprises (control
group) whose proiects were advancing satisfactorily. These reviews were
supported bv field visits to 14 of the project sites where management was
7/   CFN reports that as of September 24, 1q85, two projects classified as
"Fai]ed are now in the process of rehabilitation and should be moved to
"In Difficultv classification. No further information on the nature of
the process was given.

interviewed and the condition of operations observed. This research effort
revealed that while the recession played a large role in reducing Project
Profitability, it turned out not to he the major canse of project
failure.8/ The major controllable, internal reasons were few in number:
(a) Marketing and/or distribution issues were often inadequately
or incorrectly addressed, which accounted for about 4nz of
problem projects. These inadequacies were not given
sufficient attention in Bank reviews.
(b) Management proved to be inadequate, and unable to plan for and
to execute, project startup or to run the enterprise once it
was under way, which accounted for about one-third of project
difficulties.9/
3.14      The main reasons for problem projects that were external to the
project but subject to risk analysis included: (a) shifts in Government
industrial or export incentive policy; (b) reduced public sector program
expenditures; tc) devaluation and sustained financial distress; and
(d) export market (Andean Pact) closings. (See Table I for summary of
reasons for project failure.) TFCs did not attempt to address or deal with
these risk features systematically in their subproject reviews. nften the
contrary was true.  Project appraisals proved that project viability was
assured because of the existence of Government programs that offered a secure
market. A high percentage of the problem projects reviewed in detail for the
PCR depended, in some measure, upon Government programs for their
profitability (export incentive subsidies, public construction programs or
Andean Pact arrangements).  The fact that a major risk is often associated
with these special arrangements was not discussed or evaluated.ln/ In one
subproject appraisal reviewed, the data indicated that almost 1ii07 of annual
profits would he accounted for in the early years by the 15X incentive rebate
on export (CAT). The repeal of this CAT and its subsequent reinstatement at
a lower level was one reason for the difficulty experienced hy this
subproiect.
8/   CFN emphasizes the importance of the economic crisis and other factors
external to the project evaluation for the ultimate failure of many
projects to achieve their projected results (Borrower's Comments, Annex
5, Paras. 2.1 - 2.2 and 3.1).
9/   CFN commented that management appraisal for new projects was often
incomplete because the managerial and senior technical staffs had not
yet heen engaged (or chosen) at the time of appraisal, and would not he
chosen until project start-up.
10/ These failings in Project appraisal methodology continued to applv in
the Fifth project.

3.15      There is no evidence that the Rank's subproject review, as
practiced in the Past, contrihuted toward preventing subproject failures.
The B"M subproiects, which are the smaller projects not generally reviewed in
substance by the Bank, have suffered fewer failures or difficulties than have
the large "A" subpro,iects, which receive substantive review by the Bank.
Part of the reason why past subproject reviews may not have made an effective
contribution toward identif-ing gaps in the vroject analysis process is that
at that time the Bank focused mainly on the quality of the economic
analysis. Bank reviews did not contribute much to identifying shortcomings
in the critical portions of project appraisal affectina markets,
distribution, management, and risks which proved to be critical to project
success or failure.
3.16      The mission found that only ln% of subprojects reviewed contained
an adequate examination and evaluation of the project's management team.
Most appraisals reviewed and commented on the project's financial sponsors or
directors, hut not the actual operating management team. This was not
surprising, because It would have involved the DFCs' professional staff in
making judgment on executives selected by the major financial and industrial
personages who sponsored the project. This is a difficult problem, and it is
not likely that such an analysis would he undertaken without (a) more direct
involvement of financial intermediaries in the projects that they finance and
(b) increased training of DFC loan officer staff and awareness of how to
judge management capability.
'A.17    It is not possible at this stage to forecast with precision the
losses that COFIEC and CFN may ultimately sustain as a result of the
performance of proiects they financed under the Third and Fourth loans since
many of the owners of the affected enterprises have continued to repay their
loans from other resources.11/ It is likely that a sizeable percentage of
the potential losses of principal and interest that the DFCs may ultimately
suffer could be offset by the proceeds from the sales of land, and plant and
equipment, which are the underlving guarantees for each project.
Nevertheless, economic losses of failed projects could be substantial.
TV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
4.fll     Capital Market Development.  A primary objective of the Third and
Fourth loans was to advance the development of a more effective capital
market to enable financial institutions and enterprises to mobilize and
11/ Only three of COFIEC's failed or difficult subproiects from Loans
1359-EC and 1731-EC were reported to he in arrears.  However, a number
of such proiects have been rescheduled and are still in doubt.

channel increased resources efficiently.12/ To help fulfill this very broad
objective, CRE established a capital markets study unit (CMST7) as a condition
for presentation of the Fourth loan to the Board. A comprehensive multi-stage
work program was agreed upon, and rMSTJ was staffed with two qualified young
professionals. It was hoped that the creation of CMSU would ultimately have
far-reaching effects upon research, policy formulation and institution
creation. Three events intervened:
(a) Despite the creation of CMSIT, the project was not firmly
institutionalized at the key senior professional levels. Agreements regarding
the program of study between the Rank and the reneral Manager of CBE and his
staff were not transmitted to the line managers responsible for CMSIJ activity.
Subsequently, CRE's General Manager resigned, CRE was reorganized and the line
managers were replaced. This process of change occurred at the general manager
and department director levels three more times from 1980 through 1983.  Since
the need for the capital market studies and their terms of reference proved to
he somewhat ambiguous, the impetus to get them done in the narrow 13-month
allotted timeframe was diminished, especially since accomplishing the
multi-disciplinary studv originally envisaged could have required much more
legal, accounting, financial and economic skills than were provided for. At
the time, CBE was neither staffed nor hudgeted to accomplish the complex study
pronosed.
(b) With sharp]y rising inflation, increased credit restraints and
emerging foreign exchange problems, the attention of CRE's senior monetary
policy staff focused full time upon the serious immediate problems arising from
the existing structure of inflexible and negative interest rates, multiple
exchange rates and the like.  CRE's most senior economists were requested to
prepare a paper directed toward resolution of these problems. This paper was
prepared outside of the formal structure of CMSU and CRE's agreement with the
Rank concerning prior review of terms of reference. The interest rate paper
was subsequently reviewed hy Rank staff during supervision; it was considered
to he incomplete in scope, narrow in content and not complying with the terms
of reference for the study. Retrospectivelv, although incomplete hy formal
research standards, this policy Paner on interest rates (directed to the
Monetarv Board) represented a breakthrough in financial policy formulation.
The paper proposed that Ecuador adopt, for the first time, a policy of gearing
its lending rate structure to a base rate which would approximate the market
rate for savings deposits.
(c) In spite of the difficulties in the way in which the capital market
study was being handled by CBE, progress was made for the first time on some of
the fundamental policy issues the study was designed to address. During
1982-1983, the frequency and quality of the Rank's policy dialogue with the
Government improved because of (a) the increased frequency of Rank/Government
12/  IJnder the First, Second and Third loans, financial sector policy dialogue
focused on the issue of expanded resource mobilization via-a-vis interest
rate reform. The Bank's Project Performance Audit Report--prepared in
connection with the first two proiects-concluded that the Rank should
focus increasingly on broader issues of developing Ecuador's capital
market. This broad, somewhat undefined, ohiective was picked up and
advanced during appraisal of the Fourth loan.

contact during the supervision of Loans 187Q-EC (SSE I) and Loan 2096-EC (Fifth
DFC prolect) and the preparation of Loan 2221-EC (SSE II) and (b) the
availability of financial and economic studies around which policv dialogue
could focus.  Bank project and program staff were deeplv engaged in a Joint
effort with the Ministry of Finance to establish estimates of the fiscal cost
of Ecuador's industrial policy and the fiscal costs (or savings) of policy
reforms. At the same time, discussions were being held with CRE on financial
policy issues. A report]3/ was prepared by Bank staff which resulted in a
focusing of attention on the major issues of resource mobilization and interest
rate policy. In that context, the more remote, broad-ranging capital market
development issues proposed for study under the Fourth loan hecame relatively
less important and were, in effect, abandoned.
4.02      Discussions on interest rate issues during the course of the Fourth
and Fifth DFC projects and the First SSE project resulted in agreements to
maintain interest rates on loans in real terms. Negotiations on broader
financial sector issues affecting resources mobilization were opened in August
1983, based upon the newly completed financia] sector review which had adopted,
in some measure, CBF's earlier staff proposal to move toward a more flexible
indexed interest rate regime pegged to a reference savings rate. Agreement on
reasonable progress on Ecuador's economic and financial policy was made a
condition for committing the final 3nx of the Fifth loan and the balance of the
Second SSE project. Government assurances on economic and financial policy
satisfactory to the Rank Managei'ent were given in September 1983 and these were
followed by a series of agreed upon interim actions in trade policy, exchange
and interest rate levels. In late 1984, under Ecuador's new administration,
CBE started working with USAID on the preparation of a study and program for
capital market improvement in Ecuador for the next decade.
4.03      Institution Building.  Since the Rank viewed, during loan
preparation, that it was dealing primarilY with two mature DFCs, neither the
Third nor the Fourth loans explicitly detailed prograws of technical assistance
to the DFCs.  CFN and COFIEC had adopted satsfactory policy statements and
were found during supervision, and confirmed by the PCR on the First and Second
vrojects, to be adequately organized and appropriately staffed and governed by
sound procedures. On that basis, it was assumed that the required assistance
to the new DFCs could be previded during periodic Rank supervision and/or as
the need would arise. Indeed, under the Third loan, CFN agreed to assist the
new DFCs in preparing subprojects and to review them prior to their submission
to the Rank for approval.
4.04      To further reduce the projected increase in Rank workload under the
Fourth project (it was assumed that six DFCs could present tip to en
subprojects) the Bank attempted to establish a second tier discount facility in
CBE to assess the eligibility of new financieras to participate in the program
and to Provide assistance to DFCs in subproject review and supervision. A
total of five supervisory technical assistance tasks were specified by the Rank
13/ Ecuador: A Brief Financial Sector Repoit (87 pages plus Annexes) was
prepared by J. Hanson, INDFD, based upon a March 1982 mission headed by
T. Butcheson and including J. Garcia Gaicia and R. Vogel (Consultants) and
operational missions in June and August 1983 headed by M. Stoller.

for the unit. The rationale for this scheme, according to the findings of the
appraisal mission, was that the alternative, expanding direct fank staff
supervision of DFCs and their subprojects, was not feasible because of manpower
constraints. However, as result of negotiations (para 2.01) the Bank accepted
to continue dealing directly with individual financteras.
4.05      Retrospectively, CBE's judgment was accurate regarding its capability
to serve as a subproject evaluation intermediary'4/ since there was little
prospect that it could hire local Protessional staff qualified to contribute
substantively to improving OFC project operations.15/ As a result of direct
Bank supervision under the Fourth loan, technical shortcomings in ERR
calculations were identified and corrected, and overall procedures for economic
calculations were improved.
4.06      No measurements were made of the amount of time artually spent by
Bank professional staff in the review of subprojects sent to the Rank for ap-
proval under the Fourth loan. However, starting in FY83, information was ga-
thered on staff time reported for the review of subproiects submitted under the
Fifth DFC proiect. These data indicate that, on average, one man-day of staff
time was devoted to the subproject review and approval process for each of the
23 projects over the free limit that were submitted to the Bank during an
approximate 18-month period in FYR3-84. Applying the Fifth loan's manpower
coefficient to the Fourth project, It would appear that between 25 to 30
man-days of staff time were devoted to free limit subproject review, which is a
significant application of staff time but may not have been as high as was
assumed during project appraisal. Had the Bank's subproject review process
included a detailed evaluation of the quality of the market, distribution, risk
14/ Bank staff, preparing Loan 1879-EC (SSE I) during June-September 1979,
carefully appraised the capability of CRE to operate an efficient second
tier facility to review subprojects and to provide technical assistance
and institutional support to participating financial intermediaries. The
mission concluded that CUE would not be an appropriate setting for such
activities.
15/  Detailed intervie.s were held with present and former CRE officials.
Rased upon their experience, CBE suffered from a shortage of highly
trained professional staff, reflecting Ecuador's lack of facilities for
advanced graduate training in economics and finance and the absence of an
advanced economics research facilitv. CRE's failure to deal with the
'studies of longer term monetary, financial or capital market issues is not
due to an absence of will, according to a former CRE General Manager, but
rather to the fact that the high level professional staff is limited to
four or five line managers and a few well trained assistants, all of whom
are devoted to running CRE's normal functions. When confronted with the
requirements to address inflation, devaluation, and a foreign exchange
crisis while preparing for the TMF, the World Rank and the Paris Club,
this former General Manager reported, the syster become3 overloaded, with
few, if any, prospects that longer term issues can be addressed. A
solution to the shortage of highly trained professionals lies in
developing more advanced training for professional staff and in the
creation of a well organized high level research and training facilitv
perhaps modeled after Brazil's Vargas Foundation and linked indirectly to
CBE.

and management capability analysis submitted by the PFCs, it is likely that the
manpower coefficient for subproject review could have doubled or even tripled.
Thus, the cost of subproject review could have been three or four man-months,
which could be substantial, considering that several active credit projects are
supervised at the same time. Among the alternatives which could be considered
to deal with the issues that have emerged would he (a) expanding efforts to
help develop, over time, an apex institution which could effectively deal with
eligibility and/or project appraisal issues; (b) expanding existing in-house
review efforts, over the medium term, based upon a new system of deeper
analysis of subprojects, on a smaller sample basis, using Rank staff with
augmented skills and training to deal with the review of the quality of
marketing management and other proiect issues; (c) expanding technical
assistance for financial intermediaries in areas of marketing and distribution
analysis, management evolution and financial analysis of projects; and (d) the
"without addtional manpower case, reducing the scope and the depth of DFC and
financial market development activities in Ecuador in the absence of a
qualified apex institution, limiting lending activities to two or three
intermediaries. All these alternatives are being examined for potential future
DFC type lending.
4.07      Financiera System.  The Bank fostered competition among DFCs by
making Bank funds available to the new financieras which met the Bank's
qualifying conditions. By mid-1982, three new DFCs (ECUFINSA, FINANSA and
FIDASA) accessed 1S! of the Bank's Fourth DFC loan, and the number was further
extended to five by the Fifth loan under which these new financieras commited
36% of the USS58.8 million available. Clearly by one measure, use of Bank
funds, the new financieras had substantially increased their relative
importance in the DFC svstem compared with that of CFN and COFITC. Viewed in
terms of financial power by mid-1984, the new financieras enjoyed an estimated
527 share of the total resources (liabilities and capital) available to the DFC
svstem, compared with 35! in 1982.
4.08      As expected, competition among DFCs changed the face of DFC lending
activity and mav, in the end, make for a more diversified financial system.
Results show that suhprojects financed under the Fifth loan are smaller and
more geographically dispersed, thus, an objective of broadening and deepening
the base of DFC lending has been achieved in substantial measure. Competition
did not help COFIEC or rFN, which lost a share of the term lending market and
exclusive access to term resources, as well as professional staff to the new
DFCs. There is evidence that larger industrial borrowers used the new
competitive situation to negotiate more highly leveraged loans or to provide
less adequate guarantees for projects financed. These facts may have been
reflected in subproject reviews under the Fifth loan in which Bank staff
questioned leverage ratios associated with loans to major industrial
companies. Retrospectively, prior to encouraging increased DFC competition,
the Bank could have required assurances on two major institutional issues:
first, that the Government's supervisory authorities were equipped to extend
the additional supervision and portfolio review that would be appropriate to
the new competitive banking environment; and second, that DFCs had established
internal credit risk management systems with appropriate supervision and agreed



- 21 -
upon policies and procedures so that adequate loan conditions would he
maintained in the face of competition for clients, and that excessive exposure
to foreign exchange risk be avoided through limiting the growth of so-called
contingent liahility operations.
4.n9      By 1983, Rank loans to the major participating DFCs accounted for
about 10% to 35% of their total term borrowings and were a significant
component of DFCs' resource structure and income base. The financial charges,
spreads and fees provided for under the Third and Fourth loans have proved to
he inadequate to cover costs of DFC operations (including adequate provisions)
and provide TFCs with a minimnum acceptable return on equity.  Financial spreads
(the margin between average borrowing and effective lending rates) under the
Third and Fourth loans, ranged from 3.559 to 4.10Z and 3.3Z to 3.5% p.a. DFC
operating costs ranged between about 2.2Z and 2.5% on average assets and
provisions of about 1Z were needed to supDort potential portfolio losses. On
that basis, net earnings on the Bank financed assets would have ranged between
a high 1.1% and a low of .01X for the Third loan and 3% and -.3% under the
Fourth loan. For the DFCs to have earned a 16X nominal return on equity (a
zero return on equitv in real terms) during lQ8l-82, Bank supplied assets
should have on average yielded 1.78! net under the Third loan, with its 8 to 1
D/E ratio, and from 1.68% to 1.45% net under the Fourth loan given the 8.5 to 1
to 10 to I D/E ratios established for the project. To have achieved these
minimum returns on equity would have required that financial spreads of between
5.0% and 5.2% be Provided for under the Third and Fourth loans. For DFCs to
have earned a moderate 4% real return on equity, the loans should have provided
for effective spreads of about 6%. Thus, the Rank's loan did not contribute
adequately to DFC profitability and strengthening of their financial
structures. 16/
4.10      Financial Condition of DFCs.  The financieras participating in the
Fourth project all started 1981 with debt equity ratios of less than 10 to 1
and relatively tight liquidity ratios (ranging from 1.3 for the two oldest DFCs
and ahout 1.8 for the newer p.-rticipants). With few investments or real estate
holdings, most private DFCs were subject to the effects of inflation. By
September 1983, the effects of devaluation, recession, reduced consumer demand
and public sector investments, all impacted upon industry's ability to meet
debt service Pavments on projects financed by DFCs, and the financial
statements of DFCs reflected a sharply declining stream of revenues and
income. A detailed financial analysis of DFCs prepared by a Bank supervision
mission (Loan 2096-EC, September 1983) showed that all private DFCs
participating in the Fifth Loan were in violation of the required 10 to I
debtfequitv ratio and most had sharply reduced equitv positions. The mission
16/ CFN comments (Annex 5, Para. 2.3) that the Bank should liberalize its
lending terms to permit DFCs to recycle loan funds. At present, IDF staff
is generallv suggesting the use of fixed amortization schedules to replace
composite schedules which has created some cash flow problems, given the
high percentage of sub-borrowers that delay their repayments during
adverse economic periods.



- 22 -
reported to the Bank that despite the very positive efforts made by all DFCs to
increase their equity, the situation could deteriorate further, and it
recommended that the Bank continue to disburse the remaining balance of the
loan providing that: (a) the Government, as guarantor, was advised regarding
the condition of each DFC and would not object to the proposal; and (b) the
Ministry of Finance (MF) would coordinate with the Superintendent of Ranks, who
had assured the Bank that none of the DFCs were intervened, and that MF would
be advised if any DFC suffered more rapid deterioration than was expected.
4.11      During the period from the end of 1983 through mid-lq84, the Bank
maintained close supervision of the DFC system. A detailed report of November
1984, covered the financial condition of each of the financieras currentlv
participating in the Fifth loan (or having participated in the Fourth). The
financial reports of DFCs as of December 31, 1983 and June 3n, 19R4 reflect
continued deterioration in their debt/equity ratios but some small
improvements in their cash positions since mid-1983.  Annex 4, Attachment 1,
contains a summary analysis of the financial condition of the major DFCs
participating in the projects.
4.12      Auditing and Financial Reporting.  Ouali'ied audit firms annually
prepared audit reports for the participating financial intermediaries. The
quality of these revorts has improved notably since 1982 as the DFCs' auditors
have taken measures to improve the content, form and arrangement of their re-
Ports. Where the accounts of the borrowers have not been maintained in accor-
dance with the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) due to
Superintendent of Bank (SB) regulations, the auditors have increasingly
included expanded and detailed notes in explanation. Bank supervision missions
have, in the past several years, worked closelY with the major accounting firns
and with the Superintendent of Ranks (SB), (who sets accounting standards and
dictates the form of financial statements), to improve the content and quality
of financial reports.
4.13      Technical assistance to SB was made available under the Fifth DFC
loan to help improve accounting and, ultimately, regulatory practices. The
Bank also reached agreement with SB that it would (a) prepare summary reports
on DFCs annually, (b) provide semi-annual statistical (ratios) information on
each of the DFCs and (c) report monthly on the eligibility of DFCs under the
project.
4.14      Supervision of Projects.  The mission reviewed iT' detail the files
for 23 enterprises which had been financed by the Bank through CFN and COFIEC
under the Third and Fourth loans in order to determine the degrees to which
these files reflected an orderly process of subloan management by the major
users of Bank funds.17/ A second Purpose was to determine the degrees to
17/  Subproject files of FINANSA and ECUFINSA were also reviewed.  The latter
files were well maintained on a current hasis in a unified formae
particular to commercial banks. FINANSA files were split among functional
departments but were reasonably current regarding financial status.

which there existed ample formal communication of information within these
large and geographically dispersed organizations. At the time of the mission's
visits,only four of the 23 projects reviewed contained current information on
project status.  Many projects had no recent financial statements on file.18/
Some projects had no financial information whatsoever in their supervision
files. However, information on a number of the companies reviewed did exist
outside of the formal information file process. Based upon the condition of
the 23 files reviewed (see Annex 4 for details), it was clear that neither CFN
nor COFIEC had developed adequate client or credit management information
systems.19/ One result of the lack of timely client financial reporting and
the lack of formal responsibility for client nroject performance was that DFCs'
professional staff members were not alerted to the financial difficulties faced
by their clients and rarelv hecame parties to the prompt resolution of their
problems.
4.15      Both CFN and COFIEC had heen structured organizationally so that
their loan review and approval processes were sevarate and apart from their
loan administration and supervision operations. Under their organizationa].
models, no provision exists for the continuity of professional responsibility
for individual orojects (or for clients). Thus, a very high premium is placed
upon the role of written communication b-tween the project evaluators and the
project administrators so that information concerning projects may he returned
and used by the DFCs over the life of a Project. There is no evidence in the
files that this creation and transfer of information occurred.
4.16      Ecuador's major DFCs tend to play relatively passive roles in the
current business affairs of their clients.  Supervision exercised by DFCs is a
stand-alone function not integrated into credit management or the client
advisory and marketing processes. The PCR mission noted at least two cases
wherein timely advice and informed intervention hy trained financial
professionals could have assisted industrial companies resolvo, at earlv
stages, what later became intractable problems. Substantial efforts should be
made by the Bank, 'n the course of future DFC lending operations, to help PFCs
to create appropriate organizational platforms from which the DFC svstem could
play a role as advisor and as consultant to their clients. This could mean
higher fees and spreads for services performed, but the importance of skilled
advisory and followup services for clients, and close corporate involvement
with clients, has been made clear as a result of the findings of this PCR.
18/  CFN's comments (Annex 5, Paragraph 3.3) that several of the subprojects
financed under the Third and Fourth Bank loans have obtained new loans and
that more up-to-date supervision and financial data are available for
these companies in CFN's project files.
19/ A technical assistance program to meet CFN's need for management
information was financed under Loans 2096-EC and 2221-EC and has not yet
been implemented. Clearly the same need, which had not yet been
identified, exists within COFIEC.

V. SUI'kARY AND CONCLUSIONS
5.01      The Third and Fourth DFC projects are being reviewed in a unique
context. The Ecuadorian economy and its financial system are in distress.
Major bidden postulates underlving the design of the Third and Fourth projects
were that the economy would continue to grow at a modest upward trajectorv for
an indefinite period and that there would be no major devaluations of the sucre
relative to the dollar. These postulates have proven not to be the case, and
all projections made for the projects are substantially off center.
5.02      Ecuador's DFCs were designed to operate in a growing economy, with
low levels of husiness failure and under a stable exchange rate regime. The
financial structure of the DFC system had been kept relatively Inflexible, and
the role that the DFCs were able to play in the financial market was restricted
in part by the underlying legislation and interest rate policy and in part by
the terms and conditions established under Bank loans. The overall limits
placed by the Bank on short term lending and commercial paper operations have
retrospectively tended to reduce DFCs' profit-making potential and to operate
against capital market expansion. DFCs' vulnerability to business cycle change
was increased. On the other hand, neither the Government nor the Bank was
fully alert to the dangers involved in DFCs' mounting exposure to foreign
exchange loan guarantees, which, to a substantial extent, financed imports of
capital goods for domestic resale, local construction projects or non-dollar
earning import substitution projects. Thus, these non-dollar generating
guarantees proved to be highly vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations, and
the risks inherent in these expanding guarantee operations were not fully
considered (para 4.08).
5.03      The structure of financial spreads granted to DFCs under the Third
and Fourth loans proved to he inadequate, in many cases, to cover costs of DFC
operations, provisions for loan losses and to provide for a reasonable return
on equity (para 4.09).  If we draw a lesson from this experience, future
appraisals of DFC projects should demonstrate how the Bank loan would be
expected to contribute to the financial objectives of the DFCs by showing,
inter alia, that the net return to DFCs, from Bank-provided assets, could yield
a satisfactory stipulated return on the DFCs' equity tinder the debt/equity
ratio conditions provided for in the financial covenants. Tn this context,
DFCs should be expected to develop, in addition to normally required Policy
statements, a strategy for medium term growth together with underlying
financial vlans for achieving these financial goals. This strategy would
provide for alternative financial services and products to increase
institutional strength and profitability.



- 29 -
5.04      DFCs made a substantial number of questionable loans under the Third
and Fourth (para 3.12) proiects because (a) their market and distribution
analysis were often weak; (h) the risks in lending to industries highly
dependent upon Government tax or export-Incentive policy programs were not
properly examined; and (c) the capacity of actual project management to handle
their new or expansion projects successfully was rarely reviewed with the
required depth. TFCs tended to lend to the larger, well established industrial
and financial groups or Individuals hased upon their known ability to provide
guarantees.
5.05      The calculations and presentations of the economic rates of return
proiected for proiects improved throughout the course of the Third and Fourth
loans (para 3.n7), and little needed to be done in the area of economic
analysis that could not be handled during supervision or subproject review.
Recently, the quality of ERR analvsis is reported to have deteriorated as staff
turnover in TFCs has Increased, and the Rank will be advised to focus on
assistance in economic analysis once again. Based upon PCR findings, DFCs
still require guidance and technical assistance in helping to improve project
analysis in the critical areas of marketing, distribution, planning and project
executive staffing. In view of manpower constraints, expanding technical
assistance to, or dealing directly with individual DFCs in future DFC-type
lending will present staffing and operational problems. Four identified
alternatives are heing exarined (para 4.n6).
5.n6      The Bank made a major contribution toward improving the quality of
financial and industrial sector dialogue during 1982-1984 by helping F.cuadorian
auithorities to better understand the costs and benefits of alternative policies
and hy framing the dialogue in the context of sharply focused and well prepared
studies (paras 4.01-4.02). Given Ecuador's constraints on professional
manpower, it is not likelv that major research efforts of the type designed for
the Fourth project cousld be accomplished under one cover and over the life of a
single project. The studies of issues affecting financial policy and
industrial sector policy conducted in the context of the Fifth DFC and Second
SSE loans provide a better anproach to continued progress toward policy
reformation.
5.07      While there is substantial scope for improvement in auditing
standards and accounting systems, the quality of DFCs' financial reporting
improved continuously during 19R1-1983 as the Bank worked with (a) the major
auditors to provide for a more uniform presentation of reports, (b) the
Superintendent of Banks to modify accounting and reporting requirements in line
with generally accepted accounting procedures and (c) with the DFCs on detailed



- 26 -
reviews of the financial reports. Equally important, internal financial
reports and forecasts improved in most cases. To better serve the future needs
of DFCs' management, its reports would need to he timely and contain a few
selected operating ratios which would provide an efficient method for checking
on how the criteria for financial performance had been met.

ANNEX 1
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR - THIRD AND FOURTH DFVELOPMENT BANKIN(. PROJECTS
(LOANS 1359-EC AND 1731-EC)
Industrial Development Polic
Ecuador's industrialization model, since the early 1960s, has been
based mainly upon the development of import-substitutinn industry by offering
relatively strong protection for domestic sales and low, and occasionally
even negative incentives for exports. In addition, consumer goods tend to be
relatively more highly protected than intermediate and capital goods, which
creates other biases. In 1980, as the Fourth loan was achieving effective-
ness, the average custom duty applicable to consuimer goods industries (which
were the major users of Bank funds) was ahout 46Z. Tn addition, there was
substantial non-tariff protection in the form of import prohibitions and
prior ministerial authorizations for almost 800 products. An average of 14%
duty was paid on industrial inputs for the non-industrial sector, whereas the
duty on inputs for industry was 9%. Imported capital goods for industry paid
only 5%, while domestic agricultural products had low tariff protection of
only 2%. The pace of agricutural and industrial development was essentially
in line with these incentives. During the past decade, industry expanded
rapidly while agriculture stagnated. In practice, the net result of
protection is mixed since relatively open borders exist with Colombia and
Peru. The volume of Ecuador's non-reported exports is not well known. What
is known is that a large percentage of textile, clothing, shoe and food
products are costefficient and that well established brand names, along with
artisan products, are part of the high volume of non-reported free trade in
the region.

ECUADOR - THIRD AND FOURTH DEVELOPMENT BANKING PROJECTS

Summary Analysis of Selected Subprojects
ADAMAS ANDINA S.A.
1.01   Project: ADAMAS ANDINA, S.A. manufacturing specialty paper and
cardboard products.
1.02   Financiera:  CFN repassed US$1.75 million from 1359-EC for
construction of a US$17 million paper mill in Cuenca.
1.03   Result:  Plant construction and machinery and equipment installation
were proceeding according to schedule when, in 1980, the company's
Italian shareholder--who furnished all technical, engineering, design
and production expertise-fell into bankruptcy.  A search for
replacement of the equity capital and technology package, conducted in
conjunction with the International Finance Corporation and the
Inter-American Development Bank, was unsuccessful. Cost overruns
pushed total project costs to US$30 million by late 1983.
Construction was halted in December 1983, when the plant was 70Z
completed. All participating financial institutions are currently
negotiating capitalization of outstanding balances, seeking technical
partners or possible buyouts. There is a probability that the plant
will never open.
1.04   Findings:
1) It is impossible to draw substantive conclusions about this
project. Its failure is due to events that could not have been
foreseen.  The inability of creditors to find buyers for the plant-at
any price-is reported to be due to the specialized nature of
equipment (which restricts product line options) and to the large
scope of investment.
2) The financial institutions involved were financing a one-stage
entry into large-scale production. A multiple-year and multiple-
stage operation may retrospectively have been a more judicious
strategy for entry into paper goods production.
3) Death of key executive and bankruptcy of equipment and technology
supplier was not covered by standard life or business interruption
insurance. A closer look at insurable risks is needed.

Summary Analysis of Selected Subprojects
ARTEPRACTICO S.A.
2.01   Project:  ARTEPRACTICO S.A., wood products and furniture manufacturer
and retail furniture and hnuseware stores.
2.02   Financiera:  CPN repassed US$2.9 million (maximum allowed by loan
agreement) from Loan 1731-EC for a major expansion project in the
furniture division totaling USS26 million.
2.03   Result:  The project initially fell behind schedule because the
required electric energy could not be made available by Ecuador's
electric company. Costs escalated when ARTEPRACTICO installed its own
generating capacity, and the total project quickly fell apart when
domestic demand for its traditional products contracted and its new
project lines never found the market anticipated. The sucre's
devaluation tripled the company's dollar-denominated debt and plant
construction-and production-have stopped.  ARTEPLASTICO S.A. is
trying to remain a going concern by convincing its creditors to
capitalize their debt.
2.04   Findings
1)   CFN's econometrically-oriented study of demand potential was
technically sophisticated and comprehensive. A study of the
marketplace, consumer habits and preferences and the traditional way
in which the construction trades operate was not made. Prospects of
expanded competition and market saturation (implicit in the growth of
new, smaller, regionally-centered millwork firms) were not explicitly
researched.  Ultimately, the failure to evaluate the market,
construction trade practices, and price competitiveness and to
understand and project the implications of a cyclical downturn in the
housing sector on sales prospects may have seriously compromised this
subproject. Ex ante scenario development may have helped to define
alternative measures and/or coping strategies and invested the project
with greater flexibility.
2)   The project's enormous scale was never seriously examined, except
from an engineering efficiency point of view. This project is one of
several that attempted to enter new markets on a major scale when an
alternative strategy of slower, modutlar growth based on smaller scale
entry could have been more realistic. The DFC never required from the

project sponsor the degree of market research for the construction
trade and consumers that would have justified a US$26 million
investment.
3)   Based upon the appraisal submitted and the assumed high quality
of the project, the Bank proposed that CFN take an equity position.

Summary Analysis of Selected Subprojects
CALCAREOS HUAYCO S.A.
3.01   Project:  Calcareos Huayco S.A., lime extraction and processing plant.
3.02   Financiera:  The company actually disbursed US$1.4 million from CFN
through Loans 1359-EC and 1731-EC and US$279,095 from FIDASA through
Loan 1731-EC to finance acquisition of a turnkey lime extraction plant
from an Italian firm.
3.03   Result:  Calcareos Huayco suffered from project completion setbacks,
cost overruns, costly mistakes in factory setup and production flow
and misjudgments regarding appropriate sales and distribution system
and raw material supplies and basic support systems. Sales have been
depressed since the subproject came on line due to the collapse of the
construction, public works and housing markets. The company is in a
serious liquidity situation, and financial costs alone absorbed 52% of
sales revenues in the first quarter of 1984. A sustained economic
recovery could enable the company to remain operating and generate the
sales and production volumes necessary for profitable operations.
3.04 Findings:
1) CFN uncritically accepted the findings of a market study
commissioned by a majority shareholder. Unproved assumptions were
made and accepted regarding total domestic demand, market share, and
adequacy of the proposed distribution systems.   The market study did
not deal in detail with the strategy that would be followed to size
60% of the total market in gear one nor did it deal adequately with
construction cycles and agricultural cycle information. The project's
construction and assembly planning schedule did not consider the
difficulties of transferring sophisticated machine technology to
unskilled workers. CFN appeared to have placed great faith in the
project based on its turnkey modality and the prior success and high
financial status of the majority stockholders.

CAMARSA INTERNACIONAL S.A.
4.01   Project:  Camarsa Internacional S.A.(CAMARSA), shrimp processing and
freezing for export markets.
4.02   Financiera:  CFN repassed US$683,792 from Loan 1731-EC to finance
imported capital equipment (80%) and civil construction (20Z) destined
for CAMARSA's US$1.7 million startup plant.
4.03   Result:  CAMARSA's plant completion suffered delays which were
financed with working capital. This constrained the company's ability
to secure planned scale economies on purchases of shrimp. Camarsa's
difficulties were exacerbated by the defensive marketing sxrategies
employed by competitors, who bid raw material prices up and willingly
absorbed the operating losses in order to severely hamper the new
company. CAMARSA has been unprofitable since the shrimp industry
export subsidy was rescinded in March 1983, and its Bank-accessed loan
has, to date, been chronically in arrears.
4.04   Findings:
1) CFN tried to allow for contingencies by attaching a number of
performance conditions to the loan. Once the money was disbursed,
however, CFN found it difficult to induce CAMARSA to comply with all
the conditions. This situation was typical of many DFC/recipient
enterprise relations observed during the Bank visit. Greater Bank
attention to the adequacy of DFC credit management and technlcal
assistance by participating DFCs to borrowers could also be required.
2) Inadequate market study. No information describing CAMARSA's
strategy for entering a highly competitive market was provided.
Inadequate attention was paid to the degree of control over market
supply that is exercised by existing buyers and processors.
3) Management and entrepreneurial skills. The two key executives and
project promoters had had prior experience as development banker and
as financial officer. They had never been in the seafood processing
business. The appraisal report did not address the issue of the risks
associated with financing a new venture with executive talent having
no prior practical experience in this competitive sector.

FABRICA DE  LANCHAS GALVANIZADAS S.A. (CECALSA)
5.01  Project:  Fabrica de Planchas Galvanizadas S.A. (CEGALSA), galvanized
roofing sheets.
5.02  Financiera:  CFN repassed US$1.08 million from Loan 1731-EC, which
financed a second production line totaling US$1.87 million.
5.03  Result:  CEGALSA's production has been far less than projected (yearly
shortfall 1981-1983 averaging 422) because (1) domestic demand has
sharply contracted and (2) :. new generation of Japanese steel mills
have enabled Japanese competitors to flood the Ecuadorian market with
cheap imports. Despite the drop in production and sales volume,
CEGALSA has been able to raise its profit margin, between 1981 and
1983 from 1% to 23% by importing inexpensive steel inputs from three
Japanese companies holding 36% of the company's subscribed capital
stock. CEGALSA is presently lobbying the Government for increased
tariff protection.
5.04  Findings:
1) The market study did not discuss international trade and economic
issues that directly bear on CECALSA's competitive position.l/ This
is especially remiss considering that Japanese imports-which flooded
the market and undercut CEGALSA's prices at the time the subproject
was under construction--historically dominated the Ecuadorian market.
2) CFN did adjust company projections downward, but CEGALSA's
projected sales and production were still overestimated. Part of the
problem stems from the limited scope of the market study, which
focused on historic domestic demand while only briefly mentioning
price, distributcon and consumer preferences. Another part stems from
incorrectly interpreting the data base upon which projections were
made.
3) CFN began to monitor the project closely when sales faltered soon
after subproject completion, demanded more equity to cover its exposed
position, and then reverted to a passive supervisory position.
1/ The emergence of new, high-volume, highly efficient steel industries in
the Far East was knowa throughout the world and had generated much
commentary about downstream costs and benefits, both by industrial
fabricators and industrial consumers.

Summary Analysis of Selected Subprojects
ELECTRODOMESTICOS DUREX C.A.
6.01   Project:  Electrodomesticos Durex C./A. (DUREX), manufacturer of
appliances and white goods.
6.02   Financiera:  CFN repassed $804,108 from Loan 1731-EC for a $916,676
expansion project.
6.03   Result:  DUREX's initial performance hewed closely to the sales and
cost structure outlined in the appraisal report. Since tne round of
sucre devaluations in 1982, however, DUREX's substantial
dollar-denominated debt and depressed domestic and Andean Pact demand
have erased profit margins. Buoyed by short-term credit support from
local financial intermediaries, the company awaits the return of
market demand.
6.04   Findings:
1) There is no evidence that CFN monitored the company's financial
standing at regular intervals. Timely advice on loan covenants or
limiting and better managing foreign exchange risks may have mediated
the impact of devaluation on the company's balance sheets.
2) The appraisal report did not discuss market demand, past sales
performance, distribution systems, price competitivess or product
lines, and project sales objectives were vague. The absence of an
appraisal of market objectives, market constraints and sales
strategies for this project cannot be explained. Possibly, there
existed an implicit reliance on Government policies to assist a
company that figures prominently in the Ecuadorian economy, thus,
market realities and risks were not adequately dealt with.
3) The appraisal report discussed the impact of Durex's recently
acquired dollar debt on its financial standings, but did not explain
why it had contracted the debt or how it would be liquidated.
Perhaps a more cautious, well structured evaluation procedure would
have revealed the subproject's true strengths and weaknesses through
analysis that took into account its leveraged financial position. high
foreign debt and low earnings prospects without Government subsidies
for exports. At a minimum, such an analysis could have led CFN to
establish more exacting conditions on leverage, debt restructuring,
dividend payments, etc. than were specified in the loan covenants.

ECUAFRITOS S.A.
7.01   Project:  ECUAFRITOS S.A., potato chip processing.
7.02   Financiera:  COFIEC received US$245,300 from Loan 1731-EC for a
US$260,000 project to acquire a complete production line for this ne;
enterprise.
7.03   Result:  Company underestimated production costs, established an
inappropriate sales and pricing strategy and the subloan was in
arrears until July 26, 1984 when ECUAFRITOS was acquired by Borden
Inc., which assumed all obligations.
7.04   Findings:
1) Loan approval was based upon the entrepreneur's prior business
record and, implicitly, his overall financial standing. The subloan
appraisal did not elaborate on, or critically evaluate, the quality
and skills of the project's actual management, its financial policy or
its critically important distribution and marketing plans.
2) Project supervision was minimal: COFIEC appeared to be unaware
that project difficulties were due to lack of production cost/price
analysis.

ECUAJUGOS S.A.
8.01   Project:  ECUAJUGOS S.A., fruit juice extraction and bottling.
8.02   Financiera:  COFIEC repassed US$512,628 from Loan 1731-EC to finance
the imported capital equipment portion of a US$3.58 million plant
construction project.
8.03   Result:  ECUAJTJGOS consistently outdid its forecast performance (with
the exception of its first year of operations), although profit
margins have been narrowed by debt-financed expansion programs
(Tetra-Pak and yoghurt production). A promising export market and
steadily increasing domestic sales (averaging 8% per annum) brighten
ECUAJUGOS' long-term outlook. The company promises to be an important
factor in Ecuador's growing agroindustrial sector.
8.04   Findings:
1) ECUAJUGOS may have proved to be excessively aggressive by entering
too many markets in too short a time period, thereby jeopardizing its
near-term prospects. COFIEC, as principal banker, did not subject
ECUAJUGOS to performance conditions in its loan contract and, thus,
has had marginal input on the pace and direction of company growth,
possibly to the detriment of both parties. Typically, COFIEC protects
its interests-and covers its exposure-by insisting on increased
equity if the company's earnings tumble or if a financial position
deteriorates.1/ These loan conditions provide some security against
adversity but7do not provide the conditions under which a financiera
can play a useful and timely development banker role or foster credit
management awareness and skills and thus administer its loan portfolio
more effectively.
1/ CFN supplements such measures by requiring annual, independently audited
financial statements.

Summary Analysis of Selected Subprojects
ECUATORIANA DE TRANSFORMADORES S.A.
9.01   Project:  Ecuatoriana de Transformadores S.A. (ECUATRAN), electrical
generators.
9.02   Financiera:  COFIEC repassed US$1.58 million from Loan 1731-EC which
financed procurement of machinery and equipment for a US$4 million
startup subproject.
9.03   Result:  ECUATRAN has, to date, experienced great difficulty in
meeting project objectives because of delays, cost overruns, depressed
demand and inadequate staff training and plant maintenance, arising in
substantial measure from inadequate management and planning.
Cons'derable and increasing financial losses have been sustained since
operations began. The Belgium parent company sold 40% of its equity
to ECUATRAN's local shareholders in mid-1983, and the administration
was replaced. Currently, the company operates at 30% of capacity, is
trying to secure sales contracts to reach its breakeven point and
awaits the outcome of a possible IDB-financed electrification program
loan.
9.04   Findings:
1) COFIEC has monitored ECUATRAN fairly consistently, but this is not
reflected in the files, which show only one supervision report.1/
COFIEC continued until recently to open new credit lines for ECUATRAN
despite its inadequate operating performance, placing much trust in
the company's local shareholders' (business leaders who have had
substantial operations with COFIEC over the past two decades) capacity
to repay.
2) ECUATRAN had (until the PCR mission) sent neither balance sheets
nor profit and loss statements to COFIEC since the loan's inception in
1980, indicating that COFIEC's management role as a banker was truly
1/ One of relatively few supervision reports found in the sample of
companies reviewed by the PCR mission. Financiera files generally do not
reflect the extent of communications between client and DFCs. Overall
DFCs have not adopted commercial banking credit management reporting
practices regarding credit and supervision information.

limited. Obviously, subloan contract conditions - which request such
Information - are not backed with measures to ensure performance.
The role of the DFC as financial advisor and counselor does not appear
to have emerged, even for a mature financiera operation such as
COPIEC.
3) Procurement decisions were not discussed by either the financial
intermediary or the recipient enterprise, despite the significant
equity holdings of a foreign multinational and prospects of non-arms-
length transfer pricing.   Bank records ironically appear more
solicitous with respect to procurement in the case of small projects,
where parent compenies - and potential transfer pricing - do not
present potential conflict of interest situations. This policy
procedure-by both rhe Bank and participating financieras-should be
reviewed and, if necessary, revised.

Summary Analysis of Selected Subprojects
COMPANIA ECUATORIANA DEL CAUCHO S.A.
10.01  Project:  Compania Ecuatoriana Del Caucho S.A. (ERCO), tires and tire
products for the domestic market.
10.02 Financiera: ERCO received US$1.86 million from CFN and US$2.87
million from COFIEC (total US$4.7 million) from the proceeds of Loan
1731-EC to finance the first stage (totaling US$12.4 million) of an
ambitious factory-wide expansion project.
10.03 Result: Inconclusive. A major strike, which closed the plant for the
first quarter of 1983, and import restrictions on raw materials have
both interfered with project implementation. ERCO had been a highly
profitable and rapidly growing firm for many years. It is expected to
recover, although it will not achieve the stream of revenue postulated
in the FRR calculation.
10.04 Findings:
1) Market study appears to have been on target, but appraisal did not
discuss downside risks which could arise from high dependence upon
imports of basic raw materials. The firm does have a program to
increase domestic raw materials supplies.
2) Pricing and profitability depend on Government grants of periodic
increases in controlled prices to match rising costs. ERCO
unilaterally raised prices 16% in mid-August 1984. No punitiv- action
by the new Government had occurred by mid-September, and most
interpret this as tacit approval of the long-awaited price hike.
Currently, the company is operating at 80% of capacity, sharply up
from its 20%-of-capacity low in April 1984.
3) ERCO's Bank credit and its share in COFIEC's credit portfolio have
been consistently paid back, with the exception of a fairly
substantial arrearage In late 1982.

GASEOSAS TUNGURAHUA S.A.
11.01  Project:  Gaseosas Del Tungurahua S.A., Coca-Cola bottling plant.
11.02 Financiera: COFIEC repassed US$600,000 from Lo-an 1731-EC for a US$5
million startup bottling plant subproject.
11.03 Result: Company has met and/or exceeded sales performance targets in
the first two years of operations. Its highly leveraged position and
costly dollar-denominated debt, however, endanger the company.
11.04 Findings:
1) COFIEC's financial analysis, as shown in the pro forma balance
sheet, clearly indicated that the project's financial structure (with
projected 2.8 debt/equity ratio in 1981) was not soundly based. The
threat that this weakness posed to Gaseosas Del Tungurahua's liquidity
in the short term has since become reality.
2) Considering the new company's close ties with the Coca-Cola Export
Company, the non-arms-length procurement arrangements should have been
verified by COFIEC to ensure that least-cost equipment was acquired.
3) Substantive charges in the scale and objectives of this subproject
were made after the subproject was approved by the Bank for
financing. The changes in project size sharply altered the financial
plan and exacerbated an already highly leveraged position. Retrospec-
tively, it is not clear that the Bank would have approved the project
had it been initially presented in its altered and expanded form.

12.02 Financiera: COFIEC repassed US$1.28 million from Loan 1731-EC as
partial financing for a US$2.96 million factory startup project.
12.03 Result: INPILAS' management proved incapable of providing for and
managing the project, which resulted, inter alia, in delays, cost
overruns and poorly trained production staff. INPILAS was recently
reorganized and refinanced, and the new management expects to be
profitable in 1984.
12.04 Findings:
1) COFIEC did not critically assess the strategic and operating
problems and issues that needed to be addressed and resolved in order
to successfully launch a new company (distribution, sales, marketing,
etc.). Excessive reliance was placed on the abilities and connections
of INPILAS' managing director. The capability of the key staff that
would operate the enterprise on a day to day basis was not serlously
evaluated.
2) COFIEC's supervision was partially documented and treated only
financial issues on an ad hoc basls.

ISKRAEMEC S.A.
13.01 Project: Iskraemec S.A., small machine tools and electrical
appliances.
13.02 Financiera: CFN repassed US$151,526 from Loan 1731-EC in July, 1980
to finance foreign exchange costs of machinery and equipment in order
to complete the f{nal stage of a USS2.91 million expansion project.
This *B subproject, which was not subject to intensive Bank review,
did not reflect in its appraisal report tne high risks associated with
CFN increasing its exposure to this firm.
13.03 Result: Plant has sustained heavy losses since initiation of
subproject because of (1) marketing problems associated with
introducing an unfamiliar brand in Latin America; (2) depressed
domestic demand created by the recession; and (3) the closing of the
Andean Pact export market. Management was unable to control project
costs and implementation schedule, mainly for lack of overall
production and market planning. Company currently seeks new export
markets to replace Andean markets and new investors to help
recapitalize operations.
13.04 Findings:
1) CFN's initial decision to participate as majority stockholder was
influenced by Government policy to develop an Andean Pact-oriented
high technology metal tool industry. Its subsequent decision to lend
to a company that had been operating marginally from the outset (.003
and .16% profit margins on decreasing sales of UTS$1.3 million in 1978
and US$1.0 million in 1979) was made despite awareness by both the
company and the financial intermediary of deteriorating market
conditions. The loan appraisal report did not deal with the
substantial downside risks usually involved when attempting to
penetrate new markets against established brand names.1/ Because this
was a -B project- and therefore subject only to pro forma Bank review,
deficient appraisal was not noted in review processing.
2) CFN's supervisory reports - though infrequent - reflected
appropriate concern and offered constructive criticism.
1/ Problems of distribution, cost of advertising and promotion associated
with such efforts were not addressed.

FABRICA DE MOSAICOS ATLAS S.A.
15.01 Project: Fabrica de Mosaicos Atlas S.A. (MOSAICOS), tiles made of
vinyl, granite or wood.
15.02 Financiera: CFN repassed US$443,471 from Loan 1731-EC to finance
procurement of imported machinery and equipment as part of a US$2.0
million project which combined two existing factories under one roof
and increased productive capacity by 50%.
15.03 Result: MOSAICOS was negatively affected by the housing slump that
engulfed Ecuador beginning in late 1981, soon after the project was
finished. Accelerating operating losses and dangerous liquidity
pressures threaten the company's future. Short-term loans, some
provided by CFN, are presently keeping the company afloat as it awaits
an economic recovery.
15.04 Findings:
1) CFN (Guayaquil) granted the credit to MOSAICOS despite financial
reports that showed poor operating results in prior years. The
conditions which were imposed by CFN to protect itself against the
high possibility of continued adverse financial results were not
enforceable. In any event, CFN did not appear to seek to enforce
financial covenants.
2) This expansion project rested upon inaccurate use of historic
construction industry data. The company's study asserted that
construction activity had grown at an average rate of 11% p.a. in the
past decade and used this as a basis for establishing future demand.
Ex poste research revealed that this rate and more had been achieved
early in the 1970s, and that, in recent years, each successive year
actually showed contraction in the rate of sector growth. On that
basis, it would have been hard to justify a major expansion program
for a financially marginal firm, except that its sponsors included one
of the largest financial/agroindustrial groups in the country.
3) There was minimal evidence of supervision of this long-standing
problem loan. The company's financial statements were not available
in the project file. There was no evidence that CFN's management was
in full touch with the current issues or that it was addressing credit
management issues aggressively.

plastic injection mold machines, part of a US$802,420 expansion
project.
16.03  Result:  Company has essentially met performance targets with regard
to sales and earnings.
16.04  Findings:
1) PISA developed a highly accurate market forecast model which has
served it well as an accurate planning tool.
2) The shoe industry is highly price-competitive despite the
existence of import quotas, and PISA is well positioned to operate in
a competitive, price-conscious market.
3) Witb the exception of a supervision visit conducted in early
January 1984, COFIEC appears to have had little contact with PISA.

POLDMALLA S.A.
17.01 Project: Polimalla S.A., plastic mesh and laminated plastic sheets.
17.02 Financiera: COFIEC on-lent US$498,609 for capital equipment to start
a plastic screen and laminated plastic sheet fabricating enterprise.
17.03 Result: Polimalla was scheduled to make a profit in 1981. It has yet
to reach its breakeven point, much less turn a profit. The company's
entrepreneurial drive and ingenuity, however, may, in the medium term,
expand volume through new product applications and generate sufficient
profits to become a financially viable enterprise.
17.04 Findings:
1) Market and application engineering research was woefully
inadequate in this subproject. The two anticipated production-
sustaining activities--mosquito netting and laminated plastic
sheets-failed because they were either technically flawed or linked
to unforeseen marketing difficulties.
2) This project is yet another example of a DFC's decision to finance
a subproject based on the prior business record and financial/
commercial clout of the subproject's backers. COFIEC's decision to
support this subproject appeared to have been based on its backers and
not on the evidence presented for the subproject itself.
3) Polimalla was unable to deal with the forecasting challenge posed
by the introduction of new products and applications. A more prudent
approach would have been to actually import the new raw materials and
conduct applications testing and marketing on a pilot basis.

PRODUCTORA DE CACAO S.A.
18.01  Project:  Productora de Cacao (PROCAO), unrefined and semi-refined
chocolate products.
18.02  Financiera:  COFIEC repassed US$939,059 from Loan 1731-EC to finance
procurement of second-hand equipment for the production of
semi-refined chocolate products.
18.03  Result:  The company completed the subproject in 1981, within time and
cost parameters, but profitability declined in this heavily
Government-supported industry as incentives were reduced and cacao
production declined, which rendered upstream value added activities
unprofitable and forced 60% of the subsector to close down. High
Government incentives fueled a doubling of productive capacity for
refined cacao products between 1977 and 1979 and transferred the
benefits from the traditional grower/exporter to the new industry. In
1982-1983, domestic production fell 55%. Producers had to cope with
low domestic supply and high prices in the face of low world prices.
A major sectoral shakeout is in process as a result of excess
capacity.
18.04 Findings:
1) The market demand forecast referred only briefly--and obliquely-
to the dangers posed by Ecuador's cacao industry, in which productive
capacity is fully twice the size that can be utilized economically.
2) The market study periscoped the cacao industry's problems,
selectively discussing broader market forces but neglecting to
describe the forces (political and economic) at play within the
subsector and the overriding fact that the industry could not exist
without heavy 'incentives.-
3) The report did not discuss any risks endemic to the industry
(i.e., commodity price swings, climate, etc.) or downside project
risks.

19.01  Project:  Sinteticos Ecuatorianos S.A. (SINTECA), plastic wall, floor

19.02 Financiera: CFN repassed US$2.47 million from Loan 1359-EC to finance
procurement and installation of machinery and equipment at SINTECA's
new production complex in Cuenca. The Bank subloan was part of a
US$4.71 million investment.
19.03 Result: The company suffered serious delays in the construction and
installation phases of the subproject. The plant opened almost two
years behind schedule, then closed scarcely three months later because
of inadequate sales, inventory backlogs and lack of key raw
materials. Production started up briefly one month later, but faulty
planning, management and marketing procedures--which had still not
been corrected-forced the plant to close permanently in May 1981.
The, company is in liquidation.
19.04 Findings:
1) This project failed because of a total lack of planning and
administrative incompetence. No information is furnished in the
appraisal report on the background of the company's principals.
Moreover, marketing and demand projections were not well conceived.
2) It appears that CFN did not or could not exert control over this
enterprise to cause it to correct management failure. Flexibility to
assume control and/or correct such situations-either in DFC
management or in the legal contracts binding their loans-should be
considered as part of the forecast.

TROQUELADOS S.A.
22.01  Project:  Troquelados S.A. (TROSA), manufacturer of hinges and metal
plates for electrical outlets.
22.02  Financiera:  COFIEC on-lent US$268,000 from Loan 1731-EC to fund the
purchase of metal-stamping machines, increasing the company's produc-
tive capacity by 50%.
22.03  Result:  TROSA has experienced lower-than-expected profits because of
depressed demand in the construction industry, which showed dynamic
growth through 1975-81 but declined sharply (15.4%) in 1982-1983.
TROSA planned to capitalize on a Government housing piogram that never
fully materialized. It has recently contracted substantial short-term
debt while waiting out depressed market conditions. The company ex-
pects to improve profitability ratios when construction demand surges
again. An ambitious new Government-sponsored housing program was
recently announced by the new Government, which could affect TROSA
beneficially.
22.04  Findings:
1) The market analysis for the project was weak. The apprafnal
report did not assume that there would (or could) be a housing cycle,
appropriate interest rates, etc. It did not discuss the original
Government housing program nor past and/or projected trends in
construction activity. Other marketing variables impacting on the
industry, such as contraband, exchange rate policies, price increases
for inputs etc., were also overlooked.

Summary Analysis of Selected Subprojects
VIDRIO TECNICO DEL ECUADOR C/A
23.01  Project:  Vidrio Tecnico del Ecuador S.A. (VITEDECA), glass ampules,
vials and flasks for the pharmaceutical, medical and veterinary
industries.
23.02  Financiera:  CFN disbursed US$144,000 to the company from Loan 1731-EC
for purposes of building a factory in Guayaquil and installing
imported equipment.
23.03  Result:  VITEDECA's new plant was completed after considerable delay
due to administrative, technical and financial problems attributed to
an inadequate financial plan, faulty management and a fundamental lack
of detailed corporate planning and forecasting. Acceptable product
quality is just beginning to be achieved, and the company is still far
below optimum production levels. The company's financial condition
could not be ascertained because of the complete absence of financial
statements in the project file.
23.04 Findings:
1) CFN granted the initial credit despite VITEDECA's history of
difficulties in raising equity capital and several changes in
ownership and administration. These problems have continued to plague
the company, which has not achieved sales and revenue targets, because
of unsuccessful technology transfer and its inability to achieve
acceptable product quality standards. It continues to suffer
financial losses. Perhaps a more thorough understanding of VITADECA's
management capabilities and technical expertise by CFN might have
averted what now seems to be a non-performing asset.
2) CFN's working capital financing-made after the subloan disbursal
to keep the plant afloat--was based only on subsequent national demand
forecasts. Quality control and plant management--upon which
VITEDECA's sales depend in the quality-conscious medical fields-did
not appear to receive adequate consideration.
3) CFN's Guayaquil office, which executed the project, had no
financial statements on file.

PROJECT COMPLETION REIORT
ECUADOR - THIRD AND FOURTH nEVELOPWFNT BANKING PROJECTS
(LOANS 1359-R.C AND 1731-EC)
Financial Condition of Selected Development Finance Companies
1.        The financial position of DFCs participating in Loans 1359-EC and
1731-EC are reviewed in this annex.  It was envisaged, in the process of
preparation of these loans, that DFCs would experience rapid but orderly
financial growth which would be fueled by (a) substantial annual increases in
long term borrowings, (b) sales of term bonds to the public and private
sectors and (c) adeauate increases in equity through growth of profits and
retained earnings. The actual events of the past few years did not match the
forecasts, and DFC growth has been negatively affected by the impacts of
persistent inflation, tight credit, restrictive interest rate policy, and,
more recently, a major recession and devaluation.
2.        DFCs have been hard hit by the negative effects of recession and
devaluation on their industrial clients. As of December 31, 1983, between
10% and 15% of DFCs' loan portfolios were reported to he in arrears. Recause
recently refinanced and restructured loans are not reported as non-performing
assets, the data on accounts in arrears understate the actual status of DFC
loan portfolios and their shrinking capability to generate current cash flow
and financial income. As a result of the maxi-devaluations in 1983 and 1984
and the program of -sucretization" of public and private foreign debt
guaranteed by DFCs and the other financial institutions, the liabilities of
the financial sector have expanded by 50% or more. Thus, debt/equity ratios
among private DFCs increased from less than 10 to 1 in 1982 to levels of 15
to 1 to 25 to I by mid-1984. All DFCs participating in Bank loans (except
for CFN) are in violation of their debt/equity loan covenants. Members of
the financial sector are aggressively seeking to recapitalize and to reduce
their gearing ratios to legal limits. The outcome of these efforts is not
likely to be fully determined until late 1985 or early 1986.
3.        To lessen the shocks to the financial system which followed
devaluation, CBE has expanded selective credit, made special discount
facilities available to hard pressed and illiquid financial system members,
and, in late 19R4, provided for a major stretchout in the revayment schedules
for loans under the  sucretization  program (from about three years maximum
to about seven years). These measures will substantially ease the cash flow
burden on industry, and the financial system. Given continued inflation,



- 68 -
ANNEX 4
Attachment I
Page 2
these policies could transfer a significant portion of the real costs of
"sucretization" to the public sector.
4.        The impacts of the economic events of 1982 and 1983 on the
future income earning capacity of DFCs is complex. DFCs have suffered the
loss of major sources of income with the disappearance of loan guarantee
operations which accounted for up to 25Z of their annual financial income.
On the other hand, DFCs' loan portfolios expanded substantially when
guarantees were -sucretized- and converted into long term debt. These new
loans will generate financial income. Because margins on these loan
operations are low, DFCs could, in the balance, suffer from losses in
revenues of the order of 10% to 15% as a net result of their loss of foreign
exchange loan guarantee fees. Such losses in annual revenues could be
difficult to replace without DFCs increasing their short term lending
operations and/or expanding their non-traditional banking activities. The
realities of the current conditions of the financial market could force DFCs
to adopt alternative business strategies in 1985 and beyond, and to sell new
financial products and services.
5.        Financial Result:  The financial positions of CFN, COFIEC,
ECUFINSA, FINANSUR and FINANSA, the participants in the Third and Fourth
loans, which continue to participate actively in Bank industrial credit
projects, are reviewed below.
6.        Corporacion Financiera Nacional (CFN).  ClN's assets almost
doubled,from S/8,293 million in 1979, to S/15,928 million on December 31,
183. In real terms, CFN suffered a small decline in asset value, as
Ecuador's rate of inflation equalled about 15% of p.a. during 1979-1983. The
substantial growth in CFN's loan account, to S/8,813 million by December 31,
1983, is due to the transfer to this account of the revalued and -sucretized-
foreign exchange loan guarantees. The major growth in accounts receivable,
from S/400 million in 1979 to S/3,500 in 1983, is mainly due to the
multiplication of the effects of devaluation on the Government's outstanding
obligations to repay selective foreign exchange losses experienced by CFI
(CFN Table 1).
7.        CFN's net income declined sharply between 1978 and 1983, from S/585
million to S/46 million (CFN Table 2) as its provisions for possible loan and
investment losses mounted from 0.4% of average assets (S/29 million) in 1978
to 2.1Z of average assets (S/252 million) in 1983. CFN's financial expenses
grew more rapidlv than its financial income during 1983 and served to further
reduce available net profits. As a result of its low profits, CFN earned a
very low 1.6% return on equity in 1983. CFN's small profit in 1983 resulted
mainly from a one-time translation adjustment (foreign exchange gains) as its
actual gross operating margin in 1983 was ony 0.1% on assets applied. In
fact CFN has not had satisfactory earnings since 1975 when it earned a barely
reasonable 8.5% on equity.
R.        The main causes for CFN's lower-than-anticipated earnings were:



- 69 -
ANNEX 4
Attachment 1
Page 3
(a) the Government's mandate to CFN regarding profit objectives
was ambiguous. During the mid-1970s, there appeared to be a
preference by CFN's management for earning only marginal
profits on loans and guarantee operations, which was then
viewed as appropriate to better serve CFN's development
objectives. This approach was modified by CFN's new general
manager in 1980.
(b) CFN has, in recent years, not been able to manage its
financial operations successfully. Moreover, its accounting
systems cannot provide the data needed for financial planning
and analysis. And, finally, CFN's senior management were
never able to link the marketing of financial products (loan
operations) with their financial resource mobiliation and
management efforts. This resulted in the non-optimum use of
CFN's resources and a frequent mismatch between borrowing and
lending activities.
(c) CFN's decisions in 1979-1980 to set lending rates and fees and
co-mmissions at lower than the current maximum market levels
fuirther reduced CFN's income and earning capacity at a time
when its financial costs were increasing (especially those
incurred on its mounting short term foreign loans). As a
result of this policy, CFN suffered an operating loss in 1979,
just about broke even in 1980 and 1981 and will continue to
suffer from this earlier decision for several more years.
(d) The deterioration of CFN's loan portfolio in 1983-1984
sharply reduced financial earnings and resulted in a negative
cash flow during the first half of 1984. CFN's higher
operating costs relative to its static earning asset base will
continue to deplete its earning capacity unless appropriate
measures are taken.
9.        CFN's current ratio of 1.0 on December 31, 1983 declined from 1.4
in 1981 reflecting CFN's growing inability to obtain long term funds. Short
term funds accounted for 40% of CFN's debt in December 1983, compared with
30X in January 1981. CFN's current debt/equitv ratio of 4.9 to 1 is well
within loan limits. Financial ratios only partiallY reflect CFN's current
earnings, and current and prospective cash flow problems. These may be
resolved by (a) appropriate Government action to repay its outstanding debts
to CFN; (b) the willingness of CFN's management to take the organizational
and staffing measures needed for improvement; (c) financial and portfolio
management and planning; (d) efficiency in the use of existing resources;
(e) the modernization of marketing its financial products and supervision of
loans; and (f) impr3vements in loan collection and supervision activities.

10.       Compania Financiera Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo S.A. (COFIEC).  This
company is Ecuador's largest private DFC. As of December 31, 1983, it had
S/10,402 million in assets and S/3,897 in contingent assets, most of which
were in the process of conversion into loans under the program of
"sucretization' (COFIEC Table 1). COFIEC had a high percentage of its loan
and guarantee portfolio affected by arrears. Its reported non-performing
loans amounted to S/3,371 million in 1983, affecting 46% of its total
portfolio. COVIEC's audit report for 1983 was qualified by a statement from
the auditors noting the inadeqtuacy of COFIEC's reserves for bad debts. By
June 1984, these had been increased to 1.5% of assets which may be the
minimum required. COFIEC plans to further increase these allowances. As a
result of its deteriorating loan portfolio, about 70% of COFIEC's assets were
income earning compare.l with 90% in 1980. COFIEC's debt/equity ratio rose
from 9.1 to 1 in 1981 to 17.4 to 1 in December 31, 1983.
I1.      As a resulL of its declining earning capacitv, COFIEC earned a low
S/16 million in profits in 1983 compared with S/81 in 1980 (COFTEC Table 2).
This resulted in verv low earnings of 0.1% on average assets in 1983 compared
with 1.5Z in 1980. The composition of COFTF.C's portfolio has been shifting
increasingly toward short term operations as current liabilities doubled from
1982 to December 31, 1983. These borrowings have recently been used to
offset declining term resources, as a result of which COFIEC's current ratio
has slipped from 1.12 in 1982 to 1.02 in December 1983. COFIEC has, since
December 1983, been experiencing cash flow problems. It has had to refinance
a portion of its loan Portfolio. The outcome of these efforts will not be
fully known until mid-to-late 1985. As is the case with other DFCs with cash
flow problems, COFIEC will depend substantially upon short term CBE
facilities for its clients' incremental resource requirements. Its efforts
to increase its equity may, to some extent, be hampered by its relatively
broad private and public ownership base.
12.       Ecuatoriana de Financiamiento S.A. (ECUFINSA).  This DFC has, since
mid-1970, operated principally as a short term lender/commercial paper
organization. The commercial banking orientation of its management has
evolved slowly and, by 1980, about 58% of its portfolio was in short term
loa:is while 42% of its operations had moved toward long term lending. As a
result of -sucretization' of ECUFINSA's foreign exchange loan guarantees, 63%
of its loans were long term by the end of 1983. The structure of ECUFINSA's
resources has changed to match its changing asset structure. ECUFINSA has
recently suffered from substantially increased interest and commision
expenses, relative to revenues, resulting from its growing portfolio of term
loans which were created under the  sucretization- program.  The margins
available from CRE to the DFCs on such operations are not very substantial,
and term lending appears not to be as profitable as short term loans and
commercial paper operations.

ANNEX 4
Attachment 1
Page 5
13.      ECITFINSA has remained one of the more profitable DFCs.  Its earnings
on equity in 1983 were 18Z after unusually high provisions of almost 1.2% on
average assets. However, non-interest income provided a large part of
ECUFINSA's profit since net operating profit margins were.a nominal 0.1% of
average assets.  RCUFINSA's earnings could deteriorate as higher provisions
are required and its net interest margins continue to dip while EC!WINSA's
less profitable long term lending operations continue to grow as a percentage
of total loans.
14.       ECUFINSA's liabilities equalled Sl4,117 million on December 31,
1983 compared with S/1,661 million in 1982. This large increase is due to
the devaluation and 'sucretization" programs' effects upon its foreign
exchange loans and guarantees. ECUFINSA did a reasonably effective job in
balancing the term composition of assets and liabilities duri-nr the recent
period of significant change as its current ratio stood at 1.09 in 1983.
ECUFINSA's debt/equity ratio deteriorated from 8 to 1 in 1981 to almost 14 to
1 in December 1983. It is making efforts to reduce its leverage ratio in
line with legal requirements.
15.       Financiera del Sur S.A. (FINANSUR).  In 1983, the profits of this
DFC had slipped to S/17 million, which was substantially lower than its 1982
profits of S/51 million. Its earnings on average assets in 1983 were less
than .5%. In 1982, they were a low 4% on average assets. This DFC has,
since its inception, not provided equity holders with returns equal to the
opportunity costs of capital. Its very low profit performance in 1983 was
due to the S/72 million provision for had debt that it made in recognition of
the fact that 22% of its loan portfolio was reported to be affected by
arrears. Moreover, its interest income in 1983 was a reduced percentage of
average assets because a very high 6O% of FINANSUR's resources are financed
by CBE discount or rediscount facilities. FINANSUR had one of the highest
levels of dependence upon CBE resources.
16.       As a result of the -sucretization- program's induced liahility
growth, FINANSUR's debt/equity ratio rose from 7:1 to 1 in 1981 to 15:4 to 1
in December 1983. With higher interest expenses, FINANSUR's net interest
margin narrowed to about 3% on average assets, which is significantly lower
than the 5.5% it registered in 1981. Its current ratio was a satisfactory
1.1 at the end of 1983. FINANSUR is a component of an aggressive financial
group which owns or controls real estate, banking, commercial and industrial
interests. There is little reporting on the financial inter-relationships
among components of groups and the degrees of dependence among such groups.
17.       Financiera Nacional S.A. (FINANSA).  This financiera is part of a
financial group which includes a factoring company (NAFINSA), an equipment
leasing company, a real estate company and a financial services company.
Because of the limitations in regulations affecting disclosure, relevant
financial information about the status of this financial group is not



- 72 -
ANNEX 4
Attachment 1
Page 6
available. FTNANSA is in difficult financial shape. Its financial structure
was particularly affected by the 'sucretization" program as a result of its
relatively large portfolio of foreign exchange guarantees. As a result of
the rapid build up of liabilities following "sucretization," FINANSA's
debt/equity ratio increased from 11 to 1 in 1982 to 21 to 1 by December 31,
1983, as liabilities increased by 200Z between 1982 and 1983. This occurred
despite management's best efforts to increase FINANSA's capital structure.
18.       FINANSA had earned an acceptable 15% on average equity in 1981.
Since then, its profits had slipped to 10% in 1982 and to 7.7% in 1983.
FINANSA's net income had grown by only 42% from 1981 to 1983 while its equity
increased by more than 80%. Its net earnings have been negatively affected
by its growing portfolio in arrears, its very sharply increasing financial
expenses (Sf63 million in 1981 to S/263 million in 1983) compared with its
more moderate financial income growth (S/173 million in 1981 to S/433 million
in 19831 and its relatively high administrative expenses.
19.       As a result of FINANSA's increased short term operations with CBE
and its slower growth in current assets, its current ratio fell below 1.0 in
1982 and reached a low of 0.8 in December 1983, from which it recovered
moderately, by June 1984, when its ratio was 1.0.  FINANSA's interest
coverage ratio has also dropped from 1.3 in 1981 to 1.1 in December 1983.
FINANSA's overall fin ncial situation is difficult and its problems are
compounded by the fact that it had already received increases in capital In
1983 and 1984 which were not yet adequate to stabilize its financial
situation.

Subject: ECUADOR: Project Completion Report on the Third and
Fourth Development Banking Projects (Loans 1359-EC and 1731-EC)
Dear Sir:
Concerning the preliminary version of the
above-mentioned document, the Corporacion Financiera Nacional
would like to make the following comments on those matters that
concern it directly:
1.        The document in general provides an authoritative
analysis of the progress and results of the Third and Fourth
Development Banking Projects, financed by the World Bank. We
have noted many of the important conclusions reached and the
recommendations made.
2.        Several factors analyzed in the document should be
emphasized:
2.1  During the implementation of these projects, the          Para. 1.01-1.11
Ecuadorian economy deteriorated sharply as a result of a series  describes
of factors, both domestic and external; of these the most           negative impact
significant were:                                                   on subprojects
of macro-econo-
-    The general recession in the world economy, which led  mic events.
to the adoption of a series of restrictive measures by both the
developed and the developing countries, with adverse
consequences for the normal development of international trade.
-    The decline in the process of Andean integration, on
the basis of which various subprojects were implemented.
-    Problems related to excessive external indebtedness,
especially in a large number of Latin American countries,
including Ecuador, which led to the almost complete paralysis of
new loans to our country; this resulted in a negative flow of
foreign exchange, which in turn caused serious balance of
payments problems.
-    To all this must be added the problem caused by floods
and drought, which had a tremendous impact on Ecuador's economy.

-    All these factors precipitated a profound crisis in Ecuador from 1981
onwards, leading to serious inflation and a decline in the exchange rate for our
currency.
2.2  This series of problems led to changes in the                Reflected in
conditions that prevailed at the time of appraisal of the project   footnote 8.
financed under the third and fourth loans, which, as noted in the   Effect of
document, prejudiced the execution of a number of these projects.   external
conditions
Thus, despite this careful appraisal work, these             reflected in
altered circumstances meant that some of the projects financed by   Table 3 and
this Corporation encountered market and marketing problems.  This   para. 3.14.
is especially true of the projects that were designed to tap the
markets of the Andean Pact countries, which then closed their
doors to these projects.
Meanwhile, despite the analysis made by our institution Reflected in
of the main promoters of the projects financed by CFN, ir the         Footnote 9.
majority of cases involving new projects not all the relevant
information regarding executive and technical personnel was
available at the time of appraisal, since these persons were
contracted later on at the execution stage. This hindered a more
searching analysis of the capacity of these persons.
2.3  We feel that the comment made in the report regarding    Reflected in
the low financial margins provided to the participating CFD under  footnote 16.
the third and fourth loans should be emphasized, and we recommend
that this matter should be reviewed by the Bank in future loans.
In CFN's case, one way of increasing this margin and of helpig to
improve the institution's liquidity over the long term would be
to make the terms of each subloan for which funds are transferred
to CFN the same as the term of the loan granted by the Bank to
the Government of Ecuador, thereby permitting a certain rotation
of these funds to finance new eligible subprojects.
3.        As regards the specific comments on subprojects
financed by CFN, we would like to make the following remarks:
3.1  The information available regarding the projects has         Reflected in
apparently been reviewed in a rather superficial way, insofar as    footnote 8.
the appraisal of these projects included analyses of management*
to carry out these projects, while the market studies contained
statistical information on domestic and international trade, and
the policies in effect in those markets. These were all matters
that were difficult to project, as was the economic crisis which
has affected Latin America since 1980 and which obliged the
countries in the region to take specific measures to resolve
their problems; this in turn jeopardized some of the projects
financed under the loan, which were already at various stages of
implementation.
3.2  We believe that in Table No. 3 it would be appropriate        Reflected
to change the classification of ECASA and SINTECA from "Failed           in footnote
Subprojects' to 'Subprojects in Difficulty,- insofar as these            7.
industrial plants are in the process of rehabilitation.

Likewise it should be clarified that neither ECASA nor   Affecting
DUREX produce "ropa blanca" but rather household appliances,          only Table 3
i.e., -white goods"; they are not textiles industries.*             Spanish version
3.3 As regards Supervision and Credit Management (Annex 4)
we would point out the foliobing:
-    Several of the subprojects financed under the third and   Reflected in
fourth World Bank loans have obtained new loans from CFN, so that   footnote 18
more up to date information on supervision carried out, and            and Annex 4
additional financial data, can be found in other documents put          Table 1.
out by these companies. This is true for CALCAREOS HUAYCO,
ISKAREMEC, TEXTILES CONTINENTAL, LA UNIVERSAL, CEGALSA,
ARTEPRACTICO, MOSAICO ATALAS and CAMARSA.
Yours sincerely,
