PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1025-PE)
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Sixth Highway
Project in Peru for which Loan 1025-PE, in the amount of US$26.0 million, was
approved by the Board on April 23, 1974. The Loan was closed on June 30, 1981,
and the final disbursement was made on July 29, 1981.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from the
LAC Information Center, Appraisal Report No. 302a-PE, Staff Supervision
Reports, project progress reports, final construction reports of the Ministerio
de Transportes y Comunicaciones (MTC) and information gathered during a mission
to Peru in September 1980.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower who, by letter dated November 9, 1982, communi-
cated to the Bank its agreement with the concepts expressed in it. The letter
has been annexed to the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1025-PE)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Sixth Highway Project (Loan 1025-PE) had as a main objective the
upgrading of the Huanuco-Aguaytia section of the Carretera Central. Although
originally included for financing under Loan 425-PE, its implementation was
postponed when cost and time overruns forced the Bank and the Borrower to
reduce the scope of that project (paras. 2.01, 2.02).
The execution of the Sixth Highway Project encountered basically the
same problems that affected the two previous Bank Highway Projects in Peru:
(a) time delays due to institutional weaknesses (para. 6.01) and
important design changes and additions (paras. 3.06, 3.14),
which resulted in the project being completed almost four years
later than appraisal estimates; and
(b) cost overruns due to high price inflation and currency devaluations,
time delays and, most important, substantial underestimation of
project costs because of less than adequate detailed engineering
(paras. 3.13, 3.14). The final project cost was about 72% in real
terms above appraisal estimates, an increase almost entirely due to
a real 111% increase in the price of the civil works elements of
the project.
The Project Completion Report recognizes that, in retrospect, time
and cost estimates made during the appraisal were far too optimistic (para. 7.03).
Because of insufficient funds to provide for the project as originally
envisaged, the project was reformulated in mid-1977 (para. 3.07) and disbursements
on civil works after January 1, 1979 were reduced from 65% to 20% to permit
continued Bank participation (para. 4.03).
Despite only partial completion of the original construction and
improvement program, the project met its principal objective of reducing
transport costs on roughly four-fifths of the Huanuco-Aguaytia road. For those
sections improved under the project, the overall estimated ERR is close to the
24% anticipated at appraisal. This result, in the presence of substantial time
and cost overruns, is principally due to considerable increases in vehicle
operating costs which occurred between appraisal and the project's first full
year of operation (1980) (paras. 5.02, 8.01, 8.02).
The Sixth Highway Project included, at the Bank's suggestion, improve-
ments to about 200 km of feeder roads connecting to the Huanuco Aguaytia road,
but the Borrower attached very low priority to this element of the project and
argued for its elimination at the time of project reformulation, three years
after loan approval (paras. 3.07, 3.16). The Bank subsequently (1979) agreed






- vi -
that improvements be scaled down to the essential minimum, but, despite this
concession, MTC continued to delay the works, which were finally completed
in 1980.
The Project Completion Report critically examines the Bank's
performance during project implementation and concludes that:
(a)  the Bank made a significant contribution to the project
by attaching special importance to those elements of the
project other than works on the Huanuco-Aguaytia road: the
feeder roads, road maintenance (para. 3.21) and technical
studies (paras. 3.22, 3.25, 7.01); these elements of the
project served to substantially enhance local skills in
geotechnical engineering, planning and feasibility studies
and led to a number of important technical recommendations
of relevance for similar projects in Andean countries
(para. 8.03);
(b) the Bank was at times ready to respond to the difficulties
that arose during project execution; for instance, the Bank
gave immediate consent to disburse loan funds without inter-
national competitive bidding for emergency landslide clearance
(para. 3.02); also, when the Borrower did not give the Bank the
opportunity to review contract awards recommendation and draft
contracts before their signature, retroactive Bank approval was
given (para. 3.05). The PCR recognizes that such Bank responses,
if repeated frequently, would undermine the Borrower's sense of
obligation to follow procedures and regulations agreed with the
Bank (para. 7.02).

SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1025-PE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Peru's topographical, geological and climatic conditions make the
provision of transport facilities extremely difficult. The transport network
reflects these difficulties and has shaped the country's geographic development
accordingly. Since the nineteenth century, several isolated railways have
been built by private interests to connect mining areas in the Sierra with
coastal ports. Even today, railways and ports are highly specialized and
operate mainly as transport systems for the export of minerals. Only highways
and, much more recently, civil aviation have played an important role in
integrating the country, but the lack of an adequate transport network remains
one of the most difficult problems confronting Peru.
1.02      The highway network totals some 58,500 km, of which about 6,000 km
are paved, 12,500 km have gravel surfacing and 40,000 km are earth roads.
After the heavy emphasis on highway construction in the mid 1960s, road
development has, since 1970, been concentrated on paving and improving some of
the more heavily used roads and gradually extending the system. While the
whole system grew by 12% during the period 1970-1978, the paved and gravel
road networks grew by 25% and 22% respectively. The backbone of the Peruvian
road network is the Pan-American Highway, an all-weather asphalt road 2,675 km
long, running the entire length of the country along the coast (Map IBRD
10610(PCR)). The highway system is still in a very early stage of development,
and Peru's road density is half that of its neighbors, Ecuador and Chile. The
few roads connecting the coast with inland areas are generally low standard,
unpaved and sometimes, particularly in the inland areas, little more than
rudimentary dry weather tracks. In these circumstances, the importance, for
the country's economic integration, of the most important major road connection
from the coast through the mountains to the inland areas can scarcely be
exaggerated. This road, some 800 km in length, is the Carretera Central,
which starts from Lima, crosses the highest range of the Andes to La Oroya,
continues across high plateau and other mountain ranges to Huanuco and Tingo
Maria, and eventually emerges from the Andean foothills to reach Pucallpa on
the headwaters of the Amazon river system. The main element of the project
reviewed in this report consisted of paving and improving the 219-km section
of the Carretera Central between Huanuco and Aguaytia.
1.03      The Bank has been closely involved with the highway subsector in
Peru since 1955. Highway development has to date been promoted by eight loans
totaling US$278.5 million: Loan 127-PE, US$5 million, 1955; Loan 300-PE,
US$10 million, 1961; Loan 271-PE, US$5.5 million, 1960; Loan 425-PE, US$33
million, 1965; Loan 706-PE, US$30 million, 1970; Loan 1025-PE, US$26 million,
1974; Loan 1196-PE, US$76 million, 1976 and Loan 2091-PE, US$93.0 million in
1982. Four of these loans (Loans 271-PE, 425-PE, 1025-PE and 1196-PE) have
supported construction and improvement of different sections of the Carretera
Central as part of Bank assistance toward the ultimate aim of a paved road
between Lima and Pucallpa. All the loans have helped to finance feasibility
studies and detailed engineering designs, as well as providing for studies,
technical assistance and equipment with the objective of increasing efficiency
in the highway subsector.

1.04      This Completion Report is based on information obtained from the LAC
Information Center, Appraisal Report No. 302a-PE, staff supervision reports,
project progress reports, final construction reports of the Ministerio de
Transportes y Comunicaciones (MTC), and information gathered during a mission
to Peru in September 1980.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01       In September 1965, the Bank made a loan (425-PE, US$33 million) for
the improvement of the La Oroya-Aguaytia section of the Carretera Central.
The extraordinarily difficult topographic, geological, soils and climatic
conditions of the region, however, had been insufficiently considered during
the design, and both the cost estimates of the original studies, as well as
the bid prices of the contractors, were substantially underestimated. These
factors, together with inflation and the Government's inability to pay contrac-
tors for extended periods, led to large time and cost overruns. In November
1969, the Borrower and the Bank agreed to reduce the scope of the project as
well as eliminating paving and some stabilization and drainage works in
order to match the then available loan funds. The improvement and paving of
the Huanuco-Aguaytia section were among works which were postponed for a later
phase.
2.02       In March 1972, the Government engaged an Italian consultant firm,
which had been working for several years on the Carretera Central, to carry
out detailed engineering and economic studies for completion of the improve-
ments to the La Oroya-Aguaytia road which had been started under 425-PE.
This study, financed under 425-PE, was completed in December 1972 and subse-
quently updated in April 1973. The study indicated that the improvements
contemplated under what was now the second phase of the La Oroya-Aguaytia
project were technically and economically feasible. Accordingly, the project
was accepted in principle as the Sixth Highway Project, and an appraisal
mission visited Peru in March 1973.
2.03      As a result of this appraisal mission, a subsequent visit in May
1973, and discussions with the Government and the consultants, it was agreed
that:
(a) certain design features included in the plans proposed by the
consultants, which were desirable but considered as not technically
essential, would be deleted or modified to reduce costs;
(b) the Bank would finance the purchase of maintenance equipment for
adequate future maintenance of the project road; and
(c) up to US$2 million worth of improvements to access roads leading
to the La Oroya-Aguaytia section or the Carretera ientral would
be included in the Droject.
At that time (June 1973), the Bank expressed its concern over the lack of
progress in payments to contractors and consultants under Loans 425-PE and
706-PE as well as over the disputes emerging from Loan 271-PE and other



- 3 -
foreign-financed loans. It was felt that these delays and disputes could
have an adverse impact on the participation and pricing of contractors and
consultants in international tenders called by the Peruvian Government.
2.04      Against the background of a series of disputes concerning the
nationalization of foreign corporations in Peru, a deteriorating political
situation, and a need for substantial updating of the overall list of projects
requiring foreign financing, a Country Programs mission visited Peru during
the third quarter of 1973. Partly based on the findings of this mission, Bank
management decided to reduce lending to Peru in FY1974. Consequently, suffi-
cient funding was not available to finance improvements along the whole length
of the road between La Oroya and Aguaytia, and, after further discussions with
the Government, it was decided to divide the road into two sections: La
Oroya-Huanuco and Huanuco-Aguaytia. Although the La Oroya-Huanuco section
yielded higher economic benefits because of heavier traffic (over 500 vehicles
per day), it was felt by both the Government and the Bank that the Huanuco-
Aguaytia section had a higher priority for reconstruction under the proposed
project because highly unstable terrain on some sections of the existing road
could cause prolonged closure of the only land corridor between Lima and
Pucallpa. Most of the La Oroya-Huanuco section passes through more stable
terrain, and such mudslides as occur can be cleared relatively rapidly.
2.05      Thus, the works for the completion of the La Oroya-Aguaytia road,
which was originally a part of one project (Loan 425-PE), had now been divided
into three phases:
Phase I:     works financed under Loan 425-PE;
Phase II:    completion of the Huanuco-Aguaytia section to be financed
under the Proposed Sixth Highway Project (subsequently
Loan 1025-PE); and
Phase III:   completion of the La Oroya-Huanuco section (subsequently
financed under Loan 1196-PE).
2.06      Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. in March 1974.     The
loan for US$26.0 million (1025-PE) was approved by the Board of Executive
Directors on April 23, 1974, was signed on July 1, 1974 and became effective
on August 17, 1974.   The original closing date was June 30, 1978.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Civil Works
(1) Huanuco-Aguaytia Road
3.01      For bidding purposes, the Huanuco-Aguaytia road was divided into
five contracts (Lots) as follows:
Lot A:   Aguaytia-"Tea Gardens"             41.5 km
Lot B:   "Tea Gardens"-Puente Pumahuasi     38.0 km
Lot C:   Puente Pumahuasi-Huachipa          47.7 km
Lot D:   Huachipa-Carpish                   45.2 km
Lot E:   Carpish-Huanuco                    46.8 km
Tender documents were issued for international competitive bidding with bid
opening scheduled for October 1974; contractors were to be post-qualified.
Following the usual practice, official cost estimates were published for
each Lot, and only bids within 10% of those estimates would be accepted. The
official estimates were too low, and the invitation to bid produced virtually
no results, with only one bid for Lot E being submitted. In accordance with
Peruvian law, the bidding was declared void and the one bid received was
returned unopened.
3.02      In the early months of 1974, prior to the initial bidding period,
heavy rains caused repeated slides which blocked the Tea Gardens-Puente
Pumahuasi section of the road (Lot B). The Bank agreed, in July 1974, to
disburse US$400,000 in loan funds, without competitive bidding, to enable
slide removal work (to reestablish full roadbed width) to be carried out on an
emergency basis by a local contractor already working in the area. In spite
of this concession by the Bank and the emergency nature of the work, the slide
removal did not begin until November 1974 because of Government administrative
delays.
3.03      In March 1975, subsequent to the first bidding, an inspection
revealed that Lot B had stabilized reasonably well, but that the section
between Huachipa and Carpish (Lot D) had developed some critically unstable
zones and was suffering from severe erosion from the rivers, which had swollen
to record levels as a result of the unusually heavy rains. Because of the
uncertainty of future stability on some sections, it was agreed that this
portion of the road should not be paved at this time; it was, therefore, not
included in the next round of bidding.   It was duly paved as a Government-
financed project (para 3.10).
3.04      New bid documents were issued in April 1975.   The revised official
estimates of construction costs for the five lots were, by then about 50% in
excess of the appraisal estimates (US$30.8 million as against the appraisal's
US$20.5 million, excluding contingencies), and normal procedures were modified
to permit bids within 15% of the official estimate to be accepted. Bids were
opened in July 1975, and only one bid was received for each of the four Lots:
A, B, C, and E. Price levels were, on average, about 14% above the official
estimates.



- 6 -
3.05       In August 1975, separate contracts were awarded to each of the
Peruvian firms bidding for the four Lots. The contracts were awarded without
the Bank having been informed either of the results of post-qualification or
of the evaluation of bids. Nevertheless, in view of the urgency of the
proposed works, and the delays which the project had already incurred, the
Bank approved the contracts retroactively. Work began on October 10, 1975,
with expected completion of Lots A and B in January 1978, Lot C in July 1977,
and Lot E in October 1977.
3.06       Subsequent execution and costs of the contracts were substantially
affected by design changes and additions (para 3.14). Principal among these
were:
(a) raising embankments (Lots A and C);
(b) widening roadbed (Lot C);
(c)  changing potentially unstable and failed sideslopes (all lots);
(d)  adding of protective works against river scour (Lots A and C);
(e)  additional erosion protection, paved ditches and underdrains
(all Lots);
(f)  substitution of a 400-meter long tunnel for three bridges in the
Boqueron Canyon (Lot A);
(g)  paving of 1.4 km of the main street through the town of Tingo
Maria, for which no solution had been included in the original
contract (Lot C);
(h)  increasing pavement width from 6.0 to 6.6 meters in order to
reduce raveling of pavement edges (Lots A, B and C);
(i)  large increases in volumes of landslide removal after severe
rains in 1976 and 1977 and addition of protective walls
(Lots A, B and C);
(j)  change in the alignment of the bypass around the town of
Huanuco to reduce expropriation of houses (Lot E).
These design changes, which were agreed by the Bank, inevitably led to modifi-
cations in the construction schedule, which were aggravated by slow and com-
plicated administrative procedures for approving contract additions and
modifications. Work on Lots C and E was completed by the end of March 1979,
Lot B by July 1979, and Lot A by the end of the first quarter of 1980. The
final increases in the value of constructed works, excluding cost escalation,
were: for Lot A, 97%; Lot B, 32%; Lot C, 71%; and Lot E, 32%.
3.07      By early 1977, it had become evident that there were insufficient
funds in the loan to provide for all of the project, and, by letter of
April 25, 1977, the Government requested reformulation of the project. The
Bank agreed to delete the improvement of Lot D and the resealing of the



- 7 -
Neshuya-Pucallpa road section, which had, by this time, deteriorated to a
condition which required pavement reconstruction. However, the Government
request to also delete feeder road improvements was not accepted by the Bank,
and the Government agreed to include, at the Bank's request, detailed engi-
neering studies for pavement rehabilitation of the Neshuya-Pucallpa road.
The loan agreement was amended accordingly on March 9, 1978.
3.08      In early 1979, an earthquake caused localized damage to a number
of paved segments. Although some of the necessary repair work was carried
out under the project, there were insufficient funds remaining to provide
for all of it. For the remainder, therefore, MTC awarded a separate contract
to the contractor still working in the area. There was no Bank participation
in the expenditures under these contracts, and they are not included in the
cost estimates for this project.
3.09      During several missions, and also by letter, the Bank expressed
its concern regarding the lack of effective provisions for the maintenance
of the paved road sections completed under this project. MTC had largely
depended, for pavement repairs, on the contractor working on Lot D. This
solution is no longer acceptable and does not provide for routine mainte-
nance. A plan of action to improve MTC's overall maintenance capability
was agreed with the government as part of the Eighth Highway Project
(Loan 2091-PE).
3.10      With regard to Lot D, detailed engineering was initially delayed by
the need for additional geotechnical studies. These studies were financed
under the Lima-Amazon Transport Corridor Project (Loan 1196-PE, US$76.5 mil-
lion, December 1975). A construction contract was finally awarded in 1979
to the same Peruvian contractor responsible for Lots A and B with total finan-
cing by the Government. Work began in the fourth quarter of 1979 and was
completed in 1981.
3.11      Table 1 shows the chronology for constructing the various Lots of
the Huanuco-Aguaytia Road. Construction on all Lots began in October 1975,
some 10 months later than expected, and all work was not completed until April
1980, about 4-1/2 years later. The various Lots were completed from 18 to 27
months later than specified in the contracts and from two-and-half to four
years later than estimated at the time of loan negotiations. The main causes
of these lengthy delays have been described in the preceding paragraphs.
3.12      Rapid inflation and devaluation of the sol in Peru, especially since
1977, made it difficult to compare appraisal estimates with actual construction
costs. The comparison has been made using constant 1974 US dollars, the year
of project appraisal with the methodology outlined in Annex 1 used to convert
the certified cost of works to constant dollars, using the construction cost
index as a basis. Because this index is an annual average, the resulting
constant costs represent mid-year values regardless of when works were com-
pleted in any given year. In spite of this imprecision, however, the comparison
is considered to be a reasonable indication of cost differentials between
actual expenditures and appraisal estimates.



- 8 -
3.13      Table 2 shows the appraisal estimates, original contract value and
the final cost for each of the four Lots and for the works as a whole. The
total cost of the construction was about US$41 million in 1974 values, an
increase of 111% over the US$19.4 million appraisal estimate (including
physical contingencies) and some 76% more than the original contract value.
The increase was particularly pronounced in Lot A, where a tunnel was intro-
duced into the project after contract awards. The principal factors causing
these cost increases have been described in paragraph 3.06.
3.14      Supervision of the construction work was awarded to a joint venture
of the same Italian firm which prepared the detailed engineering (para 2.02)
and three Peruvian consultants. Although the work of the joint venture in
supervising the construction and carrying out quality control was generally
adequate, the quality of its design and redesign work during construction was
less than satisfactory in some instances. The numerous major changes and
additions required during construction (para 3.06) indicate clearly that the
original detailed engineering was inadequate in several respects, particularly
with regard to subsurface explorations and interpretation of the results,
protection against river action, protection against erosion caused by changing
drainage patterns and slope stability investigations.
3.15      Supervision costs for the civil works on the Huanuco-Aguaytia road
were about US$3.94 million (in constant 1974 values) compared with an appraisal
estimate of approximately US$1.8 million for the four sections of the road on
which civil works were completed. This increase (121%) reflects the extended
construction period and the redesign work which had to be carried out.
Supervision costs were about 10% of construction costs, which is reasonable
considering the extended construction periods.
(ii) Improvement of Feeder Roads
3.16      The project included improvement of about 200 km of feeder roads
connecting to the Huanuco-Aguaytia road, and the Government selected three
road sections for this work: Puente Rancho-Panao-Chaglla (70 km); Puente
Prado-Monzon (68 km); and Ramal-Tournavista (62 km).   However, it soon became
apparent that MTC attached a low priority to this element of the project, and,
by mid-1977, about three years after loan approval, no design work had started
and decisions were still pending on the width of bridges, the method of
construction (by contractors or force account), and whether supervision should
be by a consultant or MTC's own forces. During discussions on project refor-
mulation (para 3.07), MTC personnel argued for the elimination of the feeder
roads from the project, but the Bank insisted on their continued inclusion on
the grounds that they would substantially extend the area which would benefit
from the construction of the Huanuco-Aguaytia road.
3.17      MTC continued to delay the start of design work throughout 1978,
and, in early 1979, the Bank agreed with MTC's proposal that improvements be
considerably scaled down to the essential minimum--that is, construction of
permanent bridges and culverts and spot improvements to road surfaces where
necessary. Despite this concessionary agreement by the Bank, it was not until
January/February 1980 that construction contracts were awarded, through local
competitive bidding, and consultants were contracted for construction



- 9 -
supervision. Construction of seven bridges was completed during 1980. MTC's
final report on the project (dated December 1980) states that seven bridges
have been constructed under the project at a total cost of S/ 223 million
(about US$0.8 million equivalent). Improvements to the surface of the
Tournavista road have been undertaken by force account, with total financing
by the Government, and similar improvements have been started, and are programed
to continue, on the Puente Prado-Monzon Road.
(iii)  Resealing of the Pucallpa-Neshuya Road (61 km)
3.18      Resealing of this road was considered of high priority in order to
prevent serious damage to the existing asphalt surface treated pavement, the
construction of which was financed under Loan 271-PE in 1967-1968. Despite
the urgency of this work, MTC was unable to finalize contract documents until
mid-1977, almost three years after the Loan Agreement was signed, because of
protracted litigation with contractors who had carried out the improvements
in 1967-1968. As a result of this delay, what had been a minor project
component in 1974 was, by mid-1977, a major reconstruction task because of
predicted disintegration of the neglected pavement.
3.19      In February 1978, the Borrower and the Bank agreed to delete the
resealing of this road from the project and to include instead the consulting
services for design of the necessary pavement reconstruction. At that time,
the Bank emphasized the importance of reinforcing the subbase and base courses
prior to paving since the original surfacing had almost totally disappeared
on many sections. However, the start of consulting services was delayed
until December 1978 because of a contracted, emergency road repair program
launched by the Government to offset the discontent that had caused a general
strike in the city of Pucallpa. The consultants eventually designed a full
reconstruction of the pavement at an estimated cost of about S/. 244 million
(US$3 million equivalent), at mid-1977 prices, compared with the appraisal
estimates of US$0.7 million equivalent. This satisfied the Government's
commitment under the reformulated project, although the design failed to
reflect the widely different traffic volumes using different sections of
the road.
3.20      Subsequently (late 1979), responsibility for pavement reconstruction
on this road was transferred to the newly created Loreto Regional Development
Authority (ORDELORETO), under which a special commission for the Pucallpa area
had taken charge of starting the improvement of the first 15 km outside of
Pucallpa with a S/ 700 million (about US$2.8 million) allocation in the 1980
budget. Agreement was reached between the Bank and ORDELORETO's engineers
concerning appropriate pavement design procedures to accommodate varying
traffic densities on different sections of the road. Work on the first 5 km
started in early 1982.
(iv) Procurement of Maintenance Equipment
3.21      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that
a maintenance program for the La Oroya-Pucallpa road would be prepared to
serve as a basis for procurement of maintenance equipment financed under
the project. Such a program was prepared, and, in July 1974, the Bank agreed



- 10 -
with a list which included workshop installations, workshop tools, and mobile
maintenance trucks. Because of MTC's difficulties in accepting the procurement
procedures set out in the Loan Agreement, draft bid documents were prepared
and presented to the Bank only in May 1975. However, once started, procurement
proceeded smoothly, and, by mid-1977, a total of 15 separate contracts had
been awarded for the supply of 19 items of equipment by 11 suppliers. The
value of the contracts amounted to about US$1.95 million, leaving a balance of
almost US$250,000 in the Loan account in this category. MTC's request to use
this balance of funds for additional maintenance equipment from the same
suppliers was accepted by the Bank, and all procurement was completed in
January 1978 at a total cost of US$2.20 million. The equipment thus acquired
was used to maintain the unpaved portions of the road, including Lot D.
B.   Geotechnical Studies
(i) Studies by Consultants
3.22      The principal objective of these studies was to investigate and
recommend methods for improving the stability of road sections through unstable
mountain areas or in zones of "huaycos" (mud flows). The start of this work
was delayed extensively. Several months were required for MTC and the Bank
to agree on the scope of work and detailed terms of reference, and this delay
was followed by protracted and unsuccessful negotiations, first between MTC
and a local geophysical institute, and then with a French Government agency.
It was finally agreed that the studies would be done by the Special Studies
Department of MTC with assistance from selected individual consultants. Work
began in January 1979 and was carried out in two phases: Phase I during the
period January-July 1979; and Phase II, starting in April 1980, was not fully
completed and no report was issued.
3.23      The Phase I studies were carried out successfully, and resulted in a
report which presented specific engineering recommendations to deal with various
types of instability and slides. However, these recommendations, including pre-
ventive measures (tree planting, ditch lining, increased drainage, etc.), were
not utilized fully by the MTC Design Department and their consultants who still
rely too much on a "structural" approach with the emphasis on rigid retaining
walls and tunnels. Phase II of the studies were eventually reduced to conducting
limited monitoring of stability of several landslides in the Tea Garden area.
The work was constrained by inadequate budgets and MTC eventually lost all their
qualified geotechnical staff.
3.24      Since the study was carried out by MTC personnel with some supple-
mentary budget allocations, the portion of the cost of the studies financed
under the project was only US$33,000 for the services of a foreign expert,
which is extremely low compared with the appraisal report estimate of
US$700,000.
(ii) Study of Road User Charges
3.25      A contract for this study was signed in late 1976 with a joint
venture of two consulting firms, one US and the other Peruvian. At the time
of contract award, the Bank questioned the qualifications of some members of
the proposed team, and, although some changes were made in the team composition,



- 11 -
the results of the study reflected certain of the staff's shortcomings. The
work, which required numerous reviews and changes, progressed slowly, with
completion in April 1978, some nine months later than the July 1977 date
specified in the contract. Some basic faults, such as the analysis of rail
and shipping costs being based on average rather than marginal costs, remained
even in the final report. Nevertheless, the main goal of the study - the
determination of road user costs and allocations - was on the whole achieved,
and the methodology and traffic assignment models developed were utilized in
later studies. The consultants were willing and cooperative in undertaking
the considerable amount of additional work necessary to complete their assign-
ment satisfactorily. The cost of the study was S/. 15.2 million (US$236,000
approximately). There was no separate estimate of the cost of this item in
the appraisal report (para 3.28).
(iii) Feasibility Study of the Tarma-San Ramon-Oxapampa Road
3.26      The road was separated into two sections for study purposes:
Tarma-San Ramon and San Ramon-Oxapampa. For the first section, MTC awarded
the contract to a Peruvian consultancy with limited experience, without taking
into account the Bank's comments on the proposal and recommendation that two
experienced expatriate experts be incorporated into the study team. However,
the Bank subsequently approved the contract, and work began in April 1976. The
study was completed satisfactorily, and a draft final report, including engineer-
ing plans, was submitted to MTC in March 1978. The engineering solutions
proposed for several critical points on the winding Palca-San Ramon section
have been further evaluated, discussed with MTC, and modified in the road
design which has been included in the Eighth Highway Project.
3.27      The study for the second section was awarded to the same Peruvian
'consultancy in October 1979. Initiation of this work had been delayed pending
the results of a general transport study of the area by MTC to determine if
the proposed branch road to Oxapampa constituted the most appropriate alter-
native. For this section, the consultant's draft final report included only
preliminary engineering. Final engineering is eligible for financing under
the Eighth Highway project. The study was completed satisfactorily in
July 1980 with recommendations for road improvements to the level of paved
road to Puente Paucartambo. The consultant's recommendation for a surface
treatment of the existing branch road to Oxapampa (3.5 to 5.0 meters wide),
however, has not been accepted by MTC and the Bank, and further study of an
alternative alignment is being undertaken under the Eighth Highway Project.
3.28      The total cost of the feasibility studies for the Tarma-Oxapampa
road and the study of road user charges was approximately US$436,000 equiv-
alent compared with an appraisal report estimate of US$1.1 million. The major
reasons for this much lower cost were the extensive use of Peruvian consultants
and the assistance provided by MTC's planning service. As a result of
the austerity in Peru in this period, salaries paid for these services have
been very low by international standards.

IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A summary comparison between appraisal estimates and actual costs
for the various project elements is shown in Table 3. The final total project
cost was US$49.18 million 1/, about 72% over the appraisal estimate of
US$28.53 million for the same project elements. The increase in costs was
entirely due to the 111% increase in the amount of civil works. In 1974
prices, major increases in contract amounts resulted from the following addi-
tional work:
Lot A
Boqueron Tunnel and approaches             US$3.79 million (equivalent)
Slides and rain damage (1976 and 1977)     US$2.65 million (equivalent)
Lot B
Rain damage (1976 and 1977)                US$1.33 million (equivalent)
River damage and protective works          US$0.27 million (equivalent)
Lot C
Additional bridge works                    US$0.67 million (equivalent)
Tingo Maria street (addition)              US$0.85 million (equivalent)
Lot E
Additional slope protection works          US$0.10 million (equivalent)
Additional maintenance                     US$0.10 million (equivalent)
4.02      Loan funds were reallocated twice, as follows:

Total                              26.0        26.0      26.0
This reallocation between broad loan categories simply consisted of the
absorption of the contingency items into civil works expenditures, masking
some important changes, other than those introduced by project reformulation,
within the different categories. These were:
1/   In 1974 dollars for the reformulated project.



- 13 -
(a)  the reduction in cost of the feeder roads improvement (para 3.17)
and the absorption of this reduction into the construction costs of
the principal highway; and
(b)  the substantially higher cost of construction supervision within
consulting services, partially offset by reductions in the cost of
the geotechnical studies and the feasibility studies of the Tarma-
Oxapampa road.
4.03      As shown in Table 4, disbursements lagged substantially behind
appraisal estimates from the start. In the early years of the project,
this resulted mainly from extensive delays by MTC in the bidding process and
in awarding contracts. In spite of a substantial acceleration in project
implementation in 1977 and 1978, the initial delays in disbursements were
never overcome. By agreement between the Bank and MTC, disbursements on civil
works after January 1, 1979 were reduced from 65% to 20% to permit continued
Bank participation. The loan was fully disbursed on July 29, 1981.
4.04      The loan closing date was extended twice:   first, in February 1978,
from the original date of June 30, 1978 to June 30, 1980, and then, in August
1980, to June 30, 1981.
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      The Sixth Highway Project was justified at appraisal on the basis
of quantifiable benefits accruing to road users, mainly from reduced vehicle
operating costs and travel time which would result from improvements in
road design and surface characteristics. In addition to road user savings,
changes which were expected to occur in maintenance cost as a result of the
proposed improvements, including the provision of additional maintenance
equipment for the Huanuco-Aguaytia section, were included in the evaluation.
A separate economic analysis of the maintenance program for the remainder
of the La Oroya-Pucallpa road was also carried out.
5.02      The appraisal estimate of the economic rate of return (ERR), not
including time savings, for the improvements to the Huanuco-Aguaytia road
was 24%, with an average traffic growth rate of 7% per year from 1977 to 1996.
Reevaluation, based on the methodology discussed in the following paragraphs,
resulted in an overall estimated ERR, for the four road sections improved under
the project, of 23.2% with an average traffic growth of 4.1% per year from 1980
to 1999 (para 5.04). For truck traffic only, the average estimated ERR is 17.4%.
Only savings in vehicle operating costs were considered in the reevaluation
analysis. These highly satisfactory rates of return were obtained despite sub-
stantial construction delays and cost overruns, and with a lower assumed annual
growth of traffic than at appraisal. This result is principally due to the
considerable increases which occurred in vehicle operating costs between the
date of appraisal and the project's first full year of operation (1980). With



- 14 -
the high proportion of trucks on the project roads, averaging 41% of total
traffic (Table 5), and the competitive nature of the trucking industry, it is
likely that project benefits related to freight movements are being reasonably
distributed among truckers and shippers by limiting freight tariff increases.
The road improvement is a vital element in reducing transport costs and the
risk of closures on the Carretera Central, which is the only land corridor
between Lima, the agriculture development areas beyond Tingo Maria and the
river port of Pucallpa, on a tributary of the Amazon.
5.03      Base year traffic estimates rely on counts conducted in 1979 by MTC.
From Table 5 it can be seen that the appraisal projection of 7% annual traffic
growth was very close to the actual rate (7.2%) for the period 1972-1979 on
the road as a whole. There were, however, substantial differences between the
rates of growth experienced on different sections, with those beyond Huachipa
showing considerably faster growth than the area between Huanuco and Huachipa.
This is in large part explained by the previously poor condition of the road
in these sections, especially in the Carpish mountain range, and the interrup-
tion to the flow of traffic caused by landslides. The high rates of growth
elsewhere on the road reflect the importance of locally generated traffic in
the rapidly developing area beyond Tingo Maria.
5.04      On the basis of annual traffic counts, MTC derived a trend line,
using the least squares method, based on data for the 1965-1979 period.
This trend line has been used for projections of traffic from 1980 onward
and results in an average annual growth of 4.1% per year during the period
to 1999. On the basis of past experience on the road as a whole, this can
reasonably be considered as conservative.
5.05      For purposes of the economic reevaluation, all costs and benefits
were expressed in constant soles (February 1980 prices). Vehicle operating
costs used in the original feasibility study and appraisal were updated
to February 1980 prices using data from the "Estudio de Transporte para
la Selva Central," prepared by the Economic Studies Office of MTC, and the
general consumer price index for items other than food, housing and clothing.
The updated vehicle operating costs are shown in Table 6 . Project bene-
fits were calculated on the basis of the traffic mix identified from MTC's
counts in 1979, taking into account the improvements actually carried out on
each section of the road. For example, in the case of Lot B (Puente Pumahuasi-
Tea Gardens, part of the road was not paved (because of continuing stability
problems), but was, rather, improved to good gravel standards (para 3.03),
and this is reflected in the calculation of the benefits accruing to this
section. Construction, supervision, and maintenance costs were converted to
constant February 1980 prices, using the construction cost index.
5.06      The estimated ERRs for each of the four road sections, and the improve-
ment program as a whole, are shown in Table 7.    For the two sections between
Huanuco and Puente Pumahuasi (Lots E and C), the reevaluated ERRs are very
close to those of the appraisal. In the case of Lot B (Puente Pumahuasi-
Tea Gardens), the ERR is substantially higher than at appraisal, mainly because
of a higher rate of traffic growth between 1972 and 1979 than predicted for
this section (13.8% per year as against the appraisal forecast of 7% per
year). The much lower ERR on Lot A is due to the very high actual construction



- 15 -
costs incurred. However, despite an average construction cost in this section
of US$440,000 per km (in constant 1974 dollars), the estimated ERR is still
satisfactory and underscores the high justification for road paving projects
once traffic reaches levels in excess of 500 ADT. Furthermore, the rate of
return understates the total benefits of the project in that it reflects only
savings in vehicle operating costs.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01      Even before implementation of the Sixth Highway Project, MTC suf-
fered numerous institutional and administrative weaknesses which frequently
impeded the achievement of its objectives in the transport sector. Within
MTC, planning, construction, and maintenance of the national road network is
the responsibility of the Direccion General de Transporte Terrestre (DGTT).
In January 1973, DGTT was reorganized and divided into six directorates.
As was foreseen in the appraisal report, this new organization did not have a
significant beneficial impact on MTC's management performance. The substantial
administrative delays experienced under previous highway loans were equally
prevalent in the case of this project. As noted in Chapter III, virtually no
element in the project started without delays of at least 12 months and, in
some cases, of more than three years. These delays undoubtedly contributed to
the substantial cost overruns which were incurred. Furthermore, in at least
three individual instances, MTC did not comply with procedures set out in the
Loan Agreement with regard to the preparation and review of bidding, procure-
ment and contract documents.
6.02      Both this project and Loan 706-PE (US$30 million, September 1970)
provided for reinforcement of the road maintenance system, which remains the
most critical area of road transport infrastructure. Technical assistance
under Loan 706-PE was instrumental in developing a maintenance management
system which has since been progressively introduced as the basis for planning
and programing maintenance in the departments. However, the partial intro-
duction of the system has not led to any significant improvement in the road
maintenance situation because of insufficient funding, lack of working equip-
ment, and institutional difficulties including frequent organizational changes.
The acquisition of small lots of maintenance equipment was financed under this
project, but this has not resolved the underlying institutional problems. In
October 1980, the Bank expressed its concern that MTC was still largely
dependent on the contractor working in the area for pavement repairs and, in
June 1981, that routine maintenance of the improved sections of the Huanuco-
Aguaytia road was not being performed. The implementation of a cohesive
maintenance program for the La Oroya-Pucallpa road, which was a specific
undertaking by the Government expressed in a covenant of the Sixth Highway
Project Loan Agreement, has at best been erratic.
6.03      In general, these difficulties stem from four basic characteristics
of MTC's recent administrative structure:
(a) partial decentralization without corresponding clear delineation
of responsibilities regarding execution and supervision of central-
ized and decentralized functions at different levels (departmental
and regional);



- 16 -
(b) lack of specific focus on road infrastructure within DGTT (which was
also responsible for railways) and a similar lack of focus on road
maintenance in the department and regions;
(c) insufficient coordination among the different activities carried
out within the DGTT and between DGTT and other MTC directorates;
and
(d) depletion of technical and managerial expertise due to low
compensation levels and uncertain career prospects.
Measures aimed at improvement of these weaknesses are currently being intro-
duced by the new MTC management; however, time will be required to effect the
changes since it is impossible to separate the solution to some of these
problems from the broader aspects of Government policy concerning issues such
as decentralization and the salaries of public employees. In the case of this
project, it should be added that the execution of the project coincided with a
particularly difficult and turbulent period for the Peruvian economy as a
whole, which undoubtedly contributed to the budgetary and administrative
problems faced by MTC. Under the subsequent project, Loan 1196-PE, six road
contracts are presently being executed. Initiation of these works also
sustained considerable delay, but, since the date of contract signing, the
works have remained generally close to schedule, with only one contract
indicating troubles of the nature experienced under the project. The new MTC
administration is also taking measures to restore DGTT to highway-department
status 1/ and the field-engineering departments to being exclusively maintenance
organizations.
6.04      Despite the problems discussed in the preceding paragraphs, there
is no doubt that the project did have a number of positive results from the
point of view of the Borrower's institutional development. The project
supported broad based studies related to transport planning and the prepara-
tion of future investment programs as well as specific road feasibility
and engineering studies. These studies have led to the identification and
subsequent preparation of high priority programs and to improvements in
planning. The transport planning studies were largely carried out "in-house"
while specific road feasibility and engineering studies were contracted to
local consulting firms. Furthermore, the geotechnical studies prepared by
MTC's Special Studies Department, supported by Bank-financed expatriate
experts, contained high quality work providing valuable recommendations on
more appropriate measures to deal with various types of road instability and
landslides common in the Andes (para 3.23), and serving as a basis for upgrad-
ing highway engineering in Peru by including more attention to geotechnical,
drainage and soils problems.
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank contributed significantly to project identification and
preparation via the preceding highway projects on the Carretera Central
(especially Loan 425-PE; US$33 million; September 1965) and during the execu-
tion of the project provided essential continuity and advice in a difficult
1/   In 1981 DGTT became DGC (General Roads Directorate) being concerned only
with highway and rail infrastructure directorates.



- 17 -
period for the Peruvian economy and for MTC. The number and timing of super-
vision missions were appropriate for the circumstances during the execution
of this difficult project. A particularly significant contribution of the
Bank was the importance which it attached throughout to those elements in the
project other than the construction and improvement of the Huanuco-Aguaytia
road itself: the feeder roads, road maintenance, and technical studies. On
several occasions during execution, the Borrower tended to attach a low
priority to these elements and even, in some cases, wished to eliminate them
and reallocate the funds to civil works construction or supervision. When
these difficulties arose, the Bank was always swift to point out to the
Borrower the benefits of the studies, not merely from the technical point of
view, but also from that of building local knowledge and institutional develop-
ment. It was thanks to Bank insistence that feeder road improvements took
place at all under this project and that the geotechnical studies were finally
carried out satisfactorily. In the case of the maintenance program, problems
associated with lack of adequate funding and institutional weaknesses within
MTC limited the achievements that could take place during the period of the
project's execution. The Bank's missions have, however, served to continue
focusing MTC's management attention on maintenance and rehabilitation and
suggesting ways in which some of the institutional difficulties might be
overcome. This is being done under the reformulated Loan 1196-PE and the
Eighth Highway Project.
7.02      The Bank was always ready, perhaps at times a little too ready,
to respond to the continual difficulties which arose, particularly during
the early stages of project implementation. When the Borrower requested a
rapid disbursement of US$400,000 in order to contract extremely urgent emer-
gency repairs without international competitive bidding (para 3.02), consent
was given immediately, although several months were to elapse before these
funds were put to use. When the Borrower did not comply with proper procedures,
for example by failing to allow the Bank the opportunity to review contract
documents before they were signed, retroactive Bank approval was nearly always
given within a short space of time. While this was done with the objective
of avoiding still further delays in project implementation, there must at
least be a possibility that such a response, if repeated too frequently,
will undermine the Borrower's sense of obligation to follow strictly the
procedures laid down in the loan agreement and in the general regulations of
the Bank.
7.03      The estimates made at appraisal of the time which would be required
to e,eecute the project and disburse the loan were, in retrospect, far too
optimistic (para 4.04). In view of the fact that, first, very long delays
and difficulties were experienced on previous highway projects in Peru and,
second, that considerable skepticism was rightly expressed in the appraisal
report concerning the efficacy of administrative reforms carried out at MTC in
1973, part of these delays should have been foreseen and allowed for at the
project preparation stage. Furthermore, especially in the difficult terrain
and climatic conditions of the project area, there is a natural tendency to
underestimate construction costs at the final design stage. The consultants'
estimates were indeed much too low, and were reduced even further, at the
Bank's suggestion, before incorporation into the appraisal report. As a
consequence, the initial invitations to bid produced virtually no response,



- 18 -
and cost increases of 50% were included in the re-issued invitations. On
future occasions, especially under conditions such as those experienced on the
Carretera Central, construction cost estimates produced by the Borrower or his
consultant should be examined more critically by the Bank, not just to see
whether they can be reduced, but also to judge whether they might not be too
low. In addition, the Bank should continue to support the recommendations
arising from the geotechnical studies financed under this project concerning
more innovative methods of dealing with stability problems.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      Despite only partial completion of the construction and improvement
program originally envisaged at the appraisal stage, the project represents an
important contribution to the betterment of the vital land transport link
between Lima and the headwaters of the Amazon at Pucallpa. On roughly four-
fifths of the Huanuco-Aguaytia road, the project met its principal objective
of upgrading the highway and reducing transport costs; work on the remaining
portion of the road was completed in 1981, with financing wholly by the
Borrower.  This has been achieved despite institutional difficulties and
physical conditions which challenge the current state of the art in highway
engineering.
8.02      For those sections improved under the project, the overall estimated
ERR is close to the 24% anticipated at appraisal despite the extended construction
time and heavy cost overruns. This result emphasizes the critical importance
of the highway to the development of the economy in general and of the Selva
Central area in particular. Furthermore, the ERR reflects only the savings in
vehicle operating costs. In addition, the project will play an important role
in the integration of the area east of Huanuco into the wider economy and the
opening up of markets for the agricultural produce of a number of fertile
valleys. Previously, the growth of agriculture in these valleys had been
impeded by their inaccessibility and the high cost of transport to the urban
markets, especially Lima. The impact of the project on these areas will be
enhanced by the improvement of feeder roads leading into the principal highway.
8.03      In addition to the construction and improvement of the main highway
and feeder roads, the project has had a highly beneficial impact on transport
planning and the identification and preparation of future investment programs.
There is no doubt that, as a result of the project, local skills in geotechnical
engineering, planning and feasibility studies have been substantially enhanced.
This work has led, not only to the development of high priority programs, but
also to a number of important technical recommendations of relevance for other
similar projects in Andean countries.
8.04      In the light of the problems encountered during the implementation
of this project, future Bank involvement in the Peruvian highway system
should stress:



- 19 -
(a) the need to establish a proper balance between maintenance and
rehabilitation on the one hand and new construction on the other
(a rehabilitation program is being prepared under the reformulated
Loan 1196-PE);
(b) continued support of carefully selected studies leading to
identification of investment programs, better transport planning,
and improved engineering practices;
(c) the need for a more realistic assessment of MTC's capacity, and for
a time schedule which fully recognizes local practices and conditions;
and
(d) the need to strengthen and reorganize the services responsible
for road infrastructure, and for stricter adherence to the Bank's
procurement procedures.
The three latter areas are addressed in the Eighth Highway Project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Conversion of Current Soles into Constant US$
1.        The rapid rate of inflation and devaluation of the Sol in Peru,
especially since 1976, makes a comparison of the appraisal estimates and the
actual final costs difficult. To minimize the problem, the Peruvian construc-
tion cost index has been used to convert the actual final costs to costs in
1974, when the appraisal estimates were made. In Peru, the construction cost
index is divided into two indices, one for labor and the other for materials.
For purposes of this exercise, these two indices have been combined into a
single average index. For the conversion of current soles into constant US$,
the following procedure was used:
(a)  divide the construction cost index for the base year by the index
for the year in which construction costs were incurred (this
refers to total construction costs, including compensations for
inflation, paid in that year);
(b)  multiply the construction costs by the fraction obtained from
(a) above;
(c)  divide the result of (b) by the exchange rate in the base year
(throughout 1974, the exchange rate was S/. 38.70 per US$); and
(d)  add the results of (a) through (c) for all years in which
construction costs were incurred to obtain the total construction
cost in 1974 US dollars.
2.        The construction cost index used is the following:
Yearly Average             Index (1960 = 100)
1974                          399
1975                          474
1976                          668
1977                          989
1978                        1,494

2/  The  appraisal report did not provide a breakdown of the costs by Lot.  The
total estimate in the appraisal report (US$20.5 million excluding contingencies),
which included Lot D has been divided proportionally, in accordance with MTC's
original division into Lots A-E in October 1974. The appraisal estimates in
this table include physical contingencies.
