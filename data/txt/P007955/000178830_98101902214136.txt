INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU
FOR A SIXTH ROAD PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Peru for the equivalent of US$26.0 million to help
finance a road project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including
5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Peru"
(No. 136-PE) was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 25, 1973
(R73-115). An updating economic mission is scheduled for April, 1974, and
its report is expected to be ready for distribution by the end of September.
Annex I summarizes the main economic and social indicators.
3.        Peru has achieved a respectable rate of economic growth: excluding
one year at the height of an economic crisis (1968), GNP growth in real terms
has averaged over 6 percent per annum since 1960. With per capita GNP about
$500 in 1972, Peru is also well removed from the group of poorest countries.
The pattern of development that has brought this about, however, has been
one of very unequal distribution of the fruits of growth. The modern sec-
tors, where incomes are high and rising, comprise little more than one-
fifth of the labor force, with a heavy concentration in the Coast, and in
the Lima area. Twice as many are engaged in an agriculture of very low
productivity where incomes rise slowly if at all and where large groups of
Indian descent until now have hardly been touched by modern development 1/.
The rest - somewhat over one-third of the total - are accounted for in handi-
craft production and various service activities outside the modern commercial
establishment. Their incomes also grow at rates well below those in the
modern sector. The challenge that has been facing the country is to break
this pattern without sacrificing further growth.
4.        Upon its takeover in 1968, the military Government began to pursue
structural reforms. Agrarian reform has been broadened and speeded up. By
the end of 1973 about 5.7 million hectares of farmland had been expropriated,
nearly half the area initially estimated to be subject to expropriation
1/   Those working in the larger export oriented farms, and particularly the
members of the coastal sugar cooperatives must be counted in the modern
sector.



- 2 -
(which in turn is about half the total farm area in the country). Special
emphasis is given to the promotion of cooperatives and other forms of col-
lective management traditional among the Indian population. While still
controversial, the labor communities introduced in the industrial, rrining,
and fisheries sectors to bring about workers' participation in profits and
ownership are now a fact in Peruvian economic life. Marketing of the im-
portant export products is now Government controlled, and the state takeover
of the basic industries - iron and steel, metal refining, cement, paper,
petrochemicals and fertilizers - is virtually complete. The power and
telecommunications sectors have been reorganized to become totally state
managed. Publicly-owned banks have become more active. In parallel, the
Government is carrying out comprehensive reforms of the public administra-
tion, which include reorganization of many ministries, strengthening their
planning offices, and setting up of a series of new state enterprises to
implement the new policies.
5.        The 1971-75 development plan projected extremely ambitious figures
for public investment; in fact, they were challenges for the executing
agencies rather than realistic targets. The agencies' performance in the
first year, 1971, was rather disappointing, but 1972 was muchi better, with
an increase in investment outlays of over 15 percent in real terms. Indica-
tions are that the 1973 expansion will be similar.
6.        A new medium-term development plan for the 1975-78 period is being
prepared, built around the same objectives: achievement and consolidation
of the structural reforms, and a further reduction of unemployment and
underemployment. Increased importance is likely to be given to the produc-
tion performance of agriculture, where public support has been relatively
lacking in recent years as attention has been concentrated on the redistrib-
utive aspec:t of agrarian reform. Industry and mining are likely to retain
their investment priorities, with petroleum development a probable new im-
portant field (see paragraph 11). The Government meanwhile is taking steps
to strengthen project preparation and to set up an improved monitoring
system for execution.
7.        The 1973-74 budget and investment program contained a significant
unfinanced gap, which would have to be closed by new revenue measure3 un-
less capital expenditures fall much short of the projected levels. Devel-
opments during 1973 have now made evideat the need for strong action in the
near future. The increase in current expenditures over the budgeted amounts
has been larger than that of revenues, leading to a further deterioration of
central government savings. Revenues from income taxes have been buoyant,
reflecting the high profits in the export industries but the yield from the
1972 tax measures has fallen short of expectations. Expenditures were higher
than foreseen, particularly for interest and defense.
8.        Adding to the fiscal pressures are the sharp increases in world
prices for some imported commodities where Peruvian Governments have tradi-
tionally sought to maintain low consumer prices: wheat, edible oils, and



- 3 -
petroleum. The most drastic case is that of wheat, which is almost entirely
imported and where the import price for 1974 is expected to be nearly three
times the earlier long-term average. This means that despite a price increase
to consumers of over 40 percent, which was approved in January, the cost of
the subsidy may still be of the order of S/.3.0 billion this year (almost
1 percent of GDP). The decision of the Government not to let gasoline prices
rise to reflect the higher cost of imported petroleum may add another SI. 2.0
billion to the subsidies and other minor items a further S/.1.0 billion. In
terms of new revenues, the Government has so far only introduced a temporary
export surtax, but the yield for 1974 is estimated at only about S/.l.0 bil-
lion. This is clearly insufficient.
9.        Heavy imports of capital goods, industrial and food products are
needed. Rapid export growth is thus required to avoid balance of payments
problems again becoming a constraint to growth. The Government is aware of
this and is pursuing a vigorous development program in the mining sector,
which is seen as the major provider of additional export earnings for the
foreseeable future. Major mining projects underway are Cuajone, where the
private developer (Southern Peru) had invested some $180 million by the end
of 1973, and Cerro Verde, which is the first project undertaken by the state
mining corporation, MINEROPERU. Together with some expansion from independ-
ent medium and small mines, these projects should almost double annual cop-
per output by 1976-77, increasing export receipts by over $250 million.
MINEROPERU has several other large projects for which technical work has
been initiated and discussions with potential foreign partners are continuing.
10.       The decline in the anchovy catch which took place in 1972 continued
throughout 1973. The catch was only one-fifth that of pre-crisis years. Very
high fishmeal prices limited the loss of export earnings to some $100 mil-
lion, however, and this was more than offset by price gains on other exports.
International reserves had gone up by over $100 million by the end of
November. This reflects foreign investment in mining and petroleum explora-
tion, and substantial non-project borrowing by the Government (see para-
graph 14).
11.       Petroleum could provide significant additional exports.     The pace
of exploration in the Amazon basin has been stepped up, and foreign com-
panies are expected to initiate drilling programs this year. Further sub-
stantial exploration must be completed before petroleum prospects can be
firmly assessed. However, PETROPERU has contracted for detailed engineering
of a trans-Andean pipeline and signed preliminary contracts for the supply
of pipe in the expectation that the positive preliminary indications will
be confirmed. It should not be difficult to arrange the financing of the
pipeline once sufficient reserves are proven and the Government hopes that
petroleum can flow in 1976.
12.       About two-thirds of 1973's petroleum needs were covered by domestic
production. *The declining trend in production was reversed last year, and a
further increase in production is expected this year. This would reduce im-
port dependence further. The higher prices expected to prevail for Peru's



-4-
major export commodities would at the same time boost export revenues far
above earlier projections (contained in Annex I). Peru's balance of pay-
ments situation should not deteriorate significantly through 1975 despite
the higher prices for food imports, provided that there is a moderate
recovery of fishmeal exports. The fishmeal prospects remain a major
uncertainty in the short term.
13.       Since 1967-68, Peru has been able gradually to restore the confidence
of creditors and to obtain a rapidly increasing volume of new loans, total-
ling over $500 million in 1973 (see Annex I, page 3). Although over half of
this amount has been contracted with private financial institutions there has
been some improvement in the average terms of new loans contracted in recent
years, but debt service will remain high for the next few years. Taking into
account also the uncertainties introduced by t:he anchovy crisis, the Govern-
ment has preferred to shift part of this burden forward beyond 1976, when
the new exports (minerals, petroleum) are expected to ease the pressures on the
balance of payments. To this effect it has contracted in 1972 and 1973 a
substantial volume of commercial bank loans for refinancing purposes, in
addition to the new loans referred to above. This has helped maintain inter-
national reserves, which exceeded $400 million at the end of 1973.
14.       Actual commitments of project loans during 1973 of $273 million
fell somewhat short of the $295 million which had been projected in the
most recent economic report, wlhile total borrowing was much larger than
foreseen owing to the Government's greater recourse to non-project
borrowing. Gross external capital requirements by 1976 are estimated at
$550 million, including $470 million of new project loan commitments.
Debt service is likely to remain at about 23 percent of export earnings
throughout the 1973-76 period.
15.       At a meeting in June 1973 members of the Consultative Grou9 re-
cognized the country's serious development ambitions, particularly com-
mending the Government's effort to combine eccinomic growth with social
justice, and indicated their willingness to extend financial assistance,
in part on concessional terms, in support of these efforts.    Under t'le
Consultative Group arrangement the volume of project loans with a term of
seven years or more from governments, banks and international instit!itions
increased from $113 million in 1972 to $181 million in 1973, consisting of
$46.7 million from governments and government agencies (Germany, Japan,
the Netherlands and Canada), $18.3 million from the IDB, $49.0 million
from the Bank, and $67 million from banks. Further project loans wi-_h
shorter maturities were provided by suppliers ($85.9 million). Eastern
European countries provided additional loans f'or $6.3 million. In addition
to growing in volume, external project assistance is increasingly being
concentrated on the list of projects submitted to donors through the Con-
sultative Group. A further meeting of the Group is planned for later this
year.



16.       The Peruvian Government has shown pragmatism in its economic
management and genuine concern for a more equitable distribution of the
fruits of development. The project preparation and execution capacity of
the various public sector agencies is improving. While debt service is
going to be a burden for the country for several years to come, Peru is
clearly creditworthy for substantial amounts of additional borrowing,
provided the required public revenue measures are taken promptly. Ylhere
is a case for extended grace periods, so as not to increase the debt ser-
vice problems of the next few years. There is also need for some local
currency financing, as the resource transfer required to support the devel-
opment program is not likely to be fully achieved if all lending is restrict-
ed to the foreign exchange component of projects suitable for external fi-
nancing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PERU
17.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's 27th operation in Peru.   With
the $24 million loan for the education project, signed on December 5, 1973,
total Bank lending to Peru has reached $292.3 million net of cancellations.
Of this amount, 40 percent has been for transportation (mainly highways and
ports), 30 percent for agriculture, 23 percent for electric power and 8 per-
cent for education. In addition, a small loan was made for industry. IFC
commitments to date have been about $9 million - all in industry - of which
$0.4 million is held by the Corporation. Project execution has been
generally satisfactory. Annex II contains a statement of Bank loans and IFC
investments as of February 28, 1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects. Bank loans to Peru constitute about 10 percent of total outstand-
ing debt, including undisbursed, and are estimated to have absorbed 5.6
percent of the country's external debt service obligations in 1973.
18.       In my report on the education project (Report No. P-1300a-PE, datecd
October 30, 1973), I stated that further lending to Peru should await a re-
view of progress on settlement of outstanding investment disputes. Since
then, the USA and Peruvian governments have signed an agreement settling in-
vestment disputes with regard to American investors, which constituted the
bulk of the claims. In the case of expropriations affecting companies of
other countries, mainly in the fishmeal and fishoil industry, guidelines for
valuation of the properties involved have been established and the valuation
process is well advanced, after initial auditing delays. In these c::rcumst^-
ances I conclude that the Bank should proceed with the proposed loan
19.       Besides continuing to review Peru's performance and creditx,orthiness
as required for the meetings of the Consultative Group, the Bank also .Iamlls
to send a mission in 1975 to prepare a basic report on the economy of Peru.
This report will take a more comprehensive view of the Peruvian economy,
analyzing prospects for the remainder of the decade. Towards this goal at)
agricultural sector study is now being completed, and we are plannin,-; to
review the other productive sectors, notably industry, mining and enemgy Ii
a part of the basic report.



- 6 -
20.       At present two projects are at the appraisal stage.    One is a com-
bination of road and river port development designed to complete the all-weather
road corridor across the Andes assisted by the proposed loan and to facilitate
river traffic in the Peruvian Amazon area. Ttle other is to expand the power
distribution network in the rapidly growing Lima-Callao area. Follcwing up
on the recent agricultural sector mission Bank staff are now assisting the
government in the preparation of projects for rural development in the Sierra
and irrigation rehabilitation in the coastal area to support the Government's
objectives of attaining a more equitable distribution of income and increasing
food production. Bank staff are also assisting in the preparation of a DFC
project designed to strengthen the capacity of COFIDE, the Government-owned
development bank, in financing industrial and tourism development. In addi-
tion, the Bank is planning to participate in the expansion program of
CENTROMIN-PERU, which took over the assets of the Cerro de Pasco operation,
to expand copper production and exports. IFC is presently at an advanced
stage of negotiations for a loan and equity participation in the Cuajone
copper project and is actively exploring other investment possibilities in
the country.
PART III - TRANSPORTATION IN PERU
21.       The Andes, the world's second highest mountain range, divile Peru
in three markedly different physical regions: the Coast, where most of the
industrial and modern agricultural development has taken place; the Andean
highlands, with most of the miining activities of the country; and the sparse-
ly populated but potentially rich Amazon jungle region. The economic develop-
ment of the country has been influenced considerably by this geographical
division, and has resulted in a concentration of most of the economir activity
and wealth along the narrow coastal region, in particular the Lima-Callao
metropolitan area.   The absence of adequate transportation infrastructure
linking the three geographic areas has largely contributed to this situation,
by limiting specialization and the generation of surpluses for exchange on
the basis of each region's comparative advantage.
22.       Transport facilities are constrained by the difficult topography
of Peru. The Panamerican Highway, running the entire length of the countrv
near the coast, provides the backbone of the Peruvian network. Mlajor
secondary roads and two railway lines link the most important coastal cities
and the main ports with large towns and mining centers in the Andean highlands.
A few roads leading into the Amazon jungle have been under construction for
several years, but the topographic, geologic and climatic conditions have
largely contributed to the absence of arn all-year link between the coast
and the interior of the country.   Aside from aviation, which provides limited
transport capacity, the only semi-permarnent connection between the three
regions is the Lima-Pucallpa road, which links the Lima-Callao metropolitan
area in the Coast to the Amazon river, and through it to the Atlantic Ocean.
However, some critical sections of this road, as described below, still



- 7 -
need major investments in drainage, protective structures and other improve-
ments to provide for an all-weather road and reduce the presently high
maintenance and transport costs.
23.       The transportation system on the whole is in a rudimentarY condi-
tion, resulting in high transport costs, long travel times, and considerable
damage to both vehicles and cargo. The road network comprises some 50,000
km of roads of which only 5,000 km are paved. There are 35 ports, of which
11 handle most of Peru's international trade. The railway system is limited
to two separate lines, which largely specialize in ore transportation. In
view of the unusually difficult topographic condition of the country, the
relatively long distances involved and the still low volume of traffic
between major population centers in the three regions, air transportation is
playing an important role in opening up new areas -- in particular the
prospective oil fields in the Amazon jungle -- linking various popuiation
centers in the interior where extensive fixed transport facilities cannot
be justified, and connecting major urban areas along the coast, where surface
transportation involves substantial travelling time.
24.       On the whole, the present transport system satisfies the minimum
requirements of the coastal area, but is inadequate to the development needs
of the mountainous and amazonic jungle regions. In view of the high cost of
road investments in Peru, more careful screening of investment projects than
in the past is required and the Government is appropriately cautious in its
investment decisions for new roads. Contrary to the ambitious road develop-
ment plans of the past, the Government's strategy is to give relatively low
priority to new road construction in the short term, unless it is part of a
broader development scheme, while emphasizing road maintenance, for which
budgetary allocations have been increased considerably. As to the longer
term transport requirements, there is no doubt that substantial investments
in roads will be needed in the coming years.
25.       To carry out this strategy, the Government is increasingly focuss-
ing on three key aspects that need to be strengthened: the transport plan-
ning and coordination mechanisms, the maintanance level on existing roads
and the technical know-how to build roads in the Andean terrain. As to the
first aspect, improvement has been noted since 1969, when coordination and
administration of the transport sector, which was carried out by various
agencies, was centralized in the Ministry of Transport and Communications.
In addition, to strengthen the still limiited planning capacity of the Ministry,
the Bank has been entrusted as Executing Agency of a United Nations Jevelop-
ment Programme-financed project to assist the Government in reviewin- the
policies and practices, evaluate the systems of data collection, existing
transport studies, and other related matters, in order to establish improved
planning and review procedures, assist in the preparation of a five-year
plan, and train the Peruvian technicians needed to set up an effective plan-
ning organization. The Bank is also involved, together with the Uniced Nations
Economic Commission for Latin America, in a technical assistance program,
which will provide the necessary statistical information on a continuing basis
for transportation planning purposes. These efforts should help the Government



- 8 -
in screening larger and more complicated investment projects, which will be
required to meet the longer-term transportation requirements of the country.
26.       In the past the maintenance level of existing highway infrastructure
has been poor and there has been serious deterioration of roads through
inadequate and insufficient repair and seal coat:ing. This resulted from
insufficient allocations of funds for maintenance, partly because of past
fiscal stringencies. The Government hias near:Ly quadrupled the maintenance
budget since 1967 but, even so, the maintenance budget is still not large
enough. As the financial constraint is removed, other limitations, mainly
organizational and lack of qualified staff are likely to prove to be more
pressing. In order to help remove this constraint, the Bank financed under
the 1970 highway reconstruction loan a study of a maintenance program and
the related training requirements for such a program.
27.       Finally, as to the development of technology for road con<;truction,
the Andean highland configuration poses serious difficulties in road design
and construction methods. The combination of unstable terrain, difficult
seismic, geological and soil conditions and torrential rains cause frequent
floodings and landslides with consequent damage to the roads. Although
significant experience has been gained in recent construction work through
the Andes, particularly in the Bank financed La Oroya-Aguaytia road,
extensive geotechnic studies are being carriecd out prior to deciding specific
road investments.
28.       The level of road user charges in Peru is considered acceptable
but the structure of such charges needs to be improved. Although there is
an element of progressive taxation in the present structure by taxing more
heavily gasoline in the Coast than in the Amazonic jungle, for example, it
appears that charges paid by the Lima-Callao area do not cover the social
costs generated by private vehicles used for urban traffic. Also, indications
are that a large portion of truckers are not paying their share of road
use since diesel oil is not specially taxed and these truckers are tie major
contributors to rapid deterioration of the road network. At a step towards
improving this situation the Government will, under the proposed project,
carry out a study of the marginal costs of the various vehicles using the
road network in Peru, and the conclusions of such a study will he used as <n
input for revising road user charges (Section 4.05 of the Loan Agreement).
PART IV - THIE l'ROJECT
29.       The proposed project would be the 12th in Peru's transportation
sector receiving Bank financing; it was appraised in March 1973 and, fniicw'in
a change in the scope of the project, reappraised in November 1973.   loan
negotiations took place in Washington, D.C. on March 11-15, 1974. Tli,
Peruvian delegation was led by Mir. Franklin Caceres, Executive Direclor of
Public Credit of the Ministry of Finance, and included representativc; ot t.ie

Ministry of Transport and Communications. A Loan and Project Summary is
attached as Annex III. An Appraisal Report (No. 302a-PE) dated April 11,
1974, on the project is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
30.       While the ports and railway projects have been carried ou. relatively
smoothly, experience with the road proiects has usually been difficult. Two
of the loans, totalling $15 million, were made for road maintenance (127-PE
and 300-PE) with mixed results in the first and considerable success in the
second. The reconstruction project, (706-PE), geared to build up rcads in the
earthquake striken area and to provide technical assistance to improve road
maintenance efforts, is now proceeding satisfactorily after delays _n the
engineering work. Two road improvement projects, both for the Lima--Pucallpa
road, have been plagued with difficulties from the outset. The first one
(271-PE), which helped finance the reconstruction and pavement of about 170 km
of the Aguaytia-Pucallpa road, was only 80 percent completed when loan funds
were exhausted in 1967, mainly because of the unexpectedly difficult soils
and climatic conditions. At that time, because of the stringent fiscal situa-
tion, the Government was unable to raise funds to continue the works. Exten-
sive failures have since occurred in the work done. In May 1969, the Government
appointed a Ministerial Commission to investigate the quality and condition of
the works and the causes of their failure. On the strength of the Commission's
report, the Government initiated legal proceedings against the consultant and
contractor, claiming that the failures were due to the use of unsatisfactory
materials and inadequate construction methods. Pending settlement cf the dis-
pute the Government suspended major works to complete the unfinished project.
With the recent out-of-court settlement of this case, the Government is now
planning to undertake the necessary works to bring this road up to the standards
originally envisaged. The second road improvement loan (425-PE) was made to
finance 60 percent of the construction v7orks on the La Oroya-Aguaytia segment
of the Lima-Pucallpa road. However, after large cost overruns, the Bank agreed
in November 1969 to reduce the scope of the project, which was completed by
January 1973. The remaining works to complete the La Oroya-Aguaytia segment
are to be carried out in two stages, the first one -- between Huanuco and
Aguaytia -- would be covered under the proposed project, as explained more
fully below, and the second one - between Huanuco and La Oroya - would be
covered under the next Bank transport loan for Peru.
Description
31.       The proposed project consists of:
(a)  Construction and improvement of the road from Huanuco
to Aguaytia, totaling about 219 km;
(b) Construction and improvemet of feeder roads, totaling
about 200 km;



- 10 -
(c) Resealing of a 61 km stretch of t.he road from Neshuya
to Pucallpa;
(d)  Acquisition and utilization of maintenance equipment
for the La Oroya-Pucallpa road;
(e) Consulting services for:
(i) Construction supervision of (a) (b) and (c);
(ii) Geotechnical studies;
(iii) Preinvestment studies; and
(iv) Study of marginal costs of road transport.
32.       The main objective of the project is to open up Peru's hinterland
by significantly reducing transport costs along the road from the coast to
Pucallpa (and from there by river to the Brazilian border) and by eliminating
closures of this road in extreme climatic conditions.   The project would not
only substantially improve the link between the Coast and the Amazon jungle
but also improve access to a number of other economically underdeveloped areas
with rich agricultural potential, such as the fertile valley of the Huallaga
River, where spontaneous settlements of peasants from the highlands have
already taken place with the road developments thus far in the area and some
Government assistance.  Bank involvement in the project is also aimed at
assuring appropriate design standard's, execution and ensuing maintenance of
the road. Most highway projects involve a tradeoff between construction costs,
on the one hand, and maintenance and vehicle operating costs, on the other.
The minimum cost solution which has been worked out during appraisal of thie
project has resulted in relatively modest engineering standards for a number
of sections of the road, in the most difficult: mountainous stretches, which
would call for an important maintenance effort. To meet this requirement,
the acquisition and utilization of the necessary maintenance equipment for
the 1luanuco-Aguaytia section and for the rest of the transport corridor up
to La Oroya on the one end and to Pucallpa on the other, has been included
in the project.  A maintenance program based on consultant's recommendations
would be undertaken to help assure a satisfactory maintenance level on the
entire road (Schedule 2, Part C 1 of the Loan Agreement).
33.       The project will be executed by the Ministry of Transport and Communi-
cations through its Directorate General for Land Transport with the assistance
of consultants, and is expected to be completed by the end of 1977. The General
Directorate for Land Transport staff is of high technical quality, although
short in quantity, and they are expected to carry out the project adequately,
with the aid of the consultants services provided under the loan. Also, the
new organizational structure, which combines highway planning, design,
construction and maintenance under one Directorate of the Ministry, will
help improve performance.  Past failures in highway construction in Peru
have been mostly due to the extremely heavy and unexpected magnitude of the
difficulties encountered. It is expected, however, that the experience gained



by all the parties concerned with previous construction works across the
Andes -Ministry's officials, foreign and local contractors and consultants,
and the Bank-- will bear fruit for the proposed and future projects.
Costs and Financing
34.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $40.0 million equiv-
alent, of which about $21.1 million are in foreign exchange. This cost
estimate includes contingency allowances for both increases in quantities
and price escalation which amount to $3.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively.
Price increases have been estimated at rates varying between 5 percent and 10
percent per annum for the various components of the project during the three
and a half year construction period; increases in quantities have been estimated
at 15 percent of construction costs. The latter percentage, which is unusually
high, is justified by the uncertainties involved in road construction in the
Andes and past experience in earlier Bank loans for road projects ir. this
area.
35.       The proposed $26 million loan would finance the foreign exchange
costs of the project and $4.9 million of local currency costs, in line with
our assessment that the resource transfer required to support the country's
development program is not likely to be achieved if lending is restricted to
the foreign exchange component of projects suitable for external financing.
A grace period of five years, i.e., one and a half years beyond the estimated
disbursement period, is proposed for the loan, in view of the balance of pay-
ments tightness which Peru is likely to experience until the mining projects
now under construction, and perhaps petroleum prospecting, bear fruit.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Construction contracts will be awarded after international competitive
bidding except for the construction and improvement of feeder roads, which
because of their dispersed locations and small size, the Borrower would have
the option to carry out by force account'under supervision of consultants
(para. 2 of Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement). Bidding procedures azceptable
to the Bank for the reconstruction works on the Huanuco-Aguaytia road have
been already initiated but no expenditures have been incurred in the project
as yet. Procurement of equipment is to be made through international com-
petitive bidding, with local suppliers to be granted a margin of preference
of 15 percent or the customs duties payable by a non-exempt importer, whichever
is less. At present, major maintenance equipment is not produced in Peru.
37.       Disbursements will be made on the following basis:     (a) 65 percent
of total expenditures for civil works contracts and of total expenditures
certified by consultants in the case of works carried out by force account:
(b) 60 percent of total expenditures for consulting services; and (c) 100 per-
cent of foreign exchange costs of road maintenance equipment. Based on the
project execution schedule, the Loan will be fully disbursed by mid-1978.

Justification
38.       The project is economically justified.    Taking into account only
savings in presently very high maintenance costs and direct users savings in
vehicle operating costs, the economic rate of resturn is estimated at 24 percent.
This does not include other important benefits, such as time savings of drivers
and passengers, the reduction of traffic accidents, breakage and spoilage of
cargo, reduced inventory requirements for goods in transit and, more import-
antly, the multiplying effects on productive activities in the areas to be
opened up. As has been observed with the first phase of this project, it is
likely that the proposedl project will have a development effect on the agri-
culture production areas with widespread benefits to their population. The
immediate effect of the proposed investment will probably be to lower prices
of agricultural and forestry products from the hinterlands to consumers in
the coast, and to reduce prices of industrial products from the coastal
region to Andean and hinterland consumers sinc-e the Peruvian truck industry
is highly competitive.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUR ENTS AND AtJTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of the Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
40.       The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans
for road projects.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOP4E*NDATION
42.       In formulating this proposal, if has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However,
available information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully justified.
43.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 418-PE: San Lorenzo Irrigation Project; US$11 million Loan of June
18, 1965. Closing Date: December 31, 1974
Due to inadequacy of water supply, the Bank agreed to reduce the
project area; consequently, the project was redefined and the original loan
amount of US$11.0 million was reduced to US$6.5 million. (See Memorandum to
the Executive Directors "Peru; Proposed Change in Loan 418-PE", February 28,
1968 R68-33). The closing date, originally June 20, 1967, was three times
postponed, first to June 30, 1969, then to December 31, 1973, and then to
December 31, 1974. The project has encountered a number of difficulties,
both administrative and technical but these problems are being overcome.
Project management has recently been strengthened and the last part of the
project related to the drainage scheme is now progressing satisfactorily;
disbursements have also picked up. Undisbursed funds amount to US$0.8 and
the loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the revised Closing Date of
December 31, 1974.
Loan 706-PE: Road Reconstruction Project; US$30 million
Loan of September 14, 1970; Closing Date:    September 30, 1975
This loan was signed only three and a half months after the earth-
quake in the Callejon de Huaylas. However, the identification, fea;ibility
study and final engineering of the roads to be improved have taken rmuch longer
than expected because of a too optimistic assessment at the time of appraisal,
because of administrative and coordination difficulties in connection with
the on-going decentralization of the Central Government, and because of prob-
lems with the consultants engaged to study and supervise the project. Con-
struction of a short section of road near Huaraz, the capital of the region,
is well advanced. W4ork has started on the two remaining sections along the
Callejon: bidding for the access road was already carried out and construction
of this last section should start soon. The road reconstruction element of
the project is expected to be completed by the end of 1976, 15 months later
than the Closing Date of the Loan.
Loan 933-PE: Agricultural Credit Project; US$25.0 million Loan of September
12, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The Loan was signed in September 1973 and became effective on December
12, 1973. BFA has commenced field work, such as sub-loan appraisal, and pro-
gress is satisfactory.
Loan 949-PE: Education Project; US$24.0 million Loan of December 5, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
This loan became effective on March 5, 1974.
1_ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.
