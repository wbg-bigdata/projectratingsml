                      SCHEDULE 5

shall be sufficient to enable it to carry out the
Development Project and to contribute at least 30% of the
aggregate cost thereof (excluding the cost land).

alia, of the existence of markets for its output; (b)
designed in accordance with appropriate safety, health
and environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank; and
(c) calculated to have a financial rate of return and an
economic rate of return of at least 12% each; all as

loan under Part B of the Project, the rate of interest
established by the Guarantor's Minister of Finance,

established and operating under the laws of the Guarantor
pursuant to the Convention dated December 31, 1988, as

Beneficiary or by other appropriate legal means, rights
adequate to protect the interests of the Bank and the
Borrower, including:
     (a)  that each Beneficiary shall undertake to: (i)

the goods and services to be financed out of the proceeds
of the Loan at a reasonable price, account being taken

therefor, and, in the case of services, of their quality
and the competence of the parties rendering them
(provided that the Beneficiary may, with the prior
approval of the Bank, carry out works under force account
in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank);
and utilize such goods and services exclusively in the
carrying out of the Development Project; (iii) enable the
Bank and the Borrower to inspect such goods and the sites
and works included in the Development Project, the
operation thereof, and any relevant records and
documents; (iv) take out and maintain with responsible

proceeds of the Loan to the place of use or installation,
any indemnity thereunder to be made payable in a currency
freely useable by the Beneficiary to replace or repair
such goods; and (v) prepare and furnish to the Borrower,
for forwarding to the Bank, if so requested by the Bank,
all such information as the Bank or the Borrower shall
reasonably request relating to the foregoing and to the
management, operations and financial condition of the
Beneficiary and to the benefits to be derived from the
Development Project; and
     (b)  provisions to ensure the right of the Borrower
