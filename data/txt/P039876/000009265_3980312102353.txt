COSTA RICA
BIODIVERSITY RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Country, Sector, and Project Background
1.    Costa Rica's Biological Diversity. Costa Rica's 51,100 square kilometers of the isthmus
joining North and South America contain at least half a million species in habitats ranging from
near desert to exceedingly wet rain forests and cloud forests, and from sea level to over 3,500
meters. It is estimated that there are about 13,000 species of plants, 30,000 fungi, 1,500
vertebrates, 290,000 insects, 75,000 aquatic organisms from fresh to brackish waters, 15,000
marine invertebrates, up to 50,000 spiders, mites, and other terrestrial invertebrates, as many as
10,000 nematodes, and innumerable species of bacteria and viruses. Eighty percent of these
species, many of which have yet to be described and named, have ranges that extend into other
countries in Central and South America. Some species extend from central Brazil or Bolivia,
through Costa Rica, to Guatemala and southern Mexico.
2.    Government's Biodiversity Strategy. Costa Rica is at the forefront of biodiversity
conservation and management. Recognizing that its biological resources are an important
national asset, Costa Rica has actively pursued a policy of conservation and protection, and has
encouraged innovation in financing and administration. The Government has articulated a
strategy with three main objectives: (i) the establishment of large areas for conservation; (ii) the
assessment of the biodiversity that lies within the conserved areas; and (iii) the integration of the
sustainable use of biodiversity into the intellectual and economic fabric of the society. Congress is
in the process of deliberating a proposed Biodiversity Law, which is expected to be approved
prior to April 1998. Costa Rica received Global Environment Facility (GEF) financing in August
1996 and has started to update the National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and to prepare an
action plan which will further endorse and elaborate these objectives.
3.    Establishment of Conservation Areas. Since the early 1970s, about 25 percent of the
country's territory has been designated as national parks, national forests, and equivalent reserves.
In 1986, the administration of these protected areas was transferred to the newly created Ministry
of Natural Resources, Energy and Mines, renamed the Ministry of Environment and Energy
(MINAE) in 1995. MINAE has inherited regulatory, policy and management responsibilities over
natural resources as diverse as minerals, energy, and forests.
4.    Based on the National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy of 1989, a National System of
Conservation Areas (Sistema National de Areas de Conservacion; SINAC) was initiated with the
goal of consolidating small, separate protected areas into eleven Conservation Areas. SINAC is
increasingly characterized by decentralization of administration, deconcentration of resources,
collegial structures of decision-making, and grouping of contiguous areas into larger units.



2
5.    Assessment of Biodiversity. In 1989 the National Biodiversity Institute (Instituto
Nacional de Biodiversidad; INBio) was created as a non-governmental, non-profit association to:
(i) develop a strategy and carry out an inventory of Costa Rica's biodiversity; (ii) begin integrating
national collections into one physical and administrative entity; and (iii) put biodiversity
information into an easily accessible format for public access. In 1994 [NBio was authorized by
MINAE to develop and execute a National Biodiversity Invenitory in the Conservation Areas in
Costa Rica.
6.    INBio has experimented intensively at various Conservation Areas, notably the
Guanacaste Conservation Area (ACG), to successfully develop creative approaches to
undertaking a large-scale biodiversity inventory. An important innovation is the use of specially
trained staff from the communities surrounding the Conservation Areas to work as
parataxonomists in collecting and preparing biological specimrens. These parataxonomists
understand local conditions and risks, have been trained by curators to collect, mount, and
preserve specimens, and undertake targeted collection in consultation with the curators. This
reduces the redundancy in collection, facilitates identification, and helps create community
involvement. The work of these parataxonomists, supported by technicians and curators, reduces
the time and effort required of international and national taxonomists to collect and prepare
specimens for identification, and enables the experts to concentrate on classification of species.
Another innovation is the development of an easily accessible computerized biodiversity
information management system using bar-coding to identify specimens collected by
parataxonomists.
7.    Sustainable Use of Biodiversitv. Knowledge on the species that exist within a certain area,
their correct identification and natural history, seasonal migration patterns, geographic
distribution, and status, is the starting point for the use of biodiiversity in conservation, land use
planning, environmental impact assessments and environmental monitoring. Accurate scientific
documentation and identification of specimens is essential for verifying, cataloguing, and
identifying distributions for further research, collection, or development.
8.    INBio has been at the forefront of using the knowledge obtained through its inventory
work. It has: initiated ground breaking bioprospecting projects with several pharmaceutical
companies, notably Merck and Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb,; pioneered bio-literacy projects with
school children; created multimedia products to inform and eclucate the Costa Rican public;
experimented with the use of wild species in integrated agricultural pest management; and
increased the ecotourism potential of Conservation Areas through enhanced knowledge of flora
and fauna.
9.    Project Background. With the mandate to develop a National Biodiversity Inventory, it
was clear to INBio that in order to take advantage of the savings made possible through INBio's
innovative approaches, the scale of inventory activities would have to be increased. This
expansion in collection, cataloguing, and identification of sustainable use of biodiversity would tax
their human, physical, and managerial resources. Therefore EI;Bio approached the GEF and other
donors to assist it in establishing a framework to strengthen institutional capacity by: training
more parataxonomists, technicians, and curators; building more infrastructure for sorting,



3
analysis, and storage; purchasing more equipment; expanding management systems; and
strengthening the uses and applications of biodiversity services to increase revenue generating
opportunities and general awareness of the contribution of biological resources to ecosystem and
environmental health, and to sustainable development.
10.   The donors responded positively, in part due to expected GEF support. NORAD, the
Norwegian Development Agency, provided two grants of US$ 0.4 million in April 1995 and US$
1.4 million in October 1997 to: enable a series of participatory workshops to take place with
scientific Taxonomic Working Groups and potential clients and users so as to determine the
methodologies and protocols that should be used for collection and cataloguing; undertake limited
collection and cataloguing activities; pilot the development of products based on the inventory;
and develop institutional capacity at INBio. These NORAD funded activities lay the foundation
for, and are closely aligned with, the project (although they are not necessary for the viability of
the project). In June 1995, the GEF Secretariat approved a US$ 283,000 Project Development
Facility Block B Grant (PDF) to assist INBio in preparing this project and to mobilize donor
assistance. In 1996 the Government of Canada launched a five year grant of US$ 3.4 million to
strengthen management capacity at INBio, to finance infrastructure for the Bio-Prospecting
laboratory, and to finance meetings with indigenous communities adjacent to Conservation Areas.
11.   While these donor-funded activities were being undertaken, the Government formed
several working groups, in which INBio and SINAC both participated, to discuss the sustainable
development of biodiversity in Costa Rica. As a result of these discussions and the work that had
been undertaken with the assistance of donor-funded projects, it became apparent that the
sustainability of the Conservation Areas depends on the benefits generated for society and the
local communities. As a result, SINAC has focused on developing a decentralized system of
Conservation Areas that takes an ecosystem approach to conservation, and that involves the local
community in the development of strategies for sustainable development. INBio and SINAC have
agreed that inventory activities should be based on community demand-driven criteria, and should
cover a range of ecosystems and geographic locations.
12.   Based on this approach, in December 1997, the Government of the Netherlands has
approved a four year grant of US$ 8.2 million, which would finance the collection and
cataloguing of five taxonomic groups including plants, mollusks, nematodes, lepidoptera, and
vertebrates; ecosystem mapping for the Conservation Areas; the further development of the
biodiversity information management system; projects based on sustainable uses and applications
of the inventory; and infrastructure, training, and institutional strengthening of the Conservation
Areas and INBio. The activities funded by the Dutch are highly complementary to this project
(although not necessary for its viability).
13.   Since initiating the National Biodiversity Inventory, and with the help of the donor funded
activities, INBio has so far trained 61 parataxonomists, 20 technicians, and 25 curators, collected
two million specimens and entered them into the database, and identified an average of ten new
species each month.



4
14.   Project Strategy. The project would build on this work carried out by INBio. The
taxonomic groups included in this project are: Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, and fungi.
These four taxonomic groups are part of a high priority group of taxa that were chosen because,
together, they cover a wide spectrum of species richness and a broad range of niches and habitats.
They cover a range of collecting and cataloguing logistical challenges and represent a range of
prior taxonomic knowledge and difficulty. Species from each group are represented at the
national and international level, and will provide experience relevant to other countries. These
four taxonomic groups are expected to generate a large number of potential applications and
potential uses. Criteria used to select the taxonomic groups for inclusion in the project are
presented in Technical Annex 2.
15.   Five Conservation Areas have been chosen as sites for collection activities, in both this
project and the Dutch project: Tempisque, Arenal-Tilaran, Amistad Caribe, Amistad Pacifico, and
Osa. These Conservation Areas have been chosen because of their high coverage of Costa Rican
biodiversity, significant endemism, and outstanding biological importance for Costa Rica and
Meso-America, as well as their human, financial, and infrastructure resources. Tempisque covers
t:.e driest region of Costa Rica, and includes an important wetlands refuge. Arenal-Tilaran is
physiographically complex, with volcanic activity, humid tropical forests, and a breadth of rainfall
gradients and soil heterogeneity, resulting in high biodiversity and endemism. Amistad Caribe and
Amistad Pacifico cover the highest mountain ranges in the country, with altitudes ranging from
sea level to 3,800 meters above sea level, and extend to both t:he Pacific and Caribbean coasts.
Amistad Caribe includes the largest wilderness area in Meso-America, and Amistad Pacifico
consists of mid and high elevation protected areas with extensive subalpine paramo vegetation
with high endemism, and montane forests dominated by oak. ODsa, which includes the Corcovado
National Park, contains most of the lowland tropical rain forests that occur on the Pacific side of
Meso-America, and harbors high numbers of endemic species. Technical Annex 3 describes the
biological importance of these areas in more detail.
Project Objectives
16.   This project would demonstrate that increased knowledge and information about
particular species enhance their value and increase the marketability of biodiversity services, by
enhancing the knowledge of Costa Rica's species, testing methodologies for undertaking a cost
effective inventory, and maximizing the value of those species and the social return to the
investment in knowledge through conservation and sustainable use. Specifically, the project
would: (a) develop and update the framework for undertaking a biodiversity inventory of priority
sub-groups within four major taxonomic groups - Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, and fungi -
at selected sites within the five Conservation Areas of Tempisque, Arenal-Tilaran, Amistad
Caribe, Amistad Pacifico, and Osa; (b) undertake the collection and cataloguing activities related
to the inventory; (c) develop and test potential applications based on the inventory; and (d)
strengthen the institutional capacity at INBio.

Project Description
The project is expected to take seven years to implement. The project would have the
following components, described in more detail in Technical Annex 1:
17.   Framework (US$ 0.7 million). This component would finance consultants,
transportation, travel-related expenditures, and materials for: consultations with scientists;
consultations with representatives of different user groups, communities, other stakeholders; and
the work of the Commission on the Use of Indigenous Knowledge and the Sharing of Benefits.
18.   Biodiversity Inventory (US$ 8.0 million). This component would finance: the collection
of specimens for priority sub-groups of the estimated 144,000 species of Hymenoptera,
Coleoptera, Diptera, and fungi in the five Conservation Areas of Tempisque, Arenal-Tilaran, Osa,
Amistad Pacifico, and Amistad Caribe; cataloguing; and information management activities. The
two sub-components would be:
(i) Collection Activities. This sub-component would finance: incremental costs of
salaries for new parataxonomists and research coordinators in the three Conservation Areas that
currently don't have research coordinators; equipment; maintenance; supplies; transportation and
training programs for local parataxonomists and technicians; collection of specimens for
Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, and fungi in the five Conservation Areas; preliminary sorting
of specimens in the field; recording of relevant specimen natural history information; and transfer
of the specimens to INBio for further processing.
(ii) Cataloguing Activities. This sub-component would finance: incremental salaries for
technicians and curators; international taxonomic consultants; equipment; training programs;
recurrent costs on a declining basis at INBio for activities and equipment related to cataloguing
and information management; and travel and per diem for international and national experts
working in Costa Rica who have volunteered their time. This would enable the processing and
storage of the millions of specimens that the collection activities would generate, the identification
and cataloguing of each specimen, and the recording of relevant data in a computerized
information management system.
19.   Sustainable Uses of Biodiversity (US$ 0.9 million). This component would finance
consultants, studies, equipment, materials, publications, seminars, transportation, and per diem for
the development of applications based on the inventory. It is intended to have a demonstration
effect by testing various alternatives to show which are the most feasible for revenue or non-
revenue generating uses.
20.   Institutional Strengthening (US$ 1.3 million). This component would finance
incremental costs of additional personnel, equipment, and recurrent costs on a declining basis for
the Project Coordination Unit. Given the special handling and storage needs of fungi, this
component would finance the infrastructure, equipment, and maintenance costs of a fungi
laboratory at INBio.

Project Financing and Incremental Costs
21.   Total project costs are estimated at US$ 11.0 million equivalent, of which the GEF would
finance about US$ 7.0 million, INBio would finance about US$ 1.0 million in counterpart funds,
and international taxonomists would contribute about US$ 3.0 million in services. Retroactive
financing of US$ 200,000 would be available as of January 16, 1998. The incremental cost of
generating global benefits associated with the GEF-funded project is estimated at about US$ 10.0
million. Of these incremental costs, the GEF would finance US$ 7.0 million and the international
taxonomists would contribute US$ 3.0 million. Schedule A and Technical Annex 5 contain the
project costs and financing plan. The incremental cost analysis and justification for the GEF grant
are provided in Technical Annex 6.
Project Implementation
22.   INBio. INBio operates under an administrative system characterized by decentralized and
collaborative decision making with few levels of hierarchy. The institution is headed by a Director
reporting to the Board of Directors and to an Assembly which has community representation.
Operations are managed by the Director and Deputy Director. The organization has four
divisions, each with a Coordinator: Biodiversity Inventory, Bio-Prospecting, Information
Dissemination, and Information Management. A Project Coordination Unit, reporting to the
Director, has been established to coordinate and manage donoir-funded activities. Field offices,
staffed mainly by parataxonomists, are maintained in some of the Conservation Areas, under the
supervision of Conservation Area management.
23.   SINAC. SINAC is a decentralized and participatory institutional management system that
unifies MINAE's competencies regarding forestry, wildlife and protected area issues, in order to
plan and execute processes aimed at the sustainable management of the country's natural
resources. Administratively, SINAC is a system composed of eleven subsystems called
Conservation Areas. SINAC's Directorate consists of a General Director, Director, an Advisory
Team and a Technical Unit. The main responsibilities of the Technical Unit are to: support the
Conservation Areas through implementation of plans and projects; negotiate international treaties
and conventions on biodiversity; obtain financing; and improve the quality of management and
information systems. The SINAC Director at the center, and the Directors of each Conservation
Area in the field, are responsible for coordination with INBio.
24.   Each Conservation Area is comprised of a Regional Bureau and Subregional Offices. The
Regional Bureau has strategic decision making responsibilities,, which are exercised by the
Director and a Technical 'Committee composed of the Coordinators for Control, Promotion, and
Protected Wildlands. The Local Council advises the Technical Committee, and is composed of
representatives of local communities, governmental and non-governmental institutions, and
groups in the region of influence.
25.   Coordination. A high-level Committee, consisting only of the Director of INBio and the
Minister of MINAE, would meet as necessary to set policy guidelines and resolve issues. A
Coordinating Committee has been established composed of representatives of INBio and SINAC,



7
to serve as the main link between the two organizations, plan and monitor joint activities, build on
experience from previous joint programs, and oversee project implementation. To improve
coordination, the donors (currently including the GEF, the Dutch, and NORAD) would meet once
a year with the Coordinating Committee to review progress made in each project, to evaluate the
use of financial resources provided to the inventory, and to coordinate assistance.
26.   A Project Coordination Unit has been established at INBio, and the Coordinator for this
project has been appointed. The Project Coordination Unit would have regular contact with the
Conservation Area staff. Project activities would take place at the most suitable location; in
general, collection activities and initial sorting would take place within each Conservation Area,
while the methodological framework, cataloguing, and identification of sustainable uses would
take place at INBio. Routine supervisory authority over contractual staff, construction, material
inventories, and daily work programs would be undertaken through existing systems within INBio
and the five Conservation Areas. The Project Coordination Unit would continue to maintain
separate project accounts and retain strict financial controls and contractual authority over all
donor projects and components. INBio has existing accounting, control and auditing systems
which are being used in the management of the PDF. These systems have been evaluated and
found to be adequate to meet the needs of the project. These implementation and coordination
arrangements would be precisely defined in a Cooperative Agreement between INBio and
MINAE, satisfactory to the Bank.
27.   Monitoring and Evaluation. INBio, as recipient of the GEF grant, would have full
responsibility for overall management and supervision of the grant, as well as monitoring and
evaluation. These responsibilities would be exercised through the INBio divisions, the Project
Coordinating Unit established at INBio headquarters in Heredia, and each of the five
Conservation Areas. A project implementation plan for the first year of the project, including
timetables for procurement, has been prepared and agreed with the Bank. Technical Annex 8
includes details of the planning and reporting that will be undertaken by the Project Coordination
Unit.
28.   Twelve indicators have been selected against which successful implementation would be
measured: (a) demand-driven methodologies and protocols developed, tested, improved, and
widely applied for Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and fungi; (b) number of international
scientists familiar with these methodologies and protocols and able to apply them to other national
inventories; (c) recommendations developed and disseminated on the use of indigenous
knowledge and the sharing of benefits; (d) number of communities or organizations participating
in the project; (e) number of specimens of Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and fungi identified
at species level; (f) number of new species described for science; (g) incorporation of biodiversity
information generated by the project into conservation management plans and programs of the
protected areas in the Conservation Areas; (h) number of conservation professionals and decision
makers familiar with the biodiversity information generated by the project and able to influence
conservation management in their own countries; (i) development and implementation of pilot
agreements incorporating the information generated by the project; (j) development of syllabi for
training parataxonomists, technicians, and curators; (k) number of parataxonomists, technicians,



8
and curators trained; and (1) number of voluntary taxonomic days. Quantitative targets for each
indicator can be found in Technical Annex 8.
Sustainability and Participation
29.   Financial sustainability would be promoted by the ongoing use of available funds and
financing mechanisms, and the establishment of equitable revenue sharing mechanisms. Operating
costs for the Protected Areas within the Conservation Areas during and after the project
implementation period would be financed from conventional sources, w-hich include the SINAC
budget, fees for facility use, donor resources, and in some cases endowment funds. INBio and
MINAE would share any income generated from the use of biodiversity, in order to augment the
SINAC budget for the sustainability of the Conservation Areas. Its own share of revenues from
the use of biodiversity would support INBio's operating expenditures. The income generated as a
direct result of this project is expected to be small, since the uses and applications are intended to
have a demonstration effect. Institutional sustainability would be promoted by further
strengthening the scientific, technical and management capacity in Costa Rica, as well as
developing mechanisms for self-sustainability. The sustainability of human resources would be
promoted through training the parataxonomists, technicians, curators and information systems
specialists, who would be expected to continue working at INBio and other institutions after the
project implementation period.
30.   As detailed in Technical Annex 5, project preparation has been participatory. NORAD
and the PDF have funded scientific and technical workshops with national and international
taxonomists to design the framework for inventory activities, and with clients and users to discuss
potential applications. The PDF has also funded community consultations to discuss the possible
benefits of the project to communities adjacent to the Conservation Areas. During
implementation regular consultations and workshops would be held with local, national and
international scientific contributors, clients, and users of the inventory, indigenous and non-
indigenous communities adjacent to the five Conservation Areas, and non-governmental
organizations. In addition, INBio's Assembly, which has cormmunity representation, and the
Local Councils for each Conservation Area, would be asked to provide input and advice.
Lessons Learned and Technical Review
31.   GEF has financed two projects in Costa Rica: the Biodiversity Conservation and
Sustainable Development in the Osa and Amistad Pacifico Conservation Areas Project with the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as the implementing agency; and the
Institutional Development for Biodiversity Management Project with the United Nations
Environment Program as the implementing agency. INBio w2Ls the implementing agency for the
research and inventory component of the UNDP project. After initial administrative start-up
problems, implementation proceeded smoothly. This project wxas to test sampling methodologies
and training protocols, and to strengthen the working relationship between INBio and MINAE.
Lessons have also been learned from the preparation of the Indonesia Biodiversity Collections
Project, which aims to strengthen the management of systematic collections and establish a
computerized database for biodiversity inventory and monitoring. This project has shown the



9
value of client-driven activities and capacity building at the local level, of limited and realistic
project objectives, and of timely availability of counterpart funding.
32.   Four formal independent technical reviews have been undertaken for this project, at an
early stage in May 1995, in December 1996, in September 1997, and in January 1998. The May
1995, review by the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) reviewer endorsed the
project for GEF financing. The reviewer noted that in terms of innovation, potential replicability,
and significance for global biodiversity conservation, the project would rank high according to
GEF project selection criteria. The reviewer noted the global relevance of this project as a
demonstration model, that the implementing agencies were considered appropriate in terms of
both their capacity and mandate, that the project fit well with the national agenda for
environmentally sustainable development, and that it complemented other Costa Rican initiatives
in biodiversity conservation and management. In December 1996, the STAP reviewer
commented that project design had improved and that the project continued to merit GEF
support. Regarding possible refinements to project design, in December 1996 and in September
1997 the STAP reviewer supported the increase in project scope to five Conservation Areas, the
inclusion of Diptera, and greater emphasis on sustainable use. In January 1998, the STAP
reviewer supported the criteria to be used in selecting subgroups, priority collection sites,
cessation of collection activities, and avoidance of overharvesting, noting that life history
characteristics of the subgroups should bear on their selection and also noting the importance of
long-term monitoring of the impact of collection activities.
Rationale for GEF Financing
33.   This project addresses the three main objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity
- conservation, sustainable use, and equitable sharing of benefits. It is a global pilot project which
will test methodologies, and provide lessons and applications that can be applied globally in both
developing and developed countries. It will be particularly relevant to other countries in Central
and South America, many of which share a large number of species with Costa Rica. The project
is consistent with the guidance from the Conference of the Parties, including the Third Conference
of the Parties (COP3). Recommendations from COP3 emphasized the need for capacity building
for taxonomy, greater attention to species important as pollinators (Hymenoptera, Coleoptera)
and for soil fertility (fungi, Coleoptera). This project also addresses the issue of more equitable
sharing of benefits from biodiversity between nations. Consistent with COP guidance and GEF
eligibility requirements, the project addresses the GEF biodiversity focal area (Operational
Program 3, Forest Ecosystems).
34.   Costa Rica ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity in September 1994. The
project has been identified as a national priority; identifies and monitors biodiversity; builds
capacity; provides opportunities for international cooperation in the joint development of
technology; promotes sustainability; serves as a demonstration project; encourages scientific
excellence; takes innovative measures to conserve biodiversity including economic incentives;
strengthens involvement of local communities; and strengthens the conservation, management and
sustainable use of ecosystems. This project is a global pilot being tested in Costa Rica because
Costa Rica has an appropriate enabling environment and capacity in place. The project is



10
expected to develop cost-effective methodologies and to serve as a demonstration model for other
developing countries globally.
35.   This project is fully consistent with the Government's strategies to assess the biodiversity
in conserved areas and to integrate the sustainable use of biodiversity into the country's
development strategy. The Government is firmly committed to the project. The President of
Costa Rica, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Environment, and the Director of the SINAC
have all indicated that this project is a priority, that they have no objection to INBio receiving the
grant, and that the project will receive their full support.
Environmental Aspects
36.   As a biodiversity project in high priority areas, the project is expected to make a major
contribution to environmental goals, both in Costa Rica and globally. Protection of the natural
resource base remains of paramount importance, and project activities have been designed to
avoid any environmental damage. Ecosystem studies will be undertaken, and seminars will be
held with Government officials and non-governmental' organizations in Meso-America on the
sustainable use and management of natural resources. As wit h any inventory activity in protected
areas, there is a risk of over-sampling: criteria have been established for the cessation of sampling,
and will be carefully monitored by the Taxonomic Working Groups. The only infrastructure to be
financed in the project is the construction of a 100 square meter fungi laboratory at INBio, which
is located in a semi-urban area; national guidelines on environrnental assessments will be followed.
Project Benefits
37.   Expected project benefits of global significance include: development of cost-effective
methodologies for undertaking biodiversity inventories; recommendations on the use of
indigenous knowledge and the sharing of benefits; an inventory of four major taxonomic groups,
including species which occur widely throughout Central and South America; rapid training
methodologies for parataxonomists, technicians, and curators; and legal, contractual, and financial
models for revenue generating and non-revenue generating uses of the biodiversity inventory. An
important benefit from this project would be an increased understanding of the inter-relationships
and inter-linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and the crucial role biodiversity
plays in sustainable development. Expected project benefits of national significance include:
national capacity building; incorporation of biodiversity information in the management of
protected areas; possible additional ecotourism and scientific tourism; and new bioprospecting
opportunities.
Project Risks
38.   Several features of this project carry risks. The project is expected to undertake extensive
collection of specimens, which carries the risk of depleting the resource base through over-
sampling. Project design includes elements to mitigate this rislc. Criteria for the selection of
priority sites and for the cessation of sampling have been developed for the Project.
Conservationists will be involved in the planning workshops for the development of the



11
framework for sampling and sustainable harvesting, and will monitor the protocols and
methodologies that have been established to protect the biological resources. In addition, SINAC
has conservation guidelines which will be followed during project implementation.
39.   As in other knowledge generating projects, this project carries the risk that the knowledge
gained during the project will not be disseminated or utilized on a global basis. To mitigate this
risk, project design includes activities to share knowledge through workshops and multimedia
products, assess demand for biodiversity products and uses, and develop products and services.
40.   This project would result in a 25 percent increase in the amount of resources and activities
INBio would manage annually, carrying the risk that it would overwhelm INBio's absorptive
capacity. Project implementation has been phased, and institutional strengthening has been
frontloaded. INBio's existing accounting and control systems have been evaluated, and have been
found to be adequate to meet the needs of the project.
41.   As in other countries, there are real financial and human resource constraints in the five
Conservation Areas, and if these constraints are not addressed, there is a risk that project
objectives would not be met. The Government is making efforts to overcome these resource
constraints through innovative revenue-generating programs, better targeting of donor resources
(including this GEF-funded project), greater decentralization of managerial authority, and
improved stakeholder involvement.
42.   As is often the case in multi-agency projects, this project carries the risk that coordination
between INBio and SINAC will be inadequate, and project implementation will suffer. To
mitigate this risk, the proposed management system for the project is designed to promote
coordination and accountability. In addition, this project carries the risk of poor donor
coordination. To mitigate this risk, the donors would meet once a year with the project's
Coordinating Committee.
43.   The guidance and assistance of international taxonomists is an essential input into the
design of the framework and the cataloguing of the species. Up to now, taxonomists and their
employing institutions have donated their time on a pro-bono basis, and INBio has prepared
project cost estimates on that basis. However, these taxonomists do not have binding agreements
with INBio. To partially mitigate this risk, taxonomic groups have been chosen for which there is
already strong support from international taxonomists, and a small amount of project funds have
been earmarked for salary support to taxonomists. However, while INBio's assumptions are
considered reasonable based on the commitments made so far by the members of the Taxonomic
Working Groups, any program that depends on voluntary contributions of this sort carries risks
that if these contributions are not forthcoming, the project would suffer.



12
Agreements
44.   Assurances. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that [NBio would:
(a) Maintain a Project Coordinating Unit with an organizational structure, functions, and
staffing satisfactory to the Bank.
(b) Be responsible for any counterpart funding required for the Project, including potential
fees and other expenses to ensure that the Taxonomic Working Groups are formed and
operational in accordance with the Operational Manual and Annual Operating Plans satisfactory
to the Bank.
(c) Carry out a plan satisfactory to the Bank, to: (i) upgrade the equipment, personnel, and
training in connection with the biodiversity information management system; and (ii) provide
adequate processing and storage facilities at INBio and in the Conservation Areas.
(d) Comply with the criteria for the selection of subgroups, priority collection sites,
cessation of collection activities, and avoidance of overharvesting.
(e) Prepare and furnish to the Bank draft and final Annual Progress Reports and Annual
Operating Plans.
45.   Special Conditions of Effectiveness. Special Conditions of Grant effectiveness would be
that:
(a) The Collaboration Agreement between INBio and MINAE shall have been signed.
(b) The Bank shall receive a satisfactory legal opinion related to the validity and
enforceability of the Collaboration Agreement.

COSTA RICA
BIODIVERSITY RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Description
1.    The project is expected to take seven years to implement. The project would have the
following components:
2.    Framework (US$ 0.7 million). This component would finance consultants,
transportation, travel-related expenditures, and materials for: consultations with scientists;
consultations with representatives of different user groups, communities, other stakeholders; and
the work of the Commission on the Use of Indigenous Knowledge and the Sharing of Benefits.
Specifically, this component would finance the following:
(i) Consultations with Scientists: (a) annual workshops starting in the second year of the
project (NORAD is funding the first year of workshops) of each of the four Taxonomic Working
Groups that would develop and update the framework and protocols for collection and
cataloguing activities, and would establish an annual operational plan; (b) an annual workshop
with one representative from each of the Taxonomic Working Groups to discuss issues common
to all the Taxonomic Working Groups; and (c) a workshop in the first year of the project on
information management.
(ii) Consultations with Different User Groups to determine the demand for revenue
generating and non-revenue generating products based on the inventory: (a) annual consultations
at each Conservation Area; and (b) about six expert consultations per year with representatives of
the major current or potential user groups.
(iii) Consultations with Stakeholders: (a) stakeholder analysis carried out by social
scientists in the first two years of the project; (b) consultations with indigenous and non-
indigenous communities to identify their concerns; (c) dissemination of information about the
project in local languages; (d) regular meetings with indigenous leaders and non-governmental
organization representatives starting in the second year of the project (the Government of Canada
is funding these meetings in the first year of the project).
(iv) Commission on the Use of Indizenous Knowledge and the Sharing of Benefits: (a)
formation of the Commission at the mid-point of the project, after the stakeholder analysis and
early consultations have been undertaken; (b) an analysis of international best practice on the use
of indigenous knowledge and sharing of benefits; (c) a consultant to draft a proposal for
consideration by the Commission; (d) meetings of the Commission and its consultant with
stakeholders; and (e) presentation of the final report.
3.    Biodiversity Inventory (US$ 8.0 million). This component would finance the collection
of specimens for priority subgroups of the estimated 144,000 species of Hymenoptera,
Coleoptera, Diptera, and fungi in the five Conservation Areas of Tempisque, Arenal-Tilaran, Osa,



Annex 1
Page 2 of 3
Amistad Pacifico, and Amistad Caribe; cataloguing; and inforirnation management activities. The
two sub-components would be:
(i) Collection Activities. This sub-component would finance: incremental costs of
salaries for new parataxonomists and research coordinators in the three Conservation Areas that
currently don't have research coordinators; equipment; maintenance; supplies; transportation and
training programs for parataxonomists and technicians; and recurrent costs on a declining basis.
Collection would be guided by the framework established through consultations, and would
follow methodologies and protocols prepared by the Taxonornic Working Groups.
Parataxonomists selected from the local communities surrounding each Conservation Area would
undergo an intensive six-month training program, followed up by short-term specialized training
on specific collection methodologies and natural history. Each parataxonomist would be provided
with the field equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to undertake the primary collection and
sorting of the specimens prior to their transfer to INBio. In addition, parataxonomists would have
access to computers within each Conservation Area for use in the sorting of specimens, and for
recording collection and natural history information. The number of parataxonomists funded by
the project would decrease over time, as primary collection activity for these groups decreases.
(ii) Cataloguing Activities. This sub-component would finance: incremental salaries for
technicians and curators; international taxonomic consultants; equipment; training programs;
recurrent costs on a declining basis; and travel and per diem for international and national experts
working in Costa Rica who have volunteered their time. This would enable the processing and
storage of the millions of specimens that the collection activities would generate, the identification
and cataloguing of each specimen, and the recording of relevant data in a computerized
information management system. Technicians would work closely with the parataxonomists to
sort and mount specimens collected in the field. Each mounted specimen or isolate would be bar-
coded, and the relevant collection and natural history information would be entered into a
biodiversity information management system. At INBio, curators would work on identifying the
specimens. International and national taxonomists would assist curators in the classification of
new species. Technicians would join the parataxonomist training programs. Curators would
undergo an intensive three month training program that includes classroom instruction, field work
in Costa Rica, and in-service training outside Costa Rica. Technicians and curators would also
receive short-term in-service training.
4.    Sustainable Uses of Biodiversity (US$ 0.9 million). This component would finance the
development of applications based on the inventory. It is intended to have a demonstration effect
by testing various alternatives to show which are the most feasible for revenue or non-revenue
generating uses. The component is currently designed to finance: (a) consultants, studies, and
seminars, to undertake research on market opportunities, seek out revenue-generating joint
ventures involving the private sector, and develop legal and financial instruments to ensure
equitable sharing of benefits for biodiversity products based on the inventory. Some of the
inventory-based applications include bioprospecting for pharrrLaceutical products, ecotourism,
training and research opportunities, and the preparation of media products; (b) a publications
coordinator, and the equipment and materials necessary to prepare and publish limited quantities
of products such as field guides, scientific guides, brochures, videos, compact discs, web sites,



Annex 1
Page 3 of 3
tourist guide books, calendars, and children's books; (c) equipment and materials for exhibits,
maps and manuals for visitors, and educational signs for trails at the five Conservation Areas and
INBio; (d) studies by graduate students on threatened and endangered species, indicator species,
migration patterns, and monitoring of the impact of collection; and (e) transportation, per diem,
materials, and seminars for Government institutions and non-governmental organizations in Meso-
American on sustainable use and environmental management.
5.    Institutional Strengthening (US$ 1.3 million). This component would finance
incremental costs of additional personnel, equipment, and recurrent costs on a declining basis for
the Project Coordination Unit. INBio has created a Project Coordination Unit for all donor-
funded support related to inventory activities and uses, and will provide administrative, secretarial
and operational support to the Unit. This component would therefore finance a coordinator for
the project, a procurement specialist, two administrative assistants, an accountant, and a
secretary, as well as a project launch workshop and annual audits. Other donors would also
provide financing for staff of the Project Coordination Unit, including a science coordinator.
Given the special handling and storage needs of fungi, this component would finance the
infrastructure, equipment, and maintenance costs of a fungi laboratory at INBio. Other
infrastructure needs are being financed by the Governments of Holland and Canada.

BIODIVERSITY RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Criteria for Selection of Priority Taxa
The following criteria have been used to select a group of four major taxa - Hymenoptera,
Coleoptera, Diptera and fungi - for financing by the GEF-funded project:
*  enthusiastic and committed leadership, and highly trained professionals for each taxa are
available at both the national and international level;
*  the four taxa cover a wide spectrum of species richness, from very species rich (fungi and
Coleoptera) to less diverse groups (Diptera and Hymenoptera);
*  the four taxa represent species and supra-species covering a broad range of niches and
habitats;
*  species within the four taxa cover a representative range of groups that are taxonomically
complex like fungi as well as other less complex groups like Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and
Diptera;
*  a large number of potential applications and potential users exists for each taxa, such as
biodiversity prospecting, biological control, organic degradation, pollination, education, and
tourism;
*  the four taxa represent a range of prior taxonomic knowledge and inventory difficulty;
*  the four taxa are not dependent on prior knowledge of taxonomy and ecology of other taxa
for inventory;
*  all four taxa have manageable infrastructure needs; and
* all four taxa are represented at both national and international levels and will provide
experience relevant to inventory in other countries; additionally many species and species
groups within these taxa have multi-country ranges and some are pan-tropical.

BIODIVERSITY RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Biological Importance Of Proposed Conservation Areas
1.    The five conservation areas proposed - Amistad/Caribe (ACLA-C), Amistad/Pacifico
(ACLA-P), Arenal-Tilaran (ACA), Osa (ACOSA) and Tempisque (ACT) - are among the most
important reservoirs of biological diversity in Costa Rica. Each of the five conservation areas
contains a world-class protected area, e.g., La Amistad International Park (PILA) in ACLA-C and
ACLA-P, Corcovado National Park (PNC) in ACOSA, Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological
Reserve (RBNMV) in ACA and Palo Verde National Park in ACT. Together with the adjoining
Panamanian component, PILA is the largest protected area in southern Mesoamerica. For
administrative purposes the Costa Rican Government divided La Amistad into two conservation
areas based on the Caribbean and Pacific watersheds, ACLA-C and ACLA-P, respectively.
2.    With few notable exceptions (e.g., Monteverde in ACA and Sirena in ACOSA), the five
conservation areas are very poorly known at the species level for the four focal taxonomic groups
(Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and fungi). Nevertheless, bioclimatic heterogeneity,
ecoregional differences and forest ecosystem diversity are crude but legitimate general Surrogates
for estimating biodiversity at the species level. It should be noted that this assessment of
biological importance uses traditional species concepts, hence no attempt is made to assess or
include genetic diversity. Given the representative and extensive coverage of virtually all major
terrestrial ecosystems in the five conservation areas, it is expected that none of the focal
taxonornic groups would be better represented in a different conservation area.
3.    Amistad/Caribe (ACLA-C). Covering nearly all of the Caribbean slopes of Costa Rica's
Talamanca Cordillera, ACLA-C includes the largest wilderness area in Mesoamerica. Not
surprisingly, it is the least known area biologically. Though PILA is the largest and most
important protected part of ACLA-C, the mosaic of one national park, two biological reserves,
two wildlife refuges, three protective zones and major indigenous reserves covers virtually the
entire elevational gradient on the Caribbean slope of the Talamanca Cordillera. Particularly
noteworthy are the high elevation lakes that are biologically unknown, possibly endemic avifauna,
and the proposed corridor connection with the lowland Gandoca-Manzanillo Wildlife Refuge.
The latter is of significance because of the scarcity of protected lower elevation ecosystems in the
PILA complex. All four focal taxonomic groups are expected to have greatest diversity in
ACLA-C.
4.    Amistad/Pacifico (ACLA-P). In contrast to its Caribbean slope homologue, ACLA-P
consists of mid- and high-elevation protected areas, including three national parks, one biological
reserve, two protective zones, one forest reserve and two wetlands. Of greatest biological
importance is the subalpine paramo vegetation on the several Talamancan peaks above -3,300 m.
Chirripo (Costa Rica's highest peak at 3,818 m) is the most extensive and best known paramo.
This shrubby vegetation characteristic of the wetter northern Andes (Ecuador to Venezuela)
reaches its northern latitudinal limit in the high Talamnancas of Costa Rica. Though not as species-



Annex 3
Page 2 of 3
rich as the Andean paramo, the Costa Rican paramo has a high proportion of endemic species.
Also of biological importance are the impressive montane forests dominated by oaks and the
cathedral-like mid-elevation forests on andept soils. The latter is only represented in the Las
Tablas Protection Zone of the Costa Rican PILA complex. The absence of lowland forest
habitats in ACLA-P is expected to result in lower species diversity of the focal taxonomic groups
than in the other four conservation areas. Nevertheless, the mid- to high-elevation oak forests
will no doubt provide acceptable biodiversity levels of the focal groups sufficient to justify ACLA-
P's participation in this project.
5.    Arenal-Tilara.n (ACA). This physiographically-complex conservation area extends from
the Guanacaste Cordillera volcanos (Miravalles, Tenorio and Arenal), through the geologically
older Tilaran Cordillera to the westernmost volcanic massif (F'latanar) of the Central Volcanic
Cordillera. Protected areas include three national parks, one biological reserve, two wildlife
refuges, four protective zones, two forest reserves, two wetlands and significant private reserves
(i.e., the Monteverde complex). The conservation focus is primarily on protecting critical
watersheds and their catchment forests. Though the artificial Lake Arenal has major national
importance for generating hydroelectric power and providing irrigation water to the dry Pacific
lowlands, there are many other hydroelectric projects in progress or planned. Because of the
lengthy dry season in northwest Costa Rica, the mid-elevation catchment forests on these
generally low mountains perform critically important hydrologic functions in intercepting
moisture-laden winds (producing luxuriant cloud forests) and modulating streamflow, particularly
of permanent rivers flowing into the Pacific lowlands. The Monteverde region has long been the
focus of taxonomic and ecological research, hence it is one of the best known biological areas in
Costa Rica. The impressive physiographic complexity in conj-unction with the predominant
tradewinds produces great ecological diversity of habitats over short distances (i.e., tens to
hundreds of meters). As has been reasonably well documented at Monteverde, the ACA has
unusually high biodiversity due to the strong bioclimatic and physiographic gradients. The
absence of lowland forest landscapes in this conservation area may be somewhat limiting for the
focal taxonomic groups; however, the great breadth of the rainfall gradient and ample
heterogeneity of soil types will provide good species diversity for all the focal groups.
6.    Osa (ACOSA). This region is world famous because of the renown Corcovado National
Park (PNC), considered by many to be the gem of the Costa Rican national system of protected
areas. Protected areas include three national parks, one biological reserve, one wildlife refuge,
one forest reserve and two wetlands. ACOSA is ecologically and biologically important because
it contains most of the lowland tropical rain forests that occur on the Pacific side of Mesoamerica.
In addition to having some of the most structurally impressive forests in tropical America, the
ACOSA forests harbor unusually high numbers of endemic species, many with close taxonomic
affinities to the Colombian Choco and even the Amazon Basin. ACOSA biodiversity is further
enhanced by the presence of numerous dry forest elements occupying specialized habitats.
ACOSA forests are the most unique in Costa Rica and Mesoamerica because of classic tropical
rain forest in the Pacific lowlands and the intermixing of Soutlh American and dry Mesoamerican
species. Because of the preponderance of lowland tropical rain forests in this conservation area,
the highest levels of all four focal taxonomic groups should be found here.



Annex 3
Page 3 of 3
7.    Tempisque (ACT!. This extensive conservation area covers the entire Nicoya Peninsula
and much of the Guanacaste lowlands in the Canas-Bagaces region. ACT includes three national
parks, three biological reserves, two absolute natural reserves, eight wildlife refuges, four
protective zones, one forest reserve and four wetlands. Palo Verde National Park and Lomas
Barbudal Biological Reserve are the largest units and the recommended units to include in this
project. These two protected areas occur in the heart of the driest region of Costa Rica, yet Palo
Verde has a large seasonal marsh that is an important Ramsar (internationally recognized)
wetlands refuge for resident and migratory waterfowl. Of particular note are the isolated
limestone hills with abundant rocks and sparse soil that have a surprisingly broad range of
vegetation types due to the scarcity of groundwater in rock outcrops or at the opposite extreme
the year-round presence of water in limestone seeps. The latter supports well-developed
evergreen forest. The threatened lignum vitae tree, Guaiacum sanctum, is locally abundant on the
Palo Verde hills. The highly monsoonal climate may limit fungal diversity; however, the three
focal insect groups are reasonably to very diverse. Bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) are
particularly rich in species, especially in Lomas Barbudal.
8.    In sum, the five proposed conservation areas are excellent areas for inclusion in the
Biodiversity Resources Development Project. Each conservation area has core protected areas
that are of sufficient areal extent to provide habitats for large vertebrates, thus they are fully
functional ecosystems. These five conservation areas have extraordinarily high coverage of Costa
Rican biodiversity and outstanding biological importance for Costa Rica and Mesoamerica, thus
they are the most appropriate suite of conservation areas for project implementation.

Implementation Arrangements
Institutional Background
1.    INBio's Organization. The National Biodiversity Institute (INBio) operates under an
administrative system characterized by decentralized and collaborative decision-making with few
levels of hierarchy. INBio is headed by a Director and Deputy Director reporting to a Board of
Directors. The Directorate consists of groups for Administration, Finance, and General Services
(totaling 26 persons in 1997). Also, an advisory group has been set up for Organizational
Development, and additional advisory groups are planned for Conservation, External Debt
Conversions, and Financial Feasibility in Product Development. The organization is divided into
four units, each with a Coordinator: Biodiversity Inventory; Information Management; Bio-
Prospecting; and Information Dissemination. A Project Coordination Unit (PCU), reporting to
the Director, has been established to coordinate and manage donor-funded activities. INBio
already has, or will have, field offices, staffed mainly by parataxonomists in the Conservation
Areas (CAs), under the daily supervision of the CA's Research Director, with overall work
programs developed by INBio curators and the INBio Parataxonomist Coordinator.
2.    The activities of the four main units are:
(a)   Biodiversity Inventory (77 persons). Responsible for the inventory collection and
cataloguing, collection maintenance and management, and professional training;
(b)   Information Management (12 persons). Responsible for development and
maintenance of the System for Management of Biodiversity Information (BIMS),
the Geographic Information System (GIS), development of multimedia user
applications, maintenance of an Internet node and collection of documents on the
Web, and maintenance of an Intranet for internal communications;
(c)   Bio-Prospecting (29 persons). Responsible for developing collaborative products,
research and development of natural products and biotechnology, exploration of
biodiversity, and a database for bio-prospecting; and
(d)   Information Dissemination (15 persons). Responsible for public relations,
educational extension, workshops for informational exchange internationally,
informational services for users, and relations with other national institutions
involved in biodiversity study and management.
3.    SINAC Organization. The National System of Protected Areas (SINAC) is a
decentralized and participatory institutional management system that unifies the Ministry of
Environment and Energy's (MINAE) competencies regarding forestry, wildlife and protected area



Annex 4
Page 2 of 4
issues, in order to plan and execute processes aimed at the sustainable management of the
country's natural resources. Administratively, SINAC is a system made up of a Directorate and
eleven subsystems called Conservation Areas. SINAC's Directorate consists of about 40 staff,
including a General Director, Director, an Advisory Team and a Technical Unit. The Technical
Unit consists of a professional group whose main responsibilities are to: support the CAs through
implementation of plans and projects; negotiate international treaties and conventions on
biodiversity; obtain financing; and improve the quality of management and information systems.
4.    A Conservation Area is a territorial unit containing different protected areas such as
wildlife refuges, natural reserves, indigenous reserves, national parks, and wetlands. Each CA
carries out an agreed development and management strategy, in which private and Government
sectors participate in the management and conservation of natural resources and, together with
civil society, seek to find sustainable development solutions. Elach CA has a Regional Bureau and
Subregional Offices. The Regional Bureau has strategic decision-making responsibilities, which
are exercised by a Director and a Technical Committee composed of Coordinators for Control,
Promotion, and Protected Wildlands. The Control function relates mainly to enforcement of law
and regulations; Promotion to encouraging management and conservation on privately-owned
lands within CAs, and Protected Wildlands with processes to ensure biodiversity conservation,
including most activities relating to this project. The Technical Committee for each CA operates
as a collegial body in making decisions and defining policies for technical management and
operations, and serves as a channel for consultation and diffusion of information to local society.
The Local Council for each CA is composed of representatives of local communities,
governmental and non-governmental institutions or groups in the region of influence, and is
usually selected by comparable Councils at the level of individual national parks or equivalent
reserve. The Local Council operates under an elected Board of Directors, and advises the
Technical Committee on plans and programs of conservation and development in the CA. A CA's
administration also includes other departments which, depending upon the specific CA, may
include Accounting and Finance, Human and Topographical Resources, and Land Tenancy; and
support sections for Computer Services, a Research Center, and Biological Stations.
Implementation Arrangements
5.    INBio, as recipient of the GEF grant, would have full responsibility for overall
management and supervision of the project, as well as monitoring and evaluation. This
responsibility would be carried out in close collaboration with SINAC regarding activities
executed in the CAs, and with national and international taxonomists and scientists, and public
and private sector entities.
6.    The institutional framework for the Project would be legally defined by a Cooperation
Agreement for Project Execution between INBio and MINAE. The Project would be
implemented within the existing organizational framework of INBio and SINAC, with specified
division of responsibilities between them and assignment of management authority over specific
project components to existing subunits. Overall coordinationi would be performed by the PCU
within TNBio.



Annex 4
Page 3 of 4
7.    INBio will provide administrative, secretarial, and operational support to the Unit. This
project would finance a project coordinator, an administrator, and a procurement specialist, two
administrative assistants, an accountant, a secretary, along with three Research Coordinators for
the CAs now lacking this position. Other donors would finance additional staff for the PCU,
including a science coordinator.
8.    INBio Responsibilities. INBio's direct responsibilities under the Project would include:
* Establishing and maintaining the PCU;
* Designing, executing, evaluating, and reporting on the project's programs and plans, subject to
approval by the Bank;
* Implementing the project through the divisions and the PCU according to the agreements
reached with the Bank;
* Participating in the Coordinating Committee and the high-level committee;
* Providing infrastructure, and designing logistical and administrative services and technical
aspects (accommodations, laboratories, meeting rooms, meals, transportation, methodologies,
and work agendas, among others) for project activities based at lNBio;
* Participating in the design and responsible for the approval of new infrastructure within its
facilities, consistent with INBio's global development strategy, its supporting legal framework,
and environmental considerations;
*  Managing personnel assigned to the project located at INBio;
* Ensuring that work done at INBio or work that is part of INBio's program conforms to the
objectives of the project and the overall development strategy of INBio as an institution;
* Organizing, publishing, and distributing information and results generated by the project
according to the characteristics and needs of its users; and
X Developing permanent biodiversity monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.
9.    PCU Responsibilities. The direct responsibilities of the PCU under the Project would
include:
* Coordinating donor-funded projects to ensure that there is no overlap between them;
* Coordinating with the SINAC and CAs on a daily basis to ensure the smooth operation of
project activities;
* Maintaining separate project accounts, and retaining strict financial controls over the project;
* Administering project funds based on guidelines established by the Bank, including, among
others: procurement, reporting, and auditing; and
* Providing regular reports on project activities and responding to requests for information by
the Bank.
10.   SINAC Responsibilities. SINAC's responsibilities under the project would include:
E Participating in the Coordinating Committee;



Annex 4
Page 4 of 4
* Approving all plans and proposals for activities to be undertaken in the CAs, such as
recommendations submitted by the Taxonomic Working Groups on sample sites and
collection methodologies for field work for groups defined in the project;
* Supervising, monitoring, and evaluating the activities carried out in each CA;
* Within each CA region, assuring the participation of and adequate linkages with the local
communities in the design and execution of project activities; and
*  Organizing, publishing, and distributing information and results generated by the project to the
users within the region of the concerned CAs.
11.   Conservation Area Responsibilities. The direct responsibilities of the Conservation
Areas would include:
*  Managing project personnel located mainly in the CAs, such as parataxonomists;
* Providing the infrastructure and planning project logistical services (accommodations,
laboratories, meeting rooms, food and transportation, among others) for the development of
workshops, training and inventory activities within participating CAs;
* Administering assets and services assigned by the project for the activities programmed within
the CAs, and reporting to the Project Coordinating Unit following procedures established for
the project;
* Commenting to SINAC on all plans and proposals for activities to be undertaken in the CA;
* Implementing project activities in the CA;
*  Advocating and ensuring the participation of local comrmunities in the design and execution of
the project; and
* Disseminating information about the project in the CAs.
12.   Policy and Decision-Making. At the highest level, policy making authority would reside
with the Director of INBio, and the Minister of MIvNAE who oversees the SINAC. At a decision-
making level, coordination will be achieved by an INBio-MINAE Coordinating Committee. The
Coordinating Committee would include the following members: Director of the SINAC, the
Project Coordinator, the Directors of each involved CA, the Coordinator of the National
Biodiversity Inventory at INBio, and the INBio Coordinator for INBio-SINAC Relations. This
Committee would build on experience from previous joint programs and would provide the
institutional memory for project implementation. It would have responsibility for planning joint
activities between INBio and SINAC, coordinating and monitoring the project, approving
methodologies and protocols for collection, and incorporating project generated information into
the plans and programs of the CAs and INBio. This body would meet quarterly.
13.   A Donor's Committee would be formed that would meet annually with the Coordinating
Committee to evaluate use of financial resources provided to the inventory, coordinate assistance,
and evaluate progress of the various donor-funded projects. Currently, the GEF, the Dutch, and
NORAD are members of the Donor's Committee, but the expectation is that if other donors were
to provide funding for inventory activities, they would also join.

COSTA RICA
BIODIVERSITY RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Consultation Process
Preparation
1.    The Biodiversity Resources Development Project was prepared through a stakeholder
consultation and participation process with representatives of the National Biodiversity Institute
(Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad, INBio), the Ministry of Environment and Energy (Ministerio
de Ambiente y Energia, MINAE), the National System of Conservation Areas (Sistema Nacional
de Areas de Conservaci6n, SINAC), the Conservation Areas, local communities, international
experts in taxonomy and biodiversity, and potential clients and users of the inventory supported
by GEF Project Development Facility (PDF) Grant and the Norwegian Agency for International
Development (NORAD).
2.    Scientific Consultations. NORAD funded six scientific and technical workshops on
different taxonomic groups, including Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and fungi. These workshops
supported the organization of Taxonomic Working Groups and the definition of protocols and
methodologies for inventory activities, and were attended by INBio staff, and international and
national taxonomists. In January of 1998, NORAD will finance a workshop with national and
international experts on the systematization and management of biodiversity and the definition of
the general framework for the inventory oriented to respond to market demand.
3.    Social Consultations. Four social workshops funded by NORAD were held with potential
clients and users in the sectors of education, agriculture, ecotourism, and bioprospecting to start
the dialogue on possible opportunities within each sector for the application and sustainable use of
biodiversity. In January and February 1998, PDF funds will support five workshops in the
Conservation Areas with civil society organizations and a national workshop with experts in order
to identify the demand for biodiversity. Through these workshops, a group of potential demands
for biodiversity will be developed to be considered in the process of planning inventory activities.
4.    Stakeholder Consultations. The PDF financed a process of consultation with communities
living near the Guanacaste Conservation Area (which is no longer in the project). This process
included two consultations in surrounding communities in December 1995 and workshops in four
communities near Guanacaste in the fall of 1996. The objective of these consultations was to
provide information about the new project and explore mechanisms for information sharing and
communication with the local communities. The reports from these consultations indicate that the
communities surrounding Conservation Areas are likely to be interested in participating in the
activities of the Conservation Area, in particular with respect to employment as park guards or
parataxonomists. The Tempisque Conservation Area has also worked with surrounding
communities on issues of community organization and financing mechanisms for conservation and
forestry.



Annex 5
Page 2 of 3
5.    With the assistance of funding from the Government. of Canada, and using its own
resources, INBio has started to work with some of the indigenous communities that live close to
the Conservation Areas, and has had meetings with non-governmental organizations representing
these communities. In addition, the Conservation Areas have also undertaken important outreach
programs with the surrounding indigenous communities, notably at the Amistad Caribe
Conservation Area. This prelimninary work as demonstrated that there is potential for the
indigenous communities to benefit from the biodiversity inventory work being undertaken in this
project, including: the domestication of species; collection of species based on indigenous
knowledge; employment as ecological guides, park guards, or parataxonomists; and conservation
and biological education.
Implementation
6.    The consultation and participation process initiated during the project preparation period
will continue during implementation with support from the Grovernment of Canada and NORAD
in 1998, and from this project. This project will finance the continuation of participatory planning
workshops with local, national and international contributors, clients, and users of the inventory
to guide and adjust the process. Participation would be also ensured through the Local Councils
at each Conservation Area and through INBio's Assembly which both have community
representation.
7.    Scientific Consultations. In the first semester of 1998, NORAD will support scientific
workshops for the Taxonomic Working Groups for the four t.axonomic groups in this project to
develop detailed protocols and methodologies for the biodiversity inventory in the five
Conservation Areas oriented to demand. In the second semester of 1998, NORAD will support a
workshop with Meso-American taxonomists for the developnnent of mechanisms to share the
experience with taxonomists of the region.
8.    Financing for these workshops will be provided by this project, which will finance annual
workshops starting in 1999 for each of the four Taxonomic Working Groups that would develop
and update the framework and protocols for collection and cataloguing activities, and would
establish an annual operational plan. Starting in the first year, the project will also finance an
annual workshop with one representative from each of the Taxonomic Working Groups to discuss
issues common to all the Taxonomic Working Groups; and a workshop in 1998 on information
management.
9.    Social Consultations. The GEF-funded Project will continue the work started by NORAD
and the PDF, and will support consultations with different user groups to determine the demand
for revenue- and non-revenue generating products based on the inventory. Annual consultations
will be held in each Conservation Area and there will be approximately six expert consultations
each year with representatives of the major current or potential user groups.
10.   Stakeholder Consultations and Indigenous Peoples. The indigenous population of Costa
Rica is estimated to be approximately 30,000 and most live on Indigenous Reserves (see IBRD
Map 29254). Although the Project will not undertake collection in Indigenous Reserves, an



Annex 5
Page 3 of 3
important potential benefit to the Indigenous Reserves could be the collection of useful species
based on indigenous knowledge.
I1.   In 1998, the Government of Canada will support two meetings with indigenous
communities living in the areas surrounding the Amistad-Caribe Conservation Area in order to
analyze themes of common interest related to sustainable use of biodiversity and to identify
opportunities for working together. The project will continue to support consultations with
indigenous communities and additional stakeholder consultation activities as follows: (a) regular
meetings with indigenous leaders and non-governmental organization representatives starting in
the second year of the project; (b) stakeholder analyses carried out by social scientists in the first
two years of the project; (c) consultations with indigenous and non-indigenous communities to
identify their concerns and interest in project-related activities; and (d) dissemination of
informnation about the project in local languages.
12.   INBio will take the lead in putting together a commission to analyze the issue of
indigenous knowledge, and will present their findings to the Government and society. The project
will support stakeholder consultations and the organization of a Commission on the Use of
Indigenous Knowledge and the Sharing of Benefits. The Project would finance: (a) formation of
the Commission at the midpoint of the project, after the stakeholder analysis and early
consultations have been completed; (b) an analysis of international best practice on the use of
indigenous knowledge and sharing of benefits; (c) a consultant to draft a proposal for
consideration by the Commission; (d) meetings of the Comrnission and their consultations with
stakeholders; and (e) presentation of the final report.

COSTA RICA
BIODIVERSITY RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Incremental Costs and Global Environmental Benefits
Context and Broad Development Goals
1.    For centuries, biodiversity has provided fuels, medicines, materials for shelter, food and
energy for human beings. Examples of biodiversity uses are varied and the benefits derived are
interconnected. And yet, biodiversity is threatened in many countries. The protection it receives
at the national level is often much less than what would be justified by international or global
interests. Costa Rica is somewhat of an exception to this trend: there is a high level of interest in
Costa Rica's biodiversity at both the national and international levels.
2.    New research is finding that the biological richness of Costa Rica is greater than initially
thought, and, as other neighboring countries lose increasing amounts of their biodiversity, the
importance of the Costa Rican "stock" of biodiversity grows. This has resulted in increasing
interest in cataloguing the biological riches in Costa Rica, and finding new uses for the diversity
so discovered.
3.    However, it is essential to keep in mind that years of research efforts for biodiversity
development may fail if the initial collection and documentation of biological material is not done
properly. Problems may very well arise if material from the same species or subspecies, from the
same environment or even from the same location, are not available for further investigation.
Correct identification of species, and understanding of their natural history, is the starting point
for this research. Accurate scientific documentation of the collection of specimens is necessary in
order to return to the original source of promising material. The proposed GEF project is
designed, along with other sources of funds including those from the Government of Costa Rica,
to meet this need.
Identifying the Baseline Scenario
4.    The proposed "Biodiversity Resources Development Project" is designed to implement
intensive collection activities for four important taxa in five different Conservation Areas. The
reasons for the selection of these taxa and the chosen sites are given elsewhere in this submnission.
Our task here is to assess the benefits and costs of the proposed project and the incremental costs
that justify GEF involvement. Simply stated, the GEF funds incremental project costs that are not
offset by incremental national benefits -- that is, the GEF can only fund those costs that produce
global benefits beyond the borders of Costa Rica. To deterrnine the incremental costs of the
activity, one must examine the benefits and costs of the baseline scenario, and compare these to
the "with-project" scenario, identif;y the additional costs of the project and deduct any additional
national benefits.



Annex 6
Page 2 of 7
5.    National Costs: The baseline scenario comprises presently on-going conservation-related
activities in the five selected Conservation Areas and inventory-related efforts managed by INBio
at 25 to 30 individual sites located within protected areas in the five selected Conservation Areas.
For the baseline scenario, total costs associated with the conservation, park maintenance, and
special programs (for example, biology education for children, research, or fire control) for the
five Conservation Areas were approximately US$ 3.00 million in 1996. Income from the same
protected areas for that period was about US$ 500,000, largely from user fees from visitors
(about US$ 355,000), and some limited support from park endowment funds that exist for three
of the five Conservation Areas (a total of roughly another US$ 150,000 per year). In 1996,
INBio's budget was about US$ 3.4 million and approximately 10 percent of this was due to
activities directly related to inventorying activities in the five selected Conservation Areas, or a
total of about US$ 350,000. (The 10 percent was determined by examining various line items in
INBio's budget and deciding the share attributable to activities in the selected sites.) Total annual
costs associated with the five sites in the mid-1990s were thus about US$ 3.35 million (US$ 3.0
million for conservation purposes for the five Conservation Areas; US$ 0.35 million from INBio
for inventory-related work).
6.    National Benefits. The directly measured national benefits under the baseline scenario are
estimated to total about US$ 1.1 million per year. Although it is difficult to estimate these
benefits precisely, the US$ 1.1 million figure is composed of three components: First, a rough
'guesstimate' of park entry fees and net economic rents from tourist revenue, totals some US$ 0.7
million, including benefits from both national visitors (US$ 0.3 million) and foreign visitors (US$
0.4 million). Second, commercial agreements between INBio and chemical and pharmaceutical
companies such as Merck Co., yielded US$ 0.4 million due to activities associated with
biodiversity collection in four of the selected Conservation Areas. Finally, income derived from
training workshops given by INBio represented approximately US$ 0.02 million. Of these
benefits one could argue that the admission fees should not be included since they are largely
independent of any INBio activities ("scientific tourism" is a very small share of the total). This
would further reduce the estimate of national benefits from the proposed project but then one
would also have to remove those park management costs thalt were not directly linked to
biodiversity prospecting. Since this is difficult to do, we leave the numbers as presented.
7.    Note that these estimates are annual gross benefits at the national level and that these
estimates do not include any estimate of ecosystem benefits -- e.g. watershed protection, flood
control, potable water supply or others -- provided by the existence of protected areas. Although
potentially important, Costa Rica has already made the decision to protect theses areas. Also, the
GEF project is about biodiversity resource development, not iwhether or not these conservation
areas should be protected in the first place. The working assumption is that the direct (largely
tourism) and indirect (largely ecosystem services) benefits of the protected areas exceed the costs
of protection and hence continued protection of conservation areas is justified.
8.    If one considers the biodiversity resource development component separately, the
estimates of benefits (largely from bioprospecting agreements'l are about equal to INBio's current
expenditures in those areas. Thus the present levels of activities, both of biodiversity resource



Annex 6
Page 3 of 7
development and for protection of conservation areas, are at a level where costs are roughly
balanced by expected benefits.
9.    Baseline Scenario. The Baseline Scenario consists of maintaining conservation programs,
inventory activities, and sustainable use applications at the levels described in the historical
baseline over the seven-year project period. The full Baseline Scenario, therefore, includes more
than just expenses directly linked to collection activities in the five Conservation Areas. Since
INBio is the implementing agency, a number of institutional investments (e.g. framework
development, sustainable uses development, institutional strengthening) are also included in the
baseline since they form the structure upon which the GEF alternative is based.
10.   The full cost of implementing the Baseline Scenario over seven years is estimated as US$
32.9 million and consists of the following components: (a) biodiversity conservation at the five
Conservation Areas: US$ 21.0 million; (b) framework development: US$ 0.5 million; (c)
biodiversity inventory activities: US$ 5.5 million; (d) sustainable use applications: US$ 3.1
million; and (e) INBio institutional strengthening: US$ 2.8 million. (Note that these figures are
for the entire seven year period of the project and are not discounted. Although a more formal
economic analysis would enter each expense in the year that it occurred and discount the yearly
expenditures to arrive at the present value of expenditures over the seven year period, we have
not done that here and use the simpler undiscounted approach for both the baseline and the GEF
alternative.)
11.   Implementation of the Baseline Scenario would result in the continued level of collection
and inventorying activities at selected sites. It is unlikely that the INBio teams would be able to
complete the expected expanded inventories of many taxonomic groups nor develop "fast-track"
methodologies for broader application. Testing these methodologies on an appropriate scale
(several taxa simultaneously) would not be possible without a substantial input of additional
financial and human resources.
Global Environmental Objectives and the GEF Alternative
12.   The global environment objective of the project is to demonstrate the benefits of
concentrated collection of biological material in a small number of sites and to develop a cost-
effective methodology to do this. The proposed project, which is limited in scope to an inventory
of four major taxonomic groups at various sites within the five Conservation Areas, would
contribute to the development of the inventory by establishing the framework for such inventories,
increasing human capacity, and developing applications which illustrate the benefits to be derived
from the enhanced knowledge base provided through biodiversity inventories. An added and very
important dimension of the proposed project is the direct linking of collection activities to
observed demand for educational, conservation, or commercial purposes.
13.   Costs of the GEFAlternative: The GEF Alternative would permit SINAC and INBio to
undertake a more ambitious program on an accelerated timetable that would address the global
biodiversity objectives outlined above.



Annex 6
Page 4 of 7
14.   The scope and costs of implementing the GEF Alternative over the seven year period are
as follows: (a) park management costs for protection and biodiversity conservation in the five
conservation areas: US$ 21.0 million (same as in Baseline); (b) framework development: establish
and monitor a framework for collection and cataloguing of species (US$ 1.3 million); (c)
biodiversity inventory activities: undertake inventories of 4 taxonomic groups (US$ 12.5 million);
(d) sustainable use applications: test potential revenue and non-revenue generating applications of
the emerging biodiversity knowledge (US$ 4.0 million); ancl (e) INBio institutional strengthening:
increase institutional capacity to manage the scaling up of biodiversity development (US$ 4.1
million). Projected over the seven-year life of the project, this totals US$ 42.9 million.
15.   Additional National Benefits. GEF support would make possible a level of activity that
would not be possible under either the Baseline Scenario or the Extended Baseline Scenario,
thereby helping to provide an essential body of knowledge fbr conservation and sustainable use of
tropical biodiversity. The expected additional benefits to Costa Rica accruing from
implementation of the GEF Alternative are modest. Additional tourism will be limited and is
estimated to yield yearly benefits of US$ 0.07 million. In addition, new contracts from drug firms
to support bioprospecting could yield between US$ 0.06 million and US$ 0.4 million, depending
on how many new contracts are obtained each year. Using the conservative estimate of one new
bioprospecting contract over the project period, the additional benefit to Costa Rica would be
about US$ 0.06 million per year. In sum, the expected incremental national level benefits are
approximately US$ 0.13 million per year, or about US$ 0.9 million over the seven year life of the
project. These national benefits are far short of the additional costs and less even than the Costa
Rican contribution to the GEF project.
16.   Incremental Costs: The total cost of the Baseline Scenario for the selected sites and taxa
over the seven years of the project is estimated at US$ 32.90 million, and the total cost of the
GEF Alternative is estimated at US$ 42.90 million. Note that conservation management costs are
the same under both scenarios (as are the implicit, but unspecified, value of ecosystem services).
The details of the Baseline and the GEF Alternative are presented in the attached Incremental
Cost Matrix.
17.   The incremental cost of the GEF Alternative is estimated at US$ 10.00 million, of which
international taxonomists would contribute US$ 3.0 million (for in-kind services) and GEF would
provide funding of US$ 7.0 million. The analysis of costs and benefits demonstrates that the
request for US$ 7.00 million of incremental costs to be provided by GEF funding are justified
since the modest additional national benefits identified (estimated at US$ 0.9 million) are more
than offset by the contribution from INBio and SINAC of US$ 1.0 million.
Complementary Financing
18.   As mentioned in the project document, other donors are actively involved in providing
additional resources to support biodiversity resource develop:ment in Costa Rica. In particular,
the governments of Canada, Norway and the Netherlands are all assisting INBio to support a
broad range of biodiversity collection-related activities, inclucling detailed collection at the same
conservation areas for an expanded number of taxa. Associated investments in buildings, training,



Annex 6
Page 5 of 7
and consultation are also being supported. Canadian assistance is being used to develop
bioprospecting laboratory facilities at INBio and for consultation and work with indigenous
peoples. The total of these other sources of support is some $13.2 million over a period of two to
five years. Of this amount about $4.7 million are directly linked to the collecting and cataloguing
activities related to the four taxa included in the GEF project. The Dutch resources are also
supporting collection and processing of materials for five other taxa in the same areas.

Appendix 1
Preliminary Estimates of Global Benefits
1.    Although not required to secure GEF support, a preliminary effort has been made to
estimate some of the potential global benefits from the GEF-supported initiative. Although these
are very much "back of the envelope" type estimates, it is useful and important to determine that
there is some potential global benefit that justifies commitment of GEF resources. Since the GEF
project is largely about develop of methodologies and techniques for in-depth inventorying of
biological resources, and since the dissemination of this learning is an important component of the
project's outputs, the potential benefits of this learning to other countries is substantial. Among a
number of these potential global benefits the following three items have been identified: .
(a) Avoided costs of developing bioinventory methodologies. By pioneering the development of
bioinventory methodologies that use locally trained parataxonomists along with skilled
professionals, and that better reflect demand by potential users, other countries can benefit from
Costa Rica s experience. If 15 tropical countries can adapt the Costa Rican methodologies, and
avoid one-half of the development costs, this represents a savings of US$ 8.6 million over the life
of the project (US$ 1.15 x 0.5 x 15), equivalent to US$ 1.2 million on an annual basis.
(b) Avoided costs of developing an information system. Using a similar approach, the estimate of
savings to other countries from adapting the systems developed in Costa Rica amounts to US$
8.3 million over the life of the project (US$ 1.2 million on an annual basis). This is based on 15
countries enjoying a 70 percent savings in putting in place an information system that cost Costa
Rica US$ 1.84 million to develop (US$ 1.84 x 0.3 x 15).
(c) Additional bioprospecting contracts. If each of these 15 countries also realizes on additional
bioprospecting contract worth US$ 0.5 million (a modest sum), this will produce a value of US$
7.5 million, equivalent to almost US$ 1.1 million on an annual basis.
2.    Any of these three global benefits is sufficient by itself to justify the GEF component (that
is, each is over US$ 1.0 million per year against average GEF costs of US$ 1.0 million per year).
Hence, since the Costa Rican contribution to the GEF activity (both additional moneys and the
present subsidy for protected area conservation) clearly exceeds any estimate of additional
national benefits from the new activity, the entire amount of the proposed GEF component is
suitable for GEF funding. This analysis of global benefits does not take into account many other
potential benefits from discoveries that result, or willingness-to-pay to conserve Costa Rica's rich
biological resources; these would only increase the level of global benefits.

BIODIVERSITY RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting
1.    The establishment of accurate monitoring and evaluation to track project performance and
make adjustments is essential to effective project implementation. As indicated in the attached
table, twelve indicators have been selected against which successful implementation would be
measured: (a) demand-driven methodologies and protocols developed, tested, improved, and
widely applied for Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and fungi based on criteria for selection of
priority taxonomic subgroups, criteria for selection of inventory sites, decisions on changes of
protocol and cessation of sampling, and avoidance of overharvesting; (b) number of international
scientists familiar with these methodologies and protocols and able to adopt or apply them to
other national inventoiies through workshops, taxonomic working groups, visits to INBio,
requests for inventory information; (c) recommendations developed and disseminated on the use
of indigenous knowledge and the sharing of benefits; (d) number of communities or organizations
located in the areas near the collection sites in the Conservation Areas that have developed
mechanisms for participation or consultation in the project; (e) number of specimens of
Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and fungi identified at species level; (f) number of new species
described for science; (g) incorporation of biodiversity information generated by the project into
conservation management plans and programs of the protected areas in the Conservation Areas;
(h) number of conservation professionals and decision makers familiar with the biodiversity
information generated by the project and able to influence conservation management in their own
countries; (i) development and implementation of pilot agreements with companies
(pharmaceutical, ecotourism, agriculture), NGOs, community-based organizations, and
universities incorporating the information generated by the project; (j) development of syllabi for
training parataxonomists, technicians, and curators; (k) number of parataxonomists, technicians,
and curators trained; and (1) number of voluntary taxonomic days provided by international
taxonomists.
2.    The Project Coordination Unit in INBio would have primary responsibility for project
supervision, monitoring, and evaluation. It would be responsible for guiding project
implementation through annual planning, budgeting, and reporting. In January of each year, the
Project Coordination Unit would provide to the Bank an Annual Project Implementation Report,
an Annual Operating Plan, Implementation Schedule, technical reports, financial reports, and
procurement plans. The Project Coordination Unit would also prepare monthly accounting
reports, and submit annual external audit reports. A project launch workshop would be held
following effectiveness.
3.    The Annual Project Implementation Report, Annual Operating Plan, and Implementation
Schedule, all subject to approval by the Bank, would be prepared according to the following
outline:

Procurement
Procurement of works and goods financed by the Bank under the project would be
carried out in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credit (January 1995, revised August 1996, and September 1997). Consultant
services to provide technical assistance and training to the project would be procured in
accordance with Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrawers and the
World Bank as Executing Agency (January 1997, revised September 1997).
The GEF Grant would finance civil works, goods (including vehicles), technical
assistance, consultants and studies, training, and incremental recurrent costs. INBio has
managed numerous donor projects, and its Project Implementation Unit would be responsible
for procurement arrangements.
Goods to be procured under the project consist of vehicles, computers, field
equipment, publications, office equipment, and furniture. Procurement arrangements are
shown in table A. Vehicles would be procured through Limited International Bidding among
suppliers with established maintenance and service records in Costa Rica. Standard bidding
documents issued satisfactory to the Bank would be used for all National Competitive
Bidding.
Civil works consist of the construction of a laboratory for fungi and the remodeling of
offices in INBio which would be procured under lump-sum fixed price contracts on the basis
of quotations from at least three qualified domestic contractors.
Consultant Services are expected to cost approximately US$4.3 million and would
be procured in accordance with the Bank's procedures for hiring of consultants (see Table A).
Monitoring of procurement practices would be carried out to ensure consistency
with Bank guidelines, the operational manual and MIS. Bank prior review thresholds are
shown in table B. All International Competitive Bidding and Limited International Bidding
packages would require prior review, as well as consultant contracts with individuals
estimated to cost above US$10,000 and with firms above US$100,000.

Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds: Disbursements would be made against the categories of
expenditures indicated in Table C. The proceeds of the Loan are expected to be disbursed
over a period of seven years. The project is expected to be completed by December 2004 and
the Loan Closing Date would be June 2005.
Use of Statements of Expenditures: Disbursements would be based on Statements
of Expenditures (SOEs) for: (a) goods estimated to cost less than US$150,000; (b) works; (c)
service contracts for consultancies valued below US$100,000 for firms and US$10,000 for
individual consultants; (d) training expenditures; and (e) incremental recurrent costs.
Documentation supporting SOEs would be retained by INBIO, and made available for
examination by Bank staff as requested. All other disbursement requests would be
accompanied by full documentation.
Special Account: The Special Account would be maintained in US dollars in a
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. The authorized allocation, sufficient for financing
four months of eligible expenditures, would be US$350,000.
