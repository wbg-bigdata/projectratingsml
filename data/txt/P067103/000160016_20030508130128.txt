Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
households 
and 
groups 
in 
about 840 
villages 
in 
a 
sustainable 
manner 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
small 
agricultural 
development 
subprojects 
planned and 
managed 
by 
community 
members 
and 
farmers' 
groups. 
This 
objective 
will 
be 
achieved 
by: 
(i) 
empowering 
self-selected 
rural 
communities 
and farmers' groups 
to 
make decisions 
regarding 
choice 
of 
sustainable 
and remunerative 
productive 
technology; 
(ii) 
sharing 
of 
costs 
by 
the 
public 
sector 
and 
participants, 
and 
hence 
sharing 
the 
risk 
of 
adoption 
of 
improved 
technologies, 
again 
for 
self-selected participants; 
(iii) 
enhancing 
demand 
for 
products 
and 
services 
provided 
by 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
rural 
areas 
by 
increasing 
the 
purchasing 
power 
of 
participating 
groups 
and 
encouraging 
the 
growth 
of 
savings; 
(iv) promoting 
improved land 
and 
crop 
husbandry practices 
by 
participants; 
(v) 
supporting 
the 
ongoing decentralization 
process 
at 
the 
district 
level; 
and 
(vi) 
partially 
financing 
maintenance 
and/or 
construction 
of 
roads, 
bridges, 
and 
other 
small 
subprojects 
to improve 
access 
to 
markets. 
The 
project 
seeks 
to 
raise 
the 
production 
of 
food, 
incomes, 
and 
assets 
of 
participating 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex

B. 
Strategic Context 
1. 
Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
goal supported 
by 
the project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
20426 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
06/15/00 
Tanzania 
has 
undertaken ambitious 
reforms 
and 
the 
economy 
is 
growing 
and 
responding 
positively. 
Smallholders 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector, 
however, have 
not 
been 
able 
to 
benefit 
appreciably 
from 
the 
improved 
economic environment. 
The 
smallholder 
agricultural 
sector 
is 
a 
large 
share 
of 
the 
overall 
economy, 
and 
poor 
performance constrains 
aggregate 
growth 
and 
impedes 
reduction 
of 
poverty. 
The poor 
performance, 
in 
turn, 
derives 
in 
large 
part 
from 
inability 
of 
smallholders 
to 
adopt technologies 
that 
are 
available, 
known 
to 
the scientific community, and 
are 
sound 
from both 
economic and 
environmental 
perspectives. 
Adoption 
of 
technology 
is 
constrained 
by 
several factors. 
Many 
smallholders 
are 
not 
fully 
aware 
of 
the 
options 
available 
to 
them. 
When 
aware, 
they 
may 
be 
unable 
to 
purchase 
even 
the 
modest array 
of 
inputs 
required 
to 
adopt 
the 
technologies. 
When 
neither 
cash 
nor 
knowledge 
constrains choice, 
some 
producers 
are 
unwilling 
to 
assume 
the 
full 
risk 
of 
adopting 
new 
approaches. 
This 
project 
seeks 
to provide improved 
opportunities 
to 
smallholders 
to 
make better 
use 
of 
existing 
technologies 
and 
to 
adopt 
improved 
ones. 
The 
project 
is 
fully 
consistent 
with 
the strategy 
outlined 
in 
the 
CAS 
and 
PRSP progress 
report 
discussed 
at 
the 
Board 
November 
27,2001 (IDA/SecM2001-0643), 
which 
recognizes that 
poverty 
in 
Tanzania 
is 
largely 
rural, and 
that 
lack 
of 
opportunities 
for 
poor 
people 
to improve 
their 
incomes 
is 
at 
the 
root 
of 
problem. 
The 
rural 
poor 
earn 
their 
livelihoods 
primarily from 
agriculture. 
The 
CAS 
also 
recognizes 
protection 
of 
biodiversity 
and forests 
as 
important 
objectives, 
and 
these 
can 
be 
addressed 
by 
enhancing 
the 
ability 
of 
smallholders 
to 
make 
more 
sustainable 
use 
of 
the 
land 
presently 
under 
cultivation 
and 
to 
minimize 
risks 
of 
crop failure, 
thereby 
reducing 
expansion 
of 
production 
onto 
more 
-2-

fragile 
lands 
or 
inappropriate 
exploitation 
of 
forests 
to 
generate 
income. 
The 
CAS 
specifically 
recommends an 
IDA-supported 
operation 
to improve agricultural 
productivity for 
smallholders. 
This 
project 
is 
prepared 
to 
respond 
to 
that 
mandate. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
approximately 
80% 
of 
the 
country’s labor 
force. 
Approximately 
3.5 
million 
farm 
families cultivate 
about 
4.5 
million 
hectares 
of 
land. 
Most 
of 
these 
people 
are 
extremely 
poor 
and 
use 
low 
inputllow 
output 
agricultural 
systems 
that 
lead 
over 
time to 
depletion 
of 
soil 
nutrients. 
Yields 
of 
the 
country’s 
principal 
food 
crops 
are 
only 
20% 
to 
40% 
of 
the 
potential, 
and 
are 
currently 
stagnant 
or 
declining. 
Low 
productivity 
leads 
to 
a 
vicious circle 
of 
poverty, 
resource degradation, 
and 
food 
insecurity. 
Agriculture 
contributes 
about 50% 
of 
Tanzania’s 
GDP, 
75% 
of 
export 
earnings, 
and 
employs 
Five 
key 
issues 
are 
relevant 
to 
the 
project’s objectives 
and 
design: 
(i) 
Reforms 
over 
the 
last 
decade 
have created 
a 
good 
foundation 
for 
agricultural 
growth, 
but 
several 
factors 
have 
delayed a 
significant 
positive 
supply 
response 
and 
have 
increased 
risks. 
Removal 
of 
subsidies 
for 
agricultural 
inputs 
increased 
the 
costs 
and 
risks 
of 
higher 
yielding 
technologies 
in 
many 
parts 
of 
the 
country. 
As 
demand 
for 
inputs 
fell, 
retailers and 
traders 
exited 
from 
local 
input 
markets and 
competition 
declined. 
Low 
volumes 
of 
trade 
and 
limited 
competition 
raised 
trading 
margins 
and 
reduced 
the 
profitability 
of 
purchased 
inputs 
to 
smallholder 
producers. 
The 
recent 
real 
appreciation 
of 
the 
Tanzanian 
Shilling 
has 
made 
export 
crops 
less 
competitive, 
and 
has 
highlighted 
the 
need 
to 
increase 
productivity. 
In 
order 
to avoid 
deepening 
poverty, smallholder 
farmers 
must 
adopt 
improved 
technologies that 
yield 
higher 
returns 
to 
all 
factors 
of 
production 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
preserving 
the 
quality 
of 
their 
main 
non-labor 
asset, 
land. 
The 
volume 
of 
activity 
and performance 
of 
rural 
markets 
must 
also 
improve, 
so 
that 
incremental output 
can 
be 
placed 
at 
profitable 
margins, 
and 
inputs 
purchased 
at 
competitive 
prices. 
(ii) 
Governmental 
officials 
are 
increasingly 
aware 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
farmers‘ 
participation 
in 
decisions 
regarding allocations 
of 
scarce 
funds 
for 
public 
investments. 
The 
growing 
number 
of 
successful experiences 
in 
Participatory 
approaches 
in 
Tanzania complement 
to 
the 
ongoing 
process 
of 
decentralization 
to 
the 
District 
level. 
Agricultural 
Sector 
Development Program 
(ASDP) 
aims 
at 
channelling approximately 
75% 
of 
all 
public 
investments 
in 
agriculture 
through 
district 
councils. 
This 
would 
facilitate 
the 
work 
of 
district 
extension 
staff 
and 
the 
delivery 
of 
other 
support services 
to 
develop small, 
medium 
and 
large 
scale 
production 
and 
related 
enterprises. 
(iii) 
Degradation 
of 
natural 
resources, 
particularly 
land, 
is 
increasing 
in 
most 
regions 
of 
the 
country. 
Continuous cropping, 
non-replenishment 
of 
nutrients 
extracted 
from 
the soil, 
erosion 
by 
wind 
and 
water, 
and 
poor land 
husbandry practices 
contribute 
to 
depletion 
of 
the 
native 
fertility 
of 
soils 
and 
depress 
yields. 
The 
long 
term 
sustainability 
of 
agriculture 
on 
these 
lands 
is 
at 
serious 
risk. 
Farmers 
throughout 
the 
country complain 
of 
“soil 
exhaustion” 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
problems 
they 
face. 
Deforestation 
in 
catchment 
areas has 
led 
to 
loss 
of 
ground 
cover, 
causing 
soil 
moisture 
losses 
and 
persistent drought. 
The 
need 
for 
better 
management 
of 
soil 
and water 
resources 
is 
therefore paramount. 
(iv) 
Smallholders seeking 
to improve 
their 
productivity 
and 
incomes 
need 
access 
to 
good 
advisory 
services. 
The 
recent 
decentralization 
of 
the 
delivery 
of 
rural 
services, 
including 
agricultural 
extension, 
to district 
councils 
has 
launched 
a 
promising 
process 
of 
reform 
in 
dissemination 
of 
-3- 
Page  10
technology. 
Pluralism 
in 
provision 
of 
extension 
services, 
including 
the 
use 
of 
private 
service 
providers 
and 
NGOs, 
is 
slowly 
emerging. 
In 
the 
interim, 
however, 
neither 
research 
nor 
extension 
is 
capable 
without 
additional 
measures 
to provide 
the 
needed 
level 
of 
support 
to 
farmers. 
(v) 
The 
withdrawal 
of 
the 
state 
and parastatal 
entities 
from 
the 
provision 
of 
inputs, 
marketing 
of 
output, 
and 
supply 
of 
credit 
opens 
opportunities 
for 
a 
much 
expanded 
role for 
the 
private 
sector. 
Yet 
private 
agents 
in 
input 
supply 
and 
rural 
finance have 
found 
the 
terrain 
risky 
and 
have 
been 
very 
cautious 
in 
entry, 
in 
part 
because 
markets 
are 
thin, 
clients 
have 
little 
collateral, and 
costs 
of 
information 
are 
high. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
most smallholders have 
poor 
access 
to 
marketing 
and 
financial 
services 
needed 
for 
adoption 
of 
higher 
yielding 
technology. 
Government 
strategy: 
Government 
seeks 
to 
address 
these 
problems through an integrated and 
participatory 
approach 
that 
brings 
together 
all 
stakeholders 
in 
identifying 
the 
key 
problems, 
prioritizing 
the 
needs, 
and 
developing the 
strategies 
and 
technical 
solutions 
to 
address 
the 
challenges. 
The 
Participatory 
Agricultural 
Development and Empowerment Project (PADEP) 
is 
an 
integral part 
of 
the 
Agricultural 
Sector 
Development 
Program 
(ASDP)  and 
the 
broader 
Rural 
Development 
Strategy 
(RDS). 
Government 
has 
completed 
the 
ASDP 
Framework 
and 
process 
Document 
which 
focuses 
on 
(i) 
empowering 
of 
rural 
communities 
and farmer 
groups, 
(ii) 
increasing agricultural 
productivity 
and 
access 
to 
markets, and 
(iii) 
decentralizing 
public 
investments and 
involving 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
service 
delivery. 
PADEP 
will 
facilitate 
implementation 
of 
the 
ASDP 
along 
the 
agreed 
core 
principles. 
The 
overall 
objective 
of 
the 
Rural 
Development 
Strategy 
is 
to 
reduce 
poverty through 
multi-sectoral interventions 
in 
agriculture, 
roads, water, education, 
health 
and 
local 
government 
reforms. 
The 
Strategy 
will 
harmonize and 
coordinate 
key 
sector 
policies 
and 
strategies. 
The 
Rural 
Development 
Strategy 
will 
be 
implemented 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
decentralization 
and 
will 
rely 
on 
operational 
mechanisms 
that empower 
rural 
communities 
in 
planning 
and 
implementing 
development projects. 
The 
PADEP 
project 
will 
build 
on 
the 
“Vision 
for 
Extension 
for 
2010,” 
the 
articulation 
of 
the 
Government’s 
approach 
to 
extension 
and 
the 
“Medium 
Term 
Plan“ 
for 
the 
National Agricultural 
Research System 
(NARS), 
which 
highlights 
the 
need 
for 
generation and 
adoption 
of 
technology 
within 
the 
ASDP 
framework. 
To 
achieve the 
Agricultural 
Sector 
Development 
Strategy 
(ASDS) objective 
of 
5 
percent annual 
agricultural 
growth, 
the 
Government 
intends 
to 
maintain 
macro-economic 
stability 
and 
ensure 
that 
macro-economic 
policies (both fiscal 
and monetary) 
promote 
efficiency 
and 
competitiveness 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector; create 
an enabling environment 
for 
improving 
profitability 
of 
the 
sector; increase 
smallholder 
productivity 
(through 
promotion 
of 
adoption 
of 
improved 
technologies); 
facilitate 
increased 
availability 
of 
key 
inputs 
(especially 
improved 
seeds 
and 
fertilizers); 
assist 
smallholders 
to 
improve 
their 
access 
to 
credit 
(through 
strengthening 
rural 
financial 
institutions); 
maintain 
competitiveness 
in 
agricultural 
exports 
(by 
removing 
external 
trade 
barriers);  enhance 
the 
efficiency 
and 
sustainability 
of 
land utilization 
(through 
promotion 
of 
better 
land 
husbandry 
practices); 
and 
improve 
incentives 
for 
the 
private 
sector 
(through 
fiscal 
policy 
and 
better 
business 
environment). 
The 
Government’s 
role 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
policy 
formulation, 
establishment 
of 
a 
regulatory 
framework 
to 
reduce 
transaction 
costs, 
provision 
of 
strategic 
public 
goods, 
and 
maintenance 
of 
safety 
nets 
for 
the 
most vulnerable 
in 
the 
society. 
Further, 
the 
Government 
intends 
to 
ensure 
that 
it 
does 
not 
undertake 
delivery 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
that 
the 
private 
sector 
is 
able 
to provide 
efficiently 
and 
effectively.

Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
Dialogue 
on 
key 
issues 
related 
to 
agricultural 
policy 
is 
undertaken 
by 
stakeholders 
and 
development 
partners 
jointly 
within 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Agricultural 
Sector 
Development 
Program, and 
further 
supported 
by 
the 
matrix 
of 
actions 
identified 
in 
the 
sequence 
of 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy 
Credits 
included 
in 
the 
Country 
Assistance Strategy. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
PADEP 
project 
does 
not 
specifically 
aim to 
accomplish 
policy 
changes. 
Identification 
of 
key 
issues 
that constrain 
agricultural 
growth 
has 
been part 
of 
the 
process 
of 
preparation 
of 
the 
project, 
however, and 
the 
issues 
are 
enumerated 
below. 
Among 
these 
are 
the 
following: 
1. 
Grain 
marketing 
policy: 
i.e., 
reaffirmation 
and enforcement 
of 
unencumbered 
internal 
and 
external 
trade 
in 
agricultural 
commodities, 
improved marketing information, revision 
of 
operational 
procedures 
governing 
the 
Strategic 
Grain 
Reserve; 
2. 
Rationalization 
of 
local 
levies and 
taxation 
and enforcement 
of 
the 
decisions 
taken; 
3. 
Policies regarding fertilizer, 
seeds, 
and 
plant protection 
agencies, 
e.g. 
fertilizer 
policy 
- 
efforts to 
facilitate 
bulk 
importation 
of 
fertilizers and 
revision 
of 
management 
of 
KR-I1 
fertilizer 
imports, 
seed 
policy 
- 
adoption 
of 
quality control 
of 
seeds, 
and 
plant protection 
- 
investment 
in 
additional 
work 
on 
integrated 
pest management; 
and 
4. 
Disposition 
of 
commercial 
state-owned 
agricultural 
assets 
to 
create 
opportunities 
for 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
to 
provide 
reassurance 
that 
the 
state 
will 
not 
remain 
active 
as 
a 
competitor 
with 
special 
advantage, 
e.g. 
state 
farms, 
agro-industries and 
warehouses. 
The 
steps 
that the Government 
is 
taking 
with 
regard 
to 
each 
of 
the 
above 
are 
outlined 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Sectoral 
Policy. 
In 
brief 
they 
are 
as 
follows: 
1. 
The 
Government 
has 
continued 
to 
implement 
the 
grain 
market 
liberalization 
policy 
that started 
in 
the 
mid-l980’s, 
including 
removal 
of 
the 
remaining 
trade 
barriers and 
enforcement 
of 
free 
internal 
and 
external 
trade 
in 
agricultural 
commodities, 
improved marketing 
information 
and 
revision 
of 
operational 
procedures 
governing 
the 
Strategic 
Grain 
Reserve (SGR). 
So 
far, the 
Government 
has 
liberalized 
trade 
in 
grain 
with 
regional 
(EAC 
and 
SADC) 
partners. 
In 
the 
past 
two 
years, 
private 
traders 
in 
the 
country 
exported maize 
to 
the 
Eastern, 
Central 
and Southern 
African 
countries (Kenya, 
Malawi, 
Zambia, 
Democratic 
Republic 
of 
Congo 
and Zimbabwe), 
which 
were 
hit 
by 
severe 
drought. 
Significant 
amounts 
of 
maize 
were 
also 
sold to 
the 
World 
Food 
Program 
(WFP) 
and 
UNHCR, 
and 
distributed 
to 
refugees’ 
camps 
within 
the country. 
The 
Government 
has 
removed 
all 
road 
blocks 
to 
encourage 
free domestic trade 
in 
agricultural 
commodities, 
particularly 
staple 
foodstuffs. 
The 
Strategic 
Grain 
Reserve (SGR) 
has 
been 
separated 
from 
the 
Food 
Security 
department. 
The 
latter 
has 
now 
become a 
fully-fledged 
directorate 
of 
MAFS 
dealing 
with 
food 
policy 
issues. 
The 
current 
role 
of 
SGR 
is 
to 
purchase 
maize 
at 
market 
prices, 
up 
to 
a 
maximum holding 
of 
150,000 
tons, 
and 
to 
release 
the 
stocks 
during 
food 
shortages 
or natural 
disasters 
at 
prevailing 
market 
prices. 
Under 
the 
Government 
of 
Ireland 
support, 
the 
Government 
is 
currently 
preparing 
a 
National 
Food 
Security 
Policy.  Similarly, 
the 
IFAD 
funded 
Agricultural Marketing 
Systems 
Development 
Project 
(AMSDP) 
is 
supporting 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Agricultural Marketing 
Policy. 
These 
policy 
documents 
will 
provide framework 
for 
completing 
the 
outstanding 
agricultural 
sector 
policy 
reforms. 
2. 
The 
Government 
has 
recognized 
that 
proliferation 
of 
local 
government 
taxes 
and levies 
have 
impeded 
some 
economic 
activities 
and 
is 
undertaking 
efforts 
to 
rationalize 
them. 
An 
upper 
limit 
of 
5 
percent 
has 
been imposed 
on 
the 
crop 
cess 
charged 
by 
district 
councils. 
This 
directive 
has 
been 
included 
in 
-5- 
Page  12
the 
Finance 
Act 
of 
2002 
and 
is 
being 
enforced through 
the 
President's 
Office, 
Regional 
Administration 
and 
Local 
Government, 
which 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
administration 
of 
local 
authorities. 
In 
addition, 
guidelines 
for 
rationalization 
and 
harmonization 
of 
Local 
Government 
revenue 
sources 
were 
issued 
to 
local 
authorities 
in 
December, 
2002 
to 
assist 
them 
in 
reforming 
their 
taxation 
systems. 
Attention 
was 
given 
to 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
taxes, 
particularly 
'nuisance taxes' 
as 
on 
the 
average, 
local 
authorities have 
about 
40 
different 
taxes, 
with 
10 
percent 
of 
these 
accounting 
for 
about 
70 
percent 
of 
total 
revenue. 
To 
ensure 
that 
minimum 
standards 
for 
service 
delivery 
are 
maintained, 
with 
the 
likely 
lower 
level 
of 
local 
revenue, 
the 
central 
government 
has 
commissioned a 
study 
on 
revenue 
sharing 
mechanisms. 
At 
national 
level, 
duties 
on 
packaging materials 
for 
agricultural 
inputs 
have been removed 
in 
order 
to 
encourage 
bulk 
importation 
of 
inputs 
and 
re-bagging 
in 
the 
country, 
hence 
reducing 
the 
cost 
of 
inputs 
to 
farmers. 
Under 
the 
Business 
Environment 
Strengthening 
(BEST) 
program, 
to 
be 
implemented 
from 
July, 
2003, 
the 
Government 
will 
continue 
to 
focus 
attention 
on 
harmonization 
of 
local 
government 
taxation 
to 
reduce 
the 
tax 
burden 
on 
private 
enterprises 
and 
review 
exporthmport 
procedures 
to 
reduce 
costs 
related 
to 
time 
required 
to 
meet 
procedures, 
and 
to 
reduce 
opportunities 
for 
corruption. 
This 
will 
reduce 
transactions 
costs 
in 
marketing 
and attract 
further 
agricultural 
investments. 
3. 
The 
Government 
with 
assistance 
from 
JICA 
is 
reviewing 
procedures 
for 
the 
importation 
and 
distribution 
of 
KR-I1 
fertilizer. 
In 
terms 
of 
seed 
policy, 
the 
Parliament recently 
passed 
Plant 
Breeder's 
Right 
Act 
(2002), 
which 
protects 
the 
intellectual 
property 
right 
of 
the 
local 
breeders. 
It 
also 
gives 
the 
responsibility 
of 
multiplying 
breeder 
seeds 
to 
the 
agricultural 
research 
institutions 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
purity. 
The 
Seed 
Act 
(1973), 
provides 
for 
the 
Government 
to 
establish a 
National 
Seed 
Executive 
Agency, 
which 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
seed 
certification, 
screening 
and 
inspection. 
Further, the Government 
through 
its 
Plant Protection 
Act 
(1997) 
and 
associated 
regulations 
is 
promoting 
Integrated 
Pest 
Management 
(IPM) 
practices 
to 
minimize 
the 
use 
of 
pesticides, 
and 
reduce 
the 
risks 
of 
environmental 
degradation. 
Under 
regional integration initiatives, 
the 
East 
African 
Governments 
(Tanzania, 
Kenya 
and 
Uganda) have 
signed 
a 
protocol to 
harmonize 
Seed 
Regulatory 
Policies 
and 
Legislations. 
The 
Cabinet 
has 
recently 
approved 
the 
Institutional 
and 
Legal 
Framework 
for 
Environmental 
Protection, 
which 
gives 
the 
role 
of 
policy 
guidance 
to 
the 
Vice 
President's 
Department 
of 
Environment, 
overall 
regulatory 
and enforcement 
to 
the 
National 
Environmental 
Management 
Council 
and 
sectoral 
mandates 
of 
environmental 
regulation 
to 
line 
ministries. 
The 
process 
of 
drafting 
an environmental 
law 
is 
about 
to 
start. 
4. 
The 
Government 
has 
already 
taken 
an 
inventory 
and 
evaluation 
of 
state-owned 
productive 
assets 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector. 
The 
Government 
has 
rehabilitated 
and 
leased 
two 
cashew 
factories (Masasi 
and Kibaha) 
to 
local 
private 
investors, 
with 
a 
view to 
encouraging domestic processing and 
adding 
value. 
The 
Government 
has 
also 
completed 
a 
study 
of 
warehousing 
and 
has 
decided 
to 
dispose 
of 
most 
of 
them 
through 
outright 
sale 
and 
earmarked a 
few 
other 
strategically located 
for 
leasing. 
Regarding 
rice 
state 
farms 
(Kapunga, 
Rum, 
Mbarali 
and 
Dakawa), the 
Government 
has 
divested 
by 
redistributing 
land 
to 
the 
local 
smallholder 
farmers. 
A 
decision 
has 
also 
been 
made 
to 
transfer 
the 
relatively 
larger wheat (Hanang 
and 
West 
Kilimanjaro) 
and 
maize 
(Namtumbo) 
state 
farms 
to 
the 
Land 
Bank. 
These 
will 
be 
leased 
to 
large commercial 
farming 
firms 
by 
the 
Tanzania Investment 
Center (TIC). 
In 
terms 
of 
financing 
of 
inputs, 
the Government's 
Agricultural 
Input 
Fund 
(for 
importing 
fertilizer, 
seed 
and 
agro-chemicals) 
is 
now 
managed 
by 
commercial 
banks 
(Exim 
and 
CRDB 
banks). 
Loans 
are 
issued 
on 
commercial 
terms, 
and 
its 
scope 
has 
been 
expanded 
to 
cover 
agricultural 
machinery 
and 
equipment.

Strategic choices: 
The 
project 
design 
is 
based 
on 
the 
following 
key 
principles: 
The 
project 
will 
be 
implemented largely 
at 
the 
levels 
of 
districts 
and 
rural 
communities. 
About 
80% 
of 
the 
project 
funds 
will 
be 
invested 
in 
subprojects 
of 
rural 
community 
and 
farmer 
groups, 
and 
in 
financing 
capacity 
building 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
At 
the 
national 
level, 
the 
project 
will 
provide 
modest support 
for 
further 
analytical 
work to 
support 
policy 
and regulatory reforms 
to 
enhance 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
inputloutput 
markets and 
provision 
of 
services, 
and 
for 
the 
coordination 
unit. 
There 
will 
be 
no 
direct 
budgetary 
support 
to 
line 
ministries. 
The project 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
a 
phased 
manner 
starting 
in 
selected 
districts 
(including 
in 
Zanzibar) 
according 
to 
demonstrated 
implementation capacity and 
the 
existence 
of 
viable 
farmers’ 
groups. 
The project 
implementation 
arrangements 
are 
flexible 
to 
allow 
for 
faster 
implementation 
if 
the 
absorptive 
capacity 
is 
enhanced, 
either 
by 
an 
increased 
number 
of 
participating 
districts 
or 
by 
the 
incorporation 
of 
more 
villages 
within 
districts, 
or more 
farmer 
groups 
within 
villages. 
The 
project 
will 
not 
finance, 
make special 
foreign 
exchange 
provisions, 
or 
establish 
credit 
lines 
for 
the 
importation 
of 
fertilizers or 
any 
other 
agricultural 
input. 
The 
project 
will 
not 
provide 
any 
lines 
of 
credit, 
but 
will 
support 
promotion 
of 
rural 
savings 
and credit 
by 
strengthening 
farmer 
groups 
and, 
under 
certain applications 
of 
the 
project 
guidelines, 
requiring 
participants 
to 
have 
active 
savings accounts. 
The project 
will 
support 
gender 
equity 
and 
HIVIAIDS 
awareness 
and 
mitigation, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
community participatory planning 
activities. 
The project 
will 
focus 
on 
increased 
agricultural production 
from 
areas 
already 
under 
cultivation, 
as 
this 
will 
cause 
minimal 
ecological 
disturbance, 
will 
not involve 
costly 
movement 
of 
population 
or 
heavy investments 
in 
new 
areas, 
and can 
be 
accomplished 
faster 
and 
with 
benign 
environmental 
consequences.

Project Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed description and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
The 
project 
has 
two 
components: 
(i) 
Community 
Agricultural 
Development 
Subprojects; 
and 
(ii) 
Capacity 
Building 
and 
Institutional 
Strengthening. 
The 
total 
project 
cost 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
US$ 
69.99 
million 
equivalent, 
of 
which 
IDA 
will 
finance 
US$ 
56.58 
million, 
beneficiaries 
will 
contribute 
US$ 
11.82 
million, 
and Government (national and 
district 
councils) 
will 
provide 
US$ 
1.59 
million. 
The 
project 
comprises 
of 
the 
Agricultural 
Development 
Subprojects, 
benefiting 
either 
the 
community 
at 
large, 
of 
a 
village (Community 
Subprojects) 
or 
a 
group 
of 
farmers 
in 
a 
village 
(Farmer 
Group 
Subprojects) 
and

district 
and 
community 
and 
national 
level. 
The 
subprojects 
will 
cover 
all 
aspects 
of 
community 
development 
initiatives 
such 
as 
identification, 
design, 
implementation, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
using 
participatory 
approaches. 
The 
Capacity 
Building 
Program 
at 
the 
local level 
will 
cover 
identification, 
preparation and implementation 
of 
a capacity 
building 
program to 
support 
the 
community initiatives. 
The 
Capacity 
Building 
Program 
at 
the 
national 
level 
will 
cover 
aspects 
of 
Policy 
Planning 
and 
Regulatory 
Mechanism, 
Technology Linkages 
and 
Capacity 
for 
Project Implementation. 
Component 
1 
: 
Communitv 
Agricultural 
Development Subproiects 
This 
project 
component 
will 
consist 
of 
(a) 
Community 
Investment 
Subprojects (CIS); 
and 
(b) 
Farmer 
Group 
Investment 
Subprojects (FGIS). 
The 
aim 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
empower 
rural 
communities 
and farmer groups to make decisions to 
improve 
their 
economic 
well-being 
and 
to 
act 
on 
them. 
Communities and 
organized farmers' 
groups 
will 
have 
the 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
using 
participatory 
approaches 
in 
implementing 
small-scale 
investment 
activities 
supported 
by 
the 
project, 
including 
identification 
and 
planning 
of 
subprojects, 
implementation 
of 
technical 
recommendations, 
local 
procurement 
of 
inputs, 
contracting 
of 
service 
providers and 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
The 
project 
will 
build 
capacity 
of 
local 
authorities, 
communities 
and farmers' groups 
by 
conducting 
tailor-made 
basic 
training 
in 
participatory 
methodologies 
such 
as 
participatory 
rural 
appraisals 
(PRA), 
subproject cycle, 
basic 
financial 
and procurement 
skills, 
participatory 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
(PM&E), 
environmental 
and social 
assessments, 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
awareness 
and 
prevention. 
A 
community 
is 
defined 
as 
a 
single 
village, 
or 
a 
significant 
portion 
thereof, 
with 
a 
common 
investment 
interest. 
Thus 
a 
community 
subproject 
will 
be 
any 
investment, 
that draws 
public 
interest 
and 
brings 
common 
benefits. 
A 
"Farmer 
Group" 
is 
defined 
as 
a 
small 
group 
(1 
0 
- 
40 
households) 
of 
the 
same 
village 
in 
which 
members 
have 
voluntarily 
agreed, 
with 
endorsement 
of 
their 
Village 
Council, 
to 
engage 
in 
an investment 
subproject that 
introduces technological innovation. 
Possible subprojects 
include: 
soil 
fertility 
and 
better 
land 
management 
(watershed 
management 
for 
soil 
and water 
conservation, 
restoration 
of 
soil 
fertility 
using 
rock 
phosphate, 
conservation and 
no 
tillage 
techniques, 
and 
fuel 
efficiency 
technologies 
- 
biogas); 
agricultural 
investments and technologies (integrated 
plant 
nutrition 
strategy 
(IPNS), 
integrated 
pest management 
(IPM), rainwater 
harvesting, 
improvement 
of 
traditional 
schemes, 
production 
of 
nontraditional 
crops 
and 
improved 
livestock); 
and 
input-output 
marketing 
(production 
of 
organic 
fertilizers, 
primary 
processing 
of 
crop and 
livestock 
products, contract 
farming 
etc.). 
Criteria 
for 
approval 
of 
subprojects 
will 
include 
gender balance, 
sustainability and 
empowerment 
of 
rural 
communities. 
In 
order 
to 
share 
risks 
involved 
in 
adopting 
new 
improved 
technologies, 
efforts 
of 
communities 
and 
farmers' 
groups 
will 
be 
complemented 
with 
direct 
transfers 
of 
financial 
resources 
to 
them (through 
local 
governments) 
on 
a matching-grant 
basis. 
This 
will 
allow 
them 
to 
shop 
and compare 
prices among 
several 
suppliers 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
needed 
to 
implement 
their 
subprojects.  Mechanisms 
for 
community-driven 
development 
will 
be 
introduced 
in 
a phased 
manner, 
to 
allow 
for 
improvements 
in 
the 
course 
of 
project 
implementation. 
Before 
implementing 
the subprojects, each 
Village Council 
or 
farmer 
group 
will 
undergo a 
participatory planning 
process 
to 
identify 
opportunities 
key 
challenges 
and 
practical 
ways 
to 
overcome 
them. 
The 
subprojects 
thus 
derived 
will 
then 
be 
costed 
and 
the 
implied 
share 
of 
the 
cost 
to 
the 
beneficiaries 
made clear. 
If 
the 
beneficiaries 
wish 
to 
undertake 
the 
project, 
it 
will 
be 
submitted 
for 
approval 
to 
the 
District 
Management 
Team 
(DMT) 
of 
the 
District 
Authority. 
With 
each 
participating 
community 
or 
farmers 
group, 
the 
cycle 
of 
subprojects 
will 
unfold 
over 
three 
years. 
The 
initial 
year 
will 
be 
devoted 
mainly 
to 
capacity 
building 
PRA, 
identification 
and 
preparation 
of 
the subprojects. 
The 
-8- 
Page  15
initial 
year 
will 
be 
devoted a 
village 
mainly to 
capacity 
building, 
PRA, 
and 
identification 
and 
preparation 
of 
the 
subprojects. 
The 
second 
and 
third 
years 
will 
be 
devoted 
to 
implementation. 
For 
CIS, 
beneficiaries 
will 
contribute 
(labor, 
materials 
or 
in 
cash) 
at 
least 17% 
of 
total 
subproject 
costs, 
excluding 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
and 
the 
project 
will 
contribute 
the 
difference 
up 
to 
a 
maximum 
of 
US$ 
30,000 
equivalent 
per 
village. 
Additionally 
the 
project 
will 
contribute 
100% 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
up 
to 
a 
maximum 
of 
US$ 
5,000 
equivalent. 
For 
FGIS, 
the 
project 
will 
contribute 
in 
cash 50% 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
consumable 
inputs 
(seeds, 
fertilizers, 
and 
plant protection 
chemicals) 
up 
to 
US$25 
equivalent 
per 
household 
per 
year 
for 
a 
maximum 
of 
2 
years 
and 
I 
or 
80% 
of 
costs 
of 
technological innovations 
other than 
agricultural 
input 
and 
up 
to 
US$ 
8,000 
per 
village. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
contribute 
100% 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
up 
to 
a 
maximum 
of 
US$3,000 
equivalent. 
The 
total project contribution 
for 
CIS 
and 
FGIS 
subprojects 
per 
village 
will 
be 
US$46,000 
equivalent.  Farmers 
participating 
in 
the 
group 
investment 
subprojects 
will 
be 
required 
to 
have 
a 
savings account 
and 
deposit at 
least 
50% 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
consumable 
inputs 
to 
be 
purchased 
prior 
to receiving 
the 
matching contribution 
grant. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
season 
they 
will 
be 
required 
again 
to 
deposit 
at 
least 50% 
of 
the 
value 
of 
inputs 
needed 
for 
the 
following 
season 
in 
order 
to 
qualify 
for 
another 
matching 
grant 
from 
the 
project. 
In 
this 
way 
farmers 
are 
expected 
to 
build 
savings 
habits 
required 
to 
purchase 
inputs 
for 
the 
following 
seasons 
and 
will 
be 
encouraged 
to 
build 
up 
relationship 
with 
financial institutions 
and 
input 
dealers. 
Component 
2: 
Capacity 
Building 
and 
Institutional 
Strengthening 
This 
component 
enhances 
the 
institutional 
and 
human 
capacity 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
subprojects 
chosen are adequately 
considered 
in 
key 
dimensions, 
including 
environmental,  economic, 
financial 
and 
social, 
and 
implemented 
with 
acceptable 
quality. 
In 
all 
participating 
districts 
the 
project 
will 
support 
training 
to 
upgrade 
capacities 
in 
participatory 
planning 
methodologies, 
project 
implementation, 
monitoring 
and evaluation, 
financial 
and procurement 
management 
skills, 
environmental 
and 
social 
assessments, 
and 
public-private 
partnership 
in 
service 
delivery. 
Staff 
of 
the 
district 
councils 
will 
also 
undergo 
training 
to 
enable 
them 
guide 
communities 
and 
farmers' 
groups 
as 
needed. 
Technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
District 
Agricultural 
Development 
Plans 
(DADPs), 
which 
are 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
overall 
District 
Development 
Plans 
(DDPs). 
Under 
this 
component 
conditional 
block 
grants 
to 
the 
districts 
will 
be 
in 
cash 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
US$ 
175,000 
equivalent 
for 
three 
years. 
The 
District 
Councils 
will 
contribute 
10% 
of 
the 
grant 
(US$ 
17,500 
equivalent). 
Planning 
for 
the 
use 
of 
these 
funds 
will 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
District 
Councils through 
the 
DMTs. 
Support 
of 
the 
project 
at 
national 
level 
will 
include 
funding 
for 
capacity 
building 
in 
key 
entities 
and 
for 
project 
preparation, 
management 
and 
implementation 
and 
additional analytical 
work 
to underpin 
ongoing 
reforms. 
The 
capacities 
of 
national 
institutions 
responsible 
for 
policy 
analysis, 
regulatory 
functions,  and 
project 
preparation, 
management 
and 
implementation 
such 
as 
planning, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, and 
financial 
management 
will 
be 
strengthened 
through training, technical 
assistance 
and 
provision 
of 
required 
equipment. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
finance various 
policy 
studies 
aiming 
at 
reviewing, 
harmonizing and 
rationalizing agricultural 
taxes, 
levies 
and 
fees 
on 
crop and 
livestock 
sub-sectors. 
Other 
studies 
to 
be 
supported 
will 
cover 
surveys 
of 
sectoral 
performance 
and 
beneficiary 
assessments. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
further 
development and 
updating 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
system, 
and improvement 
of 
its 
management 
information 
system 
(MIS). 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Seed 
Act 
(1973) 
and 
the 
Plant 
Breeders 
Right 
Act 
(2002), 
which 
provide 
the 
regulatory framework 
for 
seed 
industry, 
including 
the establishment 
of 
-9-

Seed 
Executive Agency. 
The 
project 
will 
carry 
out 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
four 
strategically located 
soil 
testing 
laboratories, 
provide 
the 
required laboratory 
chemicals 
and 
equipment, 
including 
soil-testing 
kits 
for 
on-site

Subprojects have 
been 
estimated at 
an 
equivalent 
of 
US$ 
2.8 
million 
and 
for 
the

2. 
Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
As 
noted 
above, 
the Government 
has 
committed to 
undertake 
changes 
in 
policy 
or 
renewed 
efforts 
to 
implement 
existing policies 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
trade 
of 
agricultural 
commodities, 
taxation 
of 
agricultural 
commodities 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
facilitation 
of 
marketing 
of 
agricultural 
inputs, 
and 
divestiture 
of 
agricultural 
assets 
presently 
owned 
by 
the 
state. 
The 
project 
supports 
the Government's 
commitment 
to 
decentralization 
by 
implementing 
newly 
defined 
roles 
for 
local 
governments 
in 
promoting 
rural 
growth, and 
by 
providing 
resources 
for 
improved 
capacity 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
Although 
the 
project 
does 
not 
support 
explicit 
reforms 
to promote private 
sector 
development other 
than 
those 
noted 
above, 
the 
expected increased 
volume 
of 
transactions 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
participating 
communities 
will 
be 
an 
institutional 
development 
of 
considerable 
value.

Benefits 
and 
target population: 
Benefits 
An 
estimated 
half 
a 
million 
smallholder 
farmers 
(with 
2 
hectares 
or 
less) 
are 
expected 
to 
benefit 
directly 
from 
increased 
rural 
incomes 
and 
improved 
food 
security, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
adopting 
improved 
agricultural 
technologies,  accessing 
new or 
improved productive 
infrastructure, 
and 
enhancing 
management 
of 
their 
soils 
and 
water 
resources. 
An 
equally 
large 
number 
of 
smallholder farmers 
is 
likely 
to 
benefit 
indirectly 
through 
the 
demonstration 
effect 
of 
repeated applications 
of 
improved productive 
technologies 
by 
participants. Through participatory 
planning 
methods, 
villages 
and 
individual 
households 
will 
benefit 
from 
increased 
awareness 
of 
other 
community-wide 
issues 
(infrastructure 
needs, 
marketing 
constraints, 
environmental 
concerns, 
prevention 
of 
HIV/AIDS) 
and 
identification 
of 
strategies 
to 
address 
them. 
In 
the 
medium 
term, 
the 
adoption 
of 
improved 
land 
and 
crop 
husbandry practices 
will 
gradually 
restore 
the 
productive capacity 
of 
soils 
of 
participating 
farmers, 
thus 
enhancing the 
sustainability 
of 
their 
existing agricultural production 
systems 
and 
reducing 
the 
pressure 
to move 
onto 
new 
and 
more fragile 
lands 
and 
protected 
areas. 
Secondary 
beneficiaries 
include 
rural 
stockists 
and 
retailers 
of 
inputs, 
agricultural 
traders, 
and 
local 
authorities 
as 
they 
increase 
their 
capacities 
to 
promote 
local 
economic 
development and 
delivery 
of 
services. 
Higher 
and 
more 
predictable 
demand 
for 
inputs 
will 
result 
in 
more 
dynamic 
and competitive 
markets 
for 
inputs 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
This 
is 
also 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
increased 
coordination 
and 
efficiency 
gains 
(through 
scale economies) 
in 
the 
overall 
input 
supply 
chains, 
with 
downward 
pressure 
on 
input 
prices. 
Target 
population 
The project 
will 
target 
an 
estimated 
500,000 
smallholder 
farmers 
in 
about 
840 
villages, 
including 
Zanzibar over 
a 
five 
year 
project 
period. 
It 
will 
cover 
26 districts 
in 
the 
main 
land 
and 
the 
islands 
of 
Unguja 
and 
Pemba 
in 
Zanzibar 
(equivalent 
to 
2 
mainland 
districts). 
The 
target number 
of 
villages 
in 
each 
district 
will 
be 
30 
in 
the 
mainland. 
In 
Zanzibar, 
a 
total 
of 
60 villages, 
spread 
over 
27 
Shehias 
(Group 
of 
villages 
for 
community 
administrative 
purposes, 
with 
each Shehia 
consisting 
of 
2 
- 
3 
villages), 
will 
be 
covered. 
The 
project implementation 
in 
each 
participating district 
in 
the 
main 
land 
will 
be 
spread 
over 
three years 
with 
the 
first 
year 
earmarked 
for 
capacity 
building, 
subprojects 
preparation 
and 
for 
project 
implementation 
in 
at 
least 2 villages. 
The 
districts 
will 
be 
brought 
into 
the 
program 
in 
a 
phased manner. 
Of 
the 
mainland 
districts, 
8 
will 
enter 
the 
program 
in 
the 
first 
year, 
followed 
by 
another 
8 
in 
year 
2, 
and 
10 
in 
year 
3. 
In 
Zanzibar, 
the 
program 
will 
begin 
during 
the 
second year 
and 
will 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fifth 
year. 
The 
expansion 
in 
the 
number 
of 
districts 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
number 
of 
villages 
in 
the 
districts 
already 
brought 
under 
the 
project 
will 
be 
looked 
at 
the 
Mid-Term 
Review 
(MTR). 
The 
key 
features 
of 
the 
subprojects 
investment 
under 
PADEP 
include: 
(i) 
putting 
in 
place a 
village 
level 
micro planning 
process 
to 
allow 
members 
of 
community, especially 
the 
vulnerable 
groups, 
including 
women, 
to 
participate 
in 
planning 
and 
prioritizing 
needs; 
(ii) 
an 
elected 
community-level 
leaders 
to 
manage the 
implementation 
of 
community 
and 
farmer 
groups subprojects, 
including 
managing 
funds 
and procuring 
goods 
and 
services; 
(iii) 
systematic 
involvement 
of 
autonomous 
district 
teams 
who 
are 
trained 
in 
facilitating 
participatory 
processes, 
and 
who 
will 
work 
intensively 
with 
communities and 
farmer 
groups; 
and 
(iv) 
participatory 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system. 
This 
has 
a 
poverty reduction 
focus 
since 
about 
70% 
of 
the 
grants 
will 
finance 
community 
subprojects, 
which 
are 
implemented 
by 
a 
large 
portion 
of 
the 
village, and 
matching contribution 
is 
primarily 
in 
kind. 
The project 
is 
also 
gender-sensitive, 
with 
women 
comprising 
at 
least 
40% 
of 
membership 
in 
subprojects, 
and 
women 
only 
farmer 
groups subprojects 
are 
allowed. 
Further, 
at 
least 
two 
signatories 
of 
subproject 
accounts 
must 
be 
women. 
In 
terms 
of 
subproject 
leadership, 
either 
the 
chair 
or 
the secretary 
of 
any 
subproject 
must 
be 
a woman.

(iv) 
monitoring 
and 
supervising 
the 
implementation 
of 
subprojects. 
In 
the 
mainland, 
the 
District 
Council 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
management 
of 
the 
project 
resources (grants). 
In 
Zanzibar, 
as 
the 
districts do 
not 
have 
the 
required 
capacity, 
the 
MANREC 
will 
handle 
the 
management 
of 
project 
resources, 
while 
capacity 
at 
the 
districts 
is 
strengthened. 
The 
DED 
will 
establish a 
DFT 
of 
between 
8 
to 
10 
members 
comprising 
of 
District 
technical 
staff 
and 
representatives 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
NGOs 
with 
skills 
in 
agriculture, 
financial 
management, 
and 
participatory 
rural 
appraisal 
processes. 
The 
membership 
could 
include: 
District 
Extension Officer, 
Crops 
Officer, Livestock Officer, 
Planning 
Officer,  Treasurer, 
Community 
Development 
Officer, 
Cooperative 
Officer, 
Natural 
Resources 
Officer, 
PADEP 
Desk 
Officer 
and 
Representatives 
of 
private 
sector, 
NGOs, 
research stations. 
Other technical 
staff 
could 
be 
co-opted 
depending 
on 
nature 
of 
subproject proposed 
by 
the 
beneficiaries. 
The 
DFT 
will 
act 
as 
a 
technical 
working 
group 
under 
the 
DED 
and 
will 
be 
responsible 
for: 
(i) 
facilitating 
the 
PRA, identification 
of 
priorities, supporting 
the 
development 
of 
subprojects, 
and 
strengthening 
of 
farmer groups and communities; 
(ii) 
conducting 
desk 
and 
field 
appraisal 
of 
subprojects; 
and 
(iii) 
providing 
technical 
support 
during 
implementation and 
monitoring 
of 
subprojects.

statements. 
The 
FMS 
will 
be 
maintained 
at the

based 
on 
returns 
from 
the 
districts 
and 
communities/farmer 
groups. 
The 
Returns 
from 
the 
districts councils

will 
be 
prepared 
from 
independent 
set 
of 
books 
maintained 
by 
the

Simple 
formats 
of 
the 
Returns, 
which 
constitute 
the 
SOEs 
and 
the 
FMRs, 
were 
reviewed 
at 
appraisal 
and 
found 
to 
be 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Bank. 
These 
Returns 
format 
will 
be 
field 
tested 
on

For 
the 
community 
subprojects, 
the 
book-keeping 
and 
accounting 
will 
be 
simple 
hand-written 
records 
of 
receipts 
and 
payments and 
will 
be 
maintained 
in 
the 
Kiswahili 
language. 
The 
SOEs 
and 
the 
FMRs 
will 
be 
generated 
from 
these 
records. 
The 
record 
keeping and accounting 
by 
the 
districts 
will 
be 
an 
integral part 
of 
their 
accounting 
system. 
These

A 
Consultant 
engaged 
under 
the 
PPF 
has 
completed 
the 
detailed 
design 
of 
the 
financial 
management system 
and 
submitted 
proposals 
for 
computerization. 
The 
proposals 
for 
computerization 
will 
be 
reviewed 
and 
agreed 
at 
Credit 
Negotiations. 
It 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
of 
credit 
effectiveness that 
financial 
management 
system 
is 
put 
in 
place, 
at 
least 
for 
manual operation and 
that 
the 
returns 
from 
the 
districts 
and 
the 
communities, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
FMRs 
are 
field 
tested 
on 
the 
pilot 
subprojects. 
Monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
arrangements 
The 
project 
will 
use 
participatory 
methodologies that 
involve 
the 
district 
councils, 
wards, 
villages 
and farmers’ 
groups 
in 
collection, 
processing, 
and 
reporting 
of 
data 
in 
a 
simplified 
format. 
Implementing 
teams 
in 
the 
districts and 
wards 
will 
be 
trained 
in 
participatory 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
approaches. 
Baseline 
data 
collection 
will 
be 
undertaken 
as 
part 
of 
an 
extended 
PRA 
exercise 
in 
each 
targeted 
community. 
The 
baseline 
will 
include 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
quality 
and 
availability 
of 
rural 
services 
provision, 
as 
well 
as 
current levels 
of 
production, 
asset 
ownership 
and income. 
Beneficiary-led 
assessments 
will 
be 
carried out 
by 
village 
governments 
to 
assess 
the 
benefits 
arising 
from 
subproject 
as 
they reach completion. Each 
district 
will 
summarize 
these 
assessments 
on 
an 
annual 
basis, 
in 
order 
to 
gauge 
the 
emerging 
effects 
of 
subprojects 
on 
the 
communities 
and 
to 
learn 
lessons 
for 
investments 
in 
following 
years. 
These 
district 
summaries 
will 
then 
be 
reviewed 
at 
annual 
zonal 
workshops attended 
by 
relevant 
stakeholders 
(farmers’ 
groups, 
NGOs, 
CBOs, 
private 
sector traders 
etc.). 
Project 
monitoring 
will 
be 
based 
on 
monthly 
community-prepared 
subproject reports that feed 
into 
a Management 
Information 
System 
(MIS) 
in 
every 
participating 
district. 
The 
MIS 
will 
be organized 
around 
three 
modules: 
(i) 
a 
community 
and 
farmers’ 
group 
subproject module, 
containing 
data 
on 
the 
community planning 
processes 
and 
investment 
subprojects, 
and 
the 
farm-level technology adoption and 
input 
use 
as 
well 
as 
output 
information 
and 
environmental 
monitoring; 
(ii) 
a 
financial 
management 
module, 
which 
will 
report 
on 
financial 
performance 
and 
the 
rate 
of 
subproject 
progress, 
in 
line 
with 
FMR 
requirements; 
and 
(iii) 
an 
institutional 
strengthening 
and capacity 
building 
module 
for 
district 
activities. 
Based 
on 
the 
pilot 
district 
experiences, 
a consultant 
will 
design 
the 
MIS 
and 
install 
it 
on 
district 
computers 
in 
a 
phased 
manner 
during 
project 
Year 
1. 
With 
data 
from 
the 
baseline 
surveys 
and 
beneficiary-led 
assessments, 
reports 
from 
the 
MIS, 
and 
findings 
from 
field 
visits 
(including random 
audits) 
and supervision 
reports, 
the 
districts 
will 
monitor 
project 
performance, 
identify 
implementation 
problems 
and 
achievements, 
and 
take 
appropriate actions 
to 
improve 
project 
implementation and environmental sustainability. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
aggregating 
district-level 
reports 
on 
a 
quarterly 
and 
annual 
basis. 
These, 
combined 
with 
the 
progress 
information on 
national-level activities, 
will 
be 
consolidated and 
submitted 
to 
the 
NPSC 
and 
to 
IDA 
by 
the 
PCU. 
After 
two 
years 
of 
project implementation, 
the 
PCU 
will 
contract 
an 
independent 
Mid 
Term 
Review 
to 
assess 
overall 
progress 
and emerging impact, 
and 
recommend 
necessary 
changes 
to project 
design 
for 
the 
remaining 
project period. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project, 
a comprehensive 
terminal 
evaluation 
will 
assess 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
stated 
development 
objective 
- 
increases 
in 
household production, 
incomes 
and 
assets 
as 
well 
the 
environmental 
impact 
- 
by 
comparing 
the 
baseline 
and 
beneficiary 
assessments 
with 
results 
from 
a 
final 
year 
field 
survey 
of 
subprojects. 
The 
final 
evaluation 
document 
will 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
consideration 
by 
IDA 
on: 
(i) 
whether expansion 
of 
Project activities 
should 
be 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
addition 
of 
new 
districts 
or 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
villages 
within 
the 
participating 
districts; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
new 
CISIFGIS 
grant, 
as 
well 
as 
District Council 
grant ceilings.

Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
(a) 
Implementation 
of 
long-term Adaptable 
Program 
Loan 
(APL) 
The 
Government 
of 
Tanzania 
is 
preparing 
a comprehensive 
rural 
development 
strategy and 
program 
of 
implementation. 
PADEP 
fits 
within 
this 
framework, 
and 
the 
issues 
it 
addresses 
are 
recognized 
to 
require 
attention over 
a 
long 
time 
horizon. 
The 
use 
of 
participatory 
approaches 
and 
matching 
grants 
for 
risk 
sharing 
to 
encourage 
adoption 
of 
improved 
technologies, 
however, 
is 
somewhat 
innovative, 
and 
must 
be 
observed 
in 
practice before commitment 
is 
made 
to 
a 
longer 
term 
program. 
Therefore, 
a 
five-year 
Specific Investment 
Loan 
(SIL) 
was chosen 
instead 
of 
an 
APL. 
The 
experience 
gained 
in 
the 
course 
of 
project 
implementation 
and the 
final 
impact evaluation 
will 
provide 
valuable 
insights 
that 
could 
be 
used 
to 
prepare 
a 
long 
term 
program. 
(b) 
Self-standing 
project 
concentrating 
on 
soil fertility 
and 
agricultural 
intensijication 
Initially 
a 
proposal 
was 
presented 
to 
design 
a 
project 
focused 
on 
soil 
fertility 
and 
agricultural 
intensification. 
Through participatory 
and 
consultative 
processes, 
the 
earlier 
project 
design 
was 
rejected 
because 
of 
its 
emphasis 
on 
use 
of 
one 
input 
(Le., 
inorganic 
fertilizer) 
rather 
than an 
open 
menu 
of 
appropriate technologies. 
In 
addition, the 
original 
design 
included 
special 
allocation 
of 
foreign 
currency 
to 
support 
importation 
of 
fertilizer, 
and 
that 
was 
determined 
not 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
evolution 
of 
foreign 
exchange 
markets 
in 
Tanzania. 
Further, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
project 
preparation and 
related 
discussions 
during 
the 
finalization 
of 
the 
Agricultural 
Sector 
Development 
Strategy 
(ASDS) and 
its 
implementation 
program 
(ASDP), 
note 
was 
taken 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
participation 
of 
communities 
and 
participants 
in 
investment 
decisions. 
Therefore, the 
project 
was 
redesigned 
to 
focus 
on 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
districts 
to 
assist 
rural 
communities 
to 
identify, 
design 
and 
implement 
productive 
investment 
projects 
of 
their 
own 
choice. 
The 
spectrum 
of 
eligible 
projects 
was 
opened 
up 
to 
include 
not 
just 
those 
related to soil 
fertility, 
but 
also those 
related 
to, 
water 
resource management, 
marketing, and 
rural 
infrastructure. 
An 
earlier proposal 
to 
use 
a 
voucher 
scheme 
to 
implement 
the 
matching 
grant 
was 
rejected 
due 
to 
unnecessary 
complexity. 
(c) 
A 
broad 
rural 
development 
program 
A 
comprehensive 
Rural 
Development 
Strategy 
is 
being 
finalized 
by 
Government. 
The 
proposed 
project 
focuses 
on 
developing capacity 
of 
districts and communities 
to 
identify 
and 
implement 
demand-driven 
productive 
investments. 
By 
the 
time 
the 
Rural 
Development 
Strategy 
is 
complete 
and 
operational, 
PADEP 
will 
have 
contributed 
by 
accumulating 
experience 
in 
approaches 
that can 
be 
adapted 
to 
a 
broader 
range 
of 
activities. 
The 
RDS 
is 
a 
coordinating 
mechanism 
for 
the 
various 
sectoral 
contributions 
to 
the 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy 
(PRS); 
Le., 
agriculture, 
water, education, 
health 
and 
rural 
roads. 
The 
actual 
implementation 
of 
individual 
sectoral 
strategies 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
line 
ministries. 
Under 
these 
circumstances, a 
broadly defined 
sectoral development 
program 
would 
not 
be 
adequately focused 
on 
practical 
interventions 
that 
yield 
results 
on 
the ground. 
A 
decision 
was 
taken 
not 
to 
design 
an 
instrument 
providing broad 
support 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
Rural 
Development 
Strategy, 
although 
PADEP 
is 
fully 
consistent 
with 
that 
strategy.

Poverty reduction

Consideration 
was 
given 
to 
the 
possibility 
of 
supporting activities 
identified 
as 
part 
of 
the

PADEP 
agenda 
through 
the 
instrument 
of 
the 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Support 
Credit 
(PRSC). 
The 
Government 
has 
determined 
that 
within 
the 
medium-term, 
IDA'S 
direct 
support 
to 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
should continue 
to 
be 
through specific 
investment 
lending 
(SIL) 
operations, 
while 
the PRSC 
will 
support 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
reforms. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
ASDP, 
which 
provides 
for 
basket 
funding 
as 
well 
as 
parallel 
earmarked support 
to 
its 
subprograms. 
IFAD 
and 
DANIDA 
are 
also 
supporting 
implementation 
of 
the, 
ASDP 
through 
stand alone 
projects 
aiming to 
address 
specific problems 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector.

Lessons 
learned 
and reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
An 
Operations 
Evaluation 
Department (OED) 
review 
of 
“Tanzania, 
Agriculture, 
and 
the 
World 
Bank” 
(Report 
No. 
181 
11, 
June 
30, 
1998) supports 
the 
view 
that 
‘in 
Tanzania 
at 
this 
stage 
in 
its 
development, 
the 
best 
way 
to 
eliminate 
poverty 
is 
to 
develop agriculture.’ 
The 
report 
further 
notes 
that 
for 
most 
farmers 
the 
transition 
from 
traditional 
long 
fallow, 
land-extensive, 
low-input 
subsistence 
agriculture 
to 
market-oriented 
production 
using 
substantial purchased 
inputs 
still 
lies 
in 
the 
future. 
Tanzania 
is 
at 
an earlier 
stage 
than 
some 
African 
countries 
(Kenya, 
Zimbabwe) 
in 
building 
institutions 
(markets, 
legal 
and 
regulatory framework, 
social 
and material infrastructure) 
needed 
to 
develop 
agriculture 
in 
a 
liberalized 
and 
market-oriented 
economy. 
The 
report 
also notes 
that 
agricultural 
practices 
in 
much 
of 
Tanzania 
have 
led 
to 
some 
land 
degradation 
due 
to 
depletion 
of 
nutrients 
and organic matter. 
This 
project 
responds 
well 
to 
the 
issues 
and 
lessons 
presented 
by 
OED. 
OED 
evaluation 
reports 
for 
three 
Tanzanian 
agricultural 
and 
forestry projects 
(IDA 
Credit 
Nos. 
1970, 
1994 
and 
2335) 
highlight 
two 
important 
lessons: 
(i) 
involvement 
of 
farmers 
in 
design 
and 
operation 
of 
extension programs 
is 
a 
critical 
element 
in 
ensuring 
the 
continued technical 
relevance 
and 
usefulness 
of 
the service; 
and 
(ii) 
establishment 
of 
effective 
research-extension linkages 
requires 
institutional 
reforms 
that 
create 
positive 
incentives 
for 
collaboration. 
Information 
should 
flow 
both 
ways, 
not 
only 
from 
researchers 
to 
farmers, 
but 
also 
vice 
versa. 
More 
generally, a 
review 
of 
the Bank’s experience 
in 
agricultural 
technology 
generation 
and 
transfer 
in 
several 
regions, 
as 
documented 
by 
OED 
evaluations, 
indicates that the 
following 
elements 
are 
critical for 
success: 
(i) 
beneficiary 
ownership and 
participation 
for priority 
setting, 
planning 
and 
monitoring, 
as 
well 
as 
financing; 
(ii) 
a 
single 
model 
cannot 
be 
designed 
for 
generalized 
application; 
pluralism 
and 
competition 
among 
service 
providers 
(public, 
private, non-profit, and 
non-governmental 
sectors) 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
system; 
(iii) 
success 
and 
sustainability 
of 
development programs 
require 
commitment 
for 
building 
social capital 
through 
organizational 
and 
technical 
training 
of 
beneficiary 
groups 
and 
community-based organizations. 
The 
international 
experience 
of 
Community 
Driven 
Development 
(CDD) 
-type 
projects, 
which 
is 
documented 
by 
various publications 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
(e.g. 
thematic group 
on CDD) 
has 
revealed 
the 
following: 
(i) 
the 
potential 
for 
CDD 
is 
greatest 
for 
goods 
and 
services 
that 
are 
small 
in 
scale 
and 
not 
complex. 
These 
are 
activities 
within 
the 
management 
capacity 
of 
community 
organizations 
and 
that 
require 
local 
cooperation, 
such 
as 
common 
pool 
goods 
(e.g., 
surface 
water 
irrigation 
systems), 
public 
goods 
(e.g., 
rural road 
maintenance), 
and 
civil 
goods 
(e.g., 
public 
advocacy and 
social monitoring); 
(ii) 
the 
impact 
of 
CDD 
programs 
is 
directly 
related 
to 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
Community 
Based Organizations 
(CBOs) 
driving 
the 
process, 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
linkages 
with 
formal 
institutions, and 
the 
extent 
to which 
CBOs 
are 
socially inclusive; and 
(iii) 
the 
necessary 
elements 
for 
sustainability 
are: demand-based 
approach, 
articulating priorities 
defined 
by 
the 
people 
themselves 
and 
expressed 
through 
community 
contributions; social 
mobilization 
and 
the organizational capacity 
of 
local 
community 
groups; 
and 
financial viability, 
which 
entails 
significant community 
contributions 
(including 
in 
cash) 
towards 
initial 
capital 
cost 
and, 
whenever possible 
full 
recovery 
of 
operating 
and 
management 
costs. 
Further, 
the 
Bank 
has 
learnt 
that 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
CDD-type initiatives 
is 
enhanced 
by: 
(i) 
creating 
an 
enabling environment 
through 
relevant 
institutional 
and 
policy 
reform, 
including 
linking 
with 
decentralization 
process, 
developing 
sound 
sector 
policies 
and clear 
institutional 
arrangements, 
undertaking institutional 
reform 
and 
promoting 
private 
sector 
involvement 
in 
supply 
of 
goods 
and 
services; 
(ii) 
making 
investments responsive 
to 
informed 
demand 
to 
enable 
communities 
to 
make 
meaningful 
investment 
choices, 
which 
are 
affordable 
to 
them 
so 
that 
they 
can 
contribute 
to 
capital 
and 
recurrent 
costs; 
(iii) 
building 
participatory 
mechanisms 
for 
community control 
and 
stakeholder 
-20- 
Page  27
involvement 
to 
ensure 
ownership 
of 
a subproject and 
sustain outcomes; 
(iv) 
ensuring 
social 
and gender 
inclusion 
through 
understanding 
the 
existing community 
decision 
making 
processes 
and 
the 
often 
complex 
local 
political 
and social 
context; 
(v) 
investing 
in 
capacity 
building 
of 
local 
organizations, 
including 
CBOs 
and 
promoting 
use 
of 
traditional 
knowledge 
and culture-based 
skills; 
(vi) 
facilitating 
community 
access 
to information, 
including 
project 
contents 
and 
rules, 
technical 
information, 
such 
as 
accounting 
and managerial 
skills 
for 
decision 
making 
and 
implementation 
of 
activities; 
(vii) 
developing 
simple 
rules 
and 
strong incentives, supported 
by 
participatory 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
for 
advancing 
CDD 
goals 
of 
accountability, 
transparency and partnerships; 
(viii) 
maintaining 
flexibility 
in 
design 
of 
projects, 
often 
through 
piloting, to 
allow 
systems 
to 
evolve 
and better 
adapt 
to local 
demand and 
capabilities; 
(ix) designing mechanism 
for 
scaling 
up 
of 
successful 
operations 
in 
order 
to 
have greater 
impact 
on 
macro indicators 
of 
poverty; and 
(x) 
investing 
in 
an 
exit 
strategy, such 
as 
building 
local 
capacity 
to 
absorb the 
operating and 
maintenance 
costs 
of 
the 
subprojects, 
by 
encouraging 
savings 
or 
cost 
sharing. 
These 
lessons 
have 
been 
incorporated 
in 
PADEP 
design. 
Finally, 
PADEP 
project 
design 
has 
benefitted 
from 
the experiences 
of 
pilots 
in 
two 
districts, 
Morogoro 
and 
Hai, 
which 
were 
financed 
by 
the 
National 
Agricultural Extension Project 
- 
Phase 
I1 
(IDA 
Credit 
No. 
2899). 
These 
pilots 
showed 
that 
there 
is 
considerable enthusiasm among 
beneficiaries 
and 
district-level staff 
for 
the 
proposed 
approach. 
If 
sufficient 
resources 
are 
allocated 
for 
training 
and 
capacity 
building, 
the 
proposed 
approach 
is 
viable and 
promises 
to 
deliver 
the expected 
results. 
Training 
modules 
for 
PRA 
methodologies, subproject 
preparation 
and 
appraisal, 
financial 
management 
and 
procurement, 
participatory 
M&E, 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
screening, 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
awareness 
will 
be 
developed, 
and 
district 
and 
ward 
staff 
will 
be 
trained. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
The 
need 
for 
it, 
in 
the 
context 
of 
rural 
development 
and 
poverty 
reduction, 
is 
specifically 
recognized 
in 
the 
CAS. 
The 
Government 
has 
set 
up 
a 
unit 
headed 
by 
an 
experienced 
officer 
of 
the 
rank 
of 
Permanent 
Secretary 
to 
prepare 
the 
project. 
The 
project 
was 
prepared 
by 
a 
team 
of 
national 
staff 
and 
consultants. 
The 
Team 
adopted 
a 
highly 
participatory 
process, 
spent 
time 
in 
the 
field 
with 
farmers, 
farmers 
organizations, 
NGOs, 
and 
district 
and 
grassroots 
level 
elected 
officials. 
An 
inter-ministerial 
committee 
with 
representation 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
has 
been 
an 
active 
participant 
in 
project 
preparation. 
Government (central 
and 
local 
level) 
has 
committed many 
high-level 
staff 
from 
several 
ministries 
and 
has 
maintained 
a continuous 
flow 
of 
counterpart 
funding 
to 
complete 
project 
preparation, 
despite 
the 
delays 
due 
to 
the 
re-orientation 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
proposal 
that 
IDA 
should 
support 
the 
project 
came 
from 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
of 
Tanzania. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The Bank 
has 
contributed 
to 
the 
re-orientation 
of 
the 
project, 
from 
one 
focused 
on 
the 
supply 
of 
technology 
and over-reliance 
on 
Governmental 
structures 
for 
service 
delivery 
to 
one 
focused 
on 
the 
demand 
side, 
strengthening 
rural 
communities 
and 
farmer 
groups, 
and developing capacity 
at 
the 
district 
level.  Project 
design 
has 
benefitted 
greatly 
from 
best-practice 
experiences 
in 
community-driven 
approaches 
to 
rural 
development 
from 
other countries 
and 
regions. 
The 
Bank 
brings 
international 
lessons 
and 
experiences 
from 
implementing 
CDD 
projects 
in 
East, 
Central and West 
Africa, 
and 
Latin 
America. 
In 
Africa, 
the 
Bank 
has 
accumulated experience 
in 
launching, 
implementing 
and 
supervising 
subprojects, 
including 
social 
funds-type 
projects 
(TASAF 
and 
MASAF) 
and 
has 
the community-based procurement 
experience. 
The 
experience 
gained 
in 
management 
and channeling 
of 
funds 
through 
block 
grants, against 
development plans prepared 
by 
communities and 
local 
authorities, 
will 
be 
critical 
to 
the 
success 
of 
PADEP. 
-21 
- 
Page  28
The 
Bank 
has 
contributed 
to 
the 
PRSP process 
and 
is 
currently preparing 
PRSC 
to 
support 
the 
Government 
in 
its 
initiatives to 
reduce 
poverty. 
IDA'S 
support 
to 
PADEP 
will 
sustain 
the 
present 
good 
collaboration 
with 
other 
major 
development 
partners 
and make a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
PRSP, 
particularly 
in 
the 
development 
of 
community 
driven 
initiatives 
and 
the 
decentralization 
of 
decision 
making 
and 
service 
delivery. 
In 
addition, 
IDA 
can 
provide continuity 
of 
support 
to 
scale 
up 
PADEP 
operations 
upon 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
first 
phase. 
The 
Bank 
has 
on-going projects 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
(TARP 
11, 
NAEP 
I1 
and 
RBMSIIP) 
and 
in 
other 
sectors 
of 
the 
Tanzanian economy 
that can 
contribute technical 
solutions and 
facilitate 
institutional 
linkages 
with 
line 
ministries. 
For 
example, 
PADEP 
can 
benefit 
from 
efforts 
under 
TARP 
I1 
to 
generate 
improved 
technology, 
from 
NAEP 
I1 
in 
decentralized 
delivery 
of 
extension 
services, 
and 
from 
RBMSIIP 
in 
improved efficiency 
of 
use 
of 
water 
for 
irrigation. 
TASAF 
provides opportunities 
for 
communities 
to 
invest 
in 
subprojects 
that 
improve 
delivery 
of 
services, 
thus 
allowing 
PADEP 
to 
focus 
on 
subprojects 
intended 
to 
improve 
incomes 
directly.

A 
full 
quantitative evaluation 
of 
economic 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
cannot 
be 
easily 
done 
for 
several reasons. 
Benefits 
of 
the 
component 
for 
capacity 
building 
and 
institutional 
strengthening, 
which 
includes 
mainly 
training 
and 
studies, 
are 
difficult 
to quantify 
in 
monetary 
terms. 
The 
investments 
in 
subprojects 
are 
not 
known 
ex 
ante, 
since 
they 
will 
be 
determined 
through 
the 
participatory planning 
processes. 
Benefits 
from 
the 
subprojects 
focusing 
on 
sustainable 
natural 
resource 
management 
and 
environmental conservation 
will 
accrue 
over a 
long 
time 
frame and 
in 
part 
derive 
from 
avoidance 
of 
economic 
loss (due 
to 
degradation) 
that 
is 
hard 
to 
measure. 
In 
view 
of 
these 
problems, 
the 
economic 
analysis 
is 
indicative, rather than 
precise. 
Yet 
because 
the 
project 
is 
intended 
to promote 
growth 
of 
incomes, 
economic analysis 
is 
needed 
even 
if 
it 
cannot 
be 
undertaken 
with 
precision. 
The 
economic analysis 
has 
been 
approached 
in 
three 
ways 
as 
presented 
in 
Annex 
4. 
The 
costs 
and 
benefits 
of 
adopting 
technologies 
of varying 
intensity 
in 
use 
of 
purchased 
inputs 
in 
Tanzania 
have 
been 
assessed 
in 
some 
detail. 
The 
costs 
and 
benefits 
of 
the actual choices 
made 
under 
the 
pilot 
projects 
have 
been 
evaluated 
using 
assumptions 
about 
projected 
benefit 
streams. 
Finally, 
an 
approximate 
sensitivity 
analysis 
has 
been 
undertaken 
to 
suggest 
what 
levels 
of 
income 
growth 
on 
the 
part 
of 
participating 
farmers 
and 
villages 
would 
be 
needed 
to provide 
a 
positive 
net 
present 
value 
to 
the 
project. 
The 
sensitivity 
analysis 
suggests 
that 
participating 
farmers 
and villages should realize 
incremental income 
growth 
of 
about 
1.8 
per 
cent 
annually 
in 
order 
for 
the 
project 
to 
have 
a 
positive 
net 
present value. 
If 
choices 
of 
subprojects 
properly 
incorporate an 
understanding 
of 
the 
economics 
of 
selection 
of 
technologies summarized 
in 
the 
background 
studies, 
incremental 
income 
growth 
of 
1.8 
per 
cent 
annually 
is 
a 
realistic 
expected outcome 
of 
the 
project. The 
project 
can 
therefore 
be 
expected 
to 
show 
a 
positive 
net 
present 
value.

Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
Financial 
analysis 
of 
income-generating subprojects 
will 
be 
carried out 
annually. 
From 
the 
perspective 
of 
the participants, 
the 
financial 
analysis 
will 
differ 
from 
the 
economic 
analysis 
(summarized 
above) 
only 
to 
the 
extent that 
participants 
bear 
a 
portion, 
rather 
than all, 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
subprojects. 
Thus 
financial 
returns 
will 
be 
higher 
than 
economic, 
and 
it 
is 
for 
this 
reason that 
participants 
will 
be 
expected 
to 
save 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
incremental 
earnings 
to 
contribute 
to 
sustainability 
after 
the 
cessation 
of 
the 
grant. 
Information 
on 
the 
profitability 
of 
various subprojects 
will 
be 
made 
available 
to 
future 
participants 
to 
assist 
them 
in 
selection 
of 
subprojects. 
Fiscal Impact: 
Over 
the 
five 
(5) 
year 
period 
of 
implementation, 
the 
project 
will 
have 
only 
a 
minor 
fiscal 
impact 
on 
central 
and 
local 
governments. 
The 
central Government 
is 
expected 
to 
contribute 
only 
about 
US$ 
1.06 
million 
equivalent, 
including 
the 
form 
of 
duties 
and 
taxes, 
estimated at about 
US$ 
0.60 
million. 
The 
rest 
represents 
roughly 
10% 
of 
operating 
costs 
of 
the 
national 
coordination 
and 
facilitation 
unit. 
District 
Councils 
are 
expected 
to 
contribute 
about 
US$ 
0.53 
million 
from 
their 
own 
resources. 
District 
councils 
will 
experience 
modestly 
increased 
revenues 
from 
the 
5% 
cess 
on 
incremental marketed 
output. 
3. 
Technical: 
Technical 
considerations 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
follow: 
Watershed management 
for 
soil 
and water conservation: 
Watershed 
management 
subprojects 
are 
undertaken 
primarily 
for 
environmental 
purposes, 
but 
they 
can 
also 
contribute 
to 
income growth.  The 
linkages 
of 
the 
watershed 
to 
generation 
of 
runoff 
provide 
for 
the 
necessary 
integration 
of 
water 
quantity 
management 
with 
planning 
for 
water 
quality 
and 
control 
of 
erosion 
and 
sedimentation. 
Examples 
of 
watershed 
management 
for 
soil 
and water 
conservation subprojects 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
PADEP may 
include 
construction 
of 
contours, 
prevention 
of 
gullies, 
construction 
of 
terraces, 
agro-forestry, 
and 
others. 
Conservation 
tillage: 
Added 
crop 
residue 
and 
minimal 
tillage 
reduce 
runoff 
of 
soil 
and 
agro-chemicals, 
and 
thereby 
protect 
the 
quality 
of water 
in 
the 
ecosystem. 
Conservation 
tillage 
decreases 
erosion, 
improves 
water 
quality, 
enhances 
retention 
of 
moisture 
in 
the 
soil, 
improves water 
infiltration, 
decreases 
soil 
compaction, 
improves 
tilth, 
enhances 
biological 
activity, 
and 
reduces release 
of 
carbon 
gases. 
Reducing 
and/or 
eliminating tillage 
helps 
increase 
soil 
fertility. 
Examples 
of 
conservation 
tillage 
subprojects that 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
PADEP 
include improved 
fallows, 
use 
of 
cover 
crops, 
use 
of 
farm 
implements 
for 
soil 
and 
water conservation, practices 
to 
control soil 
erosion, 
and 
use 
of 
green 
manure. 
Eficient 
use 
of 
fertilizers: 
Participants can 
use 
resources 
under 
PADEP 
to 
make 
more 
efficient 
use 
of 
fertilizers. 
In 
phosphorus-deficient 
soils, 
Minjingu 
rock 
phosphate 
(MRP) exploited 
from 
Manyara 
Region 
near 
Lake 
Manyara 
is 
as 
effective 
and 
profitable 
as 
imported 
Triple 
Super Phosphate 
(TSP).  Farmers 
are 
applying 
125-250 
kg 
P/Ha 
as 
a 
capital 
investment, and 
expect 
a 
five-year residual 
effect. 
Further, 
nitrogen 
and 
phosphorous 
applied 
in 
combination 
have 
resulted 
in 
significantly 
higher 
yields. 
Other 
subproject 
activities 
that 
may 
be 
supported 
by 
PADEP 
include 
use 
of 
organic manure 
in 
combination 
with 
mineral 
fertilizers and 
production 
and 
use 
of 
bio-fertilizers. 
Local 
research shows 
that 
the 
application 
of 
organic 
manures 
in 
combination 
with 
mineral fertilizer 
has 
given 
higher 
crop 
yield 
increases 
than when 
both 
are 
applied 
separately. These 
kind 
of 
subprojects 
have 
the 
potential 
to 
increase 
- 
23 
- 
Page  30
and 
sustain 
production 
levels, 
enhance 
the 
economic 
potential 
of 
a 
production 
system, 
and counteract and 
minimize 
environmental 
pollution. 
Fuel 
efficient 
technology: 
Biogas 
is 
one 
of 
the 
fuel-efficient 
technologies that 
participants 
may 
choose 
to 
adopt 
with 
support 
of 
PADEP 
resources. 
The 
main 
positive 
impacts 
of 
biogas 
technology 
include: 
(i) 
conservation 
of 
the 
forest 
resource 
as 
a 
result 
of 
decreased 
use 
of 
fuel 
wood (with 
resulting 
increase 
in 
carbon 
sequestration); 
(ii) 
renewable 
energy 
used 
for 
lighting 
and cooking; 
(iii) 
reduced 
workload for 
women 
and 
girls; 
(iv) 
cost savings 
over 
kerosene; 
and 
(v) 
improved 
nutrient 
cycling 
with 
lower 
emissions 
to 
the 
atmosphere. 
Biogas 
technology 
also 
produces 
slurry 
for 
conditioning 
of 
soil. 
Integratedplant nutrition 
techniqueshtrategies 
(IPNS): 
The 
strategy 
optimizes 
all 
aspects 
of 
nutrient 
cycling 
- 
supply, 
uptake, 
and 
loss 
to 
the 
environment 
- 
to improve 
food 
production. 
At 
farm 
level, 
IPNS 
aims 
to optimize 
the 
productivity 
of 
nutrient 
flows 
that 
pass 
through 
the 
farming 
system 
during 
a 
crop rotation. 
This 
means 
application 
of 
external 
plant 
nutrient 
sources 
and 
additives, 
efficient 
processing, 
and 
recycling 
of 
crop 
residues 
and 
on-farm 
organic 
wastes 
to 
minimize 
plant nutrient 
losses. 
In 
the 
process, 
IPNS 
empower farmers 
by 
increasing 
their 
technical 
know-how 
and decision-making 
capacity, and 
promote 
changes 
in 
land 
use, 
crop rotation, 
and 
interactions among 
forestry, 
livestock 
and 
cropping 
systems 
in 
support 
of 
agricultural 
intensification. 
At 
the 
village or farming community 
level, 
IPNS 
take 
into 
account 
plant 
nutrient 
sources 
outside cropped 
areas, 
including 
those 
in 
irrigation 
water 
and 
flood 
sediments, 
livestock 
manure, 
and 
forest 
litter 
and organic 
material 
that 
is 
physically 
transferred 
from 
forest and 
pastures. 
IPNS 
promotes 
rationalization 
in 
the 
transfer 
of 
organic matter and 
plant 
nutrients 
from 
non-cropped 
to 
cropped 
areas, 
and 
the 
mobilization 
of 
unused 
nutrient 
resources. 
It 
also 
saves 
valuable 
nutrient 
sources 
oftenly 
diverted 
as 
domestic 
fuel, 
raw 
materials 
for 
building 
or for 
industrial 
purposes. 
Integratedpest 
management 
(IPM): 
According 
to 
the 
definition 
by 
FAO, 
IPM 
is 
an 
approach 
to 
pest management 
that 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
associated 
environment 
and 
the 
population 
dynamics 
of 
pest 
species, 
utilizes 
all 
suitable techniques and methods 
in 
as 
compatible 
a manner 
as 
possible and maintains 
pest 
population 
at 
levels 
below 
those 
causing 
economically 
unacceptable damage 
or 
loss. 
IPM 
integrates 
multiple 
instruments 
(chemical, 
biological, 
cultural, 
mechanical) 
for 
management 
of 
multiple 
pests 
(insects, 
weeds, 
disease 
pathogens, nematodes, vertebrates, etc). 
IPM 
incorporates 
environmental and 
social 
concerns. 
The 
main 
goals 
of 
IPM 
are 
to 
sustain 
natural 
resources 
over 
the 
long 
term, 
to 
make 
more 
rational 
use 
of 
pesticides, 
to 
reduce 
environmental contamination 
and 
costs, 
to utilize 
natural 
biological 
controls, 
to 
minimize 
pesticides 
resistance 
problems, 
and 
to improve 
safety 
of 
food 
and workers. 
Within 
the 
context 
of 
IPM, 
the 
project 
will 
promote 
and support 
safe 
use 
of 
pesticides 
in 
combinations 
with 
observation, 
preventive 
and 
intervention 
methods 
in 
crops, 
particularly 
vegetable 
and 
fruit 
production. 
Use 
of 
rain 
harvesting 
techniques: 
Rains 
of 
high 
intensity often 
cause 
devastating effects 
on 
the 
environment, 
particularly 
in 
areas 
with 
little 
or 
no 
vegetation. 
Rainwater harvesting 
methods 
can 
help 
to 
reduce 
or 
prevent 
the 
damage 
from 
heavy 
rains. 
Surface catchment 
is 
the 
most effective 
among 
the 
rainwater 
harvesting methods that 
could 
mitigate 
the 
possible 
environmental 
hazards caused 
by 
rain. 
The 
project 
will 
therefore support subprojects that 
aim 
at 
harvesting rainwater 
for 
irrigation, 
domestic 
and 
livestock 
use, 
such 
as 
chaco 
dams 
and 
water 
bunds 
in 
rice 
irrigation. 
Improvement 
of 
traditional 
irrigation 
schemes: 
The 
project 
will 
also 
support 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
weirs, 
irrigation 
canals 
and 
construction 
of 
diversion 
boxes 
to improve 
efficiency 
of 
water 
use 
on 
irrigated 
lands.  One 
of 
the 
major 
causes 
of 
crop 
failure 
and 
low 
productivity 
is 
moisture 
stress. 
By 
supporting 
traditional 
irrigation 
and 
rehabilitating 
drainage structures, 
the 
project 
can 
help 
communities 
to 
address 
this 
problem.  Experience 
shows 
that 
with 
efficient 
irrigation 
scheme 
two 
crops can 
be 
harvested 
on 
the 
same 
piece 
of 
land, 
thus 
increasing 
productivity 
per 
unit 
area. 
In 
addition 
to 
open canal 
- 
24 
- 
Page  31
irrigation, 
other 
types 
of 
systems, 
including 
drip 
and treadle 
pumps, 
will 
be 
supported 
at 
the request 
of 
communities 
and 
groups. 
Processing and 
marketing 
of 
agricultural 
products: 
PADEP 
will 
also, at 
the 
request 
of 
participants, 
support subprojects 
to 
improve 
ago-processing,  such 
as 
small-scale 
milling 
of 
oilseeds, 
rice, 
and 
maize, processing 
of 
cashew 
nuts, 
canning and 
preserving 
of 
fruits 
and 
vegetables, 
and 
processing 
of 
dairy 
products. 
The project 
will 
also support 
the 
establishment 
of 
village marketing 
centers, 
construction 
of 
market 
yards, 
and 
small 
facilities 
for 
storage 
of 
grain. 
Communities and 
farmers groups 
may 
elect 
to 
use 
project 
resources 
to 
enter 
into 
relationships 
of 
contract farming. 
4. 
Institutional: 
Institutional 
capacity 
building 
is 
an 
integral part 
of 
the 
project 
activities 
since the 
project 
will 
be 
implemented 
under 
a 
highly 
decentralized 
settings, 
by 
the 
district 
councils and 
village 
communities. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
region. 
They 
have 
elected 
officials, 
levy 
taxes, 
and 
manage 
communal 
accounts. 
They 
are 
in 
a 
position 
to 
work 
with 
district 
level 
officers 
in 
the 
identification 
of 
problems, 
definition 
of 
priorities, 
and 
implementation 
of 
community 
investment 
subprojects. 
There 
is 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
farmers’ 
groups 
and 
producer and 
financial 
organizations, 
including 
Savings 
and 
Credit 
Societies 
in 
rural 
Tanzania. 
The 
decentralized 
system 
of 
governance 
has 
empowered 
District 
Councils to 
carry out 
planning 
and 
implementation 
of 
their 
developmental 
activities. 
They 
are 
permitted 
to 
generate 
their 
own 
revenue 
by 
levying 
local 
taxes 
within 
limits 
set 
at 
the 
national level. 
Their 
establishment 
costs, 
primarily 
staff 
salaries, 
are 
funded 
by 
the 
Central 
Government 
through 
grants. 
Districts 
are 
expected 
to 
use 
their 
revenues 
to 
meet 
their 
incremental 
recurrent 
costs 
and developmental 
costs. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
both 
increased 
fiscal 
and 
administrative decentralization 
by 
empowering 
district, 
community 
and farmer 
groups 
to 
plan 
developmental activities, 
to 
budget, 
and 
to 
manage 
conditional 
grants. 
Village 
governments 
in 
Tanzania 
are 
among 
the 
best 
organized 
rural 
local 
governments 
in 
the 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
will 
be 
headed 
by 
the 
District 
Executive Director 
(DED), 
and 
will 
include 
the 
District 
Agricultural 
and 
Livestock 
Development 
Officer (DALDO), 
the 
District 
Planning 
Officer 
(DPO),  the Treasurer, 
the 
Community 
Development 
Officer 
(CDO) 
and 
the 
Cooperative and 
Marketing 
Development 
Officer 
(CMDO). 
The 
DMT 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
translating 
the 
project 
concepts 
and 
strategies 
into 
activities 
and 
results. 
They 
will 
be 
responsible 
for motivating 
and 
guiding 
the 
field 
level 
functionaries 
(district 
extension 
services 
and 
NGOs), 
who 
in 
turn 
will 
assist 
the 
farmer 
groups 
to 
access 
the 
services 
financed 
by 
the 
project. 
The 
district 
level 
team, 
including 
representatives 
from 
NGOs, 
farmers’ organizations and 
other 
local 
stakeholders, 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
preparing 
detailed 
work 
plans, 
and 
for 
periodic 
monitoring 
and 
reporting to 
the 
regional 
and 
central authorities. 
Similarly, 
the 
management 
of 
institutional 
strengthening and 
capacity 
building 
programs 
at 
the 
national 
level 
will 
be 
entrusted 
to 
MAFS. 
Project 
management 
will 
be 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
District. 
The 
District 
Management 
Team 
(DMT) 
The 
PCU 
at the 
central 
level 
will 
have 
overall responsibility 
for 
project 
management, 
coordination, 
monitoring, through 
the 
Regional 
Administrative 
Secretaries 
(US) 
in 
the 
country, 
and 
for 
securing 
and/or 
providing 
support 
services 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
A 
Project Coordinator 
will 
serve 
as 
the 
head 
of 
the 
PCU, 
The 
line 
functional responsibility 
will 
be 
delegated 
to 
technical 
experts. 
The

MAFS 
will 
chair 
the 
NPSC 
and 
will 
be 
the 
Accounting 
Officer 
of 
the

receive 
the 
Central 
Government 
budget 
allocation 
for 
the 
project 
under 
his 
or 
her 
ministry’s 
vote 
and 
will 
ensure 
adequate 
implementation 
and 
accountability 
of 
project 
proceeds. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
The 
Tanzania Government 
has 
long 
realized 
the 
importance 
of 
public 
procurement 
to 
the 
economic 
development 
of 
Tanzania 
and 
hence 
to 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
key 
objectives 
within 
the 
national 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy. 
To 
this 
effect, Tanzania 
was one 
of 
the 
first 
countries 
in 
Sub-Saharan 
Africa 
to 
enact 
a 
law 
modeled 
on 
the 
UNCITRAL 
model 
law. 
Since 
1996, 
when 
the 
first 
CPAR 
was 
carried 
out, 
the 
Government 
has 
been 
working 
closely 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
other development 
partners 
to 
enhance 
the 
economy 
and 
efficiency 
of 
its 
procurement 
system 
and 
to 
make 
it 
more 
transparent 
and 
accountable. 
The 
January, 2003 
assessment 
of 
the 
procurement 
system 
in 
Tanzania 
looked 
at 
all 
areas 
of 
public 
procurement 
operations, 
including 
the 
legislative framework, 
the 
performance 
of 
regulatory 
functions, 
the 
enforcement 
regime, 
the 
capacity 
of 
public 
sector 
institutions 
to 
conduct 
procurement, and 
the 
effects 
of 
corruption 
on 
procurement. 
It 
formed 
an 
integral part 
of 
the 
World 
Bank’s activities 
in 
Tanzania 
as 
presented 
in 
the 
Country 
Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) 
of 
2000 
and 
serves 
a 
number 
of 
its 
key 
themes, 
particularly 
higher 
economic 
growth, 
poverty reduction 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
to improve 
governance. 
The 
CPAR’s 
key 
findings 
are 
summarized 
in 
the 
following 
paragraphs. 
Despite 
the 
economic 
benefits 
mentioned 
above, 
procurement 
has 
not 
to 
date 
been 
considered 
to 
be 
a core 
function 
of 
government, 
worthy 
of 
specialized 
staff 
and dedicated 
organizational 
units. 
The 
legal 
framework 
for 
public 
procurement 
in 
Tanzania 
is 
in 
transition. 
While 
some 
very important 
steps 
in 
the 
right 
direction 
have 
been 
taken 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
procurement 
Act 
in 
July 
200 
1, 
there 
remain 
some 
critical 
outstanding 
issues, 
particularly 
concerning 
local 
government procurement, 
access 
to 
complaint 
and 
dissemination 
of 
legal 
texts. 
Overall, 
and compared 
to 
other countries 
in 
the 
region, the 
legal framework 
for 
public 
procurement 
is 
updated and 
adequate. 
The 
Local 
Government procurement 
Regulations 
have 
recently 
been 
issued, 
based 
on 
the 
Procurement 
Act 
of 
2001. 
These 
will 
clear 
the 
legal 
confusion 
and 
contribute 
to reduction 
of 
malpractices 
in 
local 
government procurement 
system. 
Currently, 
aggrieved 
bidders 
have 
very 
limited 
access 
to 
a 
complaints 
mechanism. 
The 
Bank 
has 
recommended 
to 
the Government that a 
credible complaints mechanism should 
be 
introduced 
by 
strengthening 
the 
complaints 
handling 
ability 
of 
the 
Regulatory 
Body 
and 
establishing 
the 
Public 
Appeals 
Authority, 
already entrenched 
in 
the 
legislation, 
to 
provide 
a 
functioning 
avenue 
of 
complaints 
for 
bidders. 
The 
single 
most 
important 
issue 
on 
the 
legal framework 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
dissemination and proper 
application 
of 
the 
rules. 
After 
a 
period 
of 
carving out 
the 
new 
rules, 
the 
country 
is 
now 
focusing 
on 
making 
those 
rules 
work, 
by 
developing 
enforcement 
mechanisms. 
The 
knowledge 
of 
procurement 
rules 
and capacity 
to 
apply 
these 
rules 
is 
very 
poor 
in 
most 
of 
the 
procuring 
entities.  Procurement audits 
are 
seldom 
performed 
and 
the 
consequences 
for 
breach 
of 
procurement 
rules, 
outside 
corruption 
cases, 
are 
minimal. 
As 
a 
consequence 
hereof, enforcement 
of 
the 
procurement 
rules 
suffers 
and 
malpractices 
in 
direct 
conflict 
with 
existing 
rules 
are 
allowed 
to 
flourish. 
Securing 
bidders 
and the 
public 
access 
to 
information 
is 
one 
of 
the 
cornerstones 
of 
sound 
procurement 
practices. 
Procuring 
entities 
are 
presently 
utilizing 
a 
number 
of 
different 
media 
for 
advertising 
procurement 
opportunities, 
making 
access 
to 
information 
and 
enforcement 
of 
the 
rules 
on 
advertisement 
difficult. 
The 
Bank 
has 
recommended 
to 
the 
Government 
that a 
central 
media 
for 
publication 
of 
procurement 
information, 
a Procurement 
Journal, 
should 
be 
established, 
supplemented 
with 
an 
Internet 
information 
site.

At 
present, 
the 
Central 
Tender 
Board 
(CTB) 
holds 
both 
executive and 
regulatory 
powers, 
which 
contributes 
to 
an 
unstable 
situation 
where 
the 
CTB 
on 
one 
hand 
participates 
in 
the 
procurement 
procedure 
and 
on 
the other 
hand 
monitors 
the 
same 
procedures. 
The 
executive 
role 
of 
the 
CTB 
also leads 
to 
lack 
of 
accountability 
and 
responsibility 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
ministerial 
tender 
boards and 
the 
ministerial 
Accounting 
Officers, 
who 
are 
otherwise responsible 
for 
the 
budget 
but 
not 
for 
procurement 
under 
that 
body. 
Due 
to 
the 
broad 
procurement 
issues 
raised 
above 
and capacity 
assessment 
carried out 
for 
the 
MAFS, 
the 
project’s 
procurement 
risk 
is 
rated 
as 
“high”. 
The project, 
however, 
is 
addressing 
these 
issues 
by 
implementing 
the 
following 
strategies: 
(i) 
building 
the 
capacity 
of 
Ministerial 
Tender 
Board 
(MTB) 
secretariat 
staff 
to 
handle procurement 
of 
goods, 
works 
and consultants 
using 
IDA 
procurement 
procedures; 
(ii) 
recruiting 
a 
Procurement Specialist 
with 
qualifications and 
experience 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank to 
work 
in 
the 
PCU 
for 
a 
period 
of 
least 
two 
years, 
who 
besides 
carrying out 
procurement 
responsibilities, 
shall 
also 
conduct on-the-job 
training to 
Supplies 
Officers 
at 
MAFS 
and 
in 
the 
district 
councils; and 
(iii) 
use 
of 
the Procurement 
Manual 
that 
meets 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
Bank 
Guidelines, 
the 
Public 
Procurement 
Act 
(2001), 
the 
Local 
Government Procurement 
regulations 
and 
Community-based 
Procurement. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
Country Financial 
Assessment 
Review 
(CFAA) 
completed 
in 
May 
2001, 
identified 
a 
number 
of 
weaknesses 
that 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
to 
enhance 
public 
financial 
management. 
Major 
fiduciary 
weaknesses 
identified 
include: 
(i) 
non-compliance 
to 
fiduciary 
requirements; 
(ii) 
inadequate 
human 
resource 
capacities; 
(iii) 
inadequate 
budgetary 
processes 
and 
monitoring; 
and 
(iv) 
inadequate 
public 
sector accounting, 
reporting 
and 
auditing 
systems. 
The 
government 
has 
agreed 
to 
address 
these 
weaknesses 
through 
implementation 
of 
the 
revised 
Public Financial 
Management 
Reform 
Program 
(PFMRP), 
which 
is 
supported 
by 
several 
bilateral 
donors, 
beginning 
FY04. 
The 
revised 
PFMRP 
will 
be 
a 
roadmap 
to 
built 
an 
effective 
and 
sustainable 
financial 
accountability 
framework 
in 
the 
public 
sector, 
by 
strengthening government accounting, 
reporting, 
auditing 
and 
accountability 
systems. 
In 
the 
recent 
years, 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
public 
sector 
accounting and 
reporting 
system 
has 
been 
achieved. 
Most 
notably, 
the government 
has 
put 
in 
place 
a 
sound 
financial 
management 
system, 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
computerized Integrated 
Financial 
Management System (IFMS),  and 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
new Public 
Finance 
Act 
No. 
6 
of 
2001, 
and 
the 
Public 
Procurement 
Act 
No. 
3 
of 
2001. 
For 
the 
first 
time 
the 
annual 
public 
accounts 
of 
the government 
have 
been 
produced 
within 
the 
statutory 
period. 
In 
addition, 
the 
government 
has 
undertaken 
a 
number 
of 
actions 
to 
strengthen the 
accounting 
and 
financial reporting 
fbction 
within 
Ministries, 
Departments and Agencies 
(MDAs). 
These 
include: 
(i) 
finalization 
of 
an 
operation and accounting 
procedures 
manuals; 
(ii) 
implementing 
measures 
to 
control 
all 
commitments 
at 
central 
government 
level, 
including 
non-Local 
Purchasing 
Order (LPO) 
commitments; 
(iii) 
Accounting Officers 
(AOs) have 
signed letters 
of 
appointment 
and 
have 
received 
training 
in 
their 
role 
and responsibilities according 
to 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Act; 
(iv) 
AOs 
have 
now 
direct 
access 
to 
IFMS; 
and 
(v) 
Audit 
Committees 
have 
been 
established 
in 
all 
MDAs.

The 
Local 
Government 
Reform 
Program 
(LGRP) 
Progress 
report 
for 
the 
period 
of 
July to 
December 
2002, 
indicates that 
some 
steps 
have 
been undertaken 
to 
strengthen the 
Local 
Government 
financial 
management 
systems. 
These 
include: 
(i) 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
capacity 
in 
all 
districts 
Local 
Government 
Authorities 
(LGAs); 
(ii) 
the 
use 
of 
new 
guidelines 
for 
preparation 
of 
development plans 
and 
budgets; 
and 
(iii) 
use 
of 
new 
chart 
of 
accounts 
under 
the 
Government 
Financial 
Statistics 
(GFS) codes 
by 
all 
LGAs. 
To 
address 
financial 
management 
issues, 
a 
framework 
for 
the 
project’s 
financial 
management 
system 
has 
been 
developed, 
with 
assistance 
from 
the 
Bank. 
The 
framework 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
Central 
Government’s 
Integrated 
Financial 
Management System 
(IFMS) 
and 
has 
the 
capacity 
to 
prepare 
Annual 
Budgets, 
FMR 
and 
Financial 
Statements. 
Based 
on 
the 
framework, 
consultants 
engaged 
under 
the 
PPF 
have 
designed 
the 
detailed 
procedures 
and 
systems, 
and 
will 
be 
completed 
prior 
to 
credit 
effectiveness. 
The 
computerization 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
system 
is 
planned 
to 
be 
carried 
out before 
the 
second 
year 
of 
the 
project.

The project 
does 
not 
present 
major 
environmental 
or 
social 
issues, 
and 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
a 
positive 
environmental and 
social 
impact. 
Environmental 
and social 
management 
will 
be 
an 
important 
contributor 
to 
success 
of 
the 
community 
subprojects 
under 
Component

Therefore, 
PADEP 
will 
ensure 
that 
the 
World 
Bank 
environmental and 
social 
safeguard 
polices 
are 
adhered to. 
The 
safeguard 
policies 
that 
are 
triggered 
by 
the 
proposed 
PADEP 
project 
are: 
OP/BP 
4.01

Involuntary 
Resettlement, 
OP 
4.36

and 
OP 
7.50 
Projects 
on 
International 
Waterways. 
Since 
the 
subprojects 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
PADEP 
are 
small 
and 
because 
rural 
people 
will 
be 
the 
drivers 
of 
the 
subprojects, 
the 
process 
of 
environmental 
and 
social

has 
been 
made 
simple 
and 
informative.

at 
the 
stage 
of

on 
the

and 
which 
groups 
were consulted? 
prepared 
an environmental 
and 
social framework 
and a 
resettlement 
policy 
framework to 
facilitate 
the 
discussions 
between 
district 
teams 
and communitiesifarmers' 
groups. 
The 
implementing 
agencies (PCU, 
districts councils 
and 
communities/farmer 
groups) 
shall 
be 
required 
to 
consult 
subprojects-affected 
groups and 
local 
nongovernmental 
organizations 
(NGOs)  about 
the 
subproject's 
environmental 
aspects 
and shall 
take 
their 
views 
into 
account. 
Under 
the 
PADEP 
implementation 
procedures, 
public 
consultation 
will 
begin 
with 
the 
PRA on 
environmental 
issues 
in 
the 
communities. 
PADEP 
shall 
consult 
affected 
groups 
at 
least 
twice:  shortly after environmental 
screening and 
before 
the 
terms 
of 
reference 
for 
the 
EA 
are 
finalized; 
and 
once 
a 
draft 
EA 
report 
is 
prepared. 
In 
addition, 
the 
PADEP 
will 
consult 
with 
such 
groups 
throughout 
project 
implementation 
as 
necessary 
to 
address 
EA-related 
issues 
that 
affect 
them. 
Since 
the 
subprojects 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
PADEP 
are 
not 
known 
ex 
ante 
the Government 
has 
During 
the 
PRA, 
the 
subproject 
will 
be 
defined 
and, 
through 
the 
screening 
process, 
its 
associated 
potential 
environmental 
impacts 
and 
category 
of 
the 
EA 
will 
be 
determined. 
During 
the 
subsequent 
scoping 
stages, 
if 
the 
project 
will 
be 
classified 
as 
category 
B, 
another 
public 
consultation 
will 
be 
held 
with 
the 
communities affected 
by 
the 
proposed subproject. 
Involvement 
of 
the 
public 
will 
continue 
throughout 
the 
EA 
process, 
using 
the 
community 
and farmer 
group 
subcommittees and 
village 
and 
community 
leaders.  Once 
the 
draft 
EA 
report 
has 
been 
prepared, another 
consultation 
involving 
as 
many 
community 
members 
as 
possible, 
will 
be 
held 
to 
review 
the 
findings 
and recommendations 
of 
the 
draft 
EA 
report. Comments and observations 
shall be incorporated 
into 
the 
final 
EA 
report 
and 
the 
resulting 
ESMP 
report. 
Public 
understanding about 
the 
proposed 
subprojects 
and 
their 
possible environmental 
and social 
impacts 
will 
be 
key 
to 
their 
successful 
implementation. 
These 
environmental 
and 
social 
issues 
shall 
therefore 
be 
fully 
covered 
in 
the 
participatory 
assessment 
leading 
up 
to 
selection 
of 
the 
proposed 
subprojects, 
and 
in 
subsequent 
design. 
The 
District 
Facilitation Team 
(DFT), 
through 
the 
capacity 
building 
program 
shall 
be 
fully 
prepared 
to lead 
public 
discussion 
of 
environmental 
and 
social 
issues. 
In 
order 
to 
raise 
awareness 
of 
communities 
about 
the 
potential 
environmental 
and 
social 
impacts 
of 
PADEP 
funded 
activities, a 
number 
of 
sensitization 
meetings 
will 
be 
held. 
These 
will 
include meeting 
with 
village 
leaders, 
village 
assemblies, 
workshops 
to 
launch implementation 
of 
mitigation 
plans 
and 
seminars 
to 
discuss 
various 
environmental and 
social 
assessment themes. 
PADEP 
will 
design 
communication 
strategy 
to 
enhance 
consultations. 
This 
will 
include 
the 
right 
choices 
of 
the 
agenda 
of 
meetings, 
launching 
workshops and 
seminars, 
media 
for 
message 
delivery; 
cultural 
considerations; 
and 
publicity 
or 
advocacy 
activities. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have 
been 
established 
to monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
Environmental 
monitoring 
has 
been 
designed 
to 
ensure 
that 
mitigation 
measures 
are 
implemented. 
Each 
EMP 
will 
demonstrate 
how 
identified 
impacts 
are 
matched 
with 
mitigation 
measures 
and monitoring 
plans. 
The 
monitoring plan 
will 
use 
the 
findings 
of 
existing 
baseline 
data, 
or 
the 
recommendations 
for 
new 
baseline 
data 
to 
fill 
gaps, 
as 
the 
means 
to 
measure 
the 
progress 
and 
problems 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
GOT 
and 
WB 
Safeguard 
Policies. 
An 
effective 
monitoring 
plan 
will 
consist 
of 
the 
following 
elements: 
monitoring 
objectives; 
description 
of 
performance 
indicators that 
provide 
linkages 
to 
impacts and 
mitigation 
measures

in 
EA; 
description

parameters 
to 
be 
measured, 
methods

Page  37
to 
be 
employed, 
sampling 
locations, frequency 
of 
measurements, 
detection 
limits 
(where 
appropriate) 
and 
definition 
of 
thresholds that 
will 
signal 
the 
need 
for 
remedial 
actions; 
institutional 
responsibilities, 
timing 
and timetable 
for 
monitoring; reporting 
arrangements (to 
the 
NEMC 
and 
the 
Bank); 
and 
cost 
and 
financing 
provisions. 
Environmental 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
will 
be 
incorporated 
in 
all 
PADEP 
supported 
subprojects.  Because 
PADEP 
subprojects 
are 
small and most 
of 
them 
will 
be 
simple, the 
beneficiary-led environmental 
monitoring 
will 
be 
used 
and 
will 
focus 
on 
a 
small 
number 
of 
key 
indicators 
that can 
be 
easily 
measured 
by 
members 
of 
the 
community.

key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and specify 
the

development 
outcomes. 
Assessment. 
PADEP 
will 
strengthen farmers' 
groups and organizations 
through capacity 
building 
and 
establishment 
of 
community 
subprojects' committees. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
improve 
gender 
awareness 
and 
balance 
through 
establishment 
of 
women 
groups 
and mandatory 
inclusion 
of 
women 
in 
the 
leadership 
of 
committees 
of 
the 
subprojects, 
either 
as 
chairperson 
or 
secretary. 
Women 
and 
youth 
will 
undertake 
various 
socioeconomic development 
activities 
in 
the 
villages. 
Participatory 
approaches 
to 
identification, 
planning, implementation 
and 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
subprojects 
will 
increase 
social 
cohesion. 
There 
will 
be 
no 
involuntary 
resettlement 
caused 
by 
PADEP 
operations, 
but 
because 
subprojects 
may 
entail 
changes 
in 
land 
use, 
a 
resettlement 
policy 
framework 
has 
been 
drawn 
up. 
The 
social 
assessment 
will 
be 
carried out 
as 
part 
of 
the

How 
does 
the 
project

consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs or 
other 
civil

organizations? 
Tanzania 
Development 
Research 
Group 
(TADREG) 
conducted 
a comprehensive 
review 
of 
the 
project 
and 
held 
a 
workshop 
to 
discuss 
the 
findings 
and 
forwarded their 
recommendations 
to 
PADEPIMAFS. 
The 
workshop 
was attended 
by 
people 
from 
academia, 
NGOs, 
CBOs, 
the 
private 
sector, 
government and 
donor 
agencies 
and 
was 
funded 
by 
a 
consortium 
of bilateral

What institutional 
arrangements have 
been 
provided to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
and evaluation 
of 
subprojects; together 
with 
proactive 
inclusion 
of 
women 
and 
young 
people, 
will 
assure 
that 
the 
subprojects 
meet 
their 
social 
objectives. 
This 
demand-driven approach 
to 
identification 
and 
implementation 
of 
agricultural 
development 
subprojects, 
coupled 
with

Safeguard 
Policies: 
7.2 
Describe 
provisions 
made 
by 
the 
project 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
safeguard 
policies. 
An 
Environmental 
and Social 
Framework 
(ESF) 
and 
a 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
(RPF) 
have 
been 
prepared and 
disclosed 
in 
Tanzania 
mainland, 
to 
address 
the safeguard issues 
noted 
above. 
Subproject-specific 
Pest 
Management 
Plans 
(PMP) 
based 
on 
Integrated 
Pest 
Management's 
(IPM) 
will 
be 
prepared 
as 
part 
of 
Environmental 
and Social 
Management 
Framework 
to 
be 
implemented 
under 
the 
respective subproject. 
In 
addition, relevant riparians 
have 
been 
notified 
of 
the 
potential small 
scale 
irrigation 
subprojects 
on 
intemational 
waters. 
The 
project 
will 
not 
finance subprojects 
which 
will 
involve significant 
conversion 
or 
degradation 
of 
natural 
forests 
or 
related 
critical 
habitats. 
Due 
to 
the 
Borrowers

not 
been 
prepared and disclosed 
for 
this 
component. 
Actions 
needed 
to 
prepare and disclose Safeguard 
documents 
in 
Zanzibar 
will 
be 
discussed 
during 
Credit 
Negotiations.  Disclosure 
of 
Safeguard documents 
will 
be 
a 
condition

for 
the 
Zanzibar component. 
F. 
Sustainability 
and 
Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
Institutional 
sustainability 
- 
Institutional 
sustainability 
will 
derive 
from 
capacity 
building 
and 
local 
ownership 
of 
the 
subprojects. 
PADEP 
implementation 
arrangements 
are 
built 
into 
the 
structures 
of 
local 
government 
(district 
councils) 
and 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
on-going 
Local 
Government 
Reform 
Program 
(LGRP), 
which 
is 
also 
supported 
by 
IDA. 
Financial 
sustainability 
- 
Financial 
sustainability 
will 
derive 
from 
the 
stream 
of 
eamings 
generated 
by 
the 
subprojects, 
either 
in 
cash 
or 
in 
kind. 
The 
project 
design 
has 
built 
in 
incentives 
for 
savings 
by 
farmers' 
groups. 
This 
mandatory saving 
in 
a group's 
bank 
account 
of 
a 
certain 
portion 
of 
the 
revenue 
generated, 
to 
finance purchased 
inputs 
for 
the 
next farming 
season, 
will 
enable 
households 
to 
sustain 
adopted 
new 
technologies 
beyond 
the 
project 
life. 
Some 
of 
the 
subprojects, such 
as 
dip 
facilities, 
may 
charge 
"user 
fees" 
and 
deposit 
these 
in 
the 
operations 
and 
maintenance 
(O&M) 
account. 
For

irrigation 
subprojects, 
the 
standard 
procedure 
is 
for 
each 
participating 
household 
to 
contribute, 
on 
annual 
basis 
a 
certain 
agreed 
amount 
of 
cash 
to 
cover 
the 
O&M 
costs. 
It 
is 
estimated that 
on 
average, 
80% 
of 
district 
council's 
own 
generated revenue comes 
from 
the 
agricultural 
sector, 
particularly 
crop 
and 
livestock 
marketing 
cess 
andor 
levy. 
Increased 
production brought 
about 
by 
PADEP 
supported 
subprojects 
will 
modestly 
boost 
district 
councils' 
revenues. 
Environmental and social sustainability 
- 
The 
PADEP 
design 
has 
integrated environmental 
appraisal, 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
as 
part 
of 
the 
subproject 
cycle 
management. 
This 
will 
enable 
participating 
districts, 
communities and 
farmers' groups 
to 
assess 
environmental 
risks 
and 
address 
them 
in 
a 
timely 
and 
practical 
manner. 
The 
EMP 
will 
be 
prepared 
for 
each 
subproject 
as 
part 
of 
the appraisal 
process. 
PADEP 
will 
build 
the 
capacity 
of 
MAFS' 
environmental 
unit 
and 
district 
staff 
to 
carry 
out environmental 
assessment 
and 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
of 
subprojects. 
Guidelines 
for 
environmental 
and social 
assessment 
will 
be 
translated 
into Kiswahili 
and 
distributed 
to 
all 
participating 
districts and 
rural 
communitieshillages. 
Sustainability ofprovision 
of 
services 
- 
Success 
here 
depends 
on 
the 
level 
of 
decentralization 
and 
involvement 
of 
the 
private 
sector, 
NGO 
and 
civil 
society 
in 
delivery 
of 
services. 
Capacity 
building 
for 
district 
councils 
will 
improve 
service 
delivery 
on 
a 
sustainable basis. 
Regarding 
decentralization, 
the 
GOT 
is 
committed to fiscal 
and administrative 
devolution 
to 
district 
councils, 
which 
are 
closer to 
the 
communities. 
District 
councils 
are 
now 
responsible 
for providing public 
extension 
services, alongside 
private 
and 
NGO 
providers.  Other technical 
services, such 
as 
veterinary 
drugs 
and 
care, 
importation 
and 
distribution 
of 
agricultural 
inputs, 
design 
of 
irrigation 
systems, 
and agro-mechanization 
are 
mainly 
provided 
by 
the 
private 
sector. 
Increased 
demand 
for 
services 
provided 
by 
the 
private 
sector 
will 
facilitate 
more 
sustainable 
supply.

Possible 
Controversial 
Aspects: 
The 
use 
of 
matching 
grants 
for 
adoption 
of 
technology 
was 
initially 
considered controversial, 
because 
the 
grant 
was 
misunderstood 
to 
be 
a 
subsidy 
for 
fertilizer. 
After 
extensive 
consultation 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
grant 
is 
better 
understood, 
and 
the 
concept 
is 
now 
widely 
supported. 
In 
short, 
the 
matching 
grants 
are 
provided 
to 
(i) 
introduce 
new 
technologies; 
(ii) 
share 
the 
risk 
of 
innovation; 
(iii) 
jump 
start 
a 
demonstration effect; and 
(iv) 
strengthen 
farmer group organizations.

The 
following 
items 
are

and 
are 
discussed 
under 
loan 
conditions 
(Section 
G): 
The 
preparations 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
in 
the 
eight 
(Year 
1) 
districts 
- 
Hai, 
Morogoro, 
Singida, Hanang, 
Arumeru, 
Iringa, Masasi 
and Nachingwea, 
were 
initiated 
in 
May 
2002, 
using 
PPF 
resources. 
A 
workshop 
was 
held 
to 
discuss 
the 
project 
concept, 
and 
the 
Guidelines 
for 
the 
Preparation and 
Implementation 
of 
Subprojects 
with 
District 
Management 
Teams 
(DMT), 
each 
led 
by 
its 
District 
Executive Director. 
After 
the 
workshop, 
two 
districts 
(Hai 
and 
Morogoro 
Rural) 
were 
chosen 
to 
pilot 
project 
activities, 
each 
in 
two 
villages. 
In 
November 
2002, 
the 
eight 
districts 
were 
asked 
to 
prepare 
district project 
plans, 
which 
are 
incorporated 
in 
their 
respective 
District Agricultural 
Development 
Plans 
(DADP’s), 
and 
form 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
overall 
District 
Development 
Plan 
(DDP). 
The 
DADP 
for 
Hai 
District, 
which 
includes 
PADEP 
subprojects was 
reviewed 
at appraisal 
and 
found 
to 
be 
satisfactory. 
The 
preparations 
for 
implementation, 
particularly 
in 
terms 
of 
District 
Capacity 
Building 
activities 
in 
the 
eight districts 
(Year 
1) 
will 
take 
place 
in 
April 
- 
June 2003 
period. 
Activities 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
will 
include: 
(i) 
review 
of 
District Agricultural 
Development 
Plan to 
ensure 
that 
PADEP 
activities 
are 
included 
and 
assess 
areas 
of 
support 
in 
improving 
the 
DADP’s; 
(ii) 
complete 
Districts 
Needs 
Assessment 
to 
gain 
an 
understanding 
of 
each 
district’s 
readiness 
for 
project 
implementation; 
(iii) 
develop

members, 
who 
will 
become 
trainers 
of 
the 
DMT,

and 
WFT 
in 
the 
participating 
districts. 
The 
decision 
to include 
Zanzibar 
came late, 
the 
Government 
of 
Zanzibar (GOZ),  however, 
has

submitted 
all 
the 
relevant 
project 
documents. 
The 
Zanzibar 
component 
design 
and 
implementation 
arrangements 
mirror 
those 
of 
the 
mainland. 
A 
preliminary review 
of 
project 
documents 
and 
discussion 
with 
the 
Zanzibar 
component 
preparation team 
on 
matters 
related 
to 
the 
implementation 
arrangements 
were 
done 
at 
appraisal. 
The 
Bank 
will 
complete 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
Zanzibar's readiness 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
project 
(US$ 
3.5 
million 
out 
of 
total 
IDA 
support 
of 
US$ 
56.58 
million) 
by 
March, 
2004. 
So 
far, 
broad 
agreement 
has 
been 
reached 
with GOT 
and 
GOZ 
on 
the 
institutional 
and implementation 
arrangements, 
and 
these 
will 
be 
reflected 
in 
the 
Development Credit 
Agreement 
(DCA).

Due

Borrower's late 
request 
to 
include 
a Zanzibar 
component, 
an 
ESMF 
and RPF 
have 
not 
been 
prepared and 
disclosed. 
Actions 
needed 
to 
prepare 
and 
disclose Safeguard documents 
in 
Zanzibar 
will 
be 
discussed 
during

negotiations. 
Disclosure 
of 
Safeguard documents 
will

of 
disbursement 
for 
the 
Zanzibar component.

documentation 
and 
working 
papers 
which 
describe 
each 
project 
component 
in 
greater 
detail, 
and 
which 
comprise 
part 
of 
the 
Project Implementation 
Plan 
(PIP). 
Project 
costs 
include 
IDA 
and 
counterpart 
financing 
from 
central and 
local 
governments, 
as 
well 
as 
beneficiaries 
and 
all 
contingencies. 
By 
Component: 
Project Component 
1 
- 
US$50.51 
million 
Community 
Agricultural 
DeveloDment 
Subproiects 
This 
component 
will 
assist 
the 
government 
to provide matching 
grants 
to 
communities and 
farmers’ groups 
to 
finance 
agricultural 
development subprojects 
selected 
through 
PRA 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
Village 
Councils. 
Under 
this 
component, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
both 
Community 
Investment 
Subprojects 
(CIS) 
and Farmer 
Groups 
Investment 
Subprojects 
(FGIS). 
The 
project 
will 
support at least 
one 
community 
subproject and 
at 
least 
four 
farmers’ 
groups subprojects 
in 
each 
of 
the 
participating 
villages. 
It 
is 
projected 
that 
over 
a five-year 
period 
the 
project 
will 
finance a 
total 
of 
about 840 
community 
subprojects 
and 
at 
least 
3,360 
farmers’ groups 
subprojects, 
including 
in 
Zanzibar; about 
26 
districts 
in 
the 
mainland, 
plus 
the 
Pemba 
and 
Unguja 
islands 
in 
Zanzibar 
are 
expected 
to 
participate 
under 
this 
project, 
with 
a 
maximum 
of 
30 
village 
from 
each 
district. 
This 
projection 
is 
based 
on 
the 
number 
of 
districts and villages 
expected 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
project 
in 
each year 
of 
implementation. 
A 
subproject 
will 
by 
design, 
be 
simple 
to 
enable 
the 
community 
or 
farmer group 
to 
participate 
in 
its 
implementation 
and 
subsequent maintenance. 
An 
individual 
subproject 
will 
be 
supported 
for 
one 
to 
three 
years, 
depending 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
activities. 
All 
subprojects 
will 
be 
location-specific. 
(i) 
Farmer 
Group Investment 
Subprojects 
(US% 
16.11 
million) 
The 
project 
support 
for 
a 
farmer group investment 
subproject 
(FGIS) 
will 
be 
in 
the 
form 
of 
matching 
grants. 
The 
project 
will 
contribute 
50% 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
consumable 
agricultural 
inputs 
(seeds, 
fertilizers 
and 
agro-chemicals) 
up 
to 
approximately 
US$25 
equivalent 
per 
household 
for 
two 
farming 
seasons 
(for 
a 
maximum 
of 
two 
years) 
or 
80% 
of 
costs 
for 
technological innovations 
other 
than 
consumable 
agricultural 
inputs. 
The 
maximum 
amount 
of 
grant 
for FGIS 
per 
village 
will 
be 
US$ 
8,000 
equivalent. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
contribute 
100% 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
up 
to 
a 
maximum 
of 
US$ 
3,000. 
Beneficiaries 
will 
be 
required 
to 
contribute 
the 
remaining 
50% 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
consumable 
inputs 
by 
depositing 
cash 
into 
their 
group’s 
bank 
account and 
or 
20% 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
technological innovations. 
The 
total 
cost 
for 
CIS 
for 
the 
five 
year 
period 
is 
estimated at 
US$ 
14.82 
million 
in 
Tanzania 
mainland 
and 
US$ 
1.29 
million 
for 
Zanzibar 
component. 
(ii) 
Community Investment 
Subproject 
(US$34.40 
million) 
The 
financing 
of 
this 
type 
of 
subprojects 
will 
also 
be 
in 
the 
form 
of 
matching 
grants. 
The 
grant 
for 
a 
community 
investment 
subproject 
will 
be 
used 
to 
finance 
materials, 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
(capacity 
building 
and 
community 
empowerment). 
Beneficiaries 
will 
contribute 
at least 
20% 
of 
the 
total 
subproject 
costs 
(in 
terms 
of 
labor, 
materials 
or 
in 
cash) 
and 
the 
project 
will 
contribute 
80% 
as 
a 
matching 
grant 
up 
to 
a 
maximum 
of 
US$ 
30,000 
equivalent 
per 
community 
subproject. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
contribute 
100% 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
up 
to 
a 
maximum 
of 
US$ 
-43-

The 
total 
cost 
for 
CIS 
for 
the 
five 
year 
period 
is 
estimated 
at 
US$ 
3 
1.98

Institutional 
Strengthening and 
Capacity 
Building 
Under 
this 
component, 
the 
PCUs 
for 
Tanzania 
mainland 
and Zanzibar, together 
with 
the 
MAFS 
and 
MANREC 
at 
the 
national 
level, and 
the 
District 
Councils 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
will 
be 
strengthened 
to 
enable 
them 
provide 
adequate 
support 
to 
implementing 
agencies 
in 
matters 
related 
to 
policy, institutional 
and 
regulatory 
functions. 
(i) 
District 
Level 
Institutional 
Strengthening 
and 
Capacity 
Building 
(US$5.78 
million) 
For 
each 
participating 
district, 
the 
project 
will 
finance 
district 
capacity 
building 
program 
activities. 
The 
program 
will 
be 
based 
on 
the 
district's 
needs 
assessment 
for 
capacity 
building 
to 
support 
planning, implementation, 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
of 
participatory community agricultural 
development interventions. 
The 
support 
will 
provide 
for 
the 
development and 
institutionalization 
of 
District 
Project 
Plans 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
District Agricultural 
Development 
Plans (DADPs), 
based 
on 
broad 
agricultural 
sector strategies 
and 
its 
framework 
for 
implementation 
to 
achieve sectoral 
objectives and 
targets 
at 
the 
district 
level. 
Participating 
district 
will 
be 
required 
to 
form 
District Facilitation 
Teams 
(DFT) 
for 
PADEP, 
comprising, 
among 
others, 
the 
agricultural 
and 
livestock 
development 
officer, 
the 
community 
development 
officer, 
the 
cooperative 
and 
marketing officer, 
the 
planning 
officer 
and 
the 
district 
treasurer. 
The 
DFT 
staff 
will 
be 
trained 
to 
gain 
skills 
in 
participatory 
preparation and 
appraisal 
of 
subprojects, 
establishment 
of 
public-private 
sector partnerships, 
basic 
financial 
management, 
project 
preparation, 
procurement 
procedures, 
environmental 
and 
social impact 
assessment, 
farmer-research-extension-market 
linkages, 
basic computer 
skills 
and 
others 
as 
need 
may 
arise. 
District 
capacity 
building 
program 
will 
also 
support 
incremental 
costs 
due 
to 
PADEP 
implementation, 
such 
as 
PRA 
process 
and supervision 
of 
subprojects 
by 
the 
district 
staff. 
In 
addition, 
districts 
will 
be 
supported 
to 
acquire 
office 
equipment 
and vehicles. 
The project 
will 
also 
complement 
government's 
efforts 
toward 
sensitization 
of 
communities 
in 
addressing 
issues 
of 
HIVIAIDS. 
The 
specific 
type 
and 
quantities 
of 
working 
tools 
and 
form 
of 
training 
required, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
number 
of 
participants 
will 
be 
determined 
by 
the 
participating 
district, through 
their 
needs 
assessment. 
The project 
will 
only 
finance short-term 
training 
that 
does 
not 
exceed 
3 
months. 
A 
total 
of 
eight 
mainland 
DFTs 
will 
be 
fully 
trained 
by 
September 
2003, 
in 
preparation 
for 
subprojects 
implementation 
in 
FY 
2003104. 
During 
FY 
2003/04, 
two 
DFTs 
in 
Zanzibar 
will 
be 
trained 
in 
preparation 
for 
subprojects 
implementation 
in 
year 
2004105. 
Similarly, 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
FY 
2003104, 
another 
batch 
of 
eight 
districts 
will 
be 
brought under 
capacity 
building 
program 
and 
start 
implementation 
of 
subprojects 
in 
year 
2004105. 
In 
FY 
2004/05, 
a 
total 
of 
16 
participating 
districts 
in 
the 
mainland 
and 
two 
in 
Zanzibar 
will 
be 
implementing 
the 
project. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
10 
more 
districts 
in 
the 
mainland 
and 
four 
in 
Zanzibar 
will 
initiate 
capacity 
building 
activities. 
In 
FY 
2005106, 
a 
total 
of 
26 
districts 
in 
the 
mainland 
and 
six 
in 
Zanzibar 
will 
be 
implementing 
the 
project. 
The 
final 
three 
district 
in 
Zanzibar 
will 
receive 
training 
in 
FY 
2005/06 
and 
implement 
the 
project 
starting 
FY 
2006/2007. 
In 
addition to 
building 
capacity 
of 
district 
councils, 
the 
project 
will 
empower 
and 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
and performance 
of 
the 
private 
sector engaged 
in 
marketing agricultural 
inputs, 
services 
and produce 
at 
the 
village 
and 
district 
level. 
The 
capacity 
building 
for 
private 
sector 
will 
include:

Page  51
supporting 
grass-root 
level 
private-sector 
institutions 
whose 
members 
provide 
important roles 
in 
local 
marketing 
and 
service 
provision, 
such 
as 
chambers 
of 
commerce, traders associations and 
producers organizations; 
facilitating 
dialogue 
between 
government and 
private 
sector 
institutions 
about 
obstacles 
for 
local 
private 
sector development, such 
as 
local 
bylaws 
and regulations, 
adverse 
tax 
structures, 
and 
deficiencies 
in 
public 
services 
and infrastructure; 
organizing 
dialogue 
(forum) 
between 
groups 
of 
farmers 
and 
private 
enterprises 
about 
improvement 
of 
service 
delivery 
and 
marketing 
efficiencies; 
supporting 
partnership 
arrangements 
between 
local 
government and 
private 
sector 
entities and 
between 
groups 
of 
farmers 
and 
private 
enterprises, 
such 
as 
co-financing 
of 
demonstration 
of 
new 
technologies and 
input 
use; 
and 
providing 
co-funding 
for 
training 
of 
micro 
and 
small 
enterprises 
and 
managers 
of 
farmers 
organizations 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
agricultural 
input 
supply 
and 
services, 
and 
agricultural 
product 
marketing. 
The 
Project 
will 
provide 
each 
participating district 
with 
US$ 
175,000 
equivalent 
as 
conditional 
grants 
to 
support 
implementation 
of 
capacity 
building 
program 
activities over 
a 
period 
of 
three 
years. 
Out 
of 
this 
amount, 
US$ 
10,000 
equivalent 
will 
be 
provided immediately 
after 
the 
signing 
of 
Project 
Implementation 
Agreement 
(PIA) between 
the 
PCU 
and 
the 
district to 
enable 
them 
prepare 
for 
PADEP 
implementation. 
The 
matching contribution 
from 
the 
districts 
will 
be 
at 
least 
10% 
of 
the 
grant 
(i.e. 
US$ 
17,500 
equivalent). 
Although 
districts 
will 
have considerable 
flexibility 
in 
designing 
their 
own 
capacity 
building 
programs, 
some 
expenditure 
limits 
(floors 
and 
ceilings) 
will 
be 
put 
on 
different 
categories 
of 
expenditure 
(e.g., 
maximum proportion 
devoted 
to 
vehicles, 
a 
minimum 
devoted 
to 
building 
partnerships 
or 
training, 
etc.) 
to 
ensure 
effective allocation 
of 
the 
grant 
provided. 
The 
proposed ceilings 
and 
floors 
are 
given 
in 
the 
PIP 
document. 
If 
a 
district 
chooses 
to 
acquire a 
4WD 
based 
on 
their 
needs, 
delays 
in 
acquiring 
should 
not 
materially 
affect 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
district 
to 
implement 
effectively 
the 
required 
activities.  Other 
transportation options 
must 
be 
used 
while 
procurement 
takes 
place. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
capacity 
assessment 
process, 
the 
PCU 
will 
verify 
whether 
adequate 
transportation 
arrangements 
are 
available, 
and 
the 
district 
is 
prepared 
to 
use 
them. 
The total 
cost 
of 
the 
Tanzania 
mainland 
districts capacity 
building 
program 
is 
estimated 
at 
US$ 
5.00 
million 
equivalent, 
out 
of 
which PADEP 
will 
contribute 
US$ 
4.55 
million 
equivalent, 
while 
District 
Councils 
will 
contribute 
at 
least 
US$45,500 
equivalent. 
Similarly, 
the 
total 
cost 
for 
district 
capacity 
building 
for 
Zanzibar 
component 
will 
be 
US$ 
777,200 
equivalent. 
In 
case 
of 
the 
Zanzibar 
component, 
this 
budget 
will 
cover capacity 
building 
at 
both 
national 
and 
district 
levels. 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
US$ 
700,000 
equivalent 
and 
the 
MANRECIdistricts 
will 
be 
required 
to 
contribute 
at 
least 
US$77,720 
equivalent. 
(ii) 
National Level 
Institutional 
Strengthening 
& 
Capacity 
Building 
(US% 
9.05 
million) 
The 
Project 
will 
finance 
a 
number 
of 
activities 
at 
national 
and 
project coordination 
levels that 
are 
aimed 
at strengthening 
institutions 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
and 
building 
capacities 
to 
support and 
supervise 
demand-driven 
community 
agricultural 
development subprojects. 
Activities 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
PADEP 
at 
national 
levels 
will 
include 
capacity 
building, 
support 
to 
policy 
and regulatory framework 
for 
enhanced 
private 
sector 
participation, 
support 
for 
the 
rehabilitation 
of

sensitization 
and 
annual 
review 
workshops 
to 
create 
awareness 
of 
the 
project 
objectives, 
concepts 
and 
principles, 
and 
share 
views 
and 
ideas 
with 
implementing 
agencies 
at 
all 
levels. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
support development and 
updating 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system, 
with 
a 
view 
to improve information 
flow, 
to 
enable 
rational 
and 
timely 
decision 
making 
at 
all 
levels. 
The project 
will 
also 
support 
training 
of 
responsible 
MAFS 
staff 
to 
build 
their capacity 
to 
facilitate and 
supervise 
community 
development 
subprojects 
using 
participatory 
approaches. 
Further, 
the 
project 
will 
finance various 
studies 
including 
beneficiary 
assessments, 
socioeconomic 
surveys, 
management 
information 
system 
and 
other 
studies 
as 
need 
may 
arise. 
This 
will 
include technical 
assistance 
required 
in 
carrying 
out 
these 
studies, 
as 
well 
as 
technical 
backstopping. 
It 
will 
also 
provide 
support 
to 
MAFS 
agencies 
responsible 
for 
enforcement 
of 
regulations 
and legislations 
governing 
agricultural 
sector, such 
as 
seed 
quality 
control, 
screening 
of 
agro-chemicals 
and crop 
inspections. 
It 
is 
estimated that capacity 
building 
at 
national 
level 
will 
cost 
about 
US$ 
3.97 
million 
equivalent, 
of 
which 
IDA 
will 
provide 
US$ 
3.67 
million.

The 
project 
will 
provide 
support 
to 
MAFS 
for

the 
aim 
of 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
its 
staff 
to 
define, 
implement 
and 
analyze sector 
policies 
and 
regulations. 
It 
is 
envisaged that, 
this 
will 
enhance 
the 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
marketing 
of 
agricultural 
inputs 
and 
outputs, 
and 
provision 
of 
financial 
and technical 
services. 
The 
project 
will 
finance the enforcement 
of 
legislations 
and 
regulations that 
will 
address 
deficiencies 
in 
marketing 
of 
farm 
inputs, 
particularly improved 
seeds, 
fertilizers 
and 
pesticides. 
Specifically, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
the 
development 
of: 
0 
A 
competitive 
seed 
market 
by 
commissioning 
the 
preparation 
of 
seed 
sub-sector 
vision 
and 
strategy, 
stakeholder 
consultation 
workshops, 
involvement 
of 
the 
seed 
industry

To 
enhance 
participation 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
institutions, 
the 
project 
will 
provide 
support 
to 
institutions, 
such 
as 
the 
Confederation 
of 
Tanzania 
Industry 
(CTI), 
the 
Tanzania Chamber 
of 
Commerce, 
Trade, 
Industry 
and 
Agriculture (TCCIA), 
the Tanzania Chamber 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Livestock (TCAL), 
farmers’ organizations and 
traders’ associations. 
It 
will 
also support 
forums 
aimed 
at 
discussing 
obstacles 
for 
private 
sector 
development, 
like 
focus 
group 
meetings 
to 
review 
sector 
laws 
and 
regulations. 
In 
addition, support 
will 
be 
provided to facilitate 
partnership 
arrangements 
between 
government and 
private 
sector 
entities 
aiming 
at 
revamping 
domestic processing 
of 
agricultural 
commodities 
and 
use 
of 
private 
sector 
expertise 
in 
various 
sector 
advisory 
committees and 
boards. 
A 
training program 
for 
stockists 
and 
other 
local 
input 
traders 
on 
effective 
handling 
of 
agricultural 
inputs, 
setting 
up 
demonstration 
plots 
for 
these 
inputs 
at 
the 
village 
and 
district 
level, 
and 
providing 
reliable 
technical 
information 
will 
be initiated. 
The project 
will 
also 
support development 
of 
competitive product 
markets 
by 
commissioning 
pilots 
in 
private-public 
partnerships 
in: 
supply-chain 
management; 
private 
agribusiness 
enterprises; 
and 
farmers-research-extension 
and related 
public 
technical 
services, 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
producing 
organically 
grown 
fresh 
products 
for 
export 
markets. 
It 
is 
estimated that support 
to policy 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
will 
amount 
to 
US$ 
1.32 
million 
equivalent, 
of 
which 
IDA 
will 
contribution 
US$ 
1.24 
million. 
(c) 
Strengthening 
Technological 
Linkages 
(US% 
3.76 
million) 
Effective 
linkages 
with 
on-going 
IDA 
and other 
donor 
funded 
projectslprograms 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
will 
be 
established 
for 
complementarity 
purpose. 
The 
project 
will 
achieve 
this 
through 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
ASDP 
Secretariat, 
which 
is 
coordinating 
all 
investments 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector, 
and direct linkages 
to 
on-going 
projects, 
including 
NAEP 
11, 
TAW 
11, 
ASPS, 
SPFS, 
RBMSIIP, PIDP 
and other 
relevant projects implemented 
by 
other 
ministries, 
like 
the 
Agricultural 
Marketing 
Systems 
Development Project 
(AMSDP) 
and 
Tanzania 
Rural 
Financial 
Services 
Project 
(TRFSP). 
Further, 
the 
project 
will 
provide 
support 
for networking 
with 
international 
agricultural 
organizations, 
such 
as 
FAO, 
SG 
2000, 
IITA, 
CIMMYT 
and 
World 
Ago-forestry 
Center, 
in 
order 
to 
continually 
access 
new 
technological options 
for 
dissemination 
to participating 
communities. 
For 
the 
same 
reason, 
PADEP 
will 
support 
regional 
and inter-regional 
study 
exchange 
visits, 
as 
well 
as 
farmer-research-extension-market 
(FREM) 
linkage 
forums. 
During 
PRA 
process, 
the 
project 
will 
provide 
resources 
to 
facilitate 
links 
between 
farmers 
and 
sources 
of 
technological 
options, 
particularly 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
identifying 
technical 
solutions 
to 
the 
identified 
problems. 
Strengthening 
linkages between 
Zonal Agricultural 
Research Centers 
(ZARC) 
and extension 
services, 
which 
are 
provided 
by 
District 
Councils 
will 
ensure 
participation 
of 
beneficiaries 
in 
the 
identification 
of 
ecological-specific 
research 
priorities, 
and 
in 
testing 
the 
options 
available. 
The 
ZARC 
will 
provide 
technical 
services 
to 
the 
local 
authorities 
and 
farming 
communities 
on 
demand-basis. 
District 
Councils 
are 
already 
participating 
in 
identification 
of 
research 
programs 
by 
having 
representatives 
in 
the 
Zonal 
Research 
Internal 
Program 
Reviews 
(IPR), 
Zonal Technical 
Committees 
(ZTC) and 
Zonal 
Executive 
Committees 
(ZEC) 
meetings. 
District 
Councils 
are at 
the 
moment 
contributing 
to 
their 
respective 
Zonal 
Agricultural 
Research 
Funds 
(ZARF). 
In 
turn, 
zonal 
research 
centers 
are 
conducting client-oriented and 
demand-driven adaptive 
research 
to 
solve 
ago-ecological 
specific 
problems. 
District 
capacity 
building 
grants 
could 
be 
used 
to 
contribute 
to 
or 
procure 
services 
from 
zonal 
research centers. 
The project 
will 
finance 
the 
publication 
in 
Kiswahili, 
specific technical 
handbooks 
to 
assist 
sourcing and dissemination 
of 
technological options 
to 
beneficiaries.

Under 
this 
sub-component, 
the 
project 
will 
carry out 
rehabilitation 
and 
equipping 
of 
four 
strategically 
located 
soil 
testing 
laboratories, 
to 
enable 
them 
respond 
efficiently 
to 
the 
growing 
demands 
for 
chemical and 
physical 
analyses 
of 
soils 
from 
communities. 
Knowledge 
of 
soil 
characteristics 
will 
enable 
districts and communities 
choose 
subprojects 
which 
aim 
at 
addressing 
soil 
degradation problems. 
Four 
4-WD 
vehicles 
(one 
for 
each 
laboratory) and 
eight 
motorbikes 
(two 
for 
each 
laboratory) 
will 
be 
provided, 
for 
easy 
access 
to 
remote 
areas 
during 
soil 
surveys 
and 
soil 
sampling. 
This 
will 
also 
facilitate 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
of 
soils 
status 
in 
the 
project 
areas, 
and 
for 
responding 
to 
specific 
demands 
by 
districts, 
communities and 
farmers' 
groups. 
A 
variety 
of 
chemicals and 
laboratory 
equipment, 
including 
20 
soil-testing 
kits 
will 
be acquired 
(5 
per 
laboratory) 
for 
training 
purpose, 
and 
for 
on-site 
soil 
diagnosis. 
Soil 
testing 
kits 
will 
also 
be 
provided 
for 
district 
level 
extension staff. 
Six 
(6) 
kits 
will 
be 
provided 
per district, 
thus 
overall, 
the 
project 
will 
provide 
168 
kits 
for 
28 
participating 
districts. 
The 
costs 
of 
extension 
agents' 
soil 
testing 
kits 
are 
budgeted 
under 
the 
district 
capacity 
building 
grants. 
All 
kits, 
for 
laboratory and districts 
extension 
services, 
will 
be 
procured 
as 
a single 
package. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
a 
total 
of 
US$ 
3.76 
equivalent 
million 
will 
be 
spent 
on 
technological linkage activities, 
including 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
four 
soil 
laboratories. 
Out 
of 
this 
amount 
IDA 
will 
provide 
US$ 
3.43 
million. 
(d) 
The 
project 
will 
facilitate 
coordination 
activities 
at 
community, 
district 
and 
national 
level. 
The 
project 
will 
procure 
nine 
vehicles 
including 
replacements, 
and 
office 
equipment 
for 
use 
by 
the 
Project 
Coordination office. The project 
will 
meet 
operational 
cost 
for 
the 
coordination 
office, 
which 
will 
include 
expenses 
for 
repair and 
maintenance 
of 
vehicles 
and 
office 
equipment, 
staff 
salaries, 
NPSC 
and 
PTC 
meetings, 
facilitation 
and 
coordination 
of 
field 
activities, 
M&E, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
office 
upkeep 
expenses. 
Project Coordination 
and 
Management 
(US% 
4.65 
million) 
PADEP 
will 
adopt 
and 
implement 
a 
Participatory 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
(PM&E) 
methodology, 
which 
involves 
the 
beneficiaries 
in 
the 
collection, 
processing, storage 
and 
retrieval 
of 
data 
in 
simplified, 
but 
adequate 
formats. 
The project 
will 
support 
the 
design, 
testing 
and 
installation 
of 
a 
computer-based management 
information 
system 
(MIS) 
and 
intensive 
training 
of 
the 
communities, ward, 
district 
and 
national 
level staff 
in 
PM&E 
approaches. 
Baseline 
data 
collection 
will 
be 
undertaken 
as 
part 
of 
an 
extended 
PRA 
exercise 
in 
each 
targeted 
communitylfarmer 
group. 
The 
baseline 
will 
include 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
quality and availability 
of 
rural 
services 
provision, 
as 
well 
as 
current 
levels 
of 
production, 
asset 
ownership 
and income, 
possibly 
based 
on 
TASAF's Community 
Services 
Delivery 
Survey 
(CSDS) 
methodology. 
Beneficiary-led 
assessments 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
village 
governments 
to 
assess 
the 
benefits 
arising 
from 
subprojects 
as 
they reach 
completion. 
Each district 
will 
summarize 
these 
assessments 
on 
an 
annual 
basis, 
in 
order 
to 
gauge 
the 
emerging 
effects 
of 
subprojects 
on 
the 
communities 
and 
to learn 
lessons 
for 
investments 
in 
following 
years.  These summaries 
will 
then 
be 
reviewed 
at 
annual 
zonal workshops 
attended 
by 
relevant 
stakeholders 
(farmers' 
groups, 
NGOs, 
private 
sector traders, 
etc.). 
The 
M&E 
of 
project 
activities 
will 
also 
involve 
field 
supervision 
by 
PCU 
and 
DFT, 
annual 
project 
evaluations, 
mid-term 
review 
and 
terminal 
evaluation. 
A 
database 
will 
be 
developed 
to 
capture 
all 
the 
data 
and 
information 
generated 
from 
various 
sources. 
To 
enable 
efficient 
processing 
and retrieval, 
computers 
and 
associated accessories 
will 
be 
purchased 
for 
the 
PCU 
and 
participating 
districts, 
depending 
on 
their 
needs 
assessment. 
The 
database 
will 
be 
updated 
regularly to 
accommodate 
new 
requirements 
in 
the 
course 
of 
project 
implementation. 
The 
total 
cost 
for 
project coordination 
activities 
is 
estimated 
at 
US$ 
4.65 
million 
equivalent, 
of 
which 
IDA 
will 
provide 
US$ 
4.30 
million.

TANZANIA: Participatory Agricultural Development and 
Empowerment 
Project 
Economic 
and 
Financial 
Analysis 
A 
full 
quantitative evaluation 
of 
economic 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
cannot 
be 
easily 
done 
for 
several reasons. 
Benefits 
of 
the 
component 
for 
capacity 
building 
and 
institutional 
strengthening, 
which 
includes 
mainly 
training 
and 
studies, are 
difficult 
to quantify 
in 
monetary 
terms. 
The 
investments 
in 
subprojects 
are 
not 
known 
ex 
ante, 
since 
they 
will 
be 
determined 
through 
the 
participatory planning 
processes. 
Benefits 
from 
the subprojects 
focusing 
on 
sustainable 
natural 
resource 
management 
and 
environmental 
conservation 
will 
accrue 
over a 
long 
time 
frame 
and 
in 
part 
derive 
from 
avoidance 
of 
economic loss 
(due 
to 
degradation) 
that 
is 
hard 
to 
measure. 
In 
view 
of 
these 
problems, 
the 
financial 
analysis 
is 
indicative, rather than 
precise. 
Yet 
because 
the 
project 
is 
intended 
to promote 
growth 
of 
incomes, 
financial 
analysis 
is 
needed even 
if 
it 
cannot 
be 
undertaken 
with 
precision. 
The 
costs 
and 
benefits 
of 
adopting 
technologies 
of 
varying intensity 
in 
use 
of 
purchased 
inputs 
in 
Tanzania have 
been 
assessed 
in 
some 
detail. 
The 
costs 
and 
benefits 
of 
the 
actual choices made 
under 
the 
pilot 
projects 
have 
been 
evaluated 
using 
assumptions about 
projected 
benefit 
streams. 
Finally, 
an 
approximate 
sensitivity 
analysis 
has 
been 
undertaken 
to 
suggest 
what 
levels 
of 
income 
growth 
on 
the 
part 
of 
participating 
farmers 
and villages 
would 
be 
needed 
to provide 
a 
positive 
net 
present value 
to 
the 
project. 
The 
following 
sections summarize 
the 
results 
of 
each one 
of 
the 
above-mentioned 
three 
types 
of 
analysis. 
4.1 
The 
Profitability 
of 
Agriculture 
in 
Tanzania 
The financial 
costs 
and 
returns 
for 
seven 
important 
smallholder 
crops 
grown 
in 
five 
areas 
of 
Tanzania 
under 
varying 
degrees 
of 
intensity 
in 
input 
use 
were analyzed 
during 
project 
preparation. 
Overall, 
the 
results 
of 
this 
analysis, based 
on 
current 
production 
trends, 
are 
encouraging and show 
that 
most crops 
offer 
a 
potential 
for 
attractive 
producer 
profits 
and 
good 
returns 
to 
labor. 
The 
data also 
show that a 
range 
of 
technologies 
offer 
higher 
returns, 
and that 
use 
of 
high 
levels 
of 
purchased 
inputs 
is 
rarely 
the 
most 
advantageous approach. 
Especially 
with 
most 
food 
crops, 
that a 
farmer’s 
returns 
can 
improve 
substantially 
compared 
with 
current 
average management 
simply 
through 
the 
use 
of 
organic 
(manure) 
fertilizer 
and 
careful 
adherence 
to 
the fundamentals 
of 
good 
crop 
husbandry 
(timely 
planting 
and 
adequate 
attention 
to 
weed control). 
For 
most 
cash crops, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
data 
show that 
the 
use 
of 
purchased 
inputs 
is 
more 
important 
and 
likely 
to 
have a 
positive impact 
on 
profitability. 
The 
data also 
suggest 
that 
a 
rationalization 
of 
regional marketing 
taxes 
as 
well 
as 
an 
investment 
in 
low-cost production 
technologies, 
including 
irrigation 
furrows 
and 
water-based 
hand 
sprayers, 
could 
also 
lead 
to 
substantial 
improvements 
in 
farmer 
income.

This 
section 
presents 
the 
quantitative 
results 
for 
each 
of 
the 
seven 
farm 
enterprises 
analyzed. 
To 
provide 
the 
best 
possible 
indication 
of 
the 
costs and 
returns 
to agricultural 
production, 
three 
levels 
of 
smallholder 
management 
are 
analyzed 
for 
each enterprise. 
Specifically, 
the 
first, 
or 
“average” 
production 
level 
is 
characterized 
by 
the 
use 
of 
very 
few 
purchased 
inputs, 
minimal 
attention 
to 
weed 
control 
and 
fairly 
poor 
yield 
results. 
The 
second, 
or 
“improved” 
level 
is 
based 
on 
better 
management, 
including 
good 
weed 
control, 
the 
use 
of 
manure 
fertilizer, 
slightly more 
intensive 
input 
use 
and 
higher 
yield 
results. 
This 
is 
a 
level 
of 
increased investment 
in 
inputs 
that 
could 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
small 
outlays 
envisaged 
for 
the 
farmer groups 
under 
the 
PADEP 
project. 
The 
third, 
or 
“potential” 
level 
assumes 
good 
weed 
control 
and 
satisfactory 
use 
of 
pesticides, 
inorganic fertilizers 
and 
other 
recommended 
inputs. 
Importantly, 
as 
used 
here, 
the 
term 
“potential” 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
yields 
attainable 
under 
ideal 
conditions 
on 
a 
research 
station, 
but 
only to 
the 
output 
a 
very 
good 
smallholder 
can expect 
in 
a 
year 
with 
adequate 
rainfall.

all 
crops 
and

A. 
Maize 
Maize 
is 
Tanzania’s 
principal food 
crop 
and 
is 
grown 
in 
almost 
every 
region 
of 
the 
country. 
Although 
other foods 
(including 
cassava 
and 
banana) 
are 
of 
greater 
importance 
in 
specific 
locations, 
most 
farmers 
still 
cultivate 
maize 
to 
some 
extent 
or 
another 
to 
meet 
at 
least 
some 
of 
their 
subsistence 
needs. 
At 
the 
national 
level, 
this 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
fact that 
maize 
production 
has 
more 
or 
less 
kept 
pace 
with 
population 
growth 
for 
the 
past years. 
In 
some 
areas, 
maize 
is 
also 
grown 
as 
the 
main 
cash 
crop. 
This 
is 
especially 
true 
in 
parts 
of 
the 
Southern 
Highlands 
and 
near 
Arusha 
in 
the 
north 
where 
growing 
conditions 
are 
well 
suited 
to 
this 
activity. 
Cash 
sales 
are 
also 
common 
in 
border regions 
where farmers 
selling 
to 
export 
traders are sometimes 
paid 
significantly more 
than 
those 
selling 
on 
the 
local 
market. 
For 
most smallholder 
farmers 
with 
limited 
sources 
of 
income, 
there 
is 
pressure 
each year 
to 
sell 
at 
least 
some 
maize 
for 
cash 
early 
in 
the 
marketing 
season 
when prices 
are 
low. 
In 
these 
cases, 
farmers 
-51 
- 
Page  58
are 
often 
forced 
to 
buy 
back 
maize (or 
other 
food) 
later 
in 
the 
year 
for 
home consumption 
at a 
much 
higher 
price. 
At 
least 
on 
the 
traded 
portion 
of 
their 
crop, therefore, 
many 
households 
appear 
to 
be 
making 
a 
financial 
loss 
from 
the 
cultivation 
of 
maize. 
Although 
the 
production 
of 
food 
crops 
for 
home 
consumption 
makes 
good 
sense 
for 
other 
reasons, 
this 
pattern certainly 
does 
nothing to 
alleviate 
the 
high 
levels 
of 
rural 
poverty 
and 
it 
is 
important 
to look for 
ways 
of 
breaking 
this 
cycle. 
The 
quantitative 
analysis 
of 
maize 
was 
carried out 
for five 
locations. 
Although Mbeya 
is 
the 
only 
location 
typically 
regarded 
as 
a 
major 
maize 
producing 
area, 
the 
costs 
and returns 
will 
not 
be 
too 
different 
from 
other 
surplus 
areas 
also 
in 
the Southern 
Highlands 
with 
a 
similar 
climate. 
Areas 
where 
maize 
is 
grown 
mostly 
as 
a 
secondary 
crop 
were 
included to provide 
an 
idea 
of 
possible 
food 
security 
strategies 
for 
farmers 
in 
these 
locations. 
Because 
maize, 
sorghum and 
rice 
are 
grown 
both for 
cash 
sales 
and 
subsistence, 
farmer 
profits 
are 
calculated 
for 
growers that 
sell 
different 
shares 
of 
total 
output. 
In 
these 
cases, 
food 
stocks 
retained 
for 
home 
consumption 
are 
valued 
at 
the 
higher 
imputed 
cost 
of 
purchasing 
grain 
eight months 
after 
harvest 
when 
local 
supplies 
are 
scarce. 
Improved 
production 
assumes 
the 
use 
of 
manure 
fertilizer; 
potential 
management 
is 
based 
on 
four 
50 
Kg 
bags 
of 
fertilizer 
per 
hectare. 
Table 
2 
looks 
at 
the 
benefits 
of 
technological 
advancement 
as 
measured 
by 
incremental 
cost-benefit 
ratios 
(ICBRs). 
It 
is 
generally 
assumed 
that where 
the 
ICBR 
is 
greater 
than 
2, 
the 
risk 
of 
investing 
additional 
resources can 
be 
justified; 
when 
the 
ICBR 
is 
less 
than 
2, 
farmers 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
better-off producing 
at the 
lower 
input 
level.

These data 
clearly 
show that 
the 
incremental 
returns 
are 
far 
better 
for 
average 
farmers 
who 
adopt 
improved 
technology than 
for 
those 
who 
go 
on 
to 
use 
inorganic 
fertilizers 
at a 
higher 
level 
of

Even 
when 
measured 
against

imputed 
food 
security 
value, 
the 
incremental 
returns 
from 
investing 
in

at 
high 
rates 
of 
use are 
still 
poor.

Sorghum 
Sorghum 
is 
grown mainly 
in 
areas 
with 
a 
harsh, 
dry 
climate 
where 
it 
is 
an 
important 
staple 
food. 
The 
ICBRs for 
sorghum 
shown 
in 
Table 
3 
indicate 
that 
the 
use 
of 
inorganic fertilizers and 
other 
purchased 
inputs 
at 
the 
potential 
level 
is 
difficult 
to 
justify 
compared 
to 
the 
returns 
from 
manure 
fertilizer 
and 
other 
simple 
technologies.

C. 
Rice 
Compared 
with 
maize 
and 
sorghum, 
most 
rice 
farmers 
sell 
a 
greater 
share 
of 
their 
total 
output. 
Although rice 
is 
still 
important 
for 
subsistence, 
there 
is 
good 
market 
demand 
for 
this 
commodity 
and 
most 
farmers 
aim 
to 
sell 
at 
least 
some 
of 
their production 
each year 
for 
cash. 
Broad 
production 
figures 
indicate 
this 
pattern 
has 
become 
increasingly common 
in 
that 
total 
rice 
production 
has 
been 
growing 
faster 
than 
the 
increase 
in 
national 
population. 
One advantage 
of 
Tanzanian 
rice 
is 
that 
most 
farmers 
grow 
a 
large 
grain, 
aromatic 
variety 
regarded 
as 
being 
of 
very 
high 
quality.  This 
offers 
a 
good 
opportunity 
for 
niche 
marketing 
and 
to 
attract 
premium 
prices 
for 
export.  Tanzania 
does 
export 
some 
rice, 
but 
is 
currently 
a 
net 
importer 
of 
this 
commodity. 
Table 
4 
looks 
at 
the 
incremental benefits 
of 
adopting 
improved 
and 
potential 
management. 
For 
rain fed 
rice, 
these 
data 
show that a 
move 
from 
average 
to improved 
management 
provides 
a better rate 
or 
return 
than a 
move 
from 
improved 
to 
potential. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
irrigated 
rice, the 
opposite 
is 
true 
and 
the 
returns 
from 
producing 
at 
the 
potential 
level 
are 
much 
more 
attractive 
than 
from 
advancing 
to 
the 
improved 
level 
only.

D. 
Cotton 
A 
widely 
held 
perception 
is 
that 
the 
cotton 
sector 
is 
in 
decline. 
This 
position 
is 
not 
necessarily 
supported 
by 
broad production 
figures 
which 
show great 
variation 
in 
output 
from 
year 
to 
year, 
but 
do 
not 
indicate 
any 
clearly 
discernible 
trend. 
It 
is, 
however, clear that 
the 
cotton 
sector 
suffers 
from 
many 
problems. 
Chief 
among 
these 
is 
the 
poor quality 
of 
seed 
planted 
by 
most farmers. 
Specifically, 
most 
of 
the 
seed 
currently 
used 
in 
Tanzania 
has 
been 
recycled 
for 
more 
than 
20 
years. 
This 
results 
in 
extremely 
poor 
yields, 
even 
by 
African 
standards, 
of 
less 
than 
300 
Kglha 
on 
many 
farms.  These 
outdated 
seeds 
also 
provide 
a 
very 
low 
ginning 
outtum 
(GOT) 
of 
only 
about 33% 
lint. 
By 
comparison, 
smallholder cotton 
in 
Zambia 
yields 
about 
39% 
lint; 
in 
Zimbabwe, 
42% 
is 
the 
norm. 
Because 
lint 
is 
the 
most 
valuable 
product 
of 
cotton 
(the 
other 
being 
seed), 
this 
low 
GOT 
prevents 
more 
attractive prices 
from 
being 
offered to 
the 
farmer. 
Clearly, 
efforts 
to 
provide 
farmers 
with 
improved 
planting 
material 
are 
likely 
to 
generate 
substantial 
benefits. 
This 
challenge 
is 
already 
being 
addressed 
by 
the 
cotton 
industry. 
Research 
programs 
are 
underway 
and 
from 
next 
year 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
a 
multiplication 
program 
can 
begin 
so 
that clean 
(not 
fuzzy) 
seed 
will 
be 
available 
for 
sale 
to 
farmers 
by 
the 
2002/03 
growing 
season.

Ec 
In 
terms 
of 
profitability, 
these 
data 
clearly 
show 
that 
cotton 
becomes 
significantly 
more 
profitable 
at 
each successive management 
level. 
This 
is 
especially 
true 
for 
farmers 
who 
carefully 
follow 
all 
crop 
recommendations 
and produce 
at the 
potential 
level 
where 
profits 
are 
substantially 
greater 
than 
with 
average 
or 
improved 
management. 
Although 
the 
estimated 
net 
profits 
from 
cotton 
are 
lower 
than 
for 
all 
other 
cash crops analyzed, 
cotton 
is 
well 
suited 
to 
relatively 
harsh 
growing 
conditions. 
For 
farmers 
in 
these 
areas, 
cotton 
offers 
one 
of 
the 
best 
opportunities 
for 
a 
cash 
income. 
E. 
Tobacco 
Both 
flue 
and 
dark-fire 
cured 
tobaccos 
are 
grown 
in 
Tanzania.  These 
varieties 
must 
be 
heat 
cured 
using 
firewood 
in 
specially 
constructed 
barns 
before 
the 
crop 
can 
be 
sold. 
Air-cured, 
burley 
tobacco 
is 
not 
common 
due 
to 
large variations 
in 
humidity 
during 
the 
curing 
season. 
Since 
the 
start 
of 
the 
decade, 
total 
tobacco 
production 
has 
increased 
from 
only 
about 
12,000 
mt 
in 
1990191 
to 
more than 
35,000 
mt 
in 
the 
most recent 
growing 
season. 
Of 
this 
production, flue-cured 
tobacco 
is 
by 
far 
the 
most 
important and 
regularly 
accounts 
for 
about 
80% 
of 
the 
total. 
Fire-cured 
tobacco 
is 
only 
common 
in 
parts 
of 
Ruvuma Region 
in 
the 
south; 
flue-cured 
tobacco 
is 
grown 
in 
many 
locations throughout 
the 
country.

These 
data 
show 
that 
tobacco 
production 
can 
be 
extremely 
profitable 
where 
both 
flue 
and 
fire-cured 
tobacco 
provide significantly more 
income 
per 
hectare 
compared 
with 
all 
other 
enterprises 
analyzed. 
For 
the 
majority 
of 
farmers 
that 
only 
cultivate 
one acre 
of 
tobacco, 
however, the 
returns 
will 
obviously 
be far more 
modest. 
A 
typical 
farmer 
growing 
one acre 
of 
flue-cured 
tobacco 
with 
average 
management 
in 
Mbeya, 
for 
example, 
can 
expect 
a 
cash 
income 
of 
about 
TShs 
212,880. 
This 
is 
still 
very 
good, 
but 
is 
only 
comparable 
to 
the 
income 
that 
could 
be 
earned 
from 
a 
full 
hectare 
of 
most 
other 
(easier 
to 
manage) crops. 
F. 
Coffee 
Coffee production 
has 
been 
on 
a 
slow 
decline 
for 
at 
least 
the 
past 
20 
years. 
This 
is 
largely 
explained 
by 
fact that 
most 
coffee 
trees 
in 
Tanzania 
are 
now 
more 
than 
70 
years 
old 
and 
so 
produce 
very 
little 
yield. 
Because these 
very 
old 
trees 
do 
not 
respond 
well 
to 
inputs, 
a 
major 
challenge 
is 
to 
replant 
with 
newer 
varieties. 
The 
quality 
of 
Tanzanian 
coffee 
is 
also 
thought 
to 
have deteriorated 
in 
recent 
years. 
Partly, this 
is 
because 
private 
buyers 
do 
not 
make 
any 
distinction 
in 
quality when 
buying 
at 
the 
farmgate 
so 
there 
has 
been 
little 
incentive 
for 
farmers 
to 
use 
good 
management. 
Likewise, 
very 
intense 
competition 
between buyers 
means 
that 
most 
are 
willing 
to 
accept 
whatever 
product 
they 
can 
get 
regardless 
of 
quality. 
Quantitative 
results 
from 
the 
analysis 
of 
coffee 
are 
summarized 
below.  Annualized 
investment 
costs 
at 
the 
improved 
and 
potential 
level 
are 
based 
on 
the 
cost 
of 
an 
EC 
hand 
sprayer.

Taken 
together, 
these 
results 
are 
very good and 
show that 
coffee offers an 
opportunity 
for 
highly 
attractive 
producer 
profits, 
especially 
with 
improved 
and 
potential 
management 
where 
the 
returns 
are 
much 
greater 
than 
with 
current 
average 
management. 
Even 
at 
the 
low 
input 
level, 
however, coffee 
still 
provides 
a 
very good 
net 
income 
from 
zero 
expenditure 
on 
cash 
inputs. 
This 
is 
a 
significant 
advantage 
of 
coffee and 
means 
that 
even 
very 
poor 
households 
are 
likely 
to 
benefit 
from 
this 
crop 
in 
areas 
with 
a 
suitable 
climate. 
Likewise, 
for 
improved 
farmers, 
the 
cash 
requirement 
is 
still 
relatively 
modest 
so 
that 
technological 
advancement 
may 
be 
easier 
to 
achieve 
than 
with 
many 
other 
crops. 
In 
all 
cases, 
the 
ICBRs 
and other 
rates 
of 
retum 
are 
excellent and 
show that 
an 
investment 
of 
cash 
and 
other 
resources 
in 
coffee 
makes 
good financial 
sense. 
In 
terms 
of 
labor 
requirements, 
the 
data show 
that 
coffee 
is 
very 
labor 
intensive, 
but 
still 
provides 
an 
excellent 
retum 
per day worked. 
Importantly, 
most 
of 
the 
labor 
invested 
in 
coffee 
is 
spent 
on 
pulping 
and 
processing 
which 
is 
done 
late 
in 
the 
season 
when 
there 
are 
fewer 
demands 
on 
a farmer's 
time. 
With 
the 
continued 
introduction 
of 
pulping 
by 
private 
buyers, 
the 
total 
labor requirement 
for 
coffee 
could 
be 
substantially 
reduced. 
G. 
Cashew 
Cashew 
production 
has 
increased 
dramatically 
since 
the 
introduction 
of 
market 
reforms. 
This 
is 
mainly 
a 
result 
of 
the 
higher producer prices 
now 
being 
offered 
by 
private 
buyers 
(about 
60-65% 
of 
the 
fob 
price) 
compared 
with 
the former 
Cashew 
Marketing Board 
(about 
40% 
of 
fob). 
Also, 
farmers 
are 
now 
paid 
in 
cash 
at 
the 
time 
of 
sale 
whereas 
the 
CMB 
often 
paid 
several 
months 
late.  These 
developments 
both 
provide good 
incentive 
for 
farmers 
to 
adopt 
better 
management practices, 
including 
time 
spent 
slashing 
grasses 
and constructing 
fire 
breaks. 
This 
is 
in 
stark contrast 
with 
the 
period 
before 
liberalization 
when 
many 
farmers 
left 
their 
trees 
untended 
and 
often 
did 
not 
bother 
to 
harvest 
the 
nuts 
at 
all. 
Cashews 
are 
grown 
mainly 
in 
coastal regions. 
Nuts 
grown 
in 
the 
south 
yield 
a 
higher 
outturn when 
cracked 
and 
are 
widely 
regarded 
as 
being 
superior 
in 
quality 
to 
those 
from 
the 
north.  Last 
year, 
for 
example, 
nuts 
from 
the 
southem 
cashew area 
attracted 
an 
average 
price 
of 
US$9OO/mt 
fob 
Mtwara. 
Cashew 
grown 
in 
the 
northem 
producing 
area, 
sold 
for 
about 
US$750/MT 
fob 
Tanga. 
Results 
from 
the 
quantitative 
analysis 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
8. 
Improved 
production 
is 
based 
on 
the 
use 
of 
sulphur 
dust; 
potential production 
includes 
both 
extra 
dust 
and 
a 
small 
amount 
of 
pesticide.

Clearly, 
these 
results 
are 
very 
attractive 
and show that 
cashew 
offers 
farmers 
in 
coastal 
areas 
an 
excellent 
opportunity 
for 
high 
financial 
retums. 
The 
results 
are 
especially attractive 
at 
the 
improved 
level 
and show 
that an 
investment 
in 
sulphur 
dust 
can 
be 
of 
major 
benefit 
to 
farm 
income. 
Because 
this 
requires 
a 
fairly 
large 
cash 
expenditure, however, 
input 
programs 
(like 
the 
one 
that 
currently 
exists 
in 
the 
- 
56 
- 
Page  63
cashew sector) 
are 
obviously 
important. 
Nevertheless, 
about 
half 
of 
the 
costs 
to 
produce at 
the 
improved 
level 
are 
accounted 
for 
by 
hiring 
a 
blower to 
apply 
the 
sulphur 
dust 
and 
efforts to improve 
access 
to 
this 
equipment 
could 
also 
be 
very 
rewarding. 
Potential 
production 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
make 
good 
financial 
sense 
and 
provides 
less 
income than 
improved 
management.

The 
data 
suggest 
that 
in 
the 
Morogoro 
district, 
investment 
in 
improved 
maize 
production 
under 
the 
project 
is 
likely 
to 
double 
or 
more 
than 
triple 
the 
income 
of 
farmers, 
with 
a rate 
of 
return 
to 
all 
investments at 
or 
above 
12 
percent, whereas 
investment 
in 
improved 
paddy 
rice 
production 
under 
the 
project 
(adding 
additional 
inputs) 
is 
unlikely 
to

over 
the

Information 
from 
this 
pilot 
should 
be 
evaluated 
with 
the 
help 
of 
technical 
staff 
from 
the 
extension and 
research services 
to 
determine 
why 
the 
selected 
technology 
did 
not 
perform 
up 
to 
expectations. 
Although 
the 
use 
of 
additional 
inputs 
funded 
by 
the 
project 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
more profitable than 
the 
traditional production 
practice, 
investment 
in 
rice 
production 
by 
itself 
can 
be 
very 
profitable 
with 
an 
internal 
rate 
of 
return 
about 
loo%, 
as 
suggested 
by 
the 
pilot 
experience 
of 
one 
farmer group 
in 
the 
Morogoro 
district: 
Resources 
under 
the 
PADEP 
project 
are 
intended 
to 
generate 
additional 
retums, 
and 
not 
simply 
to provide 
alternative 
funding 
for 
technologies already 
in 
use 
or 
no 
better 
than 
those 
in 
use. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
because 
new 
technologies 
are 
inherently more 
risky 
than current technologies, 
some 
will 
have 
disappointing 
results. 
The 
subprojects 
can 
thus 
be 
expected 
to 
show 
some 
results 
indicating 
low 
returns, 
and 
for 
this 
reason 
M&E 
and 
learning 
is 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
project.

Overall, the 
results 
of 
the 
pilot 
investments 
in 
the 
two 
districts 
suggest 
that 
with 
a 
careful 
selection 
of 
the 
enterprises 
in 
which 
investments 
will 
be 
made, 
the 
project 
is 
likely 
to 
generate 
an 
acceptable increase 
in 
rural 
income 
and 
a 
justifiable 
rate 
of 
return 
to 
investment. 
4.3 
The 
Whole 
Project 
Break-Even 
Rate 
of 
Return 
A 
simple 
model 
was 
designed 
to 
estimate the break-even rate 
of 
return 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
model 
indicates that 
under 
reasonable assumptions 
the 
investment 
under 
PADEP 
cannot 
be 
justified 
unless 
it 
generates 
an 
incremental 
1.8% 
real 
rural 
income 
growth 
rate 
per 
year, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
an 
internal 
rate 
of 
return to 
the 
PADEP 
investment (economic 
and financial) 
of 
at 
least 
12%. 
The 
results 
suggest 
in 
other 
words 
that 
the 
PADEP 
investment 
can 
be 
justified 
if 
it 
leads 
to 
an 
increase 
of 
11 
percent 
or 
more 
in 
the 
real 
income 
of 
rural 
communities 
in 
about 
one 
decade 
(nine 
years) 
from 
the 
first

of

implementation.

TANZANIA: Participatory Agricultural Development 
and Empowerment 
Project 
Procurement 
Background 
- 
Procurement 
Reform 
Procurement 
in 
Tanzania 
mainland 
is 
under 
reform 
process. 
The 
Government 
enacted 
the 
Procurement 
law 
in 
February, 
200 
1 
replacing 
all 
previous 
procurement legislations. 
The new 
Procurement 
Act 
became 
effective 
on 
July 
1, 
2001, 
while 
the 
associated 
Regulations 
became 
effective 
on 
July 
2,2001. 
These 
regulations 
were 
issued 
in 
two 
parts: 
(a) 
Procurement 
of 
Goods and Works; 
and 
(b) 
Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants. 
The 
Government 
issued 
a 
set 
of 
Standard 
Bidding 
Documents 
(SBDs) 
in 
mid-November, 
2002. 
The 
set 
comprises 
of 
the: 
(a) 
Procurement 
of 
Goods 
through International 
Competitive 
Bidding; 
(b) 
Procurement 
of 
Health 
Sector Goods; 
(c) 
Standard 
Request 
for 
Proposal; 
(c) 
Standard 
Pre-qualification 
document 
for 
procurement 
of 
works; 
(d) 
Procurement 
of 
works 
through 
National 
Competitive 
Bidding; 
and 
(e) 
Procurement 
of 
Works, 
Smaller 
contracts. 
These 
documents 
were 
reviewed 
by 
the 
consultant 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report (CPAR) between 
December, 
2002 and 
January, 2003 
and 
appear 
to 
be 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
Standard 
Bidding 
Documents. 
A 
stakeholder 
workshop 
was 
conducted 
at 
the 
end 
of 
January, 2003 
to 
discuss 
initial 
recommendations 
of 
the 
CPAR 
proposed 
by 
the 
consultant. 
The 
Public 
Procurement 
Act 
(PPA) 
covers 
procurement 
in 
both 
central 
government 
and 
local 
authorities, 
though 
the 
latter 
is 
covered 
by 
specific 
Local 
Government Regulations, 
issued 
under 
the 
Local 
Government 
Finance 
Act. 
Recently 
the 
PO-RALG 
through Government 
Notices 
No. 
48 
and 
49, 
published 
on 
March 
12,2003,  approved 
revised 
Regulations 
on 
selection 
and employment 
of 
consultants, 
and 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and works. 
Under 
the 
revised 
Regulations, 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
Local 
Government 
Authority 
Tender 
Board 
(LGATB) 
has 
been 
changed 
by 
removing 
Councilors participation 
in 
the 
procurement 
process, 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
increasing 
transparency. 
The 
initial 
recommendations 
of 
the 
draft 
CPAR 
agreed 
upon 
during 
the 
stakeholder 
workshop 
include, 
inter 
alia: 
(a) 
the 
amendment 
of 
Public 
Procurement 
Law 
to 
allow for 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Procurement 
Authority, 
which 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
overseeing the 
public 
sector 
procurement; 
(b) 
decentralization 
of 
procurement 
to 
line 
ministries, 
departments 
and 
agencies; (c) 
change 
of 
the 
legal 
framework to 
allow 
for 
inclusion 
of 
private 
sector representatives 
in 
the 
Public 
Procurement Appeals 
Authority; 
and 
(d) 
replacement 
of 
the 
Supplies 
Officers 
in 
the 
civil 
service 
should 
be 
replaced 
with 
a 
new 
cadre 
of 
procurement specialists. 
The 
final 
report 
including 
all 
recommendations 
agreed 
upon 
during 
the 
stakeholders 
workshop 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
GOT 
by 
end 
of 
April, 
2003 
for 
implementation. 
Based 
on 
the 
CPAR 
findings, 
the procedures 
and 
practices 
of 
procurement 
in 
Zanzibar 
are 
fallacy, 
as 
they 
lack proper 
framework. 
At 
present, 
Government 
funded 
procurement 
is 
conducted 
on 
an 
ad hoc 
basis, 
leaving 
extensive 
discretion 
to 
the 
Accounting Officers 
in 
the 
Ministries. 
While 
some 
of 
the 
procuring 
entities 
are 
applying 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
new 
Treasury 
Instructions, 
others 
have 
simply 
adopted 
their 
own 
procedures. 
Procurement 
in 
Zanzibar 
is 
carried out 
in 
accordance 
with 
former 
and 
now 
void 
rules. 
The 
legal 
framework 
for 
public 
procurement 
is 
inadequate 
due 
to 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
present 
Act 
and 
lack 
of 
Regulations. 
There 
is 
an 
Act 
to 
establish 
a 
Central 
Tender 
Board 
(CTB), 
which 
became 
effective 
on 
July 
1,2002. 
However, 
the 
associated 
Regulations have 
not 
been 
issues. 
The 
Act 
provides 
for 
the 
institutional 
set 
up 
but 
is 
silent 
on 
the 
procurement 
procedures. 
Further, 
the 
CTB 
is 
not 
functioning 
since 
its 
members 
are 
yet 
to 
be 
appointed. 
As 
an 
interim 
measure, 
the 
Minister 
for 
Finance 
and 
Economic 
Affairs 
is 
expected 
to 
issue 
Instructions authorizing ministers 
to 
approve 
all 
contracts 
- 
essentially 
legalizing 
what 
they 
are 
currently 
doing.

Procurement 
capacity 
Procurement 
capacity 
assessment 
was 
carried out 
for 
national 
and 
district 
levels 
implementing 
agencies. 
In 
accordance 
with 
proposed implementation 
arrangements, 
procurement 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
at 
three 
levels. 
These 
are: 
(i) 
National 
through 
the 
MAFS; 
(ii) 
Districts; and 
(iii) 
Community/farmer 
groups.

The 
assessment 
was 
carried 
out 
at 
the 
MAFS 
and 
at 
one 
district 
where 
the 
project 
is 
implementing 
pilot 
community 
subprojects. 
A 
PCU 
has 
been established 
at 
the 
MAFS 
and 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
overall 
coordination 
of 
the 
project. 
At 
district 
level, procurement 
will 
be 
carried out 
by 
the 
responsible 
department 
within 
the 
district 
council. 
Procurement 
at 
the 
national 
level 
shall 
be 
approved 
by 
appropriate authority, 
Le. 
Ministerial 
Tender 
Board 
(MTB) 
or 
Central 
Tender 
Board 
(CTB) 
depending 
on 
contract 
thresholds. 
At 
the 
district 
level 
approving 
authority 
shall 
be 
the 
Council 
Tender 
Board. 
At 
the 
community 
level, 
procurement 
will 
be 
done 
by 
CIS 
and 
FGIS 
Subproject Committees. 
The 
procurement 
capacity 
assessment 
has 
concluded 
that 
there 
is 
inadequate 
procurement capacity 
at 
all 
levels, 
hence a 
need 
for 
strengthening. 
At 
the 
MAFS, 
day-to-day procurement 
for 
PADEP 
will 
be carried 
out 
by 
the 
existing 
Supplies 
Officer 
and 
the 
Procurement Specialist 
to 
be 
recruited 
and 
stationed 
at 
PCU. 
The 
existing 
Supplies 
Officer 
is 
familiar 
with 
both 
the 
Public 
Procurement 
Act 
(PPA) 
and 
IDA 
procurement 
procedures. 
The 
assessment has 
revealed 
that 
the 
Supplies 
Officer 
was 
involved 
in 
procurements 
of 
previous 
IDA 
financed project, 
Le., 
Agriculture 
Sector 
Management 
Project (ASMP), and 
has 
acquired 
adequate 
experience 
in 
procurement. 
During 
implementation 
of 
ASMP, he 
attended short 
courses 
on 
IDA 
procedures 
for 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
works 
as 
well 
as 
selection 
of 
consultants. 
The 
existing 
Supplies 
Officer 
and 
the 
Procurement Specialist 
will 
report 
to 
the 
Project 
Coordinator. 
The detailed 
procurement 
plan 
for 
first 
year 
indicates that 
PCU 
will 
procure 
goods, 
works, and 
consultants, 
as 
well 
as 
training 
packages 
worth 
a 
total 
of 
US$2.8 
million 
equivalent. 
The 
MTB 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
processing 
bids 
(Le., 
approval 
of 
the 
bidding 
documents, 
advertising, 
receipt 
and 
opening 
of 
bids), 
as 
well 
as 
adjudicating 
contracts 
award. 
In 
accordance 
with 
PPA, 
the 
Secretary 
to 
the 
MTB 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
a 
Procurement Specialist. 
Currently, 
the 
Secretariat 
of 
the 
MTB 
is 
led 
by 
a 
Supplies 
Officer, who 
reports 
to 
the 
Director 
of 
Administration 
and 
Personnel 
(DAP). 
The 
secretariat 
of 
the 
MTB 
also handles 
procurement 
of 
the 
MAFS 
and other donor 
financed 
projects. 
The 
existing 
Supplies 
Officer 
has 
been 
involved 
in 
procurement 
under 
the 
on-going 
Tanzania 
Agriculture 
Research 
Project, 
Phase 
I1 
(TAW 
II), 
financed 
by 
IDA. 
He 
is 
familiar 
with 
both 
the 
PPA 
and 
IDA 
procurement 
procedures. 
However, 
during 
the 
capacity 
assessment 
exercise, 
it 
was 
learned that 
he 
has 
recently received 
a 
transfer 
letter 
to 
another 
Ministry 
and 
his 
replacement 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
identified. 
At 
appraisal, 
it 
was agreed 
that 
confirmation 
of 
his 
replacement 
will 
be 
obtained 
at 
credit 
negotiations. 
Procurement 
at 
district 
level 
will 
be 
mainstreamed 
within 
the 
district 
councils' organizational 
structure. 
In 
district 
councils, procurement 
is 
carried 
out 
by 
ten 
(10) 
individual 
departments. 
Procurements 
of 
each department 
are 
done 
by 
a 
Supplies 
Officer 
belonging 
to 
the 
department 
using 
Supplies 
Officers 
assigned 
to 
the 
departments. 
The most common 
procurement 
method 
used 
is 
national 
shopping. 
The district 
councils 
have 
no 
adequate 
experience 
in 
procurement planning, preparation 
of 
bidding 
documents, 
bid 
evaluation, and 
contract 
management 
and administration. 
Procurement 
filing 
and 
record 
keeping 
systems 
are also inadequate. 
Capacity 
will 
be 
strengthened 
during 
the 
project 
implementation 
period. 
During 
the 
appraisal mission, 
the 
mission 
visited 
one 
of 
the 
communities 
undertaking 
a 
subproject 
pilot 
and 
learned 
that 
its 
SC 
had 
received 
training 
in 
basic 
principles 
of 
community 
procurement. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
SC 
was 
carrying 
out the procurement 
of 
the 
materials 
required 
for 
the 
subproject 
in 
a transparent 
and 
economical 
manner. 
However, 
SC 
had 
asked 
for 
more 
guidance 
on 
how 
to 
keep 
procurement 
records 
for 
future 
audits. 
The 
SC's 
procurement 
capacity 
will 
be 
further 
strengthened 
during 
the 
project implementation 
period. 
Procurement 
capacity 
assessment 
of 
Zanzibar 
implementing 
agencies 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
IDA 
before March, 
2004.

Procurement 
Plan 
The 
MAFS 
has 
prepared 
an 
overall 
procurement 
plan for 
a 
five-year 
project 
period. 
In 
addition, 
MAFS 
has 
prepared 
a 
detailed 
procurement 
plan for 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
first 
year 
draft 
procurement 
plan 
includes 
information 
on all 
goods, 
works, and 
consulting 
services expected 
to 
be 
procured, 
and 
their 
estimated 
cost; 
procurement 
I 
selection 
method; 
and 
time 
frame 
for 
the 
procurement/selection 
process. 
The 
five-year procurement 
plan 
will 
be 
updated 
on 
annual 
basis 
in 
conjunction 
with 
preparation 
of 
the 
AWP&B.  Although 
the 
type 
of 
activities 
to 
be financed 
under 
the 
project 
for 
the 
communitylfarmer 
groups 
subprojects  have 
been 
defined, 
the 
specific 
procurement 
(civil 
works 
and 
goods) 
of 
CISIFGIS 
are 
yet 
to 
be 
defined 
ex-ante. 
Therefore, 
the 
first 
year 
procurement 
plan 
will 
only 
indicate 
the 
lump 
sum 
amounts 
apportioned 
to 
be 
disbursed 
on 
quarterly 
basis. 
The 
procurement 
associated 
with 
the

where needed 
installation 
requirements. 
The 
request 
for 
quotations 
should be 
sent 
to 
at 
least 
three 
reputable 
suppliers, 
however 
it 
is 
advisable 
to 
approach 
up 
to 
six 
suppliers, 
so 
that 
if 
some 
of 
them 
do 
not 
respond, 
chances are 
there 
that 
at 
least 
three 
competitive 
quotations 
would 
be 
received. 
In 
case 
of 
IS, 
quotations 
should 
be 
solicited 
from 
at least 
three 
suppliers 
in 
two 
different 
countries. Quotations 
will 
be 
opened 
and evaluated at the 
same 
time.  Whenever possible, 
goods 
of 
similar 
nature 
needed 
during 
same 
period, should 
be 
grouped 
into 
packages 
of 
US$ 
100,000 
equivalent 
or 
more, 
so 
that 
they 
can 
be 
procured 
through 
ICB.

Summary 
of 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
The 
financial 
management 
assessment 
carried 
out 
for 
Tanzania 
mainland 
by 
the 
Financial 
Management Specialist 
prior 
to 
appraisal 
mission 
revealed that 
generally, 
PCU/MAFS 
and 
Hai 
district 
(one 
of 
the 
two 
pilot 
districts) 
have 
sound 
financial 
management arrangements 
to 
implement 
the 
project. 
The 
project 
has 
developed a satisfactory 
project 
accounting and 
financial 
management 
manual 
that 
will 
be 
used 
as 
a 
guide 
to 
disbursement 
of 
the 
project 
funds. 
In 
addition 
a 
community financial 
and 
procurement handbook 
is 
being 
developed. 
At 
the 
district 
level, 
there 
are 
sound 
accounting 
system 
and 
financial 
management 
guidelines 
for 
the 
control 
of 
public 
finances. 
Many 
of 
the 
public 
financial 
rules 
have 
recently 
been 
updated and 
strengthened 
through 
the 
new 
Public 
Finance 
Act, 
2001. 
Subsequently, 
there 
have 
been 
on going 
initiatives 
to 
enhance 
financial 
management 
at 
both 
central ministries 
and 
local 
authorities 
through 
the 
Public Financial 
Management 
Reforms Program 
(PFMRP) and 
Local 
Government 
Reform 
Program 
(LGP). 
This 
also 
includes 
the 
implementation 
of 
a computer 
based 
Integrated 
Financial 
Management System 
(IFMS) 
using 
the 
EPICOR 
accounting 
package 
at 
the 
ministries, 
LGAs 
and 
districts. 
Already 
a 
number 
of 
actions 
and 
initiatives 
are 
being 
undertaken 
by 
the 
government 
to 
strengthen 
the 
accounting 
and 
financial 
reporting 
system 
within 
central 
government 
and 
local 
authorities. 
The financial 
management 
capacity 
assessment 
of 
Zanzibar 
implementing 
agencies 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
IDA 
before March, 
2004. 
Accounting and 
Financial 
Management 
Arrangements 
The 
details 
of 
the 
accounting and 
financial 
management arrangements 
are 
covered 
under 
the 
Project 
Financial Manual. 
The 
manual 
was 
reviewed 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
Financial 
management 
Specialist 
and 
found 
to 
be 
adequate 
for 
the 
management 
of 
the 
project 
funds. 
The 
manual 
gives 
an 
outline 
of 
the 
financial 
management procedures, 
financial reporting 
which 
include 
FMRs 
and auditing. 
There 
will 
be 
two 
separate 
Project 
Accounts 
opened 
with 
commercial 
banks, one 
for 
the 
Mainland 
and 
the 
other 
for 
Zanzibar.

Summary 
of 
Environmental Assessment 
and Management Framework 
TANZANIA: Participatory Agricultural Development and 
Empowerment 
Project 
Summary 
of 
Environmental Assessment 
and Management Framework 
This 
report 
provides 
guidelines 
for 
assessing 
possible 
environmental 
and 
social impacts 
of 
the 
subprojects 
to 
be 
funded 
under 
the 
Participatory 
Agricultural 
Development and Empowerment Project 
(PADEP). 
The 
guidelines 
provide 
a 
framework 
for 
screening 
community 
and farmer 
groups 
subprojects 
to 
determine 
their 
environmental and social 
impacts. 
The 
guidelines 
furthermore 
show 
how 
determination should 
be 
made 
and appropriate 
mitigating 
measures 
incorporated 
into 
the subprojects 
report. 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
PADEP 
is 
to 
raise 
the 
production 
of 
food, incomes, 
and 
assets 
of 
participating 
households 
and 
groups 
in 
a 
sustainable 
manner 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
small 
agricultural 
development 
subprojects 
planned 
and managed 
by 
groups 
of 
community 
members 
and 
farmers. 
The project 
has 
two 
components: 
(i) 
Community 
Agricultural 
Development 
Subprojects; 
and 
(ii) 
Capacity 
Building 
and 
Institutional 
Strengthening. 
The 
total project 
cost 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
US$ 
70.6 
million 
equivalent, 
of 
which 
IDA 
will 
finance 
US$ 
56.0 
million, 
beneficiaries 
will 
contribute 
US$ 
12.0 
million, 
and 
Government 
(national 
and 
district 
councils) 
will 
provide 
US$ 
2.6 
million. 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
grants 
to 
communities 
and 
farmer 
groups 
for 
investment 
in 
agricultural 
development 
subprojects, 
focusing 
primarily 
on improving soil 
fertility 
and 
land 
management, 
adopting 
sustainable 
agricultural 
technologies and 
increasing 
efficiency 
in 
inputs 
and outputs 
marketing. 
The 
soil 
fertility 
and 
land 
management 
subprojects 
will 
included 
watershed 
management 
for 
soil 
and 
water 
conservation, conservation 
tillage 
and efficient 
use 
of 
inorganic fertilizers. 
Similarly, 
under 
the 
adoption 
of 
sustainable 
agricultural 
technologies, 
subprojects such 
as 
integrated 
plant 
nutrition 
techniqueshtrategies 
(IPNS), 
integrated 
pest management, 
water 
harvesting 
techniques, 
improvement 
of 
traditional 
irrigation 
schemes, 
improved livestock 
production, 
introduction 
of 
non-traditional 
crops 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
rural 
infrastructure 
will 
be 
undertaken. 
Finally, 
subprojects 
aiming 
at 
increasing 
efficiency 
in 
input 
and 
output 
marketing 
like 
supply 
of 
farm 
inputs, 
rural 
processing 
of 
agricultural 
and 
livestock 
products 
as 
well 
as 
improvement 
of 
products 
marketing 
will 
be 
funded. 
There 
are 
several 
positive 
socioeconomic 
and environmental impacts 
that 
are 
expected 
due 
to 
implementation 
of 
subprojects 
which 
are 
eligible 
for PADEP 
funding. 
Amongst 
them 
are: 
improved 
skills 
for 
farmers; 
improved 
soil 
fertility 
and 
better 
land 
management; 
higher 
degree 
of 
environmental 
awareness; 
increased 
productivity; 
increased 
land, 
soil 
and 
water conservation; 
improved 
soil 
structure 
due 
to 
the 
use 
of 
manure and organic 
fertilizers; 
value 
added 
due 
to 
processing; 
and reduced post 
harvest 
losses 
through 
improvement 
of 
rural 
storage 
facilities. 
While 
beneficial 
subprojects 
are 
likely 
to 
represent 
a substantial 
portion 
of 
overall 
PADEP 
funded 
subprojects, 
it 
is 
recognized 
that 
negative 
environmental 
and 
social 
impacts 
are 
also 
likely 
to 
be 
generated 
in 
the 
course 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
subprojects. 
In 
this 
report, the 
typical 
environmental 
and 
social 
impacts 
for 
each 
of 
the 
likely 
subprojects 
have 
been 
analyzed, 
and 
mitigation 
measures 
to 
be 
deployed 
have been 
proposed. 
Overall, 
PADEP, 
which 
is 
a 
community 
driven 
development 
(CDD) project 
is 
classified 
as 
Category 
B 
project.  However, 
since 
the 
subprojects 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
PADEP 
are 
small 
and 
because 
rural 
people 
will 
be 
the 
drivers 
of 
the 
subprojects, 
the 
process 
of 
environmental and social 
screening 
has 
been made 
simple 
and 
informative.  The 
process 
will 
consist 
of 
the 
following 
steps: 
preparation 
of 
environmental 
profiles; 
assigning category 
to 
a subproject; 
scooping 
and 
public 
consultations; 
conducting environmental 
assessment; 
review 
and approval 
of 
environmental 
assessment 
reports; 
and 
disclosure 
and 
appeal 
procedures.  These 
steps 
have 
been described 
in 
details 
to 
enable 
districts 
and 
communities 
understand 
the 
process 
involved. 
An 
environmental and social checklist 
by 
subproject 
types 
has 
been 
included 
to

Page  89
assist 
district 
facilitation 
teams, 
communities 
and farmer 
groups 
in 
the 
screening 
process. 
The 
environmental 
screening 
process, 
therefore, 
will 
include 
questions 
pertaining 
to 
safeguard 
policy 
requirements. 
The 
subsequent 
EA 
work 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
based 
on 
the screening results and 
related 
recommendations 
on 
subproject’s 
category. 
For 
example, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
environmental 
screening 
process, 
the 
resulting 
EA 
work 
may 
also 
require 
a subproject-specific 
Pest 
Management 
Plan 
based 
on 
Integrated 
Pest 
Management 
approaches, 
or 
Resettlement 
Action 
Plan. 
If 
the 
later 
is 
being 
prepared 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
EA 
work, 
the 
RAP 
will 
be 
a 
separate 
document 
and 
disclosed 
separately 
after 
being 
cleared 
by 
NEMC 
and 
the 
Bank. 
The 
environmental 
assessment 
(including 
social 
and socioeconomic 
aspects) 
itself 
will 
follow 
a 
number 
of 
steps, 
including 
impact 
assessment 
- 
based 
on 
screening 
and scoping 
exercise; 
analysis 
of 
alternatives 
- 
to 
enhance 
the 
design 
of 
a 
subproject, 
including 
do 
nothing 
alternative; 
predictions 
- 
to 
provide 
information 
on 
the 
potential 
implication 
of 
the 
proposed 
subproject; 
evaluation 
of 
signijkance 
- 
to 
determine 
the 
predicted 
or 
measured 
change 
in 
an 
environment and 
social 
attributes; 
identiJjt 
mitigation 
measures 
- 
to 
reduce adverse 
environmental 
and 
social 
impacts; 
and 
public 
consultations 
- 
with 
affected 
or 
interested 
groups 
and 
NGOs 
during 
screening, 
scooping and 
preparation 
of 
TOR 
and 
EA 
report. 
The 
review 
and 
approval 
of 
Category 
B 
environmental 
assessment 
report, 
which 
includes social 
aspects 
will 
be 
done 
by 
the 
National 
Environmental 
Management 
Council 
(NEMC), 
or 
an 
agency 
accredited 
by 
NEMC, 
which 
is 
responsible 
for 
EIA 
clearance 
in 
Tanzania. 
The 
EA 
report 
will 
include 
a section 
on 
the 
Environmental 
and 
Social 
Management 
Plan 
(ESMP). 
For 
subprojects 
which 
are 
likely 
to 
increase 
pest 
problems, a subproject-specific 
Pest 
Management 
Plan 
(PMP) 
based 
on 
Integrated 
Pest 
Management 
(IPM) 
will 
be 
prepared. 
In 
subprojects 
that 
are 
expected 
to 
introduce 
changes 
in 
access 
to 
land 
or 
changes 
in 
ownership 
and 
use 
of 
land 
and property, 
a 
concise 
Resettlement 
Action 
Plan 
(RAP) 
will 
be 
prepared 
according 
to 
the 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
(RPF), 
which 
has 
been 
disclosed 
separately. 
The 
institutional 
arrangements 
will 
seek 
to 
promote and 
enhance 
efficiency, 
effectiveness, transparency 
and accountability, 
reduce 
red 
tape 
and 
bureaucracy. 
Instead, 
they 
will 
aim 
at 
strengthening 
community 
participation, 
empowerment and 
ownership 
of 
processes 
leading 
to 
the 
subprojects. 
The 
Community 
Subproject 
Committee 
(CSC) 
and 
Farmer Groups 
Subproject 
Committee 
(FGSC) 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
overseeing 
the 
preparation 
of 
EA 
reports and implementation 
of 
agreed 
mitigation 
measures 
for 
community 
investments 
(CIS) 
and farmer 
groups 
investments 
(FGIS) 
subprojects, 
according 
to 
the 
environmental 
and 
social 
plan 
(ESMP), Resettlement 
Action 
Plan 
(RAP) and project-specific 
Pest 
Management 
Plan 
(PMP). 
The 
District 
Facilitation 
Team 
(DFT) 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
assisting the 
communities 
in 
preparing 
their 
specific 
TORS 
and 
EA 
reports 
and developing 
ESMP 
and 
RAP 
plans. 
The 
DFT 
will 
also 
monitor 
and 
supervise 
the 
implementation 
of 
these 
plans 
and 
report 
progress 
back 
to 
PADEP. 
At 
national level, 
PADEP/Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Food 
Security 
(MAFS) 
Environmental 
Assessment 
Unit 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
developing 
the 
generic 
Terms 
of 
Reference 
(TORS) 
for 
EA, 
capacity 
building 
and backstopping 
of 
districts and supervision 
of 
implementation 
of 
ESMP, 
RAP 
and 
project-specific 
PMP 
based 
on IPM. 
Resources 
will 
be 
made 
available 
for 
training 
of 
MAFS 
EU 
staff, 
DFT 
and 
communities 
to 
identify 
and 
address 
environmental and social 
issues 
of 
the 
subprojects. 
The 
costs 
of 
capacity 
building 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and social 
aspects 
shall 
be 
part 
of 
the 
component 
2 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
estimated 
costs 
of 
undertaking 
training 
in 
environmental 
and 
social 
assessment 
will 
be 
determined 
according 
to 
the 
needs 
assessment. 
The 
Environmental 
Assessment 
and Social 
aspects 
training 
manual 
prepared 
by 
NEMC 
will 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
developing project-specific 
modules. 
Training 
on 
Bank 
safeguards 
will 
be 
added 
into 
the 
modules 
prepared 
by 
PADEP 
consultant. 
Public 
understanding about 
the 
proposed 
subprojects 
and 
their 
possible environmental and social impacts 
- 
83 
- 
Page  90
will 
be 
key 
to 
their 
successful 
implementation. 
These 
environmental 
and 
social 
issues 
shall 
therefore 
be 
fully 
covered 
in 
the 
participatory 
assessment 
leading 
up 
to 
selection 
of 
the 
proposed 
subprojects, 
and 
in 
subsequent design. 
The 
District 
Facilitation 
Team 
(DFT) 
shall 
be 
fully 
prepared 
to lead 
public 
discussion 
of 
environmental 
and 
social 
issues. 
In 
order to raise 
awareness 
of 
communities 
about 
the 
potential 
environmental and 
social impacts 
of 
PADEP 
funded activities, 
a 
number 
of 
sensitization 
meetings 
will 
be 
held. 
These 
will 
include meeting 
with 
village 
leaders, 
village 
assembles, 
workshops 
to 
launch implementation 
of 
mitigation 
plans 
and 
seminars 
to 
discuss 
various 
environmental 
and 
social 
assessment 
themes. 
PADEP 
will 
design 
communication 
strategy 
to 
enhance 
consultations. 
This 
will
