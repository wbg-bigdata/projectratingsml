MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Kingdom of Thailand for US$50 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The loan would help finance a highway sector project and would be
for a term of 17 years including a four-year grace period, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
2.        Background.  Since the mid-1960s the Thai economy has grown
rapidly.  This growth has generated a steadily rising demand for transport
services. To accommodate the demand, the Government has undertaken large
transport investments (in particular for road infrastructure) and has created
a policy environment in which a competitive transport industry has
developed. Today, all changwats (provinces) are interlinked with a good
interregional communications network, and transport services have penetrated
most of the rural areas.
3.        Supported by large infrastructure investments, road transport has
become the predominant mode of transport. The 45,300 km network of national
and provincial highways was built largely in the 1960s and 1970s. By 1981,
the end of the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan, some 79Z of the present
paved network was completed. Increasingly, the challenge of road transport
has shifted from building new roads to providing for their maintenance and
gradual upgrading, which requires better pavement management. Expenditures
for these purposes under the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1982-86) have
amounted to about US$215 million equivalent which is 30% of the highway
development expenditures. Under the sixth plan (1987-91) this proportion is
expected to rise to about 40%. Specific highway subsectoral goals involve
achieving a proper balan,.e between investment and maintenance expenditures,
including rehabilitating highways, reducing traffic congestion and providing a
higher level of road safety. The proposed Highway Sector Project supports the
Government's Sixth Five-Year Development Plan for the national and provincial
roads system by focusing on the overall adequacy of highway maintenance,
paving of provincial roads, road safety, and training of the Department of
Highways' (DOH) staff.  The proposed project is the first of two financing
*          operations that the Government is seeking from the Bank to help finance its
highway sector program.
*          4.        The Bank has supported Government's initiatives in the transport
sector with financial and technical assistance through 20 transportation
projects totalling US$614.6 million. DOH has been the largest recipient of
loan funds with US$396.6 million, followed by the State Railway of Thailand
with US$81.7 million, the Port Authority of Thailand with US$67.3 million, the
Harbour Department with US$53 million, and the Ministry of Interior with US$16
million for Bangkok traffic improvement. Of these 20 projects, 16 have been
completed.  Eight Bank loans have been made to DOH.  The loans helped finance



-2-
construction and/or rehabilitation of about 3,100 km of national and 2,800 km
of provincial roads, and provided technical assistance for the reorganization
of DOH and training of its staff, funds for a study of road maintenance,
equipment for road maintenance and workshops, technical assistance to the
Transport Planning Unit in the Ministry of Communications, and funds for a
series of feasibility and engineering studies to improve sector operations and
to prepare road projects. Six of these projects have been completed and their
object3'ves achieved, although there were some implementation deLays. The
seventh project, for construction of 740 km of provincial roads, is substan-
tially completed. The eighth project, under implementation, is proceeding
well. It reflects the increasing importance of maintenance operations and it
includes, among other components, strengthening and rehabilitation works on
about 1,000 km of paved roads.
5.        Project Objectives.  The proposed highway sector project is a
logical continuation of the Bank's involvement in the sector. It will support
the Government's policy as enunciated in the Sixth Development Plan to
emphasize improved maintenance and rehabilitation of the road network and thus
help the Government in sustaining an efficient road transport system.
Specific institutional and technical objectives to be addressed by the project
would support DOH in pursuing and increasing ongoing ef' rts to (a) improve
road maintenance efficiency; (b) continue the road rehabilitation program;
(c) upgrade planning and programming of pavement strengthening and resealing;
(d) undertake selected road improvements; and -(e) reduce road traffic hazards.
6.        Project Description.  The Ministry of Communications will be respon-
sible for implementing the project through DOH, an arrangement that has worked
well for previous Bank-assisted highway projects. DOH is a mature institution
capable of planning, programming and executing road programs and it is a
competent agency to carry out the project. The loan would finance components
of DOH's 1987-91 road development plan and periodic maintenance program.
Specific subprojects to be financed under the loan would be defined annually
on the basis of agreed-upon criteria and procedures for selection and
implementation. Major components of DOH's program, for which most of the loan
proceeds would be used, are rehabilitation, periodic maintenance and paving
programs. Other components include road safety, training program, equipment
for pavement testing and for auditing and consultant services.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project reflects Bank views on
appropriate sector development strategy emphasizing improved operations and
better maintenance of the existing highway network. It would continue the
Bank's support of DOH's programs and policies. Together with the recently
approved Railway Efficiency Improvement Project, it represents a major effort
to increase capacity utilization of the existing transport infrastructure and
improve efficiency of goods and passenger transport.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed with the Bank on: (a) the
level and composition of DOH's 1987-91 program, including estimated budget
support to ensure adequate road mainterance; (b) the financing plan for DOH's
1987-91 program; (c) an annual review of DOH's program and its financing to
ensure a balanced program implementation; (d) the priority of rehabilitation
and maintenance works over new road construction; (e) the action programs for



nationwide impLementation of systems for pavement and equipment management,
for training of DOH's personnel, for control of truck overloading and for
improvement of safety; (f) the selection criteria for the road works to be
included in the investment program; and (g) the procedures related to the
evaluation of subprojects in order to bE eligible for Bank financing.
i- 9.Justification.  The condition of the highway network in Thailand is
generally fair but in danger of deteriorating. Many of the roads in fair
condition-actually need asphaltic overlays and resealing; otherwise, they will
deteriorate to poor condition over the next few years and their subsequent
rehabilitation would eventually cost a multiple of the present repair cost.
Furthermore, about 5,000 km of paved roads are in need of rehabilitation. The
proposed project would continue the Bank's support of DOl programs and
policies to improve efficiency of the highway network. The minimum economic
return for subprojects to be included in DOH's sixth plan is 12%, equal to the
opportunity cost of capital in Thailand. The roads already included in the
1988 program for Bank financing have an economic rate of return in the 141 to
46% range.
l0.       Risks.  There are no serious technical or organizational risks.  DOH
has an adequate organization and experience to implement the project. The
wide range of subprojects and the flexibility afforded in the commitment of
loan funds should result in smooth implementation of the project. There is no
undue environmental risk associated with the project.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
