SYRLAN ARAB REPUBLIC
ALEPPO SEWERAGE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMVARY
Borrower:      Syrian Arab Republic.
Loan Amount:  US$70 Million.
Terms:         Fifteen years, including three years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate. US$69.2 million would be onlent to the
Aleppo General Company for Sewerage for a term of seventeen and
one half years, including three and one half years of grace,
with  interest  at  the  Bank's  standard  variable  rate.   The
Borrower would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project
Description:  The  proposed  project  constitutes  the  least  cost solution  to
collect and evacuate wastewater in the city of Aleppo, the
second largest city in Syria. It has received the highest
priority in the Government's most recent budget.   Its primary
objectives are: (i) to provide sewage treatment and disposal
facilities for 1.75 million equivaient inhabitants; "' (ii) to
improve water quality In che Kouek River flowing through Aleppo,
which is adversely affected by the discharge of raw sewage;
(iii)   to   connect   urban-poor   settlements,   new   housing
developments and industrial zones to the municipal sewer
network; and (iv) to help organize sewerage services through the
establishment of adequate institutional structures and the
development  of  appropriate  financial  policies.   The  project
would   generate   substantial   economic   benefits   from   the
reclamation of waste water and its reuse in existing irrigated
areas downstream of the municipality and  from improvements  in
the health of the population in the project area.
The  project  includes:  (a) construction  of a sewage  treatment
plant   to   serve    1.75   million   equivalent    inhabitants;
(b) construction  of  trunk  sewers  (about  50  km) and overflow
structures; (c) construction of two pumping stations and about 8
km of force mains; (d) establishment of a sewerage authority
including construction of workshops, supply of vehicles and
maintenance equipment; and (e) provision of training, technical
assistance and consultant's services to supervise construction
and   undertake   specialized   studies,   including   engineering,
financial and organization studies.
The project would directly benefit about 1.3 million people by
the year 1991.  The risks associated with the project are those
arising from the establishment of a new sewerage authority and
those normally associated with implementing a project of this
magnitude.   Provisions  for  training and  technical  assistance,
and adoption of financial policies aimed at making sewerage
authorities  financially  viable  would  assist   in  minimizing
project risks.
Comprises a population of 1.58 million and industrial waste discharge
equivaLent to a population of 0.17 million by the year 1995.

SYRJAN ARAB REPUBLIC
ALEPPO SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
L WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Water Resources
1.01     Although the total volume of water available throughout Syria for
urban, industrial and agricultural use is adequate, its uneven geographic
distribution causes severe water shortages in some cities. The most important
aquifers are the karstic limestones, dolomites and chalky limestones which
produce the more significant springs supplying water to Damascus, Homs,
Lattakia and Sweida.  Surface water is drawn from the Euphrates River, which
serves Aleppo and from the Assi River, which provides for the needs of Hama
and several small villages. The Barada River, which flows through Damascus,
is used only for irrigation because it is heavily polluted by urban sewage.
The growing problem of pollution is particularly evident in the Aleppo area
where the use of raw sewage for irrigation of vegetables is suspected to be
linked with the incidence of certain water-related diseases.
Sector Organization
1.02     The Ministry of Irrigation manages water resources.  Thirteen water
authorities located in the capital city of each governorate are responsible,
under the Ministry of Housing and Utilities (MHU), for all aspects of water
supply  in  their  respective  cities.   In other  municipalities  water supply
systems are operated by municipal staff.  At present there are no national,
regional  or  municipal  sewerage  authorities.   Governorate  and  municipal
technical services operate and manage existing sewerage networks in addition
to their other responsibilities, but in most cases they lack managerial and
financial  resources  to  provide  adequate  services.   MHU  provides  general
guidance and assistance to these technical services and water authorities
through two specialized departments at its headquarters in Damascus dealing
with potable water supply and sewerage. On request of the municipalities and
governorates these departments design facilities or advise in the design of
facilities to develop water sources, water treatment plants, main distribution
systems and reservoirs for water supply, as well as sewage collection systems
and small industrial sewage treatment facilities. The main constraints that
the Government faces in developing the sewerage sector are inadequate
financial policies, institutional deficiencies, and slow staff development.
There is a shortage of skilled manpower mainly on account of a lack of formal
training programs in the sector, and lack of appropriate incentives to attract
staff in public services. Aware of these difficulties, the Government has
decided to restructure the sewerage sector by establishing financially viable
companies (para 4.03) and with the Arab Fund's financial assistance is
instituting a training center specialized in water supply and sewerage
operations in Damascus.



-2-
Water SUPPlY
1.03     The level of access to water supply in Syria (measured in terms of
house connections) is above the average of about 65% for the Middle East
Region. This reflects the Government's strategy which gives priority to the
sector and emphasizes the provision of house connections in preference to
public taps in both urban and rural areas. In the past, urban water supply
has been rightly given a high priority. As a result, most of the cities enjoy
a high service level. Public water authorities, established in thirteen large
cities, operate extensive distribution networks serving nearly all households
except those in unauthorized settlements, where public taps are installed.
However, as a result of migration to urban areas, and reduced investments in
water supply works during the early seventies, available water was no longer
sufficient to meet the growing urban population's demand and large investments
to expand these systems were required. In support of the Government objective
to reduce water shortages in urban areas, the Bank provided assistance to
complete three projects to expand supply in the two largest cities of the
country,  Damascus and Aleppo.   With the implementation of these and other
planned projects, it is estimated that the urban population served by house
connections could rise from the present level of about 80% to about 85% in
1990 possibly reaching 95% by year 2000.   Rural population with access to
public water supply could increase from about 62% at present to 85% in 1990
possibly reaching 90% by the turn of the century. These estimates are in line
with the Government's sectoral  investment  objectives.   Public  expenditures
allocated to the water supply sector in the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1981-1985)
amount to LS 2,440 million (US$ 618 million) or about 2.5 percent of total
public investments. The Government intends to give the same priority to the
water supply sector during its sixth Development Plan (1986-1990) with planned
investments totaling LS 3,290 million (US$ 833 million) or about 2.7 percent
to total public investments.
Solid Waste
1.04     The Government is also taking steps to improve solid waste collection
and disposal. As a result of a study carried out by the Ministry of Housing
and Utilities, a draft decree is pending Parliament ratification to create
specialized public enterprises in each Governorate.  In Aleppo solid waste is
already treated in a composting plant, and in Damascus construction of a solid
waste treatment and composting plant is scheduled to start by mid-1986 with
the financial assistance of the Arab Fund.
Sewerage
1.05     The development of the sewerage sector has not kept pace with that of
the water sector.  Although combined and separate sewerage systems exist in
most medium-sized and large cities, they have not been extended to cope with
the  rapid  expansion  of  the  cities  and are  poorly  maintained.   Sewerage
investments in the Fith Five-Year Plan (1981-L985) represent LS 696 million
(US$ 176 million) or 0.6 percent of total public expenditures. At present,



- 3 -
there are no municipal sewage treatment plants in Syria (construction of the
first two sewage treatment plants in Homs and Hama is expected to start by
mid-1986) and no specific laws or regulations exist for governing treatment
plant  performance  or  receiving water  standards.   All  cities  and villages
discharge  untreated  sewage  into  lakes  and   rivers,  which  are  often  not
perennial while coastal communities discharge their effluents at the shore
line.  This practice results  in serious  pollution  of  the  environment  and
creates a serious health hazard to the population. The discharge of untreated
sewage into rivers prevents their use as traditional water sources for
domestic  water  supply.   Widespread  use  of  the undiluted  raw  sewage  and
polluted river water for irrigation of small agricultural plots is common.
From 1970 to 1984 at least eight major outbreaks of cholera took place in
areas  where  sewage  is  utilized  for  contact  irrigation  of  vegetables,
particularly in Aleppo, Homs, Hama, Daraa and Damascus.
1.06.    It is estimated that about 66Z of the total urban population of Syria
is at present connected to the municipal sewage collection systems.  In Aleppo
approximately 80Z of its actual population of 1.1 million inhabitants are
served by an existing network of gravity combined sewers.   The  quality of
recently constructed sewer networks is acceptable, and extension of secondary
networks is keeping pace with planned urban development and upgrading of
unplanned residential areas. The percentage of sewer connections is expected
to rise gradually to 95Z of the urban dwellings by the year 2000.
Government's Sector Obiectives
1.07.    The  Government's  primary objective in the sewerage sector is the
improvement of health and enhancement of envirormental conditions through the
abatement of pollution created by the discharge of urban and industrial sewage
to open drains and rivers. To meet its sewerage development objectives, the
Government plans to invest about LS 2,850 million (US$ 720 million) during the
Sixth Five-Year Plan (1986-1990).  These objectives will be achieved through
the construction of sewage treatment and disposal facilities serving the urban
centers and through the construction of trunk and secondary sewers conveying
wastewater to these treatment plants.  Following the Homs and Hama Sewerage
Project, the Government gives highest priority to the proposed sewerage
project for Aleppo and intends to proceed with the investments for trunk
sewers and sewage treatment plants in Damascus,  Lattakia,  Idlib and Sweida
during its Sixth Development Plan (1986-1990).
1.08.    Another  important sectoral objective  of the Government,  to develop
and organize the sewerage sector, will be achieved by the creation of
semi-autonomous sewerage companies (GECOS) to operate, maintain, and develop
the existing sewerage systems.
The Bank's Involvement and Sectora! Stratei
1.09.    The Bank has made two loans and one credit totalling $100.0 million
to assist the institutional and infrastructure developments of water supply
services in the cities of Damascus and Aleppo and one loan of US$30.0 million



for institutional and infrastructure development of sewerage services in the
cities of Homs and Hama.  An IDA Credit of US$15.0 million approved in 1973
(Credit 401-SYR) financed the first phase of the water distribution works in
Damascus and pollution control studies for the Barada and Assi Rivers. Water
supply works for Damascus, partly financed by a 1976 Bank loan of US$35.0
million (Loan 1241-SYR). were completed satisfactorily in April 1980, within
four months of the original contract schedule. The combined completion report
on the first two Damascus Water Supply Projects (PCR of June 23, 1983)
concluded that these projects had met their objectives of providing additional
water to the increasing population in the areas served, and contributed
greatly towards the development of the water authority into a technically
sound and financially viable institution.   In Aleppo, the first Bank project
in the sector was a US$50.0 million loan (Loan 1458-SYR) to help finance the
construction of a 73 km water transmission line between Lake Assad and Aleppo,
water treatment plants expansion, improvements to existing water distribution
systems and engineering studies for a sewerage master plan.  All facilities
are now in operation and the loan was closed on December 31, 1983- The project
completion report of Loan 1458-SYR dated November 18, 1985 concluded that the
major project objectives of augmenting the water supply in Aleppo and carrying
out sewerage feasibility studies in Aleppo and Lattakia have been met. Loan
1458-SYR also included the study of pollution control in the Kouek River, and
feasibility and detailed design studies for sewage treatment plants in Aleppo
and Lattakia. These studies are the basis for this project. Finally, in May
1984 the Bank approved a loan for the First Sewerage Project (Loan 2420-SYR of
US$30 million) in the cities of Homs and Hama for which project implementation
is proceeding satisfactorily after initial delays due to unfamiliarity with
procurement procedures.
1.10.    In 1985, the Government and the Bank agreed on the thrust of a water
supply and sewerage sector study which is now almost completed. This study
will supplement sector data, identify constraints in the development of the
sector, formulate strategies for investments and training and identify
suitable projects for possible future lending by external agencies.
1.11.    The  Bank's  overall  strategy  is  to assist  the  Government  in  the
development of the sewerage sector, specifically to: (i) organize the sewerage
sector through the establishment of adequate institutional structures and the
introduction  of  appropriate   financial   policies;   (ii)  ensure  adequate
construction of main sewer and storm water drainage networks; (iii) provide
sewage treatment and disposal facilities for Syria's largest cities where
unacceptable health and environmental conditions prevail; (iv) improve water
quality in the rivers flowing through these cities which are adversely
affected by the discharge of raw sewage; (v) connect sewered residential and
industrial areas to the main sewer networks; and (vi) promote the reuse of
treated water for agriculture.   The proposed project  is in line  with  the
sector development strategy.
Bank's Experience with Past Lending
1.12     Experience with  past  lending  to  Syria  has  shown  that  procedures
leading to contract award are complex and lengthy but that once the decision



to award a contract is taken, progress in physical implementation, the quality
of  the works and the adherence to contractual costs are satisfactory.   The
distribution works included in the First Damascus Project were completed in 34
months, which was within the contract period. Construction work on the Figeh
spring development and the tunnel and terminal reservoirs, which were all part
of the second Damascus Project, started in July 1976 and were completed in
April 1980 with only four months delay in spite of poorer than anticipated
rock  conditions.   Finally,  in  Aleppo  the main  construction  contract  was
completed within two months of the expected contract completion date. Despite
these successes, the process of tendering, bid evaluation and contract award
has been  lengthy.   Local  consultants  hired by  the Technical Ministries  to
assist in procurement activities are overloaded, short of experienced staff
and lack international exposure.   The technical Ministries  do not have  the
discretionary power to award contracts upon review of their consultants'
recommendations.   The  bid  evaluation  reports  and  award  proposals  must  be
submitted to the Prime Minister's office, which before approval, seeks the
advice of the Economic and Social Committee. Thus, as many as five months can
elapse  between  proposal  and  actual  contract  award.   The  implementation
schedule for the proposed project includes sufficient time to allow for these
administrative   procedures,  and  the  project  provides  for  international
consulting firms to assist local consultants in bid preparation, evaluation
and project supervision.
1.13     The cash generation objectives in the water supply sector, i.e. set
water charges to cover operation and maintenance costs and debt service and to
generate net revenues to finance at least 10% and 152 of the investment
program of the water supply authorities of Damascus and Aleppo, respectively,
were met until 1979. During the 1980-1984 period, the covenanted contribution
which was increased to 35Z of the respective investment programs, was not
met. However, on April 10, 1985 the Government authorized a water tariff
increase of about 120% for all water authorities. The new tariffs are set to
generate enough revenues to finance in full O&M costs, debt service and
depreciation.    It  is  estimated   that  net   revenues   derived   from   the
implementation of these new tariffs will finance on average about 40Z of the
water authorities investment program for 1986.
ri. POPULATION AND DEMAND FOR SERVICES IN THE PROJECT AREA
Population and City Development
2.01     The  latest census, held  in September 1981, reported a total urban
population of almost 1.0 million in Aleppo. Since the previous census of 1970
the population growth rate has averaged 4.0 percent per year, which is higher
than the Syrian national growth rate of 3.4 percent. The total population of
Aleppo is therefore expected to double about every 18 years. However, because
of physical and economic absorption capacity constraints, the average annual
population growth rate projected by the Government, in line with the
consultants' estimates, averages 4.0 percent during the 1980s and declines to
about 3.0 percent by 2010.  The population projection is shown in Annex 1.



- 6 -
Most of the expected population increase would be concentrated in the western
outskirts of the city while the main industrial developments would take place
to the easc of the city around the airport.  The actual development of the
city follows the land use plans prepared in 1975 by the Aleppo Municipality
Planning Department (Map IBRD N'19098). These plans are updated regularly.
2.02     As a result of the rapid population growth and periodic influxes of
refugees, unauthorized settlements have developed in the outskirts of Aleppo.
Most of these settlements did not have basic water and sanitation services
until the 1979/1980 cholera epidemics when the Government requested the Water
Authority and the Municipality to provide them with water supply and sewerage
services. The project provides for extensions and reinforcement of the city's
main sewer lines to serve these settlements where the urban poor number about
105,000 of the 200,000 inhabitants.
2.03     In addition about 12,000 people, mostly farmers, living in a number
of villages situated downstream of Aleppo along the banks of the Kouek River,
will benefit from reduced levels of river pollution resulting from the
project. Recently, most of these villages have been supplied with piped water.
2.04     Aleppo is the second largest city of the country and the principal
manufacturing and trading city in northern Syria. The city is located between
the Euphrates and the Mediterranean on the ancient trade route from the Far
East.   The  climate  is  Mediterranean  with an  average annual  rainfall  of
330 mm.  The city is built around a citadel,  at an elevation of some 400
meters above sea level, and set in a hollow in the hills below the confluence
of various small valleys forming the catchment of the Kouek River which ends
south of Aleppo in the Zerbe plain. Although there is no natural flow in the
river for most of the year, it is subject to flash floods and a dam has been
constructed to the north of Aleppo at Shehaba to minimize flooding and provide
irrigation water. This dam would be incorporated into the Meskine irrigation
scheme which would also involve the creation of an artificial lake at Khan
Tuman, south of Aleppo. This major scheme would provide a minimum flow in the
Kouek river of about 3 to 4 m3/s.  The river has been canalized in a large
portion of the urban area where its peak flow capacity is estimated at 48
m3/s.
2.05     In accordance with the national objective of distributing industrial
projects throughout the different Governcrates, Aleppo has a number of recent
industrial developments.   At present,  there are about 3,100 private and 50
Government owned industrial establishments. There are four primary industrial
categories:  chemical (plastics, tobacco, paint, rubber, tanning, cement and
oil), food (manufacture of edible oil, brewing, distilling, flour- milling and
cattle slaughtering), textile (including cotton ginning) and engineering
(metal work, wood work, pipe and battery manufacturing). Most of the private
industries are in the food processing and textile manufacturing sectors.
There are eleven major designated industrial zones within the boundaries of
Aleppo city but the municipality has a policy of relocating industries from
the old city and residential areas to new sewered  industrial  zones  on  the
outskirts of the city.   Implementation of this policy is underway.  None of
the existing factories have their own waste water treatment facilities, bu.t



- 7 -
all  of  them are  connected  to the municipal sewerage system.   By Law new
industries are compelled to treat their own sewage or to connect to the
municipal sewer systems.  Therefore, no adverse impact on the environment is
anticipated from industrial waste water after the conmmissioning of the
proposed sewage treatment plant.
Water Demand
2.06     In Aleppo,  piped water is supplied through  about  197,000  metered
connections and 168 public fountains by the local Public Water Authority.
About 89 percent of the total population in Aleppo is served by house
connections. Projections of future water consumption by various categories of
consumers based on the most recent data are shown in Annex 1.
2.07     Of Aleppo's 197,000 metered connections, it is estimated that no more
than 5 percent of the meters are unservicable at any one time, hence data
based on meter readings can be considered to be a fairly reliable indicator of
actual  consumption.   In  1984,  the metered consumption averaged 148,400 m 3
per day of which domestic consumers accounted for 69X, GovernmL-t institutions
24Z, and industry and commerce 7Z. The average water consumption for those
connected to the public system is estimated at about 110 liters per capita per
day (l.c.d), varying from about 86 l.c.d in the congested old area of the
city, to about 233 l.c.d in the new low density developments made up primarily
of single family dwellings  rather than apartment buildings.   With the new
water production facilities commissioned in 1982 (Aleppo Water Supply Project
Loan  1458-SYR)  demand  is  expected  to  be  met  until  about  1996.   With
appropriate measures implemented through the ongoing leak detection and repair
program, unaccounted-for water could be reduced from the present 37Z to about
20Z, which would postpone the need for new investments by about two years, to
1998. Domestic per capita water consumption is expected to reach 130 l.c.d by
the year 2000 (Annex 1).
Sewerage Demand, Pollution Loads and Drainage
2.08     Most of Aleppo city  is sewered with a combined  1/ gravity sewer
network (map IBRD N'19098).  In the old city, the sewer networks were built by
hand using limestone blocks and in new residential and industrial areas they
are made of concrete pipes.  Despite the fact that many of the older sewers
were not well designed and date back hundreds of years, the existing sewerage
network functions reasonably well under dry weather  conditions.   There  is
little evidence of faecal matter or other wastes in the streets, eve.n in
unsewered areas. Since current and planned urban developments are located at
the fringe of the city and at the ends of the system, the trunk sewers are
becoming overloaded and need to be duplicated or replaced. With the exception
of the Nearab/Jebryn residential area near the airport, all sewage flows
collected by existing sewers are discharged into the Kouek river without
I' A combined system conveys sanitary and surface water flows.



- 8 -
treatment.  Since the river has no natural flow for most of the year because
of the damuing up of its uppercourse, this causes noxious conditions along its
embankments.   The  Nearab/Jebryn  area  drains  to  an  outfall  sewer  which
discharges on to open land to the soutni of the railway yard and as yet it does
not appear to constitute a health hazard as there is no direct human/sewage
contact since the area is isolated.
2.09     Projected dry weather sewage  flows  for Aleppo  (Annex  2)  include
infiltration (40X of dry weather flow) and allow for dry weather peak flows.
The infiltration is expected to be reduced to 301 by 1995 as a result of the
rehabilitation  of  the water supply network and better sewer construction.
Projected dry weather flows (DWF) and pollution loads, 5-day biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS), at the site of the proposed
treatment plant (Annex 3) are as follows:

Suspended Solids (kg/day)                  86,200        120,100      165,300
2.10     An estimated 80X of the residents of Aleppo are already connected to
the  sewers  but  certain  areas  inhabited  by  the  poorer  segments  of  the
population presently lack service.  Visual inspections of the illegal housing
areas, particularly those in the eastern part of the city adjacent  to the
airport road, do not indicate important problems of drainage or sewage
ponding.   Many  residents  of  these areas  construct  their  own  sewers  and
sometimes illegally connect them to the nearest public sewer.   Houses not
connected to the system have seepage pits or septic tanks.  For the last five
years the municipality has been executing an urban rehabilitation program and
installing secondary sewer networks in unsewered areas. Continuation of this
program is expected to increase the service level to 951 by year 2000.
2.11     The per capita domestic sewage discharge is estimated at 90 l.c.d.
and would  increase  to about  110  l.c.d.  by  2005.   The  average  domestic
pollution load is estimated at about 45g BOD/capita/day and is expected to
grow to about 55g capita/day in 2005.  Pollution loads generated by industry,
commerce and public establishments are equivalent to about 181 of those from
domestic sewage.
2.12     Rainfall data analysis indicates an average annual precipitation of
332 mm in Aleppo during the 1967-1979 period.  In that period, on only ten to
twenty days each year has rainfall exceeded 10 mm/day; rainfall intensities
are generally low. Rainfall varies with the season ranging from 50 to 70 mm
per month between December and February to less than 10 mm per month from June
to September. During heavy rainfalls, the flows in the combined sewer system
exceed several times the dry weather flows, hence existing sewers are
frequently overloaded causing localized street flooding. The proposed Project
will address this problem (paras. 3.05 a.ad 3.06).

L. THE PROJECJ
Genesis
3.01     Urbanization and industrial activities have created serious pollution
problems in the main cities of Syria.  In 1977, the Banks lending operation
for the Aleppo Water Supply Project (Loan 1458-SYR) included sewerage studies
for  Aleppo  and Lattakia.   Engineering  consultants  (Engineering-Science  of
U.S.A.) were appointed in October 1978 to prepare a sewerage master plan,
feasibility studies, detailed design and tender documents for a sewage
treatment plant for Aleppo. The consultants' work was reviewed by a panel of
international  experts  in  November  1981  and,  in  1982  the  Government
commissioned the detailed design and preparation of tender documents for the
other project components (pumping stations and main sewers).  This work was
carried out by the Studies Department of the Hinistry of Housing and Utilities
assisted by the Engineering Department of the University of Aleppo.
3.02     In November 1983, during the appraisal of the Homs and Hama Sewerage
Project, the Government requested the Bank to assist in a project to improve
the environmental health conditions in the Aleppo area, where frequent
epidemic outbreaks of cholera had occurred.  Project preparation started in
February 1984 when the overall scope of the proposed project was discussed and
agreed upon with the Government.
Project Objectives
3.03.    The objectives of the proposed project are to:
'i)    provide sewage treatment and disposal facilities for Aleppo, the
second largest city in Syria;
(ii)    improve water quality in the Kouek River, which is adversely
affected by the discharge of untreated sewage from the Aleppo
urban area;
(iii)    improve environmental conditions in sections of the city not
adequately sewered;
(iv)    establish an independent sewerage authority; and
(v)    strengthen the cost-recovery policy instituted in the sewerage
sector.
The proposed project is essential to improve both health and environmental
conditions in and around Aleppo which, in the absence of the project, will
continue to deteriorate (para 1.05).  The proposed project will support the
Government's primary objective in the sewerage sector aimed at abating the
bacteriological and chemical pollution of rivers and water sources due to the



- 10 -
discharge of  untreated  urban and industrial wastewater.   The project will
enable the use of heavily polluted water for irrigation to be discontinued and
will reduce or even eliminate the risks of contact contamination downstream of
Aleppo which now creates unacceptable health conditions resulting in annual
cholera outbreaks and the presence of endemic waterborne diseases (Annex 5).
The proposed project will also improve the institutional framework of the
sector, particularly through technical assistance and training, and develop
reuse of treated sewage for irrigation.
Technological Alternatives and Service Standards
3.04.    The construction of a main sewer along the Kouek River and a sewage
treatment plant for Aleppo are the essence of the project.   In Aleppo, urban
sewage and storm water drainage are combined in the same sewer system with the
exception of one surface water collector. The proposal to retain a partially
separate system is an acceptable least cost solution since replacement of the
existing system with either a separate system or a combined system of adequate
capacity would be prohibitively expensive.
3.05     The  consultants have studied five sewer master plan alternatives.
However, technical solutions were not very different because of topographical
constraints, organization of the existing network, and the limited number of
sites available  for  sewage  treatment  works.   Three  potential  waste  water
treatment plant locations were identified, namely Sheikh Said, Airport and
Skhayef.   The  least  cost  alternative  provides  for  the  construction  of  a
secondary sewage treatment plant at Sheikh Said and a partially separate sewer
system including a new interceptor along the Kouek river, extending for a
distance of about 11 km from Skhayef in the north to the Sbeikh Said pumping
station in the south (Map  IBRD N°19080).   Overflows  will  be built  where
combined sewers connect with the Kouek interceptor to provide for discharge of
storm  flows  to  the  river.   These  overflows  will  provide  relief  for  the
downstream  system and  related flooding and ponding problems.   Two pumping
stations at Sheikh Said and Ramouseh will convey the sewage to the future
treatment facilities at Sheikh Said. The proposed masterplan included a great
deal of tunneling for the construction of trunk sewers. After careful review
of the detailed design by the Sewerage Department of the Ministry of Housing
and Utilities, assisted by the University of Aleppo, the required tunneling
was  substantially  reduced.   In  view  of  the magnitude  of  the  investment
required, the execution of the Sewerage Masterplan has been phased and an
alternative route to the one originally envisaged for the main interceptor, in
which the interceptor will be laid in the embankments of the river, has been
agreed upon resulting in a cost saving of some 40 percent for this component.
3.06     Existing main sewers in Aleppo have insufficient capacity to channel
wet weather flows resulting from storm water.  Runoff from new developments
cannot be discharged to the existing network unless modifications to the
network are first carried out. The consultant has proposed, and the Borrower
and the Bank missions have agreed that a design period for calculating the
capacity of the combined sewers and storm drains of two years will be
adequate.   This  is acceptable  since a slow drainage  rate exists in Aleppo
because  of  poorly  graded  and  surfaced  streets.   Taking  into  account  the



- 11 -
capacity of existing combined sewers, the development and the configuration of
existing and future urban areas, the Sewerage Department of the Ministry of
Housing and Utilities carried out the detailed design of additional combined
sewers and drains to be included in the first phase of the masterplan which
will cover all built up and planned residential areas up to year 1995. This
first phase does not include the industrial areas located in the vicinity of
the airport at about 8 km from the city center and in the north western part
of the city, where detailed planning is not yet available.
3.07     Within the context of  the Aleppo situation,  the  consultants  also
examined several alternatives in treatment methods to meet with specific
effluent  quality  standards.l-   Because  of  the  absence  of  any  receiving
watercourse which could offer adequate dilution, the treated wastewater will
undoubtedly be  reused  by  farmers  for  irrigation.   Secondary  treatment  is
appropriate for the treatment of combined domestic and industrial sewage, and
provides the least cost solution. It will consist of aerated lagoons with the
addition of maturation ponds and disinfection to provide an effluent suitable
for use in irrigation.   This treatment process is highly flexible, presents
minimal sludge disposal requirements and is relatively simple to operate.
Furthermore, aerated lagoons can be upgraded to a more sophisticated system
(extended aeration or activated sludge) if required in the future, or can be
modified to accommodate changes in pollution loads.  The construction of an
activated sludge treatment plant in Homs and a biological filtration plant in
Hama (Loan 2420 SYR), and aerated lagoons in Aleppo will provide Syria with an
opportunity to compare and monitor the perforaance of these systems under
particular Syrian conditions. It will also provide broader experience for the
selection  of  future  treatment  systems  in other cities.   The provision of
secondary treatment and disinfection are needed  to ensure  a  high   degree
destruction of pathogenic bacteria in view of frequent outbreaks of cholera
and other waterborne diseases in the Aleppo area and also to provide an
adequate degree of treatment for the industrial wastes within the locality.
The treatment of combined domestic and industrial wastes, with pretreatment of
certain industrial wastes where necessary, represents the least cost solution
for obtaining an acceptable, treated effluent which can be safely discharged
into the K uek River.
3.08     The city of Aleppo is relatively well served by its combined sewage
collection system, more than 80 percent of the population being connected to
the  main  sewerage  network.   The  Sewerage  Masterplan  provides  also  for
improvement of  existing  service  standards  through  the execution  of  local
repairs  and  extensions  of  the  secondary  network  to  serve  future  city
development.   These works are  included  in the  sewerage  company  investment
program (para 5.06).  The proposed project includes the construction of new
combined sewers which will supplement the insufficient capacity of existing
sewers. No additional rehabilitation works are therefore required.

3.09     The proposed project components (Map IBRD No 19080) are grouped into
two parts to permit parallel financing with the European Investment Bank whose
loan of ECU 16 million (US$ 12.04 million equivalent) would finance the
foreign   exchange   component   for   the   supply   and   erection   of   the
electro-mechanical equipment of one pumping station and the supply of force
mains (Part A). The proposed project includes:
Part A

and Utilities have completed final designs and contract drawings which are th.
basis for the cost estimates. Bidding documents for the trunk severs, pumping
stations and sewage treatment plant have been also prepared but need minor
revisions.   Documents  would be  ready  to call  for  international bids  and
contracts would be awarded as follows:

Parallel  financing with  the  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  has  been
confirmed for the equipment of one pumping station.  EIB appraisal took place
in October 1985 and a loan of 16 million European Currency Units (US$ 12.0
million) was approved by EIB's Board of Directors on December 10, 1985. The
Ministry of Housing and Utilities has appointed the Project Director, and
staff needed for the Project Management Unit would be in place by July 1986.
Local consultants for the revision of bidding documents and supervision during
project implementation have been recruited in March 1986. They would receive
assistance from a consulting firm specialized in sanitary engineering by July
1986. Construction is scheduled to start in December 1986.
Cot E-stimates
3.11     The estimated cost of the proposed project (Annex 6) is summarized
below.   It amounts  to  SE  923.20 million  (US$211.61 million)  including a
foreign exchange component of SE 357.88 million (US$82.04 million), or 39Z of
the total cost.   Identifiable taxes and duties amount to about 21% of the
total cost.

3.12     The cost estimates of the trunk sewers and civil works are based on
quantities estimated by the consultants and current prices for civil works
executed by state companies. The cost estimates for mechanical and electrical
equipment were updated on the basis of recent quotations from foreign
suppliers offered to the Syrian Government. Physical contingencies of 10% for
tunk sewers, pumping stations, force mains and treatment plant, and other
project components have been added. Price contingencies of 15% for 1986, 9%
for 1987-1990, 8% for 1991-1992 and 7X thereafter for the local cost and 7.5%
for 1986, 8% for 1987-1990 and 5% thereafter for the foreign cost components
have been included in the cost estimates. Physical works for the treatment
plant and the two pumping stations are expected to be completed by December
1990, and maintenance contracts by equipment suppliers by December 1992.
Completion of physical works for the trunk sewers is expected by December
1993. Annex 7 shows the estimated annual project investments.
3.13     The  project  provides  for  460  man-months  of  foreign  consultant
services for assistance in the revision and evaluation of bid documents,
engineering studies, operation and maintenance procedures, staff training and
a sewerage tariff study.  The project also provides for 1280 man-months of
local consultant services (GECEC) for the revision of bid documents, technical
studies and construction supervision.  The estimated cost of these services
including salaries, overhead, fees, international travel and subsistence is
estimated at US$8.47 million.

Financing A e      ts
3.14     It is proposed that the foreign exchange cost amounting to US$82.04
million equivalent be financed by a loan from the European Investment Bank
(EIB) of ECU 16.0 million (US$12.04 million equivalent) or 15X, and by an IBRD
loan of US$70.00 million representing 85% of the total foreign exchange cost
or  33S  of  the  total  project  cost.  During negotiations  assurances  were
obtained that local costs estimated at US$129.57 million and any supplemental
funds required for a timely completion of the project will be financed by the
Government .
3.15     The EIB Loan of ECU 16.0 million was approved by the EIB's Board of
Directors on December 10, 1985 and will finance the electromechanical
equipment for the Sheikh Said  pumping  station and  the force mains.   The
signing of a loan agreement with EIB is a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed IBRD loan. The financing arrangements for the foreign exchange cost
would be as follows:

The net internal cash generated by the General Company for Sewerage (GECOS) of
Aleppo would cover about 6S of the total financing.   The Government would
provide as equity contribution about 56X of the total project financing. The
EIB loan of US$12.04 million and the proposed IBRD loan of US$70.0 million,
would finance the foreign exchange requirements of the components described in
para. 3.09.
3.17     The proposed IBRD loan would be made to the Syrian Arab Republic, for
a term of 15 years, including 3 years of grace. A subsidiary loan agreement
of US$ 69.20 million would be entered between the Government and the Aleppo
GECOS, once it starts up operations by july 1, 1987 (para. 5.07), for a term
of 17.5 years including 3.5 years of grace at the same interest rate as the
IBRD loan. The balance of the proposed loan of US$ 0.80 million would finance
technical assistance and consulting activities not related to the Aleppo
GECOS (Part B(vii) and (viii) of the proposed project - para 3.09). The EIE
loan would also be made to the Government and on-lent to the GECOS of Aleppo.



- 18 -
Assurances were received during negotiations that the Government will enter
into a subsidiary Loan Agreement, on terms and conditions acceptable to IBRD,
for the proposed IBRD loan with GECOS, as soon as it is established. In line
with its policy for socially oriented projects, the Gove~rnment will assume the
foreign exchange risk.
Project Implementation
3.18     The responsibility of the various agencies involved in the project
will be as follows:

supervision                      December 1994
3.19     Project implementation will be the responsibility of the Ministry of
Housing and Utilities (MHU). MHU will:
-    sign  all   contracts  with   the  suppliers,   contractors   and
consulting firms;
-    enforce the right of use of land for the treatment plant, the
two pumping stations and other buildings;
-    enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with the Aleppo Sewerage
Company (GECOS);
-    ensure timely provision of adequate investment and operation and
maintenance budget during implementation;
-    send without delay the withdrawal applications  to the  lending
agencies; and
-    supervise consultants' work.



- 19 -
3.20     MHU already has assigned a qualified engineer as Project Director and
will ensure appropriate continuity of this assignment during project
implementation. The Project Director will be solely responsible to the Deputy
Minister  of  Housing  and  Utilities.   During  negotiations,  the  Government
confirmed that the Project Director will be vested with adequate authority.
Such authority will enable the Project Director to have direct access to all
the departments of MHU to discuss project related matters.  The Director will
also be the sole interlocutor vis-a vis the consultant to answer its queries
or provide guidance.  He will be authorized to forward technical reports or
letters concerning project implementation directly to the Bank and receive
assistance from the MHU accounting department to expedite IBRD's withdrawal
applications.   The Project Director will have at his disposal,  during the
project implementation, an office in Aleppo within the Public Establishment
for Water Supply and Sewerage (para 4.03).
3.21     Agreement  was  also  reached  during  negotiations  that  a  Project
Management Unit (PMU) will be established not later than July 1, 1986 within
the newly created Public Establishment for Water Supply and Sewerage (PEWSS).
Staff from PEWSS will be assigned on a full time basis to the Project
Management Unit during the project implementation period and will work under
the control and responsibility of the Project Director. During negotiations
the   Government   confirmed   that  PMU  will   (i)  supervise  all  project
implementation related activities, including procurement carried out by the
local consultant (GECEC) (para 3.22), (ii) keep project accounts, which will
be audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank and (iii) send audit reports to
the Bank not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year.  PMU
staff  will  familiarize  themselves  with  work  planning,  supervision  and
coordination and with waste water treatment technologies, system operation and
preventive maintenance through on site training provided by international
consultants  (para 3.31).  At the end of their assignment PMU staff will be
transferred to the General Company for Sewerage (GECOS) and form the core unit
responsible for the operation and maintenance of the new system.
3.22     MHU  has  also  requested  the General  Company  for  Engineering  and
Consuiting (GECEC) of Syria, a state-owned company, to provide assistance in
bid preparation, procurement, bid evaluation, construction supervision,
preparation  of  project's  accounts  and  other  studies  as  needed.    This
consulting company, staffed with a number of foreign experts, is qualified to
carry out engineering works such as those required by the project at a
reasonable cost.  It is satisfactorily undertaking similar assignments for the
Government in the sector particularly in Damascus, Homs, Hama and Lattakia.
However, due to its present work load, GECEC will not have the available staff
experienced in pumping stations, waste water treatment engineering and
international bidding to carry out the procurement, supervision and studies
related to the proposed Project in a timely manner. Therefore, the Government
authorized GECEC to receive assistance from an international consulting
company specialized in sewerage technology (para 3.31). The contract between
the Ministry of Housing and Utilities and GECEC was reviewed and found
acceptable by the Bank and was signed on March 3, 1986 before start of
negotiations.



- 20 -
3.23     Civil works contracts and supply and erection of equipment for the
treatment plant, pumping stations, trunk severs, workshops and supplies of
vehicles and equipment for the Aleppo GECOS will be awarded following ICB
procedures in accordance with the Bank's guidelines (para. 3.28). The supply
and erection of electro-mechanical equipment of the Sheikh Said pumping
station and the supply of force mains will be tendered internationally in
accordance with EIB's procedures.
3.24     It is estimated that project implementation would be completed by
December  1993  (Annex  8).   The  treatment  plant  will be maintained by  the
equipment supplier for a period of two years after works completion, i.e.
December 1990.
3.25     Land for the treatment plant and both pumping stations is presently
being farmed by its private owners and will be acquired by the Government.
No  residential  buildings  exist  at  the  proposed  sites.   Under  prevailing
procedures, the right of use of such land for public utility projects is under
the authority of the Governor of Aleppo and has been obtained for the proposed
project.   Therefore,  civil  works  companies  will  be  allowed  to  start
construction at the Governor's request, before such a land has been purchased
at negotiated prices or expropriated by the  Government.   Syrian  officials
foresee  no  difficulties  in  acquiring  this  land.   During  negotiations
assurances were obtained that the Government will take all actions to acquire
all such land for the construction of the treatment plant, pumping stations
and sewers.
3.26     Upon completion of the proposed works, MHU will transfer the related
infrastructures to the sewerage company of Aleppo, GECOS (para. 4.G.). The
technical staff of this company will require considerable assistance,
particularly at the outset, to become proficient in operating and maintaining
the networks and the plants. Provision has been made for the implementation
of a detailed training program (para. 4.07). The treatment plant's equipment
supplier will provide guidance on specific operations during the plant
commissioning  and  a  two  year  maintenance  period.   To  ensure  adequate
monitoring of the treatment plant, agreement was reached during negotiations
that the Government will cause the Aleppo GECOS to maintain the following
records:
On a daily basis:
- minimum, average, and maximum flow through treatment plant
- BOD concentration of raw and treated sewage
- SS and TS concentration of raw and treated sewage
- Chlorine dose of effluent
On a monthly basis:
- DO levels of Kouek River near treatment plant outlet
- Energy consumption in kWh
- Bacteriological analysis of effluent of the treatment plant (MPN
of coliforms)

3.28     Until  recently,  the  Government's  policy  was  to  use  state-owned
construction companies to carry out Government-financed civil works for
government projects.   Since  their establishment  in  the mid-seventies,  the
state construction companies have acquired considerable experience and
resources. From their performance in water distribution projects in Damascus
and Aleppo, they have proved their ability to carry out works in the water
sector with due diligence and within reasonable contractual costs.  In view of
the technical development and competitiveness already achieved by the national
civil works companies, the Government has decided to open i-p civil works
contracts to other contractors. The Gover.t--t has confirmed to the Bank that
international  competitive  bidding  procedures   in  accordance   with   Bank
guidelines will be followed for all Bank financed components of the proposed
project.
3.29     To allow  for  parallel  financing  by  the  Bank and  EIB,  the  main
contracts to be awarded under IC' procedures would be grouped as follows:

For bid evaluation purposes a 15% margin of preference or an amount equal to
the customs duties, whichever is lower, will be applied for equipment
manufactured in the Syrian Arab Republic. All equipment contracts, vehicles
and operation and maintenance equipment contracts, will be grouped as far as
practicable in order to encourage international competition.  For this type of
contract, a minimum individual grouping of US$  100,000 will  be  retained.
Consulting companies for engineering studies and technical assistance will be
engaged in accordance with the guidelines for the use of consultants by World
Bank Borrowers.   All procurement documentation will be subject to the Bank
review prior to their submission to bidders.  Works implementation schedule is
shown in Annex 9.
3.30    Foreign contractors are expected to win all major contracts for the
supply of electro-mechanical equipment and pressure  pipes.   The 50 km long
pipe supply and laying contract, which is divided in three lots and for which
separate and joint bids will be called internationally, is likely to be won by
the largest local civil works company which also operates a concrete pipe
manufacturing plant in Aleppo.
3.31    Technical  Ministries  are  responsible  for  all  procurement  related
activities.   Cumbersome administrative procedures, shortage of skilled staff
and fragmentation of responsibilities create delays in the procurement process
when carried out by the Ministries. GECEC, which has in the past efficiently
contributed to a number of procurement committees will, on behalf of MHU, be
responsible  for  carrying  out   procurement  of  all  project  components.
Furthermore, GECEC will receive assistance from an international consulting
firm (para 3.21) fam.liar with ICB procedures and with waste water treatment
technology.  This coisulting firm will also be responsible for training the
Project Management Unit and GECOS staff within PEWSS.   The Government has
confirmed its intention to recruit an internationaL consulting firm to provide
technical assistance to GECEC and train the Project Management Unit and GECOS
staff. Agreement on the terms of reference of the foreign consultant was
obtained during negotiations and the signing and approval of a contract with
such a firm is a condition of loan effectiveness.

3.34     Disbursement profiles show that disbursements for the water supply
and sewerage sector in the EMFNA region have extended over an eight year
period, while the overall disDursement for the Syrian Arab Republic has
extended over eight and a half years.  It is expected that the proposed Bank
Loan would be fully disbursed according to the Syrian profile.  In order to
ensure that Syria will have ready access to foreign exchange, agreement was
reached during negotiations that a Special Account will be established in the
Central Bank of Syria to which the World Bank would make an initial revolving
deposit of $ 2.0 million. The Special Account will be replenished against
withdrawal applications of at least US$200,000 at monthly intervals or, as
appropriate, when the undisbursed balance of the Account is equal to 75
percent or less of the amount of the initial deposit. All disbursements under
the project will be made against standard documentation except for contracts
below US$50,000 to be claimed under Statements of Expenditures (SOE) which
will be made available for examination by Bank supervision missions.
Agreement was also reached that the Government will recruit independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank to audit the special account and the SOEs.

MonitoringK Criteria
3.35     A number of key indicators will be used to evaluate the sewerage
company's performance and to complement the normal reporting procedures.
During negotiations, the project implementation schedule (Annex 8) and the key
indicators  (Annex 10) were discussed and agreed upon with the Government.
These monitoring criteria will serve as targets for GECOS. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that GECOS will report quarterly on all aspects
of project work including the key indicators and the project implementation
schedule. GECOS will also comment on any deviations from agreed targets and
will, as necessary, take prompt remedial action in consultation with the Bank.
3.36     Assurances have also been obtained that within six months following
the Closing Date of the proposed loan, MHU with the assistance of GECOS will
prepare and submit ro the Bank a project completion report reviewing the
planned objectives and the achievements of the project, including the costs
and benefits derived and the performance and contribution of all parties
associated with project execution and systems operation.
IV. THE BENEFICIARY
4.01     The proposed loan of US$70.0 million will be maie to the Syrian Arab
Republic. The proposed works and related infrastructure constructed under the
project will be transferred to the General Company for Sewerage (GECOS) to be
established in Aleppo (paras.3.26 and 4.04).
Present O    zation
4.02     Current  responsibility  for  the  construction and operation of  the
sewerage networks in Aleppo is undertaken by the Aleppo Service and
Maintenance Company (ASMC), a municipal company created in 1983. ASMC is also
responsible for street cleaning and maintenance of roads, buildings, parks and
garbage  collection.   There are five special geographical sewerage sections
within ASMC with a total staff of about 400 persons out of 3800 for the whole
Company. The administration, personnel function and accounting are handled by
the General Administration and Finance Department. Accounts are maintained in
accordance with the municipal accounting code of Syria which is of limited use
to manage efficiently public utilities  operations.   No attempt is made  to
apportion labor and overhead costs to the various services provided.
Therefore, it is not possible to obtain reliable costs for the operation of
existing  sewer systems.   The actual operating costs incurred for sewerage
services are financed from municipal general revenues, and funds for system
expansion and capital expenditures are provided by municipal and Government
grants.   The  present  technical  and  financial  management  of  the  sewerage
systems in Aleppo is unsatisfactory. In particular, specialized equipment is
insufficient for adequate maintenance, adequate financial resources are not



- 27 -
available, accounting systems are inadequate and management and engineering
staff do not assign the necessary priority in operating the sewerage system.
Two of the basic reasons for the present ineffective operation and maintenance
of the system are the lack of financial resources of the municipalities and
the inadequate qualifications and experience of staff assigned to sewerage
operations.
4.03     As  recommended  under  the  Homs  and  Hama  Sewerage  Project  (Loan
2420-SYR), the Government has recently established in each governorate a
semi-autonomous Public Establishment for Water Supply and Sewerage (PEWSS).
These PEWSS are chaired by the Governors and are set up according to the
following main provisions of Legislative Decree N° 14 of October 1984:
(i) Creation of 14 PEWSS under the tutelage of the Ministry of
Housing and Utilities;
(ii)   PEWSS are governed by general provisions of Legislative decree N°
18 of 1974 (para 4.05):
(iii)   PEWSS  replace  all  existing  Water  Supply  Authorities   and
Government sewerage technical services;
(iv)   PEWSS are responsible for studying, designing and executing water
supply and sewerage projects in their respective Governorates.
They are also responsible for the maintenance and operations of
all existing and future facilities;
(v)   If deemed necessary, PEWSS shall set up two or more independent
subsidiaries, named General Company for Water (GECOW) and General
Company for Sewerage (GECOS). which will be responsible for the
operation and maintenance of all related facilities;
(vi)   Staff  and  equipment  of  existing  water  supply duthorities and
sewerage  technical  services  shall  be  transferred  to  the  new
General Companies; and
(vii)   Each governor shall create by Decree a committee to inventory and
evaluate the assets and liabilities to be transferred to the new
authorities.
Proposed Organization
4.04     According  to  Decree  N°  14,  each  Public  Establishment  within  a
Governorate will entrust its executive powers for operation and maintenance to
semi-autonomous General Companies for Water (GECOW) and for Sewerage (GECOS).
Through this structure the General Companies for Sewerage will be able to
benefit from cooperation and coordination with the existing local water supply
companies, particularly for billing, customer files management, and accounting
procedures. Each GECOS will be chaired by a General Director and will receive
appropriate authority (staffing, equipment and operating budget) to operate
effectively.  In order to speed up the effective operational start up of the



- 28 -
Aleppo PEWSS, a competent General Director was appointed by the Government in
December 1985.
4.05     The legislative provisions governing the management and operation of
public sector institutions in Syria are set out in Legislative Decree No. 18
of 1974. This Decree provides, inter alia, for:
(i)   drawing up local operational policies under the supervision of
the Ministry of Housing and Utilities;
(ii)   providing  for  the  transfer  of  the  existing  assets  to  new
Companies in agreement with the municipalities;
(iii)   entering into loan agreements with the State or financial and
banking establishments, local or foreign, without prejudice to
the rights of the State Planning Authority in virtue of the
regulations in force; and
(iv)   proposing  by-laws  to  be  promulgated  by  Presidential  Decree
relating to financial policies, accounting and procurement.
PEWSS have been set up in accordance with the provisions of this Decree. The
sewerage companies (GECOS) will be set up within this framework and will
operate on a commercial basis.   In order to create a General Company for
Sewerage in the Aleppo Governorate the Ministry of Housing and Utilities has
prepared a draft Presidential Decree.   This draft decree has already been
discusse-d and agreed upon by the Governor and the Mayor of Aleppo. This
doc-ument, which was reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank, has been sent
to the Cabinet in March 1986. The Presidential Decree would spell out the
duties and responsibilities of the GECUS together with its initial capital.
4.06.    During negotiations, assurances were obtained  that a  Presidential
Decree establishing a General Company for Sewerage in Aleppo, to be operated
on a commercial basis as provided f or under Decree N' 18 of 1974 on public
establishments, will be enacted by September 1, 1986.
4.07     It is not expected that the GECOS would be able to recruit sufficient
staff from the municipality and ASMC so the company will resort to external
recruitment.  This may not be a disadvantage, as it may enable the GECOS to
break away from some of the traditional ineffective administrative practices
in  the  sector.   In  these  circumstances,  adequate  planning  and  training
programs are vital for the successful establishment of the company as an
effective organization. In 1983, the Arab Fund provided financial assistance
for the construction of a Water Supply and Sewerage Training Center in
Damascus.   The Syrian Government has agreed to make the necessary land and
buildings available, and the French Government has financed and carried out a
feasibility study for the establishment of this training center, including a
manpower  survey  and  training  needs  assessment.   Supplemental  funds  are
included in the proposed Bank loan to provide project related training for the
Aleppo GECOS' staff. Assurances were received during negotiations that the
GECOS of Aleppo will take over the sewerage operations and maintenance of all
existing networks not later than July 1, 1987. This should provide sufficient



- 29 -
time to recruit and train required staff, to carry out cost recovery and
management studies and to obtain approval for implementation of adequate
sewerage charges. To put in place the basic structure of the GECOS a calendar
of the key actions to be undertaken by PEWSS, GECOS and MHU has been
established (Annex 11).  During negotiations, the implementation schedule of
these actions was discussed and agreed upon.   In particular,  the following
target dates were agreed upon:
(i?    Commissioning by July 1986 of a tariff study as described in
para 5.04;
(ii)    start of recruitment of operating personnel and implementation
of the training program by December 1, 1986;
(iii)    engagement  by September 1, 1986 of management and accounting
consultants to assist in establishing the organization and the
implementation  of  administrative  procedures  and  commercial
accounting system; and
iv)    take over of sewerage operations not later than July 1, 1987.
Billing and Collection
4.08     Charges for the sewerage services will be implemented by July 1, 1987
and will be in the form of a surcharge on the water billing collected by the
General Company for Water Supply (GECOW), which has taken over the existing
water authority responsibilities.   All  households  connected  to  the  public
water system are metered and are billed every two months. The water authority
has experienced some difficulties in billing since a stepped tariff was
introduced in late 1977. However, since early 1983 bills have been produced
by computer within two months of meter reading.   Customer files are  also
maintained on the same equipment and accounting is being computerized.   The
present number of staff assigned to the collection of the water bills is
inadequate. The water authority and the Government have confirmed that thirty
three additional collectors will be recruited and twenty collection centers
will be opened in 1986. With the implementatior. of these actions, the water
authority expects to clear the present backlog in billing and collection
during the next two years.  The authority estimates that the introduction of a
sewerage surcharge in the computerized billing program will take about three
months.
Accountn1g. Audit and Insurance
4.09     The Water Supply Authorities in Syria maintain their accounts on a
commercial basis in accordance with a standardized national accounting code.
This system is satisfactory and there should be no difficulties for GECOS to
adopt a similar system.  During negotiations, agreement was reached that GECOS
will implement, as soon as established, a commercial accounting system, that
its annual accounts will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and that the annual accounts and audit reports will be submitted to the



- 30 -
Bank within nine months of the end of each fiscal year. The Government will
also recruit independent auditors acceptable to the Bank to audit the Special
Account and the SOEs (para 3.34). Assurances were also obtained that GECOS
will take out and maintain third party liability coverage or vehicles,
employee accident insurance as well as fire and theft coverage on buildings,
equipment and warehouse stocks as these are completed during the course of the
project.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Results and Present Situation
5.01     The existing sewer networks in the city of Aleppo are constructed,
operated and maintained by a municipal company (para 4.02). These systems are
regarded as one of the range of services provided by the company and no
separate accounts or asset  inventories are maintained.   Capital  funds  are
provided by the Central Government and day-to-day operating and maintenance
expenditures are financed from the general revenue of the municipality.
5.02     The total revenue of the Aleppo Municipality in 1983 was SE 557.37
million.   This  revenue accrued  from three main sources: revenues collected
directly by the Municipality (21X); allocation of certain Laxes collected by
the Government (20%); and loans and grants from the Government (59%). About
40% of Aleppo's direct income was derived from the sale of land acquired in
excess of actual need for road construction and housing development and sold
after the schemes were completed.   Included. in these revenues,  was a small
income specifically related to sewerage which consists of a charge levied on
the owners of property when a sewer is provided or reconstructed. The charge
is set at SE 0.60/m2 (SE 0.30 when a sewer is reconstructed) of floor area for
all properties which can be connected to the sewer.   This charge generates
about SE 0.15 million per annum.
5.03     In  1983   the  expenditure  of   the  Municipality   on  wages  and
administration accounted for about 40% of its budget and the balance was
invested  in  the  ccnstruction  of  roads,  buildings,  parks and sewers.   the
expenditure breakdown for sewerage over the last three years 1981-1983 was as
follows:
ALEPPO MUNICIPALITY SEWERAGE EXPENDITURES
1981     1982      1983
------SE Million------
Maintenance               9.46      7.99    10.99
Construction              6.66      7.78    28.74
Total                 16.1Z    15.77    39.73



- 31 -
The Municipality does not operate a cost accounting system and some
maintenance expenditures particularly labor and overheads may not have been
included in the above figures.
Financing Policies and Objectives
5.04     One of  the objectives of  the Bank's involvement in the sewerage
sector is to help implement the Government's policy on cost recovery through
the adoption of a progressive tariff structure, and other direct sources of
income, to provide revenue for the operation and development of the system and
thereby  reduce  the  burden  on  municipal  and  Government  resources.   This
financial policy issue has been discussed since 1978. However, with the onset
of the Homs and Ha-a Sewerage project (Loan 2420-SYR) in 1984 the Government
introduced a policy for the recovery of at least all operating costs including
depreciation.   Considering the magnitude of the investment required in the
sewerage sector and the early stage of development of the sewerage
institutions, the financial policy adopted by the Government is adequate at
this stage.  In June 1985, the Government confirmed that the same financial
policy will apply to the Aleppo area.   Depreciation is expected to remain
higher in any given year than projected debt service to be charged to GECOS
when works are in operation. In order to determine the most appropriate way
for achieving this cost recovery program, the Government has agreed *to
commission a tariff study by July 1986, about one year before GECOS takes over
responsibility for sewerage services.   The objective  of  this  study  is  to
assess an adequate tariff structure which will enable GECOS to generate and
collect enough revenues to at least meet operation and maintenance costs plus
depreciation of existing and future sewerage facilities as well as the
rehabilitation of existing networks.
5.05     The Government confirmed during negotiations that the tariff study
will be commissioned by July 1986 and will be completed by March 31, 1987.  It
was also agreed that by July 1, 1987, the sewerage company will implement
financial measures on the basis of the recommendations of the study and that
the Government will take into account the view of the Bank in the formulation
of such measures.
Financing Plan of GECOS' bivestment Program
5.06     The GECOS'  Sources  and Applications  of  Funds  Statement  for  the
project implementation period (1986-1994) (Annex 12) is summarized as follows:

5.07     During the project implementation period, GECOS' net internal cash
generation would provide on average about 4% of total financing requirements,
Government contributions 71%. the proposed European Investment Bank loan 4%
and the proposed IBRD loan 21%. Debt charges would be charged to the GECOS of
Aleppo by the time of the treatment works completion, i.e., December 31, 1990
in addition to the operating costs of the new facilities. Before that time,
the only recurrent costs of the sewerage authority would be those related to
operating and maintaining the existing facilities, including depreciation,
with interest during construction on the IBRD and EIB loans amounting to
US$5.09  million  to  be  financed  by  the Government.   This  financing  plan
supports the Government  financial  policy  (para.  5.04).   Projections  which
cover the GECOS' investment program show that debt service would in any given
year be covered by depreciation.   In line with its  policy  to assume  the
foreign exchange risk for socially oriented projects, the Government will
assume the foreign exchange risks on the proposed IRRD and EIB loans.
Future Financial Performance
5.08     Forecast   f.nancial  statements  appear  in  Annex  12.   Financial
assumptions  are  presented  in Annex  13.   The  investment  plan  (1990-1995)



- 33 -
includes investments other than the proposed project on the order of SE 508
million *,r about SE 84 million per annum in current value. This objective is
realistic and aims at maintaining the service level in the municipality.
5.09     Projections  of  GECOS'  revenues  have been made according  to  the
financial policy set by the Government  (para.  5.04).   The  projected  debt
service to be charged to the sewerage authority when treatment facilities are
in operation would remain lower than depreciation over the foreseeable
future. From 1988 !' to the end of the project implementation period, i.e.
December 1993 GECOS' revenues are expected to grow in current terms about 4.2
times  from  SE26.14  million  to SE110.86 million.  During the same period
operating expenses before depreciation would grow from SE13.87 million to
Sf59.14 million.  This would provide sufficient internal funds to cover all
the projected debt service and an average of 4% of investment costs.   The
working ratio would remain below 60X. Total fixed assets in operation would
increase from SE 496.34 million to SE1585.47 million, i.e., about 3.2 times.
The debt equity ratio would stay around 16:84 and the debt service coverage
ratio would not drop below 1.02.
VL JUSTIFICATION
Health Benefits
6.01     The medical authorities of Aleppo estimate that there are at least
300,000 incidents of enteric illnesses each year and that about 60 percent of
the  population  are  infected  with  intestinal  parasites.   An  additional
indicator of the importance of water and sanitation related diseases in the
project area is that drugs for the cure of alimentary diseases represent the
second highest consumption rate of all drugs in Aleppo. Despite the fact that
no epidemiological evidence has been collected to demonstrate a positive
disease transmission route from sewage to vegetables to the city population,
the Aleppo health authorities are convinced that the use of untreated sewage
to  irrigate  vegetables  is  the  main  cause  of  the  high  incidence  of
water-related diseases in the city. The water supply facilities are adequate,
there are very few areas within the city where the ground is contaminated with
faeces, and refuse collecrion is reasonably efficient, hence sewage-irrigated
vegetables would appear to be the chief vector.  In the L977 cholera outbreak,
over 40 percent of the Syrian cases were reported in Aleppo and it is now
regular practice to implement the regulation prohibiting cultivation of
vegetable crops within a 1,000 m strip along the Kouek River whenever an
outbreak  of  cholera occurs.   In practice  this means  that  the  crops  are
destroyed.  The project thus will assist the Government to address issues of
widespread environmental deterioration that have profound long-run economic
consequences.  In particular, present health hazards caused by the discharge
of effluents directly into the bed of the Kouek river which flows through the

and therefore this year cannot be taken as a valid basis for revenues
comparison.

city, will be eliminated. Prevention of the discharge of sewage to the river,
particularly during the dry season when there is virtually no natural flow in
the river, will remove the threat of contamination of lower aquifers which
provide water used for human consumption and irrigation.   In addition,  the
treatment of sewage will provide safer water for irrigation; thus lessening
contamination and infection and improving health conditions in the project
area.
EnvironmentaL Impact
6.02     No adverse environmental impact is expected from the project.   The
treatment plant site is located more than one kilometer downstream from Aleppo
and the closest rural settlement is situated 0.5 km from the plant site.
Under normal operation, aerated lagoons cause some odor but no noise nuisance.
The sparsly populated settlements, located to the windward of the treatment
plant, should not be affected during the most frequent weather patterns.
Furthermore no urban development will be permitted within a 0.5 km radius from
the plant site.  The urban environment will be improved in parallel with the
reinforcement of the drainage system provided under the proposed project, thus
reducing the incidence of stagnant water bodies throughout the city.  It is
also estimated that storage of the effluent during the winter period may
permit the increase of existing irrigated areas from 2,000 ha to 4,800 ha.
Least-Cost Solution
6.03     Alternative treatment processes considered for least-cost comparisons
included activated sludge, biological filtration, extended aeration, aerated
lagoons, and waste stabilization ponds (aerobic and partially anaerobic
lagoons).
6.04     In Aleppo, the site for the proposed aerated lagoons  s adjacent to
the existing main sewer outfall beside the river, in accordance with the
Sewerage Master Plan.  Land at this site is limited and cannot acconmedate the
alternative form of treatment, waste stabilization ponds.  The only feasible
site for stabilization ponds is several kilometers away from the existing main
outfall and would require longer interceptors, force mains and 20 meters of
additional pumping head.  The combination of capital and operating costs make
pond alternatives more expensive than aerated lagoons to be const:-ucted in the
vicinity of the city.
6.05     For Aleppo,  the recommended alternative for sewage treatmenL is to
construct aerated lagoons with maturation ponds followed by disinfection of
effluents before discharge.   This  treatment   process has a high degree of
flexibility, entails minimal sludge disposal cost and is relatively simple and
inexpensive to operate. This provides the least-cost solution for achieving a
high degree of destruction of pathogenic bacteria and improving the potential
use of the effluent for irrigation.
6.06     Due  to the high population density and  the proximity to existing
trunk sewers, the proposed reinforcement and extension of trunk sewers to



- 35 -
serve low-income settlements, and new residential and industrial developments,
is also the least-cost solution for the collection of sewage and storm water,
and for waste disposal and treatment needs of these settlements.
Beneficiaries
6.07     The proposed project will  benefit the present and future population
of Aleppo  although at  different  levels.   The  treatment and reuse of  the
effluents of an estimated 1,65 million inhabitants living in the project area
by the year 1995 and of the major polluting factories already connected to the
sewer network, will have major health, environmental and economic impacts.
The residents along the river are mostly affected by the obnoxious conditions
prevailing at present as  a  result  of  the  discharge  of  raw  sewage.   The
elimination of these discharges and the improved water quality of the river as
a result of the sewage treatment will provide a better environment for the
urban and rural population living along the river. Residents of areas flooded
during the rainy season, in particular along the railway lines and in the
center of the city, will also be relieved from this recurrent situation as a
result of the increased drainage capacity of the sewer network.  Finally the
1987-1993 trunk sewers expansion program will give 0.4 million inhabitants
access to community sewer systems.
Poverty Impact and AffordabilitY
6.08     The proposed reinforcement and extension of the combined sewerage
system will also benefit the poorer and illegal housing development districts
of the city where households are not yet connected; and where the main sewer
lines are old and undersized primarily in high density areas in the older
parts  of  the city.   Sewers  in these high density areas have insufficient
capacity to meet the needs of the present population and to absorb storm-water
runoffs.
6.09     It is estimated that in the high density areas alone there are about
0.65 million inhabitants of which about 211,000 have incomes below the poverty
threshold.  In the illegal housing developments, which will  be connected to
the municipal sewer system after the proposed extension of trulk sewers has
been implemented, an additional 15,000 families or about 105,000 persons below
or close to the poverty threshold will also benefit from the project.   It is
thus estimated that about 29% of the total population in the project area has
an income under the poverty threshold, and about 16% of the project cost will
be devoted to improving tne sewerage services to these areas.  Through river
pollution control and availability of treated effluents for irrigation, the
project will also benefit the 12,000 farmers living along the Kouek river,
downstream of Aleppo.
6.10     The water consumption of the low-income group averages about 10 m3
per month per household of 6 persons. Assuming that the income of the poorest
segment of the population is the minimum wage paid to the emplcyees of the
public sector (SE660 per month it 1985 prices) where employmeat is freely
available, the total monthly payment for sewerage will reach S£7.8 in 1991 or



- 36 -
about 1.21 of the minimum monthly income in Aleppo. This is considered to be
affordable.   Future  sewerage  charges  adjustments  should  not  change  this
forecast, since no increases in real terms are expected for low-income
consumers. The combined monthly payment for water and sewerage will amount to
about SE12.8 or 1.9X of the minimum wage, which is also considered affordable.
Adequacy of Revenues
6.11     The  long-run  incremental cost of providing  sewerage  services  in
Aleppo is estimated at SEO.7411m3  of water sold in 1985 prices, at a 10l
discount rate which is considered appropriate for Syria.  It is also estimated
that once the treatment plant is commissioned, the revenues generated from
sewerage operations will reach SEO.780/m3  in  1985  prices.   The  fact  that
these revenues per cubic meter approximate the long run average incremental
cost of providing sewerage services indicates that their level would be
appropriate.
Ris and SaWegad
6.12     The risks confronting the project are two-fold, those arising from
the fact that the Aleppo GECOS is being newly established and those associated
with project and country considerations. Both of these risks could result in
delays in project implementation and consequent escalation of costs.
Experience with previous projects in the sector is useful but may not be
completely relevant because of the newness of the GECOS and the nature of the
project. It will be the first aerated lagoons to be built in Syria for urban
and industrial sewage treatment and the construction of trunk sewers will be
undertaken in a city rich in archeological remains. This will introduce some
risk due to the relative inexperience in the country with treatment facilities
of this size and to the possible *istence of underground archeological
structures which may delay construction. However, the measures recommended in
this report, such as (i) the technical assistance provided by foreign
consulting firms for bid evaluation, construction and supervision; (ii) the
provision of experts to assist in the development and implementation of the
technical, managerial and accounting organization of the new authority; (iii)
the implementation of a thorough training program complemented by a two-year
maintenance contract of the treatment plant and pumping stations equipment
suppliers; (iv) the study and implementatiork of financial policies aimed at
building the financial viability of the GECOS; and (v) the Bank's monitoring
of key performance indicators for the GECOS and providing necessary guidance
during supervision, should help to minimize the project risks.
VII. AGREEMENIS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     During  negotiations,  agreement  and understanding were  reached  on
various issues referred to in Chapters III through V of this report.



- 37 -
7.02     The proposed loan will be declared effective after:
(i)    the signing of the EIB loan agreement (para 3.15); and
(ii)    the  signing  and  approval  of  a contract between MHU and a
consulting finm acceptable to the Bank (para 3.31).
7.03     Agreement having been reached on the issues set forth in this report,
the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US $70.0 million to the
Syrian Arab Republic for a term of 15 years, including 3 years of grace.

ANNEX 13
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
ALEPPO SEWERAGE PROJECT
ASSUMPTION FOR THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Income Statement
1.       Operating costs were escalated to cover inflation as follows:
1986      -    15%
1987-90   -     9Z
1991-95   -     8%
The income from water surcharge/fees/taxes was calculated to comply with the
proposed financial covenant that GECOS will set tariff, fees and taxes at a
level to provide income to cover operating costs including depreciation.
2.       Other income includes the sewerage levy based on property surface
which is collected by the municipality.
3.       Salaries  and wages were  calculated  on  the  basi.s  of  the  salary
structure included in Legislative Decree N'14 creating sewerage authorities.
It was assumed that GECOS would gradually build up its sewer maintenance staff
over the two and a half year period June 1987-1989 and that the treatment
plant would be operational in 1991.
4.       The following depreciation rates were used:
Existing sewers                         2.5Z
New Sewers                              2.5Z
Civil Works                             2.5%
Mechanical and Electrical Equijb,int   6.6X
Vehicles                                20%
Funds Flow Statement
5.       It was assumed that the balance to fin;nce required for investments
would be provided by the Government as an equity contribution.
Balance Sheet
6.       The  value of  the existing sewers  system  is provided for at its
estimated 1985 current cost. This is based on the consultants estimate of the
replacement cost of the system in 1980 prices plus the replacement cost of
sewers built from 1980 to 1985, less estimated cumulative depreciation.  The
net value of the Aleppo system at SE191.5 million is reasonable and has been
treated as equity on the assumption that the system would be transferred to
GECOS free of charge. The project assets were not revaluated.
