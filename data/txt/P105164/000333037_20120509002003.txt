7. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The development objectives of the Project are as follows: (a) to improve coverage by increasing the
enrollment and graduation rates of students in tertiary education; (b) improve equity by increasing
enrollment and graduation rates of tertiary education students from economically disadvantaged
backgrounds; and (c) increase and diversify the sources of alternative funding available to ICETEX in
order to increase ICETEX’s sustainability.

                   SECOND STUDENT LOAN SUPPORT PROJECT
                                 P105164
                               LOAN 7515-CO

                                 Restructuring Paper


1.    The closing date for the Second Student Loan Support Project, Loan 7515-CO,
P105164, will be extended for 12 months from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013.
2.      Coverage and equity of the tertiary education system have increased since the
Project began in 2008. In 2008, 65 percent of students graduating from secondary
education enrolled in tertiary education. By December 2010, this number had increased to
66.3 percent. The net tertiary education enrollment rate for students whose income is
below two times the minimum wage increased from 45.6 percent in 2006 to 51.9 percent
in September 2011. The Project has contributed towards these improvements by
increasing the number of loans available to academically talented but needy students.
Between June 2008 and December 2011, 125,531 new students had benefited from an
ACCES student loan; 84 percent of these students came from the two lowest
socioeconomic strata.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to continue supporting ICETEX to scale up
the provision of student loans to students from the lowest socioeconomic strata, in a
rapidly changing context for higher education in Colombia. The Borrower has an Action
Plan that is acceptable to the Bank and ICETEX is likely to meet its targets for key
Outcome and Intermediate Results Indicators by the revised closing date.
4.     This will be the second extension of the Project. The first extended the Project’s
closing date for 18 months, from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2012.
