MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) for US$150 million
equivalent.   The loan to LBP would be guaranteed by the Republic of the
Philippines against a fee of one percent per annum. It would carry the Bank's
standard variable interest rate and would have a fixed amortization schedule of
20 years including a grace period of five years. The proposed loan would help
to finance viable private investments in the agriculture and rural sectors. LBP
would relend the proceeds of the Bank loan to accredited Participating Financial
Institutions (PFIs) in domestic currency at the prevailing market rates.
2.    Country/Sector Background.  Philippine rural financial sector activities
from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s were influenced by macroeconomic policies
that were biased against agriculture (an overvalued currency; a subsidized credit
environment which was particularly prejudicial to small, poorly collateralized
borrowers; and a heavily regulated financial market with high intermediation
costs). Recognizing the negative impact of these policies on agriculture and
rural financial sector development, the Government has since introduced
substantial changes. Starting in 1981, there has been a gradual shift away from
direct intervention and towards market-oriented interest rates. Savings and time
deposit rates were deregulated in 1981, non-agricultural short-term rates in
1983, and agricultural short-term rates in 1984. Presently, about 93X of all
agricultural credit is extended at market determined rates. The balance, mainly
production loans to small farmers with less than five ha of land, is lent by LBP
through cooperatives and Rural Banks (RBs); the small subsidy involved is enjoyed
by the intermediary institutions, with the credit actually reaching final
borrowers at 4X to 10 in real terms. This is clearly a much better situation
than in most developing countries. The Government has also moved from using
pricing mechanisms towards a greater reliance on the market to allocate financial
resources. Direct lending by non-financial Government institutions ceased in
1986, and the Government's role is now seen primarily as one of providing
infrastructure and a policy environment that will make private commercial lending
for agriculture viable.
3.    The agrieultural/rural sector is critical to the Philippine economy.  In
1989, it generated about one-fourth of both GDP and exports, and employed about
half of the country's labor force. Nonetheless, in the same year agricultural
credit accounted for only 6.5X of total lerding by the banking system and, of
this, an insignificant share (less than 46) was directed towards medium- and
long-term investments.  The informal sector, although an important source of
seasonal credit, does not traditionally provide medium and long-term financing
for agricultural/rural investments. The inadequate volume and short-term nature
of institutional lending, and the conservatism of the commercial banking system,
have been highly accentuated in recent years because of the financial crisis of
the mid-1980s.   A systematic roll-over of short-term loans has in practice
provided some long-term resources to the rural sector, but most term lending by
commercial banks has been supported by long-term foreign funds channeled to the
productive sector through a second- tier rediscounting mechanism, the Agricultural



- 2 -
Loan Fund (ALF). Established and financed by the Bank under the now completed
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 2570-PH), ALF has recently been transferred
from the Central Bank to she Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) in compliance
with one of the requirements of the Bank's Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln.
3049-PH), and renamed the Countryside Loan Fund (CLF).   ALF/CLF's present
resources are now fully committed, with reflows adequate to support only US$18.0
million of medium and long-term rural credit, the demand for which is
conservatively estimated at about US$200 million annually for the next five
years. The proposed project would provide continued support and strengthening
of CLF's operations.
4.    In parallel with the commercial banking system, the Philippines has a
private rural banking system that is quite unique among developing countries.
Some 803 Rural Banks (RBs) cover 66% of the total number of municipalities and
cities in the country. RBs are small in asset size, but their resources have
mostly been mobilized and invested back in the countryside, in contrast with the
rest of Philippine banks that tend to invest outside the rural areas (only 71 of
commercial bank resources were allocated in the countryside as of year-end 1989,
compared with 70X for RBs). However, most RBs participated heavily in government
supported agricultural credit programs during the late 1970s/early 1980s, which
were plagued by political interference and resulted in heavy financial losses for
the RBs and the Central Bank of the Philippines (CBP).  As a result, RBs today
are financially weak and cannot serve effectively to mobilize and lend resources
for rural productive and commercial activities. Moreover, the weakest RBs are
bankrupt, with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) having to pay
insured deposits financed mainly through currency emissions by CBP. A program
to strengthen t.'e rural banking system by inducing financial institutions in good
standing to re-capitalize RBs would be supported by the project, along with
further liberalization of rural banking policies.
5.    Presently, many viable agricultural and agro-industrial projects are no,t
financed by lending institutions because of lack of bankable collateral. As the
Government has systematically withdrawn from direct lending, it has developed
several rural guarantee programs to reduce the perceived risks of such lending,
most notably the Quedan Guarantee Fund Board (QGFB) and the Philippines Crop
Insurance Corporation (PCIC).  QFBl's primary tasks are to enable the private
marketing sector to absorb more agricultural produce and to encourage the banking
system to channel more funds into the food marketing industry. QGFB guarantees
the integrity of warehouse receipts and insures the banks against default for 80X
of the loan values, for which it charges the banks a fee. In 1990, QGFB incurred
low claims of only about 3% of its guarantee volume. For the future, in order
to sustain and eventually increase its operational impact, QGFB needs to provide
credit guarantee services for a w'ler range of economic activities; mobilize
additional equity through privatizi con; gradually increase its fee structure to
cover operating costs and expected losses; and focus more on the needs of small
farmer groups.   PCI  is mandated to insure small farmers against natural
calamities and pest and disease damage. At the end of 1990, about 151 of total
cultivated land under annual crops "rice and corn) and 255,000 farmers were
insured. To broaden PCIC's impact on rural credit, it needs to increase the
insured area for rice and corn, expand its coverage to other crops, and modify
its premium structure to improve its financial position. These actions would be
supported by the proposed project.

6.    Lessons Learned.  The broad lessons that emerge from the review of the
previous agricultural and rural credit projects are that: (a) directed credit
by crop or type of investments, at subsidized interest rates, did not sustain
economic growth, improve the credit delivery system in the rural areas, or
increase the access of rural borrowers to formal credit facilities; and (b) heavy
arrears and poor finarLcial conditions of the apex institution and/or the selected
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) severely constrained project success.
Whenever interest rates either fell significantly below or moved well above
prevailing market rates, serious implementation problems emerged: above-market
rates, resulted in slow disbursement of Bank loan funds, while below-market rates
led to concentration of credit to relatively wealthier and larger clients. These
lessons have been incorporated in the proposed project.
7.    Project Objectives.  The proposed project would help to expand the volume
of credit for agriculture and rural development and to enhance the policy and
institutional framework of the Philippines' rural financial sector by:  (a)
supporting the development of the CLF rediscounting facility, now administered
by LBP, as the Government's primary mechanism for resource mobilization to
finance increased private investment in the agriculture and rural sectors; and
(b) providing for the institutional and financial strengthening of the rural
banking (RB) system, PCIC, QGFB, and LBP, to facilitate better access to formal
credit and banking services in rural areas.
8.    Project Descrintion.  The project would be implemented over five years and
would comprise the following components: (a) Credit to finance investment in
fixed assets and incremental working capital, and seasonal production, for a
broad spectrum of agricultural and other viable rural investments.   This
component would also include a pilot scheme under which funds would be channeled
through selected agricultural cooperatives as financial intermediaries to finance
long term investments by their members; (b) Policy and Institutional Development
through: (i) further liberalization of banking policies concerning the opening
of new branches in rural areas, merging of banks in rural areas, adjusting the
current limit on the maximum shareholding that a single investor can have in a
distressed rural bank to enable the mobilization of the additional required
capital, and inducing financial institutions in good standing to invest in rural
banks with equity deficiencies; and (ii) strengthening of the existing rural
insurance and guarantee funds, bringing these up to a sustainable and sound
position to provide farmers and banks with adequate services at market prices;
and (c) Studies and Training, including comprehensive studies on the informal
rural credit sector and the rural tarm lending market, taking into account the
respective efficiency and the magnitude of the formal and informal rural
financial sectors. The training program would include training for ALF/CLF and
Participating Financial Institution (PPI) project related staff mainly in sub-
projects appraisal, supervision and inflation implications on sub-borrowers cash-
flow and sub-loan repayment, and environmental screening, monitoring, and
compliance  with  environmental  laws  and  regulations.    Also,  members  of
cooperatives, and their management would be trained to enhance their ability to
handle credit operations.

9.    The total project cost is estimated at US$203.5 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$81 million (about 40%). The proposed Bank
loan of US$150 million equivalent would finance about 74% of total project costs,
99% of the foreign exchange requirements and 57% of local costs. Sub-loans will
be granted exclusively in domestic currency and the entire foreign exchange would
be made available to GOP through the conversion process. Therefore, the foreign
exchange risk would be borne by the Government in exchange for a market related
fee payable by LBP. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. All goods and works contracts costing US$5 million or more would be
awarded after International Competitive Bidding. Limited international bidding
and direct contracting would be allowed when justified on technical or economic
grounds. Other goods, services, and works under US$5 million would be procured
through established commercial chennels. A disbursement schedule is presented
in Schedule B.  Retroactive financing of up to US$15 million equivalent is
proposed for the credit component, to fund ALF/CLF loans made after November 1,
1990. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 9563-PH, dated May 24, 1991, is being distributed
separately.
10.   Environmer.tal Impact. To reduce the risk that sub-projects with potential
adverse environmental impact would be financed by the project, the following
measures would be taken: (a) LBP in collaboration with the Department of the
Environment and Natural Resources would work out adequate procedures and
guidelines for environmental screening and monitoring in conformity with the
existing comprehensive environmental laws, procedures and regulations; and (b)
the project training program for LBP and PFIs' staff would include courses on
environmental planning and management of sub-projects.
11.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has played a pivotal role among
external donors in assisting the Philippine Government in the process of
financial sector reform through a variety of inter-related operations, the most
significant of which has been the ongoing Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln.
3049-PH). In the agricultural sector, the Bank has also been instrumental in
supporting Government efforts to withdraw from earlier subsidized directed credit
programs, foster the move towards market determined interest rates, and establish
the ALF rediscounting facility.   The Bank is, therefore, particularly well-
positioned to assist also with the next stage of rural credit policy reforms and
institutional strengthening of the rural financial system.
12.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the main actions on which commitments
were obtained from the Government and LBP are the following: (a) use of ALF/CLF
resources in accordance with market demand, with no pre-determined allocations
by economic activity or type of investment, and no targeted borrowers; (b) LBP
would manage the ALF/CLF on a commercial basis and would exclude itself from
retailing these resources except for the Cooperative Experimental Pilot Plan; (c)
re-lending terms and conditions from LBP to the PFIs; (d) on-lending terms and
conditions from the PFIs and the sub-borrowers; (e) the mechanism for assumption
of the foreign exchange risk by the Government; (f) strengthening of the main
insurance and guarantee institutions; and (g) introduction of liberalized
criteria so that banks could open new branches in small municipalities; investors



. 5 -
could establish new banks for servicing rural areas; and financial institutions
would be induced to provide a wider range of services in the rural areas.
13.    Benefits and Risks.   The proposed project would facilitate medium and
long-term private investment in the agricultural/rural sector. It would help to
finance about 2,200 investment eub-projects, at an estimated total cost,
Including sub-borrowers' equity, of about US$200 million. These sub-projects are
expected to generate incremental direct employment for 25,000 people, and an
increase in gross value added of about US$40 million annually. Since the precise
mix of the project lending program would depend on market demand, the
quantification of aggregate economic impact is not possible. The main risk
associated with this type of program is that implementation of agreed policy
measures could be thwarted or delayed because of budgetary constraints or
political considerations, particularly during the coming election period.
However, a gradual and realistic implementation process has been agreed upon and
would be formalized through dated covenants in the project legal documents. With
respect to the credit component, the volume of demand for CLF resources would
depend on the overall macroeconomic performance, but this is not considered a
major risk as such demand during the project period has been projected
conservatively and is well within the historical performance record of ALF.
14.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
