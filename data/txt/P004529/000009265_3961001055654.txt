RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summarv
Borrower:         Land Bank of the Philippines
Guarantor:        Republic of the Phi'ippines
Beneficiaries:   Accredited financial institutions.
Amount:           US$150 million equivalent
Terms:            The Bank Loan would be for 20 years, including 5 years of
grace at the standard variable interest rate.
Re-lending
Terms:          The Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) would relend the
proceeds of the Bank loan to accredited Participating
Financial Institutions (PFIs) in domestic currency at the
prevailing market rate. Maturity would conform to the
maturities of sub-loans made by the PFIs to sub-borrowers,
but would not exceed 15 years. The foreign exchange risk
would be borne by the Government in exchange for a market
related fee payable by LBP. PFIs would be given a choice of
a fixed rate for several years or a variable interest rate
periodically adjusted. PFIs would onlend the proceeds to
their sub-borrowers at prevailing market interest rates.
Project
DescriDtion:   The objective of the proposed Rural Finance Project would be
to enhance the policy framework governing the rural financial
sector, in order to provide more efficient and active credit
support to the rural areas of the Philippines. The project
would complement, and is consistent with the objectives
sought under the ongoing Financial Sector Adjustment Loan
(FSAL, Loan No. 3049-PH). More specifically, the proposed
operation would: (a) provide investment and seasonal
production credit to support private   agricultural/rural
investments to increase production, incomes, and employment,
thereby helping to alleviate rural poverty; (b) induce
financial Institutions to attend the credit needs of the
rural areas more efficiently, and to facilitate better access
to commercial, saving, and rural banks in rural areas; and
(c) enhance the access of rural borrowers to formal credit
sources. The project would provide a second stage of support
to the Agricultural Loan Fund (ALF) rediscounting facility.

Enhancing the operations of financial institutions in rural
areas would be achieved through further liberalization of
banking policies concerning opening new branches in rural
areas, merging of banks in rural areas, adjusting -urrent
limit on maximum shareholding by single investors in a
distressed rural bank to enable the mobilization of the
additional required capital, and inducing banks in good
standing to invest in rural banks with an equity deficiency.
Enhancing farmer access to formal credit sources would be
carried out through the strengthening of two existing
insurance/guarantee institutions (PCIC and QGFB), to provide
banks and farmers with adequate services at market irices;
training of cooperative staff to upgrade their capability to
perform financial intermediary functions for their members;
and designing and implementing pilot/experimental projects to
develop new and efficient credit delivery systems and
technical assistance to rural areas. The project would be
implemented over a five-year period.
-zad Risks:    The proposed project would facilitate private agricultural/
rural sector investments, foster policy measures to induce
financial institutions to provide credit facilities to the
rural areas and to facilitate better access of rural bor-
rowers to formal credit sources. The Bank loan would help to
finance about 2,200 investment sub-projects, at an estimated
total cost including sub-borrowers' equity of about US$200
million. These sub-projects are expected to generate
incremental direct employment for 25,000 people, and an
increase in gross value added of about US$40 million
annually. Since the precise mix of the project lending
program would depend on market forces, the quantification of
an aggregate economic impact is not possible. The main risks
associated with this type of program concern possible delays
and/or inadequate implementation. The principal risk is that
implementation of agreed policy measures, wt-.d be thwarted
or delayed because of budgetary constraints or political
considerations, which are likely to become increasingly
important over the coming election period. However, a
gradual and realistic implementation process has been agreed
upon and would be formalized through dated covenants to be
included in the project legal documents. With respect to the
credit component, the volume of demand for CLF resources
will certainly depend on the overall performance of the
economy, but this is not considered a major risk as such
demand during the project period has been projected
conservatively and is well within the historical performance
record of ALF.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
RURAL FINARICE PROJECT
I. THE ECONOMY
Overview
1.1       Located in Southeast Asia, the Philippines is an archipelago of about
7,107 islands, the largest of wbich (Luzon and MHndanao) account for two-thirds
of the country's area of about 300,000 km2. With a total population of about 60
million at the end of the 1980s, the Philippines has a higher demographic density
than Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. In the 1950s, the Philippines had one of
the greater per capita incomes in Asia. After growing at an average rate of 8%
per annum during 1950-56, the Philippine economy slowed to 5% p.a. during 1957-
72. Real GNP then grew at a slightly higher rate of 6.8% p.a. during 1973-79,
but decelerated again during 1980-83, and turned negative during 1984-85.
1.2       The economic history of the country has been marked by intermittent
balance of payments crises.  Deteriorating external terms of trade certainly
played a role.11 However, the extent of government intervention in the economy
was an even greater factor, resulting at times in serious misallocation and
underutilization of scarce capital and foreign exchange resources. The growth
in manufacturing productivity, for example, which had been marginally positive
in the 1960s, turned negative during the 1970s, as resources were allocated
towards relatively poor performers.   The growth of agricultural productivity
accelerated during the 1970s compared to the previous decade, but this was
largely confined to rice and, to a much lesser extent, corn; productivity of
sugar and coconuts, on the other hand, largely stagnated over the two decades.
Irregular and poor productivity improvements and the chronic foreign exchange
constraint, gave rise to the "stop-and-go" nature of Philippines' exports and
economic growth through the mid-1980s.
1.3       In a majoi break with past policies, since 1986 the current Government
has made greater efforts to enhance economic performance by allowing market
mechanisms to improve the quality of resource allocation. Viewed against the
backdrop of the deep recession of 1983-85, the achievements of the Philippine
economy in 1987-89 have been particularly impressive. In 1984, the worst year
of the recession, GDP declined by 6%, investment plunged by 43%, the external
debt rose by 8% of GNP, and inflation soared to 50%. The recession was espe-
cially hard on the poc::   a survey of household incomes showed that 59% of
Philippine families (about 32 million people) subsisted on i.Lcomes below the
poverty line in 1985. During 1987-89, however, the economy recovered across a
broad  front.    GDP  grew  steadily;  both  consumption  and  investment  rose
1/ World commodity prices were more volatile in the 1970s than during the
previous two decades. The oil price hikes raised the share of the oil
import bill from less than 11% before 1974 to around 25% during 1980-82.
Finally, world real interest rates rose sharply during the early 1980s,
raising the debt service burden of the country.



- 2 -
significantly; and inflation was kept at single-digit levels.   The current
account deficit, the fiscal deficit and the external debt were reduced relative
to earlier levels. Macroeconomic management by the Government was distinguished
by a prudent fiscal stance, conservative monetary growth, and actions to reduce
the external debt. Fiscal discipline helped to generate surpluses in the primary
balance of the Government, which improved from a 1.5% deficit in 1986 to a 2.1%
surplus in 1988. This, together with tight monetary policy, kept inflation at
an average of 4.5% p.a.. Responsible external debt management initiatives in the
form of commercial and Paris Club reschedulings and debt-equity swaps, postponed
the bulk of repayments to after 1992 and retired about $1.6 billion of foreign
debt, contributing to an aggregate debt reduction equivalent to about 17% of GDP
(i.e., a decrease from 92% to 75% by the end of 1988).   From a comparative
standpoint, among highly-indebted countries, the adjustment performance of the
Philippines ranks near the top.  Its growth has been relatively stable; the
fiscal adjustment has been deeper and more consistent; inflation lower and less
volatile; and external debt reduction faster.
1.4       Macroeconomic performance since the end of 1988 has, however, been
more disappointing. The consolidated fiscal deficit rose from 3.1% of GDP in
1988 to 4% in 1989, and 5.2% of GDP in 1990. The interesi: rate on the benchmark
financial asset--the Treasury Bill--has averaged arcund 10% in real terms, or 23%
in nominal terms. The current account deficit rose from 1% of GDP in 1988 to
3.3% in 1989, and has since risen to almost 5% of GDP. These trends have been
accompanied by a slowdown in growth from 6.2% in 1988 to only 2.5% in 1990, and
an increase in inflation from just under 9% in 1988 to around 13% currently.

1.5       A major source of macroeconomic distress in recent years has been the
sharp increase in domestic debt, from 19% of GDP in 1985 to around 25.6% in 1989.
Despite significant fiscal adjustment, domestic debt increased as access to



- 3 -
external finance waz limited, the public revenue system yielded low returns, and
pressing infrastructure and poverty problems required constant if not rising
expenditures. Domestic interest rates have risen sharply, intensifying fiscal
pressures and making macroecono,nic management considerably more difficult. An
escalating sequence has been established linking rising interest rates to rising
fiscal deficits and borrowing requirements.
1.6       Exchange rate developments have also affected macroeconomic perfor-
mance.  During 1989, the real effective exchange rate apprecia'ad relative to
competitor countries such as Indonesia, Thailana, and Malaysia, a:.d major trading
partners like Japan and the US. The current account deficit has risen, as export
growth slowed while import growth remained relatively high. The Philippines has
lost market shares in the developed countries. The deteriorating current account
deficit raised expectations of devaluation, which in turn were built into the
interest rate structure, thereby further aggravating fiscal imbalances. These
developments prompted a more rapid depreciation of the nominal exchange rate in
recent months which, if supported with fiscal and wage restraint, should improve
external competitiveness.
1.7       Macroeconomic performance has also been adversely affected by a series
of unexpected exogenous shocks. A prolonged drought lasting over the winter and
spring months of 1989-90 substantially reduced crop output: the value added of
agricultural crops declined by 1.1% during 1990, although combined sectoral
output increased by 2.2% due to the contribution of the livestock, poultry and
fisheries sub-sectors.   The drought was also partly responsible for power
shortages, that in turn cut growth in industrial output to 1.9%, from 7.1%
registered in 1989.   The major earthquake in July 1990 caused considerable
economic damage in Luzon, and turmoil in the Middle East Gulf War caused the
price of oil to jump by almost 50% during the last months of 1990, increasing the
current account deficit: for the year to over 5% of GDP. As a result of all these
factors, GDP growth registered a meager 2.5% in 1990 compared to 6% in 1989 and
6.2% in 1988.
Agriculture and the Economy
1.8       General.   The agricultural seb.tor is critical to the Philippine
economy. In 1989, it accounted for about one-fourth of both GDP and exports, and
about half of the employed labor force. Growth averaged 4% p.a. between 1970 and
1982, when a major economic recession commenced.   Droughts in 1983 and 1987
resulted in negative growth of 2% and 1%, respectively, in those years.
Nonetheless, because of improved sectoral policies and more favorable weather
conditions in 1988 and 1989, recovery was significant (3.4% growth in 1988 and
4.3% in 1989).   The good performance of the 1970s was facilitated by high
international prices for agricultural commodities, large investments in
irrigation, the introduction of high-yielding rice varieties and increased use
of fertilizers, all of which helped to outweigh policy biases at the time against
agriculture (including an overvalued exchange rate, export taxes, price controls,
trading bans and heavy protection for industrial goods).   The 1980's have
witnessed an important diversification of agricultural production: while non-



- 4 -
traditional crops occupy only 14% of cultivated land, they now account for 45%
of total gross value added in the crop sub-sector. However, recent growth in crop
production has again been based on traditional products, mainly rice and corn,
rather than upon non-traditional products, which are more capital-inte.asive and
require  substantial  investment  credit.    Improved  institutional  financial
arrangements and an increased volume of credit will be essential to further the
diversification process.
1.9       Historically, high growth rates in agricultural crop output occurred
mainly during or immediately after a Peso devaluation (1961/62 and 1970/73)
and/or world commodity price increases (1974/76-1980). Periods of low growth of
crop output appear to have been associated with low world commodity prices, bad
weather and intercrop substitution under tight land constraints. Average real
growth of gross value added of the four main crops during 1973-84 were around
3.7% p. a. for rice, 3.4% for corn, 3.0% for sugar, and 0.1% for coconut. There
has been a secular decline in the share of these four crops, from more than two-
thirds of total agricultural crop value added during the late 1960s to about
one-half during the early 1980s.
3.10      Philippine farms are preponderantly small: about 85% of the 3.42
million crop and livestock farms in 1980 were under 5 ha, accounting for about
50% of Lotal farm area. Only about 60% of all farms (and total farm area) are
owned by the farmers themselves.  Thm' inequity in the land size distribution and
ownership of farms has been at the heart of the agrarian unrest in the
Philippines during the post World War II period. Rice and corn farmers, the most
numerous in the country, have historically been the focus of government's land
tenure and ref5rm programs.
1.li      In 1989,  agriculture grew by 4.7% in real terms,  exceeding all
expectations and having its best performance since 1982. Sectoral growth was a
result of sustained production increases in the livestock and poultry sub-sectors
and improved performance of the crops subsector, attributable to favorable
weather conditions, increased areas under cultivation, Government policies (tax
and duty reductions on farm inputs, higher support prices for palay); and real
increases in rural infrastructure investments, especially 'n irrigation and
feeder roads. Table 1.2 shown agricultural value and volume in 1988-89:

1.12      The Crop Subsector.  The crop subsector, which accounts for 59X of
total sectoral output, grew by 2.9% in real terms in 1989, compared to only 0.9X
in 1988.   The best performance was recorded in sugarcane, coffee, palay and
tobacco, which together account for 22X of sectoral output and increased in real
terms at 13%, 10%, 5.4%,and 5.3%, respectively. Palay output achie-ed a record
high of 9.5 million tons and prices remained nigh. Meanwhile, corn production
grew slowly at 2.1%, due to poor weather in several main corn regions, while
sugar production increased by 13% as a result of three continuous years of higher
prices.   Also, banana production recovered from its two-year drop.   Coconut
production, on the other hand, continued to decline for a third year, showing a
5.4% contraction in 1989.   DOA development plans for the crop subsector,
including perennial crops, envisage an annual growth rate of about 41 between
1990  and  1995.    This  implies  substantial  increases  in  input usage  and
investments, raising the need for incremental seasonal and term credit (Annex
1.1).   The annual  incremental working capital and fixed assets  financing
requirements for the next five years are estimated at P4.1 billion (US$168
million) and P9.2 billion (US$378 million), respectively.
1.13      Livestock and Fisheries.  Livestock production has grown rapidly since
1986, reaching a growth rate of 10.4% in 1989, mainly as a result of increased
internal demand, especially for pork, which accounts for three-fourths of total
livestock production.   Poultry has also performed quite well, showing a 9.61
growth rate in 1989. Strong pork and poultry demand has offset the impact of
major corn price increases.  There are also signs that producers have been able
to partially substitute corn feed for rice and wheat by-products. Finally, the
fisheries subsector contitnued its hearty growth trend, achieving a real rate of
4.4% in 1989. Aquaculture (prawns, seaweeds and tilapia) increased at 6.21 in
1989, commercial fisheries at 4.2% and municipal fisheries at 3.31. Five-year
DOA development plans suggest continued high growth of about 9.71 for livestock
and 4.5% for fisheries.   The incremental working capital and fixed assets
requirements to support this level of growth are estimated at P13 billion (US$464
million) and P35 billion (US$1.25 billion), respectively.
II. The Rural Financial Sector
Overvie
2.1       Financial services in the Philippines are provided by a network of
banks and non-bank financial institutions.  The banking system comprises the
Central Bank of the Philippines (CBP), commercial banks (KBs), thrift banks
(TBs)21, rural banks (RBs) and specialized government banks (SGBs). Non-bank
financial institutions include investment houses, insurance companies, financing
companies, securities, dealers, brokers, lending investors, and pawnshops. In
addition, there are a few public specialized non-bank financial institutions that
2/   Thrift Banks include private developmient banks, saving and mortgage
banks, and stock savings and loan associations.



- 6 -
provide guarantee and insurance services to the agricultural sector, of which the
most important are the Quedan Guarantee Ftund Board (QGFB) and the Philippine Crop
Insurance Corporation (PCIC).
2.2       The total assets of the financial system peaked in 1984, both in
nominal and real terms, but there has since been a substantial real contraction
of both financial assets and operat-ions. During 1984-89, total assets declined
in real terms by about 10%, and the total loan portfolio of the banking system
by 40%. As a result, three commercial banks, 147 rural banks and 32 thrift banks
went out of business. In addition, the largest banks, the Philippines National
Bank (PNB) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) --both government
owned-- became insolvent and had to be bailed out in 1986 by transferring their
non-performing assets and liabilities (about 60% and 90X, respectively, of their
total assets) to an Asset Privatization Trust.  The productive and financial
sectors are still suffering the effects of this major contraction.
2.3       The banking system as a whole, however, has emerged stronger from the
crisis, and in the last three years its profitability has improved and its
solvency strengthened.   The rural productive sectors are still suffering the
effects, in that they have unsatisfied credit needs, particularly for long-term
maturities, and this has had a depressing effect on output and productivity
growth. Total outstanding credit to agriculture, fisheries and forestry through
the formal financial sector, declined substantially (measured in constant 1988
Pesos) from P54.9 billion in 1983 to P25.6 billion in 1986, and to P22.7 billion
in 1987. While formal credit to agriculture increased slightly to P24.1 billion
in 1988 and to P28.3 billion in 1989, the last figure represents only 52% of the
1983 level.
2.4       Today most formal credit to the rural sector comes from commercial
banks, which accounted for 53% of banking system credit to the sector in 1981,
47% in 1984, and 62% in 1989. Thrift banks have remained quite marginal actors
in the agricultural sector, while rural banks have declined in importance to only
18% of total agricultural  lending in 1989.   Specialized government banks
decreased their lending to the sector substantially during 1982-85, but they have
since increased their rural lending slightly, from only 9% of total outstanding
credit in 1985 to 12% in 1989.
2.5       Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), the specialized government bank
mandated to play a significant role in the rural sector, had by 1990 year-end an
agricultural loan portfolio of about P4.4 billion or 51% of its total loan
portfolio.   This included P2.0 billion of mortgage loans to agrarian reform
beneficiaries and 02.4 billion of production loans to small farmers and
commercial agricultural loans. LBP is actively attempting to expand its small
farmer lending and its disbursement to small farmers have increased dramatically
from P105 million in 1987 to P343 million in 1988, P1,110 million in 1989 and
02.8 billion in 1990.
2.6       The major shortcomings of the banking system, as far as support for
rural development is concerned, have been: (a) the perception that agriculture



- / 7
has much higher risks than other sectors; (b) the insistence on supporting rural
loans with urban collateral or with relatively liquid commodity assets, rather
than relying on project  appraisal  techniques;  (c) limited availability of
resources for medium- and long-terin investments; and (d) the weak financial
condition of many rural banks.   As a consequence,  the participation of the
banking system in rural financing has remained marginal, with the e --_¢rvatism
and short-term nature of bank lending accentuating during the financial crisis
of the mid-1980s.  Term lending by commercial banks has been financed mainly
through foreign long-term funds channeled to the productive sectors through
second-tier banks.   The systematic  roll-over of short-term  loans has,  in
practice, also provided some long-term resources to the productive sector. Given
the real contraction of term lending to agriculture and the propensity of formal
financial institutions to limit their exposure to short-term operations, there
has been a growing unsatisfied demand for long-term financing of the investment
needs of the agriculture, fishery and forestry sectors. The future requirements
for medium and long-term credit, have been conservatively estimated at US$1 bil-
lion annually for the next five years (Annex 1.1). Satisfying this demand will
involve improved market-based incentives to induce financial institutions to
better attend rural needs, as well as measures to enhance the access of rural
borrowers to formal credit.
Policy and Institutional Reform
2.7       Philippine rural financial sector activities from the mid-1960s to the
early 1980s were influenced by macroeconomic policies that were biased against
agriculture (an overvalued currency; a subsidized credit environment which was
particularly prejudicial to small uncollateralized borrowers; and a highly
regulated financial market with high intermediation costs).   Recognizing the
negative impact of these policies on agriculcural and rural financial sector
development, the Government has introduced the following substantial changes
since the early 1980s.
(a)  Interest Rate Policy Reform.   Starting in 1981, Government policy has
gradually shifted away from direct intervention and towards market-
oriented  interest  rates.    Savings  and  time  deposit  rates were
deregulated in 1981, non-agricultural short-term rates in 1983, and
agricultural short-term rates in 1984.
(b)  Changes in Rural Lendina Policies. The Government has moved away from
using pricing mechanisms and direct lending, and towards a greater
reliance on   market mechanisms  to allocate  financial resources.
Direct lending by non-financial Government institutions ceased in
1986. The Government's role is now seen primarily as one of providing
infrastructure and a policy environment that will make agricultural
activities and pri ate commercial lending viable.
(c)  Reduced  Rural  Credit  Subsidies.    In  1990,  agricultural  credit
accounted for about 6.5% of the total volume of new lending by the
banking system. Of this, about 93% or P30.0 billion, was extended at



market-determined rates.   The balance of about P2.2 billion was
subsidized credit, 31 lent by LBP either directly to end-borrowers or
through cooperatives for onlending to their members.   These funds
generally reached sub-borrowers at nominal Interest rates of 18X to
24X, or 4X to 10X in real terms. LBP also rediscounted in 1990 about
P630 million of loans by some 281 Rural Banks (RBs) at preferential
rates, but RBs themselves charged their borrowers market rates.
Therefore, the total agricultural credit subsidy for 1990 is estimated
at only about P160 million (US$7 million), mainly in the form of
production loans to small farmers with less than 5 ha of land. This
is clearly a much better situation than in most developing countries.
(d)  Institutional Reform.    Rural  institutional  reform measures have
focussed on LBP and the RBs.
(i) In 1990, LBP assumed the role of an apex institution for rural
credit.   Specifically, it took over from the Central Bank the
administration of the Agricultural Loan Fund (ALF), launched a
rural bank rediscounting program and managed Government shares in
RBs derived from the transformation of their debts to CBP into
equity (para. 2.10). LBP also uses Agrarian Reform Fund (ARF)
resources to lend to cooperatives, RBs and cooperative RBs, as
well as to individual farmers.   In 1990, P625 million (US$26
million) of these ARF resources went to rural banks, P1800 mil-
lion (US$74 million) to cooperatives and P407 million (US$17 mil-
lion) to individual farmers. LBP's collection performance on its
new wholesale lending and lending to individual farmers has been
satisfactory, with current recovery rates of 911 in 1988, and 92X
in 1989, and 931 in 1990, substantially better than the record of
most of the earlier Government supervised credit schemes. LBP's
future  plans  are  ambitious.    Total  lending  through  RBs,
cooperatives and to individual farmers is projected to reach 05.4
billion (US$180.0 million) in 1991, most of which is to be
provided through 3,000 cooperatives.
(ii) As far as RBs are concerned, two rehabilitation programs were
introduced by the Government. The first in 1982 and the second
in 1987.   Both programs aimed at supporting failing RBs, in
solving their arrears problems with CBP (para. 2.10).
The Rural Banking System
2.8       The Philippines has a private Rural Banking System that is quite
unique among developing countries. As of June 30, 1990, 814 Rural Banks (RBs)
operated in the 12 regions of the Philippines, covering 661 of all municIpalities
i.   Excluding about P0.1 billion of new lending for land acquisition, under
the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.



- 9 -
and cities.   While RBs are small in asset size (only 3.3% of total private
banking assets as of year-end 1989), they have played a significant role in the
development of the rural economy. RB resources have mostly been mobilized and
re-invested in the countryside, in contrast with the rest of Philippine banks
that tend to invest outside the rtral areas (i.e., only 7% of commercial bank
resources had been allocated in the countryside as of year-end 1989, compared
with 70% of RB resources).  Total RB assets amounted to P12.8 billion (about
US$550 million) as of June 30, 1990.
2.9       Most RBs participated heavily in the Government-supported Masagana-99
(M-99) agricultural credit program during 1973-81, which aimed to bring about
self sufficiency in rice production.   Through special deposits and CBP's
rediscount facilities, Government provided about P4.5 billion of subsidized and
uncollateralized production loans. Under the program more attention was given
to extending loans than to ensuring project feasibility, repayment capacity, and
collection. Consequently, about 80% of the M-99 loans have never been recovered.
As a consequence, RBs tend to be financially weak (para. 2.11), and therefore are
not presently able to serve as effective tools to mobilize savings and stimulate
investment in the rural sector. The weakest RBs are in bankruptcy, which also
places a financial strain on the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC)
because it is obligated to pay insured deposits. Since PDIC has no other source
of funds to finance such outlays, this has also resulted in large currency
emissions by CBP. The equity deficiency in the RB system as of June 30, 1990,
was about P1.2 billion (about US$52 million). The cost to PDIC and CBP would be
much higher (about four-fold) if the insolvent banks were to be liquidated
because, in that event, many good loans also could not be fully recovered.
Moreover, since the government could not close all insolvent and unprofitable RBs
simultaneously, many RBs would continue to operate, although they would not
comply with minimum requirements to safeguard and properly guarantee depositors.
2.10      The Government has made two attempts to assist the RBs in solving
their arrears problems with CBP. The first has been a Special Revolving Trust
Fund (SRTF), established in 1982 and operated by the Philippine Crop Insurance
Corporation (PCIC), which provided P450 million of financial assistance to
guarantee up to 85% of the principal of M-99 past due loans of the RBs (at least
three years old as of May 21, 1982). Guarantee payments were made over three
years: 25% upon a statement by the RB in the first year and two payments of 30%
each, acting on evidence that guaranteed loans to final borrowers had been
restructured. As of the end of 1990, P426 million was claimed, of which only
about P214 million had been paid. The second attempt was the RB Rehabilitation
Program launched in 1987, managed by CBP and supported indirectly by the Bank-
financed Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 2570-PH), which included studies
leading to an action plan for the rehabilitation of the RBs. The focus has been
to encourage the infusion of fresh capital by RB owners against CBP support,
through a combination of arrears conversion into government equity and the
rescheduling of the remaining arrears into a 15-year installment program. RB
owners are required to provide additional capital equal to the higher level of:
(a) the equity deficiency to achieve the legally required 10:1 risk assets-to-
equity ratio; or (b) 10% of the arrears with CBP.   Upon making the capital



- 10 -
increases, at the RB's option, a portion of CBP loans can be converted into
common shares to be owned by LBP with the remaining loans in arrears rescheduled
into a 15-year installment plan.   LBP shares can be repurchased by the RB's
original owners, with first refusal right, at par value plus 6% p.a. interest
from the date of the debt conversion into equity.   As of end-1990, LBP has
acquired about P65 million in common shares and P135 million in preferred shares
in 44 and 72 RBs, respectively.
2.11      From September 30, 1989 to Jure 30, 1990, there was a noticeable
improvement in the financial condition oE the RBs because of CBP's Rehabilitation
Program. The number of RBs with equity deficiency was reduced from 635 RBs in
1989 to 529 in 1990, and the number with a negative equity declined from 472 in
1989 to 357 in 1990. Although 14 RBs were liquidated during the period, 106 RBs
stopped having an equity deficiency, mainly as a result of fresh capital infu-
sions, and 115 RBs ceased to have a negative equity condition. The aggregate
equity deficiency of RBs decreased by P400 million in the period, from P1.6
billion as of September 30, 1989 to P1.2 billion as of June 30, 1990.   In
addition, the number of RBs with surplus equity (equity levels above minimum
requirements) increased. As of June 30, 1990, there were a total of 310 RBs with
a Risk Assets to Net Equity Ratio of less than 10:1, with an additional lending
capability, before they reach the limit of 10:1, of P6.08 billion (about US$261
million).
2.12      Nonetheless,  despite three years of rehabilitation,  the financial
condition of many RBs remains critically weak, and the exposure of the
Philippines Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) to insolvent RBs has increased.
PDIC's contingent liabilities (equal to deposits in RBs with an equity
deficiency) increased by P1.27 billion (about US$55 million) from P3.05 billion
as of September 30, 1989 to P4.3 billion as of June 30, 1990. If all the banks
with an equity deficiency were closed, the total cost to PDIC would be almost
four times larger than the equity deficiency in such banks, illustrating that
closing many insolvent RBs would be an expensive proposition for PDIC and CBP.
Payments by PDIC to depositors in banks to be closed and liquidated are currently
financed by CBP because PDIC does not have the capital or liquidity to make such
payments.
2.13      From the perspective of both CBP and PDIC, therefore, strengthening
of the RBs would be a preferable option.   From the perspective of rural
development, it would also be desirable to use the existing banking infras-
tructure, as much as possible, to reach out to small farmers. In many cases,
however, the present owners do not have the financial resources or the management
skills needed to rehabilitate the RBs and make them eligible for intermediating
loans from LBP to the rural sector. Thus, it will be essential to attract new
investors, especially banks in good standing, to bring additional investments and
skills to the RB system.

Rural-Financial Guarantee and Insurance Programs
2.14      A large number of viable agricultural and agro-industrial projects are
not presently financed by lending institutions because of lack of bankable
collateral. As the Government has systematically withdrawn from direct lending,
it has developed several guarantee and insurance programs, on the assumption that
these would reduce the perceived risks of lending to farmers and rural buriness
without adequate collateral. Strengthening and expanding these mechanisms is an
essential component of government's strategy to stimulate agricultural growth and
alleviate rural poverty.
2.15      Ouedan Guarantee Fund Board (OGFB).  QGFB, created in 1978, initially
focussed on the grains industry. The scheme enables local traders and millers
to deposit surplus grain purchased from farmers in a franchised bonded warehouse,
in exchange for a negotiable warehouse receipt known as a "quedan", which can be
used as collateral for bank loans of up to 80% of the value of the grain. QGFB
guarantees the integrity of the warehouse receipt and insures the bank against
default for 80% of the loan value, for which it charges the bank a fee. QGFB is
an attached agency of the Department of Agriculture. Its management is quite
centralized, but very competent. QGFB staff strength has grown, in line with its
business volume, to 445 staff members by December 1990, including 325 in the
central office, and 120 in the regional and provincial branches.   They are
generally well qualified and highly motivated; staff turnover has been low
throughout QGFB's existence.
2.16      Since its inception, QCFB has dealt with 164 banks, including 99 rural
banks. Total loans guaranteed by QGFB and loans made by QGFB to small retailers
increased very substantially in real terms from 1979 to 1988, before declining
slightly in 1989-90. QGFB has incurred low guarantee claims of about 3% of its
guarantee volume.   Its net  income comes  largely from its investments  in
Government securities, but operating income has also expanded significantly, to
the point that in the last three years it exceeded investment income. In 1990,
30% of total income (P58.3 million) was derived from guarantee fees, 29% from
interest and other charges, 19% from investment in Government securities, and 22X
or as expense subsidy from the Comprehensive Agricultural Loan Fund (CALF). In
1990, operating income covered only 73% of operating costs. Clearly, QGFB needs
to review its fee structure with the goal of achieving full cost recovery.
2.17      QGFB's retained earnings have accumulated to P118 million, a slightly
higher figure than its initial fund of P95 million, indicating that its
innovative and entrepreneurial management has been extraordinarily successful
during difficult economic and political  times.   However,  QGFB would need
incremental funding to consolidate its present activities and provide for
expansion. It is estimated that an equity increase of P400 million by end-1991
and P500 million during 1992-95, is needed to meet the growing demand for
guarantees over the next five years. This would allow total volume of guaranteed
lending to increase to about P12.0 billion by 1995. Against QGFB's historical
increase of 63% p.a. over the last seven years (1981-88), the projected normal
growth rate of 34% p.a. appears realistic. These additional equity requirements



- 12 -
should be provided mainly through a privatization process, however, rather than
through the Government budget. To increase its operational impact, the QGFB also
needs to change its legal personality to that of a stock corporation providing
credit guarantee services for a wider range of economic activities.
2.18      The PhilinDine Crop Insurance Corporatio .   The Philippine Crop
Insurance Corporation (PCIC) was established as an auLonomous legal entity in
1978, for a period of 50 years. It has wide powers to amend its own by-laws and
to determine its operating policies, rules and regulations, as necessary, to
implement a crop insurance scheme. PCIC's authorized capital is P750 million,
and the subscribed capital which had been fully paid by end-1990 is P250 million.
However, total shareholders funds amounted to P377 million, inclusive of negative
retained earnings of P34 million and P160 million of other funds provided to PCIC
through transfer of assets. At 1990 year's end about 418,000 ha of rice and corn
crops were insured, representing 15X of total cultivated land with annual crops.
The number of farmers insured has grown to about 255,000. In addition, PCIC has
been authorized to guarantee --with the oacking of the Comprehensive Agricultural
Loan Fund (CALF)-- small production loans to farmers, of up to P50,000 per loan.
Although vital, PCIC's overall impact on the rural sector has been limited
because it insures mainly rice and corn producers. To broaden its impact, PCIC
needs to increase the area coverage for rice and corn and expand its coverage to
other crops.   Furthermore, while its present staffing ratios and costs are
reasonable, the productivity will improve substantially once PCIC increases its
coverage (geographic and kind of crops) and range of services under the proposed
project.
2.19      PCIC's premium structure was calculated on a 'no profit, no loss
basis".    Only  the  pure  premium  is charged  for  the  coverage,  excluding
administrative costs and profits, and based solely on loss expectancy. PCIC
levies a uniform premium despite the risk differentials among regions and
municipalities.   Subsidy levels in 1989 ranged from 56X for rice borrowing
farmers to about 73% for self-financed corn farmers; equivalent to about
($12)/farmer for borrowing rice farmers and $40 per self-financed corn farmer.
However, it appears that on average the real subsidy level has been higher,
because the 8% premium for rice and 13X for corn are on the low side, given
typhoon damages over the last five years.   PCIC calculations suggest that
appropriate premiums, based on the last 10 years' experience, and covering
administrative costs as well, would be 12.23% and 15.0X for rice and corn,
respectively.
2.20      PCIC's financial position has deteriorated.  It has lost in excess of
P290 million on its underwriting, due primarily to inadequate premium rates (the
corporation paid out an average of about P1.3 in indemnities per each Pl.O of
premium charged, including Government subsidy). While reinsurance recoveries
reduce this amount by some P80 million to P210 million, they do not alter the
fact that the basic business of the corporation is making significant losses.
The investment income has more than offset the underwriting losses, since 1987
it has no longer been adequate to cover the administrative costs, and the trend
is accelerating. In addition, inflation is steadily eroding, PCIC's equity in



- 13 -
real terms. In 1981 pesos, stockholders equity has shrunk from P360 million to
P117 million during the 1981-90 period. Hence, PCIC is in a downward financial
trend that must be reversed if its activities are to be sustained without
recurrent Government contribution. In summary, to improve its financial position
and expand its program, PCIC should: (a) gradually increase its premiums, toward
fully covering PCIC's operation costs and crop losses; (b) introduce variable
premium rates to cover different risks; (c) expand its coverage to include other
crops and livestock, and medium size commercial farmers; and (d) mobilize
additional equity.
The Borrower: Land Bank of the Philippines
2.21      The Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), the Borrower, was initially
established in 1963 as the primary agency respcnsible for financing agrarian
reform.   In 1972, its scope was substantiallv liicreased and its charter, set
forth in Presidential Decree No. 251, provided for ordinary share capital of P1.8
billion, which was finally paid up in 1986 and is all owned by GOP. LBP has a
head office in Manila, 49 branches and 91 field offices to support its agrarian
portfolio. Its total staff at December 1990 was 3,700, of whom 2,400 (65X) were
based outside Manila. Although LBP had been set up to buy land from landowners
(paid ~ir partly with cash and partly with bonds) and extend low cost loans to
smallholders, total lending for agrarian reform activities accounted for only
about 9% of LBP's total assets, or about 21% of its gross loan portfolio, at 1990
year end. A detailed description of LBP's operations and performance is given
in Annex 2.1.
2.22      Until recently, LBP's activities had actually been mainly outside the
agricultural sector. However, since 1987 it has vigorously expanded small farmer
lending.   By December 1990, loans to agriculture, excluding agrarian reform
mortgages, had increased to P3.1 billion (32X) of LB.'s loan portfolio, up from
PO.7 billion (13%) in December 1987.  Agricultural loans, including agrarian
reform mortgages, now account for over half of LBP's loan portfolio. LBP also
provides financing to commercial sector enterprises, which at 1989 year end
accounted for about 18% of its gross loan portfolio, to Government Corporate
Units and Local Government (12%), banks (9%) and directed livelihood projects
(9%). Additionally, LBP provides substantial Government finance through holding
assets as treasury bills and to other banks as short term deposits.
2.23      As of December 1990, LBP resources amounted to P22.8 billion (US$814
million), of which P6.3 billion or 28% is net worth (P1.8 billion share capital
and P4.5 billion reserves and retained earnings), P8.3 billion or 36% is public
and government deposits, P1.4 billion or 6% is Bonds resulting from Land Reform.
The balance of P6.8 billion, or 30%, includes bills payable of P1.6 billion (7%),
amounts due to the Agrarian Reform Fund (ARF) of P1.9 billion, (8%), special
financing for specific programs and other liabilities of P3.3 billion (14%).
About P11.1 billion (49%) of LBP's total assets was in the form of cash (19%) and
Treasury Bills (30%), P0.3 billion (1%) in investment in affiliates, P9.1 billion
(40%) in loans, and about P2.3 billion (10%) in other assets.



- 14 -
2.24      LBP's earnings come mainly from its commercial banking (35%) and
investment operations (65%). Its agrarian lending and associated administrative
costs are fully reimbursed by ARF, so that although agrarian loans are reflected
in LBP's Balance Sheet, to date they have not had a significant impact on Profit
and Loss Account.   Over the past five years (1986-1990),  LBP's after tax
earnings, excluding gains from property sales, have averaged P435 million (about
XUS$20 million), compared with average equity of P3.87 billion (about US$179
million), giving an average return to equity of 11%. This compares favorably
with the average inflation over the same period (8.9%), and indicates that LBP
has had sufficient earnings to improve its net worth. In the past, LBP's capital
base had been eroded by the need to finance losses incurred under old trust fund
arrangements, which were off balance sheet. However, these have been more than
offset by realized gains from property sales. Under current legislation, trust
fund investments are limited to Go-ernment Securities, so there is little
possibility of new losses of this type.
2.25      The current arrangements for buying land under the Comprehensive
Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) have serious potential implications for LBP.
There is a mismatch between payments to landowners and receipts from small farmer
mortgagees, which in present value terms amount to about P25,000 (about $900) per
hectare. LBP is presently required to pay landowners within 30 days, partly by
cash and partly with LBP bonds, funded through ARF. If, for any reason ARF were
not fully funded in the future, LBP would still have the legal responsibility to
finance the ten years' future liability associated with its bonds that were
issued against the outstanding sum on any land purchase (about 80%). If land
acquisition proceeded rapidly over the medium-term, without adequate and timely
funding, LBP would be left with substantial bonds to be serviced and retired,
which could result in a huge cash shortfall, beyond LBP's ability to cover. To
prevent this, it would be desirable for LBP's bonds and mortgage financing
operations for agrarian reform clients end its commercial banking operations to
be legally separated; alternatively the payment instrument for land rirchases
could be changed from LBP bonds to National Government bonds.
2.26      With the collaboration of the Department of Agriculture, LBP has
recently expanded its business through cooperatives. The numbers of cooperatives
served increased from 1987 to 1990 as follows:
1987       1988        1989        1990
No. of Cooperatives               20        281          841       2893
Disbursement (P million)           7         82          411       1798
More details on LBP's lending to small farmers and cooperatives are given in
Annex 2.2. Since LBP initially worked with well-established cooperatives, its
present collection rates are good (about 95%). However, as new cooperatives come
on stream and the level of borrowers' experience is reduced, there is a high
probability that credit performance will deteriorate. To guard against this, LBP



- 15 -
needs to increase its vigilance and impose tight discipline, ensuring that it
lends only to cooperatives that: (a) are commercially and financially viable;
(b) have adequately trained credit officers and accounting/bookkeeping personnel;
and (c) have a membership of individual farmers who understand and are .^ully
trained in the principles of cooperative responsibilities and duties (Annex 2.2).
Having assured that its own lending is solid, LBP will also need to give
financial advice and training to cooperatives on onlending terms and conditions,
because most of them are not charging members a sufficient spread to cover risks
and administration costs and to build up equity.
Bank Sector Assistance Strategy
2.27      The Bank attaches high priority to agricultural development, as a
means to support both economic growth and poverty alleviation in the Philippines.
Since 1964, the Bank has approved 41 loans and credits (US$1.5 billion) for
investmenits in agriculture and rural development. Approximately one-third of
these projects were for irrigation development, and another one-third for rural
credit. The remainder have been for area-based rural development projects, rural
infrastructure, processing and storage, land settlement, extension and research,
smailholder forestry, watershed management and erosion control, agricultural
inputs under one policy-based loan, and small coconut farm development.
Implementation of completed and ongoing Bank-financed projects has generally been
satisfactory, although some operations have experienced delays because of local
funding constraints, overly optimistic targets, design changes after project
start-up, peace and order problems, weak or poorly coordinated multiple
implementing agencies and time-consuming procurement procedures.
2.28      Previous agricultural credit operations (including loans for crops,
livestock, fisheries and agroprocessing) have been mainly for medium- and long-
term credit.   Investments  financed by these projects have been generally
productive, and the completed projects have shown satisfactory rates of return.
Of the 14 previous credit operations, the Development Bank of the F'..lippines
(DBP) received eight loans totalling US$130.4 million. Although these projects
emphasized DBP's institutional development and financial viability, DBP
experienced high sub-loan arrears on its overall loan portfolio (including sub-
loans not financed by the Bank projects) which contributed to financial
difficulties in the mid-1980s, and in turn had an adverse impact on agricultural
credit operations in general. Some of the past credit projects (Loans 432, 607,
1010, and 1399) provided some US$76 million to CBP for onlending through the
rural banking system to finance farm mechanization, irrigation equipment and
rural enterprises.   Performance under these projects in terms of increased
production and rural employment was satisfactory, but the projects were only
moderately successful in promoting institutional development due to financial
problems of rural banks, arising particularly from sub-loan arrearage under
government-sponsored credit programs (principally M-99).   Some US$23 million
uncommitted under the Third Livestock and Fisheries Project (Loan 1849-PH) and
the Smallholder Tree Farming Project (Loan 1506-PH), both implemented by DBP,
were canceled due to DBP's financial problems. Another project, the Small Farmer
Development Project (Loan 1646-PH) implemented by the Land Bank of the



- 16 -
Philippines (LBP), has experienced institutional problems including weak field
office organization and sub-loan arrearage.
2.29      Agricultural Loan Fund.  From the standpoint of the proposed project,
the most important earlier Bank credit operation was Loan 2570-PH, under which
the Agricultural Toan Fund (ALF) was established in 1985. ALF was operated as
a rediscount line available to banks to re-finance loans for seasonal
agricultural production credit and agricultural investments. Financing for this
line was initially provided by the World Bank (US$100 million) and USAID
(US$17 million). In addition funds were also contributed by CBP (approximately
US$14 million).   After a comparatively slow start, ALF took off rapidly.
Disbursement increased from about P30 million per month in 1986, to P66 million
in 1988 and P187 million in 1989.  The fund it now fully committed and the
present rate of disbursements is controlled by the rate of repayment of
outstanding loans and provision for fund amortization. Overall, the projected
level of disbursements possible with existing ALF resources averages about P40
to P50 million (US$1.4 to 1.8 million) per month (in current terms) over the next
five years. This is substantially below the present demand level (para. 3.4).
2.30      A major reason for the rapid disbursement of funds under ALF in recent
years appears to have been its attractive interest rate policy. ALF funds have
been re-lent to participating banks at the higher of either: (a) the cost of
money to CBP after taking account of potential foreign exchange risk and
administrative costs, or (b) the weighted average of time deposits, savings, and
demand deposits in the Philippines. The cost of money formula normally applied,
which yielded an ALF lending rate that was below the marginal cost of funds in
the banking sector (considered as the time deposit rate adjusted for CBP reserve
requirements).
2.31      Most ALF funds were used to expand existing agricultural businesses,
with an estimated 32% of all sub-loan amounts going to agro-processing and post-
harvest facilities, 24% to seasonal crops, 22% for poultry and livestock, 15% for
fisheries and 7% for plantation crops development (Annex 2.3). Although most of
the earlier ALF operations went to small- and medium-sized firms, by 1989 larger
firms took an increasing proportion of the total resources. Of P2.9 billionl of
sub-loans in 1989, 47% were for loans of over 020 million each (about
US$920,000). Over the whole period through December 1989, about half of ALF
funds were for loans of less than P10 million (about US$0.5 million). Of the
total number of loans over the same period, 41% were made by commercial banks,
33% by thrift banks, 24% by rural banks and 3% by others. In value terms, the
figures were 72% commercial banks, 25% thrift banks, 1% rural banks and 2X
others.
2.32      ALF was clearly an important factor in providing liquidity for rural
development.   Disbursements of ALF funds in 1989 (its peak lending year)
comprised about 7% of recorded disbursements from the formal banking system to
agriculture. Although the intention was for ALF funds to be used either for
seasonal capital or for investment, in some cases ALF investment funds were used
partly for replacing of roll over short-term financing of existing investments



- 17 -
rather than for truly new investment, which has a less catalytic effect in
stimulating investment. Careful redrafting of the ^LF operating manual, which
is presently being undertaken, will ensure that in fu. ure ALF long term funds are
used for incremental investment purposes.
2.33      In November  1989,  the  Monetary  Board  decided  to  transfer  the
administration of the ALF from the CBP to LBP. A Memorandum of Agreement to this
effect was drawn up on April 27, 1990 and ALF moved operationally to LBP on July
1, 1990. The total capital resources transferred from the CBP to LBP amounted
to about P2.5 billion (CBP's profits from operating the fund in 1989 and its own
capital input were not transferred). The agreement between CBP and LBP provides
for the latter to re-lend loan proceeds for the same purposes as were originally
allowable under ALF and that the collections of CBP loans (considered as loans
from CBP to LBP) would be re-lent for the same purposes. Based on LBP's present
working assumptions, funds for relending would average only about P500 million
(US$18 million) per year over the next four years (1991-94), or about one-quarter
of its peak level of activities. The fact that ALF is presently under-funded is
clearly demonstrated by the backlog of applications, now equivalent to about 10
months' lending.
2.34      ALF performance in terms of its financial position, disbursement and
loan collection, the number of PFIs, and the range of sub-borrower and subsector
coverage is satisfactory, but it is now short of free lending resources. The
proposed project has been prepared for the purpose of continuing and
strengthening the ALF operation with particular emphasis on providing term credit
investment facility. In 1991, LBP changed ALF's name to Countryside Loan Fund
(CLF), to better reflect its future objective.
2.35      Lessons Learned 4/.  The broad lessons that emerge from the review of
the previous agricultural and rural credit projects ars that:   (a) directed
credit by crop or type of investments, at subsidized interest rates, did not
sustain economic growth, improve the credit delivery system in the rural areas,
or increase the access of rural borrowers to formal credit facilities; and (b)
heavy arrears and poor financial conditions of the apex institution and/or the
selected PFIs severely constrained project success.  Whenever interest rates
either fell significantly below or moved well above prevailing market rates,
serious implementation problems emerged: above-market rates, resulted in slow
disbursement of Bank loan funds, while below-market rates led to concentration
of credit to relatively wealthier and larger clients. These lessons have been
incorporated in the proposed project.

III. THEPRIOJECT
Project Objectives and Description
3.1       The proposed project would help to expand the volume of commercial
credit for agriculture and rural developmert in the Philippines, and to enhance
the policy and institutional framework of the rural. financial sector, by: (a)
supporting the development of the ALF/CLF rediscounting facility, now
administered by LBP, as the Government's primary mechanism for resource
mobilization to finance increased private investment in the agriculture and rural
sectors; and (b) providing for the institutional and financial strengthening of
the rural banking (RB) system, PCIC, QGFB, and LBP, to facilitate better access
to formal credit and banking services in rural areas.
3.2       The project, to be implemented over five years, would comprise the
following components:
(a) Credit to finance private investments in agricultural and other viable
rural operations. Loans would be made for seasonal production and for
investments in fixed assets and incremental working capital. Credit
would be provided through the banking system for a broad spectrum of
agricultural and non-farm rural investments, such as poultry,
livestock,    fisheries   development,   plantation   crops,    farm
mechanization,   agro-processing,   workshops,   and   post-harvest
facilities. This component would also include a pilot scheme under
which US$1.0 million equivalent would be channeled through selected
cooperatives as financial intermediaries to support the long-term
investment of their members.
(b)  Policy  and  Institutional  DeveloRment  including:        (i)  further
liberalization of banking policies concerning the opening of new
branches in rural areas, merging of banks in rural areas, ceilings on
the maximum shareholdings by a single investors, and other inducements
to banks in good standing to re-capitalize rural banks with equity
deficiencies; and (Ii) strengthening of existing insurance/guarantee
funds, so they will be in a sound position to provide farmers and
banks with adequate insurance and guarantee facilities at market
prices; and
(c)  Studies and training including; (i) policy related studies on (formal
and informal) rural credit constraints, with special emphasis on term
lending and resource mobilization; and (ii) training for CLF and PFIs
project staff and for cooperative members and management to enhance
their ability to handle credit operations.

fgtailed Features
3.3       Credit Component.   The project would provide US$150 million of
additional funds for the newly established ALF/CLF rediscounting facility.
ALF/CLF operations will be determined by market forces, with no earmarked
allocation of funds by crop or type of investment, nor any targeted group of
borrowers.    The  Land  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (LBP),  which  is  already
administering the ongoing ALF, would be the apex institution for channeling the
credit component through the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs), for a
broad spectrum of agricultural and non-farm rural investments (e.g., production,
processing, marketing, and transport in relation to crop development, irrigation,
farm mechanization, post harvest facilities, poultry, livestock, and fisheries
development, plantation crops, storage facilities, agro-processing, custom
service or leasing operations in agricultural equipment and machinery, and import
of critical inputs by traders). LBP would perform this wholesale function on a
commercial basis, and would exclude itself from direct lending to sub-borrowers
under ALF/CLF. Assurances to these effects were obtained at negotiations (para.
6.1 (a)).
3.4       The  demand  for ALF/CLF  funds  is currently  running  at  a  level
substantially above their availability. Future demand for ALF/CLF resources, and
hence the rate of drawdown of the loan, would be dependent on the overall
performance of the economy, interest rate relative to other rediscounting
sources, the level of investment or reinvestment in the rural sector, and the
requirement for seasonal production credit.  It is estimated that total working
capital requirements 'ox agriculture were on the order of US$2.1 to 2.9 billion
in 1990 (Annex 1.1'..   Annual investment requirements to maintain existing
agricultural facilities and provide for planned sectoral growth of about 4% (as
proposed in the Philippine Agricultural Development Plan 1991-1995) would be
about US$0.9 billiox;  Over the five year disbursement period of the Bank loan,
ALF/CLF combined resources would peak, in 1990 value terms, at about US$140
million. On this bap's, ALF/CLF would provide about 2% of total agricultural
investment (one years, .easonal credit-- P60 billion plus five years investment
P146 billion).  Under a more pessimistic scenario of lower 1% annual growth,
investment needs would 311 to about P156 billion over five years, mostly for
reinvestment.    In thf, case,  ALF/CLF would provide  about  2.7% of  total
agricultural investment.   As ALF/CLF resources would be used not only for
agriculture, but also for other rural endeavors, the percentage of total rural
investment and seasonal costs which ALF/CLF would cover, assuming full
disbursement in five years, would likely be below 2%. This should be readily
attainable, provided the fund is well administered and its cost is in line with
wholesale market interest rates.
3.5        The project would continue with the previous ALF policy of supporting
seasonal production credit sub-loans to finance rice, sugar, corn, cotton,
vegetables,  fruits, poultry,  fish and livestock production.   Financing of
seasonal production credit is essential to support rural sector economic growth.
As a result of the 1990 earthquake and the recent Middle East Gulf Crisis, as
well as the overall fiscal deficit, GOP has borrowed heavily in the local capital



- 20 -
market, at the expense of the private productive sector.   Additional formal
funding at market-determined rates is therefore necessary to support sectoral
growth. Beyond these macroeconomic considerations, other specific reasons to
continue supporting seasonal production credit needs are that:   (a) there
continues to be strong credit demand, particularly in the sugar sector, for which
the 18-month facility available under the existing ALF/CLF has been particularly
attractive; and (b) availability of project funds will help to encourage higher
input usage and, generally, greater productivity. The beneficiaries of credit
extended by rural and thrift banks would mainly include small and medium size
entrepreneurs, while other banks would likely fccus on larger borrowers. Funds
initially provided by the Bank for short term credit would be subsequently
recycled through the ALF/CLF to medium and long-term sub-loans, as increased
domestic resources become available for short term funding. Assurances to this
effect were obtained at negotiations (para. 6.1 (b)).
3.6       The project would also fund medium- and long-term loans channeled
through the banking system, to help overcome the acute shortage of such financing
for agricultural and rural development in the Philippines. Term lending by the
banking system has mainly taken the form of roll-overs of short-term loans, and
the irformal credit sector has hardly been involved, if at all, with long-term
fi4ancing.    The Bank  loan would  fund fixed assets,  excluding  land,  and
increme,;tPl working capital including expansion of existing enterprises. The
repayment periods for medium-and long-term sub-loans would be based on the sub-
projects' cash flow and related to the sub-borrowers' overall repayment capacity.
Repayment of most sub-loans would be in 5 to 10 years, but will not exceed 15
years.
3.7       ALF/CLF operations will be kept separately within LBP's accounts.
Detailed estimates of the cash flow of CLF are given in Annex 3.1. As LBP would
operate ALF/CLF on a commercial basis, it should make profits from re-investment
of the cash element of the fund. Such net profits would be reflected in LBP's
profit and loss account, and would remain within ALF/CLF as LBP's investment.
Agreement to this effect was obtained at negotiations (para. 6.1 (c)).
3.8       CooReratives Sub-ComRonent.  Most Philippine farmers rely on informal
credit, which carries extremely high interest rates and binds them to traditional
marketing channels. The expansion of institutional credit at reasonable interest
rates is therefore an important element in the Government's rural development and
poverty alleviation strategies. Cooperatives would, in principle, be the best
conduit for channeling formal credit to small farmers, because of the closeness
of the cooperative's management to ind'vidual farmer members (Annex 2.2). Hence,
strengthening of cooperatives is a national goal, as stated in the Constitution
of the Philippines.
3.9       During  the  last  three-four  years,  LBP  has  assumed  increasing
responsibility for extending credit to small farmers (Annex 2.2), with heavy
reliance on cooperatives.   The volume of LBP loans to small farmers via
cooperatives in 1990 was about P1.8 billion (to 200,000 beneficiaries) compared
to only P82 million (and to 16,000 beneficiaries) in 1988. There are indications



- 21 -
that this program is having successful results, including relatively good
performance  in  loan  repayment  (96%  in  1990).    However,  LBP  lending  to
cooperatives is presently financed by the Agrarian Reform Fund (ARF).  These
funds are for seasonal production and are inexpensive, and LBP does not bear the
full risk of default in loan repayment. This will not be the case with ALF/CLF
funds, which will carry market interest rates, with the risk of default being
fully borne by LBP. A significant share of the cooperatives presently financed
by LBP would not meet conventional creditworthiness criteria. To further LBP's
cooperative development effort, the project would provide term lending on a pilot
basis to finance cooperatives' investment needs, basically in post harvest
facilities. US$1 million equivalent of ALF/CLF funds would be extended to a
selected group of financially viable and well managed cooperatives. The credit
would finance viable investments, preferably in post harvest facilities, and
working capital of the cooperatives and their members, at market interest rates
which are not lower than those charged to PFIs. Finally, training programs and
technical assistance for cooperatives' personnel and members would be undertaken,
to enhance their ability to manage credit operations.
3.10      The equity capital of most cooperatives financed by LBP is extremely
low and the sole 'collateral' provided for the production loans (which comprises
the major portion of LBP's credit to cooperatives) is in the form of farmers'
promissory notes against revenue from their produce. Also, a large number of
cooperatives are new or at an early stage of economic activity (Table I, Annex
2.2), thus cannot demonstrate loan repayment records.   Hence, conventional
lending criteria cannot be applied to these cooperatives.   Instead,  other
quantitative criteria for the selection of viable and well managed cooperatives
would be used (Annex 3.2). Cooperatives participating in the pilot ALF/CLF plan
should demonstrate improvement with respect to any criterion for which they were
initially  rated weak.    In addition,  two  aspects  should  show continuous
improvement:   training of cooperative members and accumulation of equity,
especially retained earnings. Cooperatives should also maintain adequate control
procedures and maintain separate accounts for the execution of investments and
the operation of facilities financed under ALF/CLF. Annual reports should be
submitted to LBP's Field Offices, including a summary of the related receipts and
expenses, loan repayment (interest and principal), identification of benefits and
an estimate of their value, and an estimate of non-cash expenses.
3.11      LBP's field operations group would monitor and evaluate the results
of the pilot plan, with particular attention to: (a) volume of loans by usage;
(b) execution of the investment in facilities; (c) analysis of the individual
cooperative reports (para. 3.10) accompanied by description of the usage of
facilities; (d) progress of participating cooperatives regarding the performance
aspects that were initially found to be low; and (e) progress in training and
equity  accumulation  of  the  individual  cooperatives.    If  the  number  of
participating cooperatives exceeds 50, a procedure for comparative performance
evaluation would also be developed.   The resulting rating of participating
cooperatives should be used for both monitoring purposes by LBP and as a
motivational tool for the cooperatives themselves (Annex 2.2 para. 10, (d)).



- 22 -
3.12      Policy and Institutional Development ComRonent.  The broad objective
of this component is to strengthen and improve the rural banking sector and the
crop  insurance  and  rural  guarantee  institutions.    This  component  would
concentrate on actions by various institutions other than LBP. Implementation
would be the responsibility of the Government of the Philippines, through the
Department of Finance and the CBP. These actions include further liberalization
of banking policies and strengthening of the formal financial system in the rural
areas, the Quedan Guarantee Fund Board (QGFB), and the Philippine Crop Insurance
Corporation (PCIC) as follows:
(a)  Further liberalization of banking policies and strengthening of the
formal financial system is essential to enhance competition and
resource mobilization in the rural areas. Under this component, new
criteria would be agreed concerning bank categorization by service
areas, to minimize restrictions on opening new branches to serve the
rural sector. Also, current restrictions on merging of banks would
be eliminated, and limits on maximum shareholding that a single
investor can have in a distressed rural bank would be adjusted as
needed to mobilize the additional capital requirements. The approval
by the Monetary Board of these liberalization banking policies would
be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.3 (a)).
(b)  Furthermore, a program acceptable to the Bank would be developed by
PDIC, in collaboration with CBP and LBP, to strengthen the rural
banking system by inducing banks in good standing to invest in rural
banks with an equity deficiency. The approval of this program by the
Monetary Board and its initial implementation in a manner satisfactory
to the Bank would be a condition of loan effectiveness 6.3 (b)). As
a result of this program, it is envisaged that: (i) there will be a
more efficient use of existing banking infrastructure in rural areas
to enhance credit delivery and resource mobilization; (ii) RB related
losses to the Philippine economy, and in particular CBP and PDIC,
would be minimized; and (iii) RBs which cannot benefit from the
program and are likely to remain insolvent, would be closed to avoid
posing continued risks to depositors and other creditors.
(c)  In order to strengthen the OGFB,  the guarantee  facility would
progressively shift its focus to attend the needs of small farmer
groups. QGFB would also take the necessary steps to modify its legal
status to that of a stock corporation with the capacity to mobilize
from private investors the additional equity needed to expand its
operations, and to provide credit guarantee facilities for a wider
range of economic activities (including production inputs, farm
equipment, post harvest facilities, working capital and inventory).
To improve its financial position, QGFB would also gradually increase
i - guarantee fees to fully cover, by 1994 its operating costs and
expected losses. Finally, QGFB would implement a satellite warehouse
pilot project and a grain trading center; and would expand its support
for small farmers through additional use of NFA storage facilities and



. 23 -
other leasing arrangements. Assurances to these effects were obtained
at negotiations (para. 6.2 (a)).
(d)  To strengthen the PCIC the insurance corporation would modify its
premium structure by adopting variable rates by regions, reflecting
empirically determined variable risks, and would gradually increase
its premium level toward full cost recovery by farmers and the
respective lending institutions and elimination of all subsidies by
end-1995. PCIC would also introduce insurance options to cover both
uncontrollable (typhoons, floods and draughts) and controllable (pests
and diseases) risks, the latter at higher premium levels. Finally,
in order to maintain a prudent ratio of total risks to liquidity
assets, PCIC would obtain from LBP P250 million in preferred shares
and from GOP about P220 million of overdue contributions to crop
insurance. The latter would be provided by the conversion of SRTF
(para. 2.17) earnings into Government's equity investment. Assrances
to these effects were obtained at negotiations (para. 6.2 (b)).
3.13      Training and Studies ComRonent.  The project would provide funds for
a training sub-component to address skill gaps of project-related staff in LBP
and the participating financial institutions, particularly in sub-project
appraisal and inflation implications on sub-borrower cash-flow and sub-loan
repayment; and environmental screening, monitoring and compliance with
environmental laws and regulations. Other programs would cover familiarization
training for senior staff and sub-loan supervision training. Details of training
activities are provided in Annex 3.3.  The project would also fund a special
training program for cooperative staff and management, to upgrade their ability
to perform a financial intermediary functions for their members, both in terms
of extending loans and mobilizing savings. This sub-component would be carried
out by LBP.
3.14      The  policy  studies  sub-component,  to  be  carried  out  by  the
Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC), would support: (a) a comprehensive
study to generate formal basic data to determine the relative role that the
informal financial sector is playing in terms of credit supply and resource
mobilization in rural areas, the extent to which the "shortage" of institutional
financial services is a constraint to development in these same areas; and the
extent to which the informal financial sector could be "used" to provide
financial services t  rural low income groups; and (b) an assessment of the
agricultural term lending market, including a review of volume, demand and
supply, interest rates, collaterals, and profitability/efficiency constraints.
Project Cost and Financing
3.15      The total project cost is estimated at US$203.5 million equivalent,
of which about US$81 million or 401 in foreign exchange.   The share of the
foreign exchange component is based on the assumptions underlying the indicative
lending program and would vary depending on the eventual composition of actual
lending in response to market forces.

3.16      The proposed Bank loan of US$150 million would contribute about 74%
of total project costs and would finance 99% (US$80 million equivalent) of the
foreign exchange requirements and 57% (US$70 million equivalent) of local costs.
Local cost financing is justified because of the Philippines current difficult
economic situation and the poverty alleviation objectives of the project. The
remaining project cost would be financed aS follows: sub-loan beneficiaries and
participating banks up to an average of 15% (US$30 million equivalent) and 10%
(US$20 million equivalent), respectively, and about US$3.5 million for the
training and policy related studies component by LBP (US$3.4 million) and ACPC
(US$0.1 million). The Bank loan would be made available to the Land Bank of the
Philippines with the guarantee of the Government of the Philippines (GOP) at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would have a term of 20 years with
5 years of grace.

Procurement
3.17      Procurement of goods, works and services financed with loan funds
would be on the basis of procedures which are customary for development finance
operations.   They would apply both to situations where ALF/CLF funds are
disbursed directly against the sub-project and also when disbursement is used to
repay an interim loan for an eligible sub-project. Contracts above US$5 million
equivalent will normally be procured by International Competitive Bidding. Other
procurement would follow established commercial practices which are satisfactory
to the Bank. Limited International Bidding (LIB) and direct contracting would
be allowed for contracts costing more than US$5.0 million equivalent in the
following cases:  (a) in the case of modernization or expansion projects, for



- 25 -
standardized equipment or proprietary parts needed for compatibility with
existing equipment; (b) for machinery which is available from only a limited
member of suppliers worldwide; and (c) where the procedures are otherwise
justified for technical reasons. These cases would be subject to the Bank prior
approval. Procurement of consultants will be in accordance with Bank Guidelines
for the use of consultants or with those of participating bilateral cofinanciers.
LBP would review the compliance of participating banks with procurement
procedures during its periodic supervision of project assisted sub-loans. All
ICB packages will be subject to Bank prior approval.
Disbursement
3.18      The Government has requested that, in view of the country's financial
constraints, the Bank should reimburse 100% of sub-loans disbursed by PFIs for
seasonal production credit up to a total of US$30.0 million equivalent, provided
that overall reimbursement of sub-loan amounts disbursed during the project
period does not exceed 75%. In the current circumstances, this is considered
justifiable. Disbursement of the loan proceeds wculd accordingly cover:
(a) for short-term credit, the first US$30 million of Bank loan at 100%
of sub-loans disbursed by the PFIs and the balance at 55% of sub-loans
disbursed, so that overall disbursement during the project period
would not exceed 75% of total sub-loans;
(b)  for med'um and long term credit, 75% of sub-loans disbursed by PFIs
and reimbursed by LBP.
Retroactive financing of up to US$15 million equivalent is also proposed for
eligible credit sub-loans made by ALF/CLF after November 1, 1990. These sub-
loans were made under the pressure of the heavy demand for ALF resources which
lead LBP and PFIS, in anticipation of additional financing, to use short-term
and/or unrelated resources to support the sub-projects.
3.19      LBP would  establish  a Special Account  in accordance with  Bank
guidelines to facilitate rapid disbursement of the Bank loan. An initial deposit
of US$10 million would be made by the IAank into the Special Account, representing
about 25% of the expected first year disbursements. Withdrawal from the Special
Account would be fully accounted for by sub-loan disbursements eligible for Bank
funding under the project terms and conditions. Withdrawal from the loan account
would be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs), and LBP would
ensure that all supporting documentation is adequately maintained and would be
available for review upon the Bank's request.   The loan is expected to be
disbursed in about five years, based on the Standard Disbursement Profile for all
regions agricultural credit operations as of April 1990.   The disbursement
schedule is given in Annex 3.4. The project would be completed by September 30,
1996 and the expected Loan Closing Date would be March 31, 1997.

Monitoring. ReRorting And Audits
3.20      A project sunervision plan is presented in Annex 3.5.   LBP would
submit to the Bank, on the basis of agreed formats, semi annual progress reports
on project implementation. These reports would include an assessment of progress
in implementing the credit, the policy and institutional development, and the
training  and  studies  components.    LBP  and  the  Participating  Financial
Institutions (PFIs) would maintain separate accounts for project funds.  The
accounts of LBP, ALF/CLF, the project Special Account and the SOEs related to
project activities, would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable
te, the Bank. The audit reports, including an opinion regarding the supporting
documentation for disbursements based on SOEs, would be submitted to the Bank
within six months after the end of LBP's fiscal year.   Also, LBP would be
responsible for the preparation of the Borrower's inputs to the Project
Completion Report. Assurances to these effects were obtained at negotiations
(para. 6.1 (d)).   LBP would also require PFIs, as necessary to provide an
auditor's opinion on whether sub-loans are in agreement with the terms and
conditions of project lending. In addition LBP would selectively review project
sub-loans and would provide a brief report on the quality of sub-loans and the
adequacy of PFIs' supervision and records (Annex 3.5).
3.21      LBP would establish a monitoring and evaluation system for the project
credit and training components. The objectives would be to identify constra'nts,
initiate  corrective  measures  and upgrade  project  performance.    The  main
components of the monitoring and evaluation system would comprise: (a) regular
reporting on the financial and physical progress within both LBP and the
participating banks; (b) annual evaluations during project implementation to
assess performance of the training program, of typical sub-projects, and the
project's financial impact on participating banks; and (c) ex-post evaluation of
the credit and institutional development components. Monitoring and evaluation
of the credit and the training components would be the responsibility of the CLF
Unit within LBP.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
General
4.1       The project would be implemented through various Government agencies,
each with the following responsibilities:
A-encv                        Component
LBP         -         Credit and training
CBP         -         Banling policies for the rural areas

- 27 -
As the Borrower of the Bank loan, LBP, through its President, would assume
overall responsibility for project coordination, LBP is a Government bank, with
considerable experience and exposure in the rural sector. Since July 1990, it
has managed the ALF, the predecessor of CLF, albeit at a lower level of activity
than is anticipated once the proposed Bank loan becomes effective. In many ways,
this has provided a pilot or a test of its capabilities, which LBP has passed
quite well. Over the past year, in close consultation with the Bank, LBP has
established and staffed an ALF/CLF unit within its organizational structure,
undertaken a major revision of the ALF/CLF Policy Manual to reflect lessons
learned during CBP's administration of ALF, and continued ALF/CLF rediscounting
activities at the maximum rate possible given the resources available. LBP is
currently refining the monitoring tools which will be put in p.ace for the new
project. With the support of technical assistance under the project, LBP will
also finalize training programs for its own staff and those of participating
financial institutions and cooperatives, and will carry out continuous training
over the life of the project. Overall, LBP is a strong bank, with sound systems
and a well qualified staff of about 3,500. Over the past five years (1986-1990),
LBP has been profitable, in both current and constant terms, with average current
earnings of about P400 million (about $20 million) annually. At 1990 year-end,
it had a substantial capital base, totalling over P6.3 billion (about $225
million), or 28% of its total assets. LBP has maintained a cautious exposure
policy, and its total risk assets to capital ratio at its last balance sheet date
amounted to 1.8:1. A detailed description of LBP's operations and performance
are provided in Annex 2.1.   The Government of the Philippines, through its
Department of Finance and CBP, would ensure that the policy and institutional
strengthening component would be carried out in accordance with the objectives
stated in the Loan Agreement. Specific implementation arrangements are discussed
below.
Credit Operation
4.2       Countryside Loan Fund (CLF) Unit, The CLF Unit within LBP's Program
Lending Department (PLD), headed by an experienced manager, would handle day-to-
day implementation of the credit component. It would onlend project funds to the
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) and provide them, as necessary, with
technical assistance on CLF operations. It would process sub-loan applications
from PFIs; provide guidelines to PFIs on sub-project selection and appraisai;
carry out selective end-use verification of eub-projects funded by the CLF;
monitor sub-project performance; liaise with the CLF Steering Committee on policy
related issues; conduct training with PFIs; and manage the overall CLF
relationship with the PFIs.
4.3       CLF Policy Steering Committee (CPSC).   Overall review of project
credit activities and policy matters would be carried out by CPSC, which would
provide continuing review and directives on rural credit policies, programs, and
institutions. The CPSC would comprise LBP's President, (Chairman); the DOF and
DOA Undersecretaries, CBP Deputy Governor, ACPC's Executive Director; the
Director of the Agricultural Staff, NEDA; and a representative of the PFIs. The
Steering Committee would meet as necessary but at least once every three months.



- 28 -
4.4       CLF's Operating Policies and Procedures.  Under the proposed project
LBP would continue to enhance its capabilities as a second-tier bank.   CLF
operations would be carried out on the basis of policies and procedures
established in a Policy Manual of Operations, to be approved by CLF's steering
Committee and satisfactory to the Bank. The Manual would be periodically updated
to reflect necessary policy changes. Policy amendments to be incorporated under
this loan are outlined below (paras. 4.5 to 4.23) and will be consolidated in a
revised  Policy  Manual  covering  the  whole  ALF/CLF.    The  adoption  and
implementation of the Policy Manual, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a
condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.3 (c).  Key policy issues discussed
below include: eligibility criteria for CLF resources (paras. 4.5 and 4.6);
interest rate structure (paras. 4.7 to 4.12); PFI's accreditation criteria (para.
4.13); sub-projects review (para. 4.14); sub-loan appraisal (para. 4.15); sub-
loan maturities (para. 4.16) Environmental protection (para. 4.17); and
supervision of CLF sub-loan  (paras.  4.18 to 4.21).   During negotiations,
agreement was obtained on the inclusion of the above features in the Policy
Manual.    The  Policy Manual  would not be  further  revised without  prior
consultation with and approval of the Bank (para. 6.1 (e)).
4.5       Eligibility Criteria.  The following types of rural activities, would
be eligible for financing under CLF, provided that CLF's total exposure under
sub-loans to any one single borrower does not exceed 5% of LBP's equity: (a)
seasonal production sub-loans of up to one year (up to 18 months for sugar); and
medium- or long-term investment financing for the establishment of new
enterprises, expansion of existing enterprises or reinvestment in existing
enterprises.   All agrici'tural based projects would be eligible,  including
fisheries, agro-industries and agricultural service enterprises. Other rural
industries would also be eligible, provided they are located, and most of their
business is carried out, in rural areas. To qualify, proposed projects must be
appraised by the PFI as technically feasible, financially viable, and in the case
of larger investment projects exceeding P30 million, economically justified.
4.6       CLF medium- and long-term investment financing is extended to support
medium-sized firms in the rural sector, which do not presently have easy access
to funds of more than one year's duration for real new investment.  Eligible
loans would be for investment in new buildings and machinery and incremental
permanent working capital (measured in real terms, excluding the inflationary
element of stocks). Land, existing buildings, or other assets previously used
within the rural sector (except breeding livestock) would be ineligible. For
each sub-project, the PFI would be required to provide at least 10% of the
financing package from its own funds. The minimum equity contribution by the
sub-borrower would be determined by the PFI on the basis of its sub-project
appraisal, but should not be less than 15%. LBP's financing would not exceed,
in any case, 75% of sub-project costs and 88% of a sub-loan.
4.7          Interest Rates Under the Proposed Project.  The Government of the
Philippines (GOP) has made important improvements over the past several years to
eliminate distortions and ensure that resource allocation and mobilization would
be driven by market oriented forces. Consequently, there has been a departure



- 29 -
from previous mechanisms to set interest rates through administrative procedures.
Financial institutions are now allowed freely to set competitive interest rates,
both for deposits and for loans.  Under the proposed project, interest rates
would: (a) be in line with market rates, as required by Government policy; (b)
be in line with interest rate arrangements under the latest Bank loan to DBP for
the Industrial Restructuring Project; (c) cover the Bank's interest rate and
foreign exchange risk related costs; and (d) allow free negotiations between LBP
and PFIs, on the one hand, and between PFIs and final borrowers, on the other,
to set rates which reflect their own needs.
4.8       Market reference rates are currently recorded by the CBP and are
published in the main newspapers. Prospective borrowers are, thus, well informed
on interest rate levels and trends in the local financial markets.   The key
reference rate is the time deposit interest rate. Under the proposed operation,
the weighted average interest rate (WAIR) of time-deposits of 180-days would be
used as the reference for setting interest rates charged by LBP. The reference
rates would be set monthly, as follows:
(i)  the arithmetic average of the WAIR as published monthly by CBP,
would be cormputed for the latest available three prior months.
This 3-month arithmetic average will be used as the reference
rate for a given month; and
(ii)  the variable rate from LBP to a PFI (and from the ?FI to a sub-
borrower) would be equal to the reference rate plus a fixed
spread to be freely negotiated between LBP and the PFIs (or
between the PFIs and the sub-borrowers).
4.9       The interest rate from LBP to PFIs for new sub-loans would be the
result of free negotiations between the two, taking into account recent trends
in the financial markets.   Given the constantly varying monetary and fiscal
conditions and the need to avoid major distortions due to differences with market
determined rates, there would be annual reviews between GOP, LBP and the Bank on
the adequacy of the financial arrangements under the proposed operation.
4.10      Since inflation in recent years has been quite variable, interest
rates for long-term loans would be adjusted from time to time to reflect the
trends of market short-term interest rates.  On the other hand, since borrowers
may be reluctant to borrow pure floating rate loans, a fixed interest rate
option, would also be introduced. Consequently, the PFIs would be able to offer
various options to the sub-borrowers under the proposed project, so as to match
their individual needs. Hence, the sub-loans under the proposed operation would
carry, at the option of the final sub-borrower: (a) a fixed lending interest
rate for ar least several years of the sub-loan; or (b) a variable lending
interest rate adjusted quarterly, based on the reference rate discussed above.
4.11      The sub-loans from LBP to the PFIs would also carry a fixed or an
adjustable interest rate, depending on the type of sub-loan chosen by the final
sub-borrower.   In the case of fixed rate sub-loans, LBP would be free to



- 30 -
determine the maximum period under which a loan would enjoy a fixed rate. LBP
would set a premium to cover its interest rate risk under such sub-loans based
on its perception of trends and volatility of market interest rates. From time
to time, it would set its fixed lending rate to PFIs for new sub-loans.
4.12      Foreign Exchange Risk.   The World Bank would lend to LBP at its
standard variable rate. As LBP will be lending the loan proceeds exclusively in
domestic currency and the entire Foreign Exchange (FX) would be made available
to the Government (through the conversion process), the Government would assume
the FX risk against a market based variable fee payable by LBP. This fee would
be set equal to the difference between the reference rate (para. 4.8 (i)) and the
World Bank lending rate plus 2X LBP's intermediation margin. The FX fee will be
established monthly in line with the movements of the two rates. However, the
FX fee to be paid by LBP to the Bureau of Treasury on existing loans would be
adjusted quarterly in case of loans bearing variable lending rate. In the case
of fixed interest rate loans, the FX would be adjusted inversely to the movement
of the Bank rate so that the total cost to LBP would remain the same for the
duration of the sub-loan. Since domestic interest rates in the Philippines are
basically market-determined and the capital account is essentially open, this
market-based variable formula provides a reasonable estimate of the FX risk.
4.13      EFI Accreditation Criteria.  Accreditation criteria of PFIs should
ensure that three fundamental aspects are complied with: solvency, profitability,
and quality of ownership and management.   Criteria need to be credible,
transparent, unequivocal, and compatible with sound and generally accepted
financial principles and with CBP's banking regulations. While accessory factors
could be taken into account for fine tuning purposes (e.g. reviewing LBP's credit
ceiling limits), care should be exercised to avoid deviation frora the main
criteria.
(a)  CBP's Banking Regulation.   CBP has issued detailed regulations to
determine adequate provisions to cover probable losses and, thus, to
determine the net equity level of banks.   CBP's Circular 1224 of
January 20, 1990 defines "past due loan accounts" and CBP's Circular
1222 of January 19, 1990 establishes rules to review Loan Portfolio
and Other Risk Assets of banks and other financial intermediaries.
It also establishes that "failure to account appropriately for losses
or make adequate provisions for estimated future losses may result in
misrepresentation of the bank's financial condition."   It further
requires that loans be classified into four categories as follows,
unclassified, and four sub-categories of classified loans, account
receivables,  and accrued  interest  receivables.    Details  on  the
classification and the respective provision to be made are given in
Annex 4.1.
(b)  Solvency Reguirement.  Eligible banks should comply with a minimum net
equity base of at least lOX of their risk assets. The net equity base
should be computed applying the criteria under CBP's Circulars 1222
and 1225, as of the time of accreditation.



- 31 -
(c)  Profitability Requirement.  Eligible banks should demonstrate their
profitability in real terms during the lifetime of the sub-loans. To
achieve this goal, operating costs (including depreciation), plus
provisions, less other non-financial income, plus an allowance to
cover equity erosion due to inflation, should be covered by the
maximum spread that can be reasonably charged by a PFI on its total
net outstanding portfolio.
(d)  Ownership and Management Quality Requirement.  Ownership and manage-
ment quality should be satisfactory to LBP. LBP will establish the
criteria and procedures to carry out its appraisal of ownership and
management.
(e) Banks Undergoing Financial Rehabilitation. Banks undergoing financial
-ehabilitation should not become eligible until actual rehabilitation
has taken place, permitting them to fully comply with the three main
criteria under (a), (b), and (c) above.
4.14      Sub-Rroject Review. In all cases, LBP would receive the sub-project
appraisal work carried out by the PFIs. It would review, on an ex ante basis,
the documentation of sub-projects above P20 million, or lOX of the PFI's net
equity, whichever is lower, and if appropriate it would authorize disbursements.
LBP uould grant up to 60 days to PFIs to submit required sub-loan documentation
and evidence of payments and procurement. LBP would reverse the sub-loans--and
charge a reversal fee--if PFIs have not submitted the required documentation
within sixty days after LBP disbursements to the PFIs. In the case of below-the-
free-limit (P20 million) sub-projects, LBP would review the appraisal work on an
ex post disbursement basis. Disbursements to PFIs would be made automatically,
although LBP would also require PFIs to submit all the required loan
documentation within the next 60 days. As in the case of above-the-free limit
sub-loans, reversals would be made and penalty fees imposed if PFIs fail to
satisfactorily submit required sub-loan documentation in the sixt- :':-y period
following LBP's disbursements. Bank prior approval would be required for all
sub-loans above US$1 million equivalent.
4.15      Sub-Loan Appraisal and Disbursements.  Sub-loan appraisal and approval
would be the responsibility of the participating banks, whose capability to
undertake these activities would be determined by LBP under the project's
qualifying criteria. Appraisal of medium- and long-term loans would be based on
the technical and financial characteristics of the sub-project. For each medium-
and long-term sub-loan, a participating bank would prepare a financial plan
including the sub-project's cash flow.  As calculation of financial rate of
return (FRR) for all sub-loans would be impractical, the PFIs would calculate an
FRR for all sub-loans of more than P5 million (about US$180,000).   For sub-
project to be accepted the FRR should be consistent with or higher than the
interest rate on the sub-loan. LBP would ensure that calculation of an economic
rate of return would be carried out for all sub-loans above P30 million. These
sub-projects should yield an economic rate of return of not less than 12X.



- 32 -
4.16      Sub-loan Maturities.  The repayment period for medium- and long-term
sub-loans would be based on the sub-project's cash flow and related to the sub-
borrower's overall repayment capacity.   Repayment of most sub-loans will be
within five to ten years but will not exceed 15 years, or the economic life of
the sub-project, whichever is lower. A grace period may be granted for repayment
of principal based on the sub-project's cash flow and the overall financial
status of the sub-borrower.
4.17      Environmental Protection.  LBP will specify that sub-borrowers for CLF
funded projects should comply with all laws and regulations of the Philippines
related to environmental protection.   LBP would be in charge of supervising
compliance. To reduce the risk that sub-project with undesirable environmental
impacts would be financed by CLF, the following measures would be taken: (a)
LBP, in collaboration with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources
(DENR), would work out adequate procedures and guidelines acceptable to the Bank
for environmental screening and monitoring, including if necessary, DEHR
technical assistance. The procedures and the guidelines should be as simple as
possible, avoiding any unnecessary impediment to CLF lending operations; and (b)
the training program for the project-related staff in LBP and the PFIs will
include courses on environmental issues to increase their capacity to review and
monitor environmental aspects of sub-projects. During negotiation, assurances
were obtained that the procedures and the guidelines as well as the respective
training program would be submitted for Bank review by October 31, 1991 (para.
6.1 (f) and (g)).
4.18      Supervision  of  CLF  Sub-Loans  would  be  the  responsibility  of
participating banks, which will designate specific officers for this purpose.
PFIs would requiire sub-borrowers to use project funds for approved purposes, and
they would achieve this through direct payments to suppliers of inputs and
materials, as practicable, and through qusrterly or semi-annual field visits to
sub-projects. Follow-up reports on each visit would comment on utilization of
project funds, compare actual and planned operations, review management and
financial problems of sub-projects,  compliance with enviro-mental laws and
regulations, and make recommendations. PFIs would also obtain periodic operating
and financial reports from sub-borrowers of medium- and long-term loans and would
undertake selective fiel; visits to problem projects for assessment of their
problems. LBP's CLF Uni would conduct selective end-use verification of sub-
projects f!nanced under .he project to ensure that the bank's supervision is
satisfactory. Overall, about 20X of the sub-projects financed by the project
would be visited by LBP staff, although the number would vary from bank to bank.
4.19      LBP supervision of PFIs would be a permanent effort.  An early warning
monitoring system would enable LBP to take corrective action as soon as possible.
LBP's supervision will focused on sub-loan promotion, appraisal, disbursements,
and recovery, as well as sub-project supervision by PFIs. The overall financial
condition of the PFIs would be assessed and findings and recommendation included
in comprehensive annual supervision reports prepared by LBP on each of the PFIs.
Also, LBP would prepare an annual report on the PFIs, summarizing their overall
condition and the main issues affecting the principal categories of PFIs (KBs,
TBs, and RBs). This annual report would also include technical assistance as



- 33 -
well as remedial action recommendations to enhance the financial, technical,
administrative and developmental condition of the PFIs.
4.20      Supervision of LBP's oRerations would be carried out through analysis
of its periodic reports to the Bank, concerning:   (a) CLF's sub-loan amounts
outstanding and their main features, including their recovery status; (b) sub--
loan requests pending LBP's appraisal results, approvals, disbursements, and
recoveries; (c) LBP's financial condition as reflected in its financial
statements, reviewed by independent external auditors satisfactory to the Bank;
(d) PFIs' financial condition as reflected by LBP's analysis of the quality of
the portfolio of the PFIs, their loan collection capabilities and their
compliance with CBP's regulations on portfolio classification and loan providing;
and (e) the Project's accounts, including audited Statement of Expenditures and
Special Account. Supervision missions, will complement the above Headquarters
analysis by the Bank to assess LBP's financial condition, operations and quality
of reporting requirements (Annex 3.5).
4.21      LBP  would  be  required  to  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the
Countryside Loan Fund (CLF), including resources under both the previous ALF and
CLF.  Financial requirements and conditions under CLF will be common for the
previous ALF operation. The separate CLF accounts would allow the assessment
of CLF's financial condition (profitability and liquidity), independently of
other LBP operations. Furthermore, LBP would prepare an annual report on the
CLF, including its own assessment of CLF's operations and financial condition,
plus its recommendations, if appropriate, on how to further enhance CLF's
efficiency and developmental role.
Other Project Components
4.22      Policy Related Studies.  The Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC)
would be responsible for carrying out the agreed studies. The studies' terms of
reference and the time frame for their implefiientations, to be prepared by ACPC,
would be submitted for Bank review by October 31, 1991. The studies would be
carried out either by ACPC's own staff or by consultants, or a combination of the
two.   During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the selection of
consultants, the terms of reference and the timetable for the studies would be
acceptable to the Bank and be submitted for Bank review by October 31, 1991
(para. 6.2 (c)).
4.23      Training.  The Land Bank of the Philippines (UBP) would be responsible
for the preparation and implementation of the project training program. The
preparation work would be completed and carried out along the lines stated in
Annexes 3.2 and 3.3 by October 1991. The program would be updated annually.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the training program would be
sent to the Bank for review by October 31, 1991, and thereafter the updated one
for each fiscal year by November 30 of each year (para. 6.1 (g)).

V. PROJECT IMPACT. BENEEITS AND RISKS
LBP
5.1       Impact and Benefits.  Under its present operating arrangements, LBP
has the staff, motivation and financial strength to absorb the proposed CLF
program, which would increase its total assets by about 12%. The absorption of
CLF, at the same time as the planned expansion of agrarian reform activities
would substantially change the financial picture of LBP. Detailed projections
of LBP's future balance sheets and profit and loss accounts are set out in Annex
5.1.  Two alternative projections were prepared for the pace of development of
new land reform and hence ARF funding requirements, one for new distribution of
land (1992-1997) at 20,000 hectares annually, and a second at 70,000 ha. In view
of the relatively slow past pace of land reform, and the huge financial resources
needed,  the first option is the more likely.   Projections embodying  .hat
assumption indicate that by 1996, when this loan would be fully disbursed, LBP's
total resources would have increased, in 1990 constant terms, by 56% from P21.3
billion (US$880 million) in 1990 to P33.2 billion (US$1.37 billion) in 1996.
About P2.4 billion, (20%) of this increase would be loans rediscounted under CLF,
and P4.7 billion, (40%) would be mortgages and loans for Agrarian Reform
operations. The remainder (P4.8 billion or 40%) would stem from expansion of
LBP's ongoing commercial operations. Subject to the considerations in para. 5.2
below, LBP is projected to remain financially sound over the period, with equity
increasing in real terms by an average of about 3.5% annually.  By 1996, the
capital as a share of risk assets is projected at a solid 35%, or over three
times  the minimum permitted  level.    The  direct  impact of CLF on LBP's
profitability, however, would be limited, probably of the order of P40 te P50
million (about US$1.5 million) annually, or about 4% of projected net profits.
5.2       The major potential issue facing LBP over the life of this project
would be the future pace of the Governmenit's Agrarian Reform efforts. As the
designated financial intermediary of the CARP, LBP finances land purchases under
the land reform program, and also gives seasonal loans to small farmers at
concessional rates through its network of field offices. The operating costs are
covered by ARF, as are the financial losses, potentially amounting to the
equivalent of about US$900 per hectare on land redistribution. Presently the net
flow of funds from CARP to LBP is about P1.5 billion (US$60 million) annually,
and thus would substantially increase if land reform were accelerated. Clearly,
in the event that ARF were to run short of funds, LBP would need to radically
adjust its pricing policy on loans to small farmers in order to cover its costs.
To cover the cost of the mismatch between interest paid on bonds of previous
landholuers, and income from land reform mortgagees (which is defined within the
land reform law, and so cannot be adjusted unilaterally by LUP), Government
funding from other sources would be needed. Although it is unlikely that, over
the five year project disbursement period, LBP's solvency would be threatened by
shortages of Government funds to which it is entitled, the following measures
would be taken to guard against possible long-term problems: (a) DOF and LBP



- 35 -
would arrange the issuance by the National Government of bonds with terms
identical to LBP bonds. This will be offered to landowners as an alternative
mode of compensation; and (b) during project implementation LBP would maintain
the f'ollowing: (i) Risk Assets to Net Equity ratio of not more than 7:1; (ii)
Liquid Assets to Short Term Depozit ratio of not less than 125%; (iii) ARF
arrears to LBP not to exceed 20% of LBP's equity or P1 billion, whichever is
lower. Assurances to these effects were obtained at negotiations, paras. 6.1 (h)
and 6.2 (d)).
5.3       UGFB.  Investments supported by QGFB would be mainly inventories of
grains and other crops.  Inventory finance is necessary to carry stocks from
harvest, which is seasonal, until they are consumed, on a year round basis. QGFB
makes inventory finance from the formal sector more readily available, at. lower
rates than traders and farmers would otherwise ob'.ain from the informal sector.
Bank interest rates for loans secured by warehouse receipts and guaranteed by
QGFB, including origination fees and guarantee fees are currently around 25-30X
p.a., about 2-2.5X per month.   Informal rates, on the other hand, are much
higher. For farmers, typically borrowing P5,000 - 10,000 ($180-360), rates are
8-10% per month and for merchants handling larger quantities they range from 5X
per month upwards, depending on collateral. At the micro level, the impact of
QGFB guarantees is to allou, individual traders to expand their businesses and
lower their unit operating costs.   Business expansion results from improved
access to capital; while lcwer unit costs result both from lower unit finance
charges and economies of scale.  In a competitive economy, reduced marketing
costs are reflected in improved farmgate prices. This in turn should lead to
greater farm level economic activity and more production. In parallel the level
of "rents" earned by money lenders would be reduced. This income redistribution
effect of the project is in line with Government poverty alleviation objectives.
5.4       Other QGFB project investments would include small farmer satellite
warehouses and a proposed grain trading center.  The pilot satellite warehouses
program would establish small warehouses in rural areas to act as bulking points
for farmers groups, providing them access to better drying facilities, improved
bargaining power (due to being able to sell truck load sized lots) and access to
storage finance through the QGFB program.   The development of farmer groups
would also open the way for production loans guaranteed by PCIC, thereby reducing
interest rates paid by farmers from 10X per month in the informal market to about
2 1/2X per month in the formal market. Calculations on the satellite warehouse
models show financial rates of return of about 2.X for the smaller model (50 tons
capacity) and 401 for the 125 ton capacity unit after taxes. Economic rates of
return are about 35% and 50%, respectively.
5.5       QGFB also plans to establish a grain trading center in  Manila,
initially to act as a terminal market for rice only. Grain would be auctioned
daily, typically in truck sized lots.  On-site facilities would be provided for
storing and financing rice which fails to sell in the auction on the day of
arrival. The grain trading center would increase competition in the Manila area,
facilitate the flow of rice from regional millers and allow them to liquify their
stocks, either through cash sales in the auction or warehouse receipt loans, as



- 36 -
soon as the product arrives. This would be a great improvement over the existing
practice whereby regional millers have to deal in the expensive informal credit
market if they are to receive funds straight away. It would also help to make
the rice market more transparent, with market information being readily available
from the center. Over the longer term, standardization of grades, a possible
spin off from this system, would also help to reduce transaction costs.
5.6       Other project benefits to the remainder of the rural financial sector
would stem from the following:
(a) Benefits from expanding the ALF/CLF, whicn is presently fully
committed would be realized through (a) increased short term
agricultural production, resulting from provision seasonal production
credit for agriculture and (b) long run output growth resulting from
increased medium- and long-term investment by small and medium sized
rural businesses.
(b) As a result of strengthening the rttral banking system, the number of
sound rural credit windows will be increased, thereby improving access
to formal credit and encouraging savings mobilization in the rural
areas. This program will also reduce the potential exposure of PDIC.
(c) The proposed strengthening of PCIC would both reduce that agency's
contribution to GOP's budgetary problems, and allow it to operate
independently of these same budgetary constraints.   It would also
allow LBP to expand its lending to small farmers without substantially
increasing its risk.
(d) Project support of QGFB would allow it to increase the volume of
Quedans guaranteed, and this would help increase liquidity and
competition among grain traders. The small farmers warehouse program
would allow QGFB to act as a catalyst in the provision of much needed
access to storage and credit for cooperatives and farmers groups.
5.7       Quantification of overall benefits to the economy is not feasible.
Specific investments made using CLF resources would be in a variety of
agricultural and agro-industrial sub-projects, as decided by individual
borrowers. On the basis of past experience, likely investments would include
aquaculture (shrimp, milkfish, etc.), livestock, mainly pigs, broilers and laying
hens, fruits processing of agricultural products and agricultural support
services e.g., transport. Banks submitting projects for rediscounting of over
P0.5 million are required to undertake financial analysis of them, and satisfy
themselves that the project is viable. On the basis of ALF results, more than
90% of funds would be lent for this size of project.
5.8       Given the generally minor distortion between financial and economic
prices in the Philippines, it is likely that estimated economic rates of return
from sub-projects would be slightly higher than financial ones. The existence
of a free market economy, coupled with substantially positive real interest rates



- 37 -
at the sub-borrower level suggests that entrepreneurs would normally only invest
in projects they expect to have high financial rates of return. This, together
with the reiative lack of distortion between financial and economic prices,
implies that average investments supported by CLF would show attractive economic
rates of return. The US$200 million investment would likely to generate about
US$40 million in rural value added, and create about 25,000 jobs.
Risks
5.9       The main risks associated with this type of program relate to possible
delays  and/or  inadequate  implementation.    The  principal  concern  is that
maintenance or implementation of agreed policy measures would be thwarted or
postponed by budgetary constraints or political considerations, which may become
increasingly important in the coming pre-electoral period. These risks would be
mitigated through a gradual implementation process to be agreed upon and
formalized through dated covenants to be included in the project's legal
documents. With respect to the credit component, demand will be subject to the
overall performance of the economy. The demand for CLF resources during the
project period is projected conservatively and is well within the historical
growth performance of ALF.
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
6.1       During negotiations agreement was reached with Government and LBP on
the following:
(a) LBP would exclude itself from retailing ALF/CLF funds (para.
3.3);
(b) CLF funds initially provided for short term credit would be
subsequently recycled to medium and long term sub-loans (para.
3.5);
(c) LBP would operate CLF on a commercial basis and the latter's net
profit would remain within CLF as LBP's investment (para. 3.7);
(d)  LBP would  submit  to  the  Bank:    (i)  semi-annual  progress
implementation report; (ii) audited accounts along with auditor
reports on LBP, CLF, the Special Account, and Statement of
Expenditures related to project activities within six months
after the end of LBP's fiscal year; and (iii) Part II of the
Project Completion Report within six months after the loan
closing date (para. 3.20);
(e) a revised Policy Manual would be issued and would incorporate
agreement with the Bank as noted below. Further changes in the



- 38 -
Policy Manual for project lending would not be made without the
Bank's prior concurrence (para. 4.4);
(i)     eligibility criteria for CLF loan,  including minimum
funding requirements and equity contribution of PFIs and
sub-borrowers respectively (paras. 4.5 and 4.6);
(ii)    interest rate structure (para. 4.7 to 4.12);
(iii)   PFIs accreditation criteria (para. 4.13 and Annex 4.1);
(iv)    sub-projects review and free limit (para. 4.14);
(v)     sub-loan appraisal and computation of FRR and ERR (para.
4.15);
(vi)    sub-loan maturities (para. 4.16);
(vii)   conformity with environmental laws (para. 4.17);
(viii)  CLF supervision (paras. 4.18 to 4.21);
(f)  LBP in collaboration with DENR will prepare guidelines and
procedures for environmental screening and monitoring and submit
it for Bank review by October 31, 1991 (para. 4.17);
(g)  the project training p-ogram for 1992 would be submitted by LBP
for Bank review by October 31, 1991 and thereafter the updated
program for each fiscal year by November 30 of each year (paras.
4.17 and 4.23); and
(h)  during project implementation LBP will maintain the financial
indicators detailed in para. 5.2 (b).
6.2       During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government and the
respective Government agencies on the following:
(a)  QGFB would implement its development program (para. 3.12 (c));
(b)  PCIC would carry out its development program (para. 3.12 (d));
(c)  selection of consultants to carry out the agreed studies, along
with their terms of reference and the respective time frame would
be acceptable to the Bank, and be submitted for Bank review by
October 31, 1991 (para. 4.22); and



- 39 -
(d) during project implementation the DOF will take the actions
necessary to ensure LBP's financial viability, as detailed in
para. 5.2 (a).
6.3       Condition of Loan Effectiveness would be:  (a) to further liberalize
banking policies, CBP has issued revised criteria and regulations acceptable to
the Bank, concerning the opening of new branches and the establishment of new
banks servicing the rural population, merging of banks, and the maximum
shareholding that a single investor can have in a rural bank (para. 3.12 (a));
(b) the RBs capitalization program has been approved by the Monetary Board and
its implementation has been started in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (para.
3.12 (b)); and (c) the approval and putting into effect of the revised Policy
Manual for the proposed project by CLF Policy Steering Committee and LBP'S Board
(para. 4.4).
6.4       Recommendation. With the above agreements and assurances, the proposed
project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$150 million equivalent to the Land Bank
of the Philippines with the guarantee of the Republic of the Philippines. The
loan would have a te .m of 20 years including five years of grace on repayment of
principal, and carry the Bank's standard variable interest rate.

PHILIPPINS
RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
Estimated Capital RequireMent for
Development of the Agricultural Sector
1.        An assessment of the capital needs  of the agricultural  sector
(including working capital, reinvestment and new investment) is set out in the
following tables. Table A estimates the seasonal and permanent working capital
necessary to sustain the 1989 level of production. Working capital needs by
product are computed on the basis of the estimated annual value of production.
About 50X of this is seasonal working capital and the remainder is permanent base
working capital, which would not be eligible for ALF/CLF financing.
2.        To support future growth, the incremental average value of production
above the 1989 level was estimated, based on DA plans, and the estimated
proportional working capital computed on a sub-sector by sub-sector basis (Table
B). All of this investment, over a five year period could be eligible for ALF
as permanent incremental working capital.
3.        The annual reinvestment needs of the sector are presented in Table C.
They are derived by estimating total fixed investment per sub-sector, divided by
the expected economic life of each unit of production.   This estimate is
inevitably very "broad brush" and can vary substantially from year to year,
depending on the investment climate. Total investment needs to support planned
future growth are estimated in Table D. For the sake of simplicity, lags between
investment and incremental output are ignored (implicitly, this assumes steady
state growth).
4.        The results of these estimates  indicate  that in the base case
situation, over a five-year period capital requirements eligible for ALF/CLF
rediscounting in 1990 peso terms would amount to about P206 billion, or US$7.4
billion. Under only a 1X growth scenario, the estimate would be P156 billion,
US$5.6 billion. Likely ALF/CLF resources correspond to between 2-3% of these
figures. Thus, even allowing for a high degree of inaccuracy in these estimates
(and/or a low portion of capital investment being funded by the formal banking
system), it is likely that there will be considerable potential demand for
ALF/CLF.

PHILIPPINES
RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
Land Bank of the Philippines OPeration ond Performance
Organization and Management
1.       The Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) was established in 1963, with its
primary role being to finance Agrarian Reform.   LBP was capitalized at P1.8
billion, which was fully subscribed by the government, and was granted authority
to issue bonds and receive savings and time deposits from both landholders and
the public, in areas where adequate savings and deposit facilities were not
provided by other institutions.  LBP is controlled by a Board of Directors,
comprising seven members: the Secretary of Finance (Cnairman), the President of
LBP (Vice-Chairman), the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Agrarian
Reform, and the Secretary of Labor, all of whom aret ex-officio members.   In
addition, there are two members appointed by the President of the Philippines to
represent the Agrarian Reform beneficiaries and landowners.
2.       Despite LBP's original mandate, until recently, its main activities were
largely outside the small farmer sector, because land reform moved relatively
slowly in the Philippines. Bonds issued to finance land purchase under Agrarian
Reform Programs have comprised only about 10-15X of LBP's total resources in
recent years, and until 1986 production loans to small farmers totalled less than
1% of its portfolio. Indeed, LBP operated as a rather conservative financial
institution with a substantial proportion of its total resources either invested
in government securities (about 30%) or else on deposit with other banks (151-
20%).  LBP also extends loans to the commercial sector, government corporate
units, and local government entities.
3.       Since the enactment of the latest Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law
(CARL) in 1987, LBP has readdressed itself to providing support to the agrarian
sector. Its present operations and staff are essentially divided into two broad
streams:   (a) Agrarian Sector staff who, through a growing number of field
offices, deal with small farmers, either directly or via cooperatives and rural
banks; and (b) Banking Sector staff, who deal with corporate clients through
LBP's branch network, or directly from Head Office. The volume of LBP production
loans to small farmers under its "Countryside Development Program" has increased
from P105 million in 1987 to P343 million in 1988, P1.1 billion in 1989 and P2.8
billion (US$115 million) in 1990.
4.       LBP's Head Office is in Manila, and it has 49 branches which deal with
commercial banking operations. Or the agrarian side, it has 12 regional offices
and 91 field offices. Present policy is to continue increasing the number of
field offices until there are more or less one per province, or about 110 in
total.



Annex 2,1
Page 2 of 22
- 46 -
The branches provide checking and normal commercial banking facilities to the
field offices (i.e., advances made by the field offices are paid through LBP
branches and collections of loans are paid into L'.P branches).
5.       At the end of 1989, LBP had a staff of about 3,200, of whom more than
2,500 have a Bachelors degree or higher qualifications. Of these, over 500 have
had some post-graduate training, and 67 have Masters degrees. By September 1990,
LBP staff had increased to 3,494. The majority of the staff build-up has been
in the agrarian sector, which has grown by 105% since December 1986, with the
highest increase being among field staff, whose numbers have more than doubled
over this period from 652 to 1,521.  Growth in staff numbers in the banking
sector has been relatively low, averaging 35% over the four years under review.
6.       Agrarian Sector.   In portfolio terms, LBP's largest Agrarian Sector
operation is the provision of Agrarian Mortgage Loan= to individual farmers who
have bought their land under the various land reform programs. Currently LBP has
outstanding Agrarian Reform mortgages of about P2 billion (US$70 million).
Official estimates were that between 1987 and 1997, P80 billion would be needed
for land acquisition and distribution.   Given the long maturity of these
mortgages, this would imply an expansion of such lending to well in excess of P70
billion by the end of 1997. At that time, less than P10 billion of the principal
lent for Agrarian Reform Mortgages would have been repaid to LBP, and Agrarian
Reform mortgage operations would dwa. f LBP's commercial operations, and could be
sustained only with continued strong support from Agrarian Refova Fund (ARF).
However, because Agrarian Reform itself has developed much more slowly than
originally envisaged, it is likely that LBP's exposure in this area will be far
below the official target figures.
7.       Since 1987, LBP has also been operating a Countryside Development
Program, for short-term production loans to farmers with under 5 hectares and
some -ice and corn farmers with under 7 hectares.   Although LBP initially
extended loans to individual farmers, it has been changing its strategy and
instead plans to channel credit to these borrowers on a wholesale basis through
two main channels--agricultural cooperatives a-ad Rural Banks (RBs).
8.       Loans to cooperatives using ARF funds include Agricultural Production
Loans, Commodity Loans, Operating Capital Loans, Agricultural Facility (fixed
asset) Loans, and Agro-Industrial Loans. They carry an interest rate of 12X per
annum and have maturity periods designed either to coincide with the crop cycle,
or in the case of fixed asset financing, to match a reasonable pay-back period
for the asset, e.g., 3-7 years.  In the case of crop loans, which account for
about 90% of all loans to cooperatives, LBP requires that the crops be insured
by the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC).
9.       LBP also operates a re-discounting program for RBs, mainly using P300
million of CALF resources made available for three years from the Department of
Agriculture to LBP at a fixed interest rate of 6%. This program is administered
by a special unit within LBP's Agrarian Sector, called the Rural Banking Group.
To participate in the program, RBs need to be accredited by LBP. Inter alia,
they must have capital of at least 10% of their risk assets, and a past due ratio
of not more than 50% (an easier requirement than that for Central Bank
rediscounting which requires a past due ratio of not more than 25%).



Maxne 2. 1
- 47 -                           Page 3 of 22
Under this program, in which about 280 rural banks now participate, LBP
establishes a line of credit with the Rural Bank, on the condition that it
relends the funds to small farmers or cooperatives who fulfil "agrarian
criteria". Lending to RBs has expanded rapidly, with disbursements increasing
from P59 million in 1988 to P295 million in 1989 and P625 million in 1990.
10.      Banking Sector.  LBP lends to the commercial sector on a range of terms
and conditions, normallv with a minimum spread of about 4% over its marginal cost
of money. In the last five years (:986-90) the banking sector has accounted for
about 75Z of LBP's assets, 55% of its outstanding loans, and 95% of income. It
has also contributed to cover the cost of the agrarian sector (82% in 1986, 65%
in 1987, 42X in 1988, 30% in 1989, and 22% in 1990). 1/ Within its Banking
Sector, LBP undertakes two main types of activity (a) normal commercial banking,
including commercial loans, foreign exchange dealing, etc.; and (b) investments
mainly in government instruments.   Overall, about 65% of its Banking Sector
profit comes from investments.
Loan Portfolio and ReDavment
11.      During 1988-89, LBP increased its non-interbank portfolio by 14% (see
Table A), roughly in line with inflation, while in 1990, partly as a result of
acquiring a regional savings bank, loan portfolio increased a further P2.4
billion (36%) 2/. Overall, agriculture (including loans for agricultural land
purchase, small farmer production loans and loans to agribusiness) is LBP's main
sector, with P3,455 million outstanding (59% of portfolio) in 1988 and P3,779
(56%) in 1989.  Total loans to agriculture grew at 9X between the two years,
which was less than the average of all loans. A spectacular 98% increase in
loans outstanding to small farmers was offset by a 15% decrease in the commercial
agriculture portfolio and virtually no growth in agrarian reform mortgages.
Lending to private non-agricultural businesses grew by only 2% and its relative
importance declined from 22% of LBP's portfolio in 1988, to 20% in 1989. Lending
to government entities grew by 36% overall, and with a total outstanding of P890,
absorbed 13% of total portfolio in 1989.   Finally, LBP acts as a Goverunment
distributing agent in financing livelihood projects. Its portfolio of such loans
grew by 47% between 1988-89 to 11% of LBP's portfolio.
]/ The reduction is due to the increasing ARF contribution to cover CARP
expenses.

12.      Analysis of LBP's balance sheet shows that, overall, its loan portfolio
including inter-bank loans has increased from P5.8 billion in December 1987 to
P7.5 billion in December 1989 and P9.7 billion in December 1990 (Tables 6, 7 and
8).  After provisioning for probable losses, which have increased from P327
million to P436 million and P613 million (5.62 to 5.82 and 6.3X) of gross loans;
net loans amounted to P5.5 billion in December 1987, P7.0 billion in December
1989 and P9.1 billion in December 1990. Increases in the volume of inter-bank
loans, bills purchased and agrarian sector loans have more than offset the
reduction in commercial loans. Of net loans, the proportion of either past due
or in litigation has been improving, from 13.52 in 1987 to 12.52 in 1988, to
10.62 in 1989 and 7.02 in 1990 (Table H). It should be noted however, that under
an agreement with CBP, LBP does not classify Agrarian Reform Mortgage Loans as
past due, although payments on over half of these are behind schedule. If these
mortgage loans are excluded fromt the calculation, (both from the numerator, and
the denominator), then net non-performing loans as percentages of net total loans
were 20.51 in 1987; 19.12 in 1988; 14.62 in 1989 and 8.82 in 1990.
13.      Agrarian Sector.  Agrarian Reform mortgages presently amounts to about
P2 billion. Historically, repayments on Agrarian Reform mortgages have been very
bad. With the reorganization of LBP's agrarian operations and the rescheduling

of its Agrarian Reform mortgages, .2/ there has been some improvement in
collections between 1986 and 1990.

14.      For all Agrarian Reform loans, past dues at the end of 1987 were 74X of
the gross outstanding loans of P286 million; for other agricultural credit loans,
past dues and sums in litigation were 56X of the P428 million gross loans
outstanding.  This unsatisfactory state of affairs results from LBP's previous
role as a conduit for Government programs. Most of the past dues prior to 1987
are old and are unlikely to be cleared up. However, under the new Countryside
Development Program initiated by LBP in 1987, the rate of loans repayment has
been much better. Current A/ collection rates are rIported in Table C:

]/ Agrarian Reform mortgages were all rescheduled in August 1987. Terms of
existing outstanding loans were extended by 20 additional years at 61 per
annum with fixed annual payments and interest overdue was set to be paid
off over 20 years in equal installments without compound.
./   The "Current Collection" percentage measures the amount falling due and
collected during a period divided by the amount falling due in the same
period. It does not therefore measure the effectiveness of collection of
past dues.

15.      Visits by the preappraisal mission to Field Offices, Cooperatives and
Rural Banks confirmed that collection rates on new loans have indeed improved.
and this in turn has improved the overall ratio of past dues ~/ to total loans.
For Agrarian Reform loans, the share has fallen from 74% in 1987 to 35% in 1989
and 19% in 1990, while for other agricultural loans the improvement has been from
56% to 11% (see Table H). However, with the rapid expansion in the number of
cooperatives becoming involved in this program (20 in 1987, 281 in 1988, 841 in
1989 and 2,893 in 1990), there is a danger that collection performance will
deteriorate.   LBP is sensitive to this, and is addressing the problem in
collaboration with the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) and training by
its own field staff.
16.      Overall, collection rates have been poor when LBP has simply been a
window for channelling Government funds. Writing off such debts is not generally
a charge to Land Bank's profit and loss account.
17.      Bank Sector.  The quantity and the quality of the Commercial Loans and
Discounts Portfolio deteriorated over the period 1987-89, but then improved
significantly in 1990 (see Tables G and H). Regular commercial loans (excluding
KKK "livelihood loans" handled by LBP on behalf of government) decreased from
P2.06 billion to P1.49 billion between December 1987 and December 1989 (a
reduction of over a quarter), but have since increased to P2.26 billion. -

18.      Between 1987-89, past due commercial loans and items in litigation
increased from P0.35 billion to P0.66 billion (an increase of 88%), but during
1990 have fallen by 18% to P0.55 billion.   The main reason for the initial
worsening was the increase in restructured loans from P2 million to P300 million.
Lending to other banks and for trade bills, etc., has increased substantially
over the period. Interbank Loans, all of which are performing, have increased
from P25 million in 1987 to P532 million in 1990, while net lending for Other
Bills, etc. has increased from P110 million to P720 million between 1987-90. The
percentage of the Other Bills portfolio which its past due has fallen from a
gross figure of 60.8% in 1987 to 9.6% in 1989 and 11% in 1990.
19.      The proportions of net non-performing loans §/ within the total
Commercial Loans and Discounts portfolio including KKK loans, for December 1987,
1988, 1989 and 1990 have been 14.5%, 18.2%, 23.8% and 16.41, respectively.
Overall, loan collection performance has been acceptable, and has recently been
improving. However, it has been poor in situations where Land Bank has been
acting as a distribution agent for government program funds (KKK Loans). On a
gross basis, the proportion of non-performing regular commercial loans within the
category 'Commercial Loans and Discounts" has been 14.3% in 1987, 13.0% in 1988,
16.8% in 1989 and 10.4% in 1990. While the gross non-performing percentages for
KKK loans, have increased from 35% in 1987 to 80% in 1990 (see Table 8).
20.      Collection performance from LBP's major commercial clients has been
good. Within Accounts Management Group I, which deals with the top 500 companies
in the Philippines, no bad debts have been incurred in the past three years, nor
have any accounts been handed over from the Regular Accounts Management Group to
the Remedial Section. Performance of smaller scale loans has been less good:
in September 1989, 33% of loans to agriculture made by Head Office were reported
as being past due. Provisioning for loan losses by LBP had been low until 1986,
but since then has been more than adequate (para. 30).
Profitability
21.      A summary of LBP's profit and loss account for the last six years is
shown as Table I. During 1986-90, LBP total gross income has .veraged about P1.3
billion (US$65 million) annually, which after expenses of about P0.9 billion
(US$45 million), yielded an average net profit of P0.4 billion (US$20 million).
Profits have increased substantially in nominal terms over the past three years,
although the apparent 63% increase between 1988-89 is somewhat misleading because
P197 million of the 1989 figure stemmed from a one off property sale.
Disregarding this, the improvement from 1988-89 would have been 13%, a figure
W_  Non-performing loans less provision for loan losses.

roughly in line with inflation, while for 1990 profits have continued to grow. 2/
LBP's profit in each of the years under review has been more than sufficient to
offset the effect of inflation on the real value of its equity. LBP's annual net
return on opening equity is estimated to have averaged 3% in real terms from
1986-90.
22.      Agrarian Sector.  There has been a marked change in the appearance of
LBP's profit and loss account in the past three years,  because  the CARP
legislation has removed lBP's agrarian activities away from this account.  LBP
is effectively a contractor for ARF which charges for its inputs on the basis of
cost, and this has changed the way in which its accounts have been presented
since to August 1987. On the income side, ARF has absorbed direct interest on
mortgage loans paid by Agrarian Reform beneficiaries, interest on loans to small
farmers and other aararian income for the same period. The impact of this in
1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990 was a decrease in LBP's gross income by P9 million,
P65.0 million, P105 million, P189 million, respectively. On the cost side, ARF
covers: (a) the bond interest payable on LBP Bonds issued to finance Agrarian
Reform land purchases (about P54. million in 1987,  P161 million in 1988 and
1989, and P202 million in 1990); and (b) the total operating cost associated with
LBP's agrarian activities, post-August 1987, which amounted to about P27 million
in 1987, P195 million in 1988, P344 million in 1989, and P525 million in 1990.
The net cost of LBP's agrarian operations which were paid for by ARF were P62
million (US$3 million) in 1987, P291 million (US$14 million) in 1988, P400
million (US$18 million) in 1989, and P538 million (US$22 million ) in 1990 (see
Table J).
23.      In addition, ARF has provided interest-free funds, for on-lending to
small farmers.   As at December 1990, the liability on LBP's balance sheet
(Table F) to the Agrarian Reform Fund, which largely represents this item, was
P1,919 million (US$69 million).  The overall cost of the agrarian operations
undertaken by LBP on behalf of ARF, after allowing for the financial opportunity
cost of interest free funds on-lent by LBP to farmer beneficiaries, was about P70
million in 1987, P330 million in 1988, P450 million in 1989, and P680 million in
1990. LBP makes some contribution to these costs through an allocation of its
own profits: in each of 1988, 1989 and 1990, LBP transferred P120 million of its
net income back to ARF.
24.      In 1990, LBP's regular commercial banking operations, which showed a net
profit of about P900 million (US$37 million) before tax, generated sufficient
profit in nominal terms to support the Agrarian Reform activities (costing P680
million) carried out by LBP on behalf of ARF. However, this was not the case in
real terms. Consequently, if LBP is to continue its agrarian ope-ations and to
remain profitable, it is vital that ARF remain financially capable of paying for
them (as it is legally obliged to do).
.7/ 1990 profits including a substantial property gain of P968 million
amounted to P1,757 million before tax, but after a contribution of P120
million to CARP. This was equivalent to 17% on opening equity (excluding
the property gain).



Mas 2. 1

25.      Both types of agrarian reform operations carried out by LBP for ARF
represent costs to the Government. Under the Agrarian Reform Law, land transfers
are financed mainly through bonds issued to landowners which yield market
interest and which are retired over 10 years, while loans to beneficiaries are
for 30 years with interest fixed at 61.  Hence, there is a substantial loss
incurred in land re-distribution. In present value terms (discounting at a real
rate of 10), this loss amounts to about P25,000 per new hectare distributed,
equivalent to about 60X of the value of the land. The implication of this is
that, the faster the rate of Agrarian Reform, the greater LBP's potential losses
if ARF is not in a position to meet its obligations.
26.      At present interest rates and spreads, the other agrarian activity
carried out by LBP on behalf of ARF --provision of production loans to farmers--
also incurs losses (Table K). The administrative costs of LBP's agrarian sector
activities have varied over the past four accounting periods from 2.2 to 3.5
times total income from the sector.  Total agrarian sector income, including
agrarian reform mortgages, has averaged only about 3X, largely a result of non-
payment by mortgagees. (Although mortgage loans which are behind schedule are
not treated as past dues, income from Land Reform mortgage loans is only taken
into the profit and loss account on a receipts basis (not on an accrual basis).
In 1989 and 1990, income from agrarian sector increased to 3.81 and 4.01,
respectively, mainly because of expanded business activity, better collection
from new agricultural production loans, and improvements in interest collection
on mortgages.   Nonetheless,  substantial change in pricing policy would be
required for agrarian lending to become profitable.
27.      Banking Sector.  The salient points on the profitability of the banking
sector are that (a) income as a percentage of total loan portfolio plus
investments is relatively modest, averaging about 141; (b) interest expense is
low (about 81 of loans made and only 41 of loans plus investments); and
(c) administration costs amount to 2-3X of loans plus investments. A/ The level
of proficability achieved, which compares favorably with that of other Philippine
banks, results partly from the fact that LBP has a substantial proportion of its
capital in the form of equity, and partly because average deposit interest paid
as a percentage of deposits is low (averaging about 6.51 over the past five
years). For example, on January 10, 1990, deposits with LBP, comprised: P1.1
billion (19X) non interest bearing current accoun- 3, P4.3 billion (731) savings
accounts, paying 51 interest and P0.5 billion (81) time deposits, yielding up to
141 interest. The weighted average cost of these Peso resources was about 4.81;
at the same time, Treasury Bills were yielding about 211.
LiagiditX
28.      LBP has consistently maintained a satisfactory liquidity position during
the past four years (1986-89). Liquid assets (cash, plus deposits with banks and
investment in short-term government securities) over this period have averaged
P6.4 billion (US$305 million) equivalent to 461 of LBP's average resources of
014.1 billion (US$670 million). This compares with an average for the top 30
Philippine Banks in 1987 of 371. As can be seen from Table E and F, LBP's liquid
assets deposits ratio over the four years averaged 1.2 (compared with 0.6 for the
I/ Net of provision and taxes, see Tables J and K.

top 30 banks in 1987). The liquidity ratios (liquid assets divided by short term
deposits) for 1989 and 1990 were much higher, 1.6 and 1.5, respectively.

_a  From LBP's annual reports.
29.      One reason for LBP's high liquidity is the large proportion of its total
deposits 90% stemming from governmental sources.   These carry with them the
requirement that at least 75% of the sum deposited should be placed in government
securities.
Solvency
30.      LBP has a strong balance sheet (Table F).  According to the World Bank
Financial Sector Study it was the number one bank in the Philippines on the basis
of capital in 1987. LBP's latest audited balance sheet (December 1989) shows
that it has a net worth (capital) of P4.6 billion out of total resources of P14.9
billion, i.e., equity represents some 31% of total resources, which is extremely
high for a commercial bank and indicates that Land Bank is highly solvent. The
comparator figure for the top 30 banks in the Philippines from 1984-87 was 10%-
12%. Although LBP carries a number of past due loans in its portfolio and also
Agrarian Reform loans which are not being collected as scheduled, most of these
are secured against real estate. In this regard, LBP's provisioning policy has
been conservative, and recent CBP inspection reports have indicated that LBP's
provision have exceeded the sums statutorily required; thus, LBP's commercial
loan assets probably exceed the figures shown in the balance sheet. In addition,
LBP has property assets estimated to be worth about P 1 billion more than their
book values.   Overall,  LBP's financial strength is such that its capital
substantially exceeds the total of all past due loans not provided for, plus the
total value of Agrarian Reform mortgage loans (which are omitted from the past
due classification).

Policy Issues
31.      Land Re-distribution Financing.  The current arrangements for buying
land under CARP are potentially prejudicial to LBP, because of the mismatch
between payments and receipts which, in present value terms (i.e., discounted at
10% real interest rate), amounts to about $1,000 per hectare. The requirement
that LBP pay landowners within 30 days (Act 6657 Chapter V Section 16(c)) is
being fulfilled partly in cash, and partly in LBP bonds which carry interest
aligned with 91-day treasury bills and mature annually at 10% per year. While
adequate funds should be available to cover the cash flow associated with new
land acquisition (about 30%), it is less clear that ARF funding will be
sufficient to cover the 10 years future liability associated with the remaining
70% of any land purchase. Should land acquisition proceed rapidly in the short/
medium-term and ARF fail to gather substantial new resources, 2/ LBP would be
left with substantial bonds to be serviced and retired but only limited income
from the corresponding mortgagees, resulting in a huge cash shortfall totally
beyond LBP's ability to cover.
32.      To safeguard against this possible eventuality, it would be desirable
for CARr's mortgage financing operations to be legally separated from the rest
of LBP.   Operationally, the remainder of LBP could act as collecting agent,
manager and bookkeeper for the program on a fee basis.  If this rearrangement
were perceived by landlords to reduce the value of the bonds they receive for
land transferred under CARP, they would have the legal alternative of selecting
other means of payment (government instruments, shares of government controlled
corpocations, tax credits).  LBP has recently initiated steps to bring about
legislation in this area.
33.      Small Farmer Lending andl SuRport from ARF. The contractual arrangements
with ARF on small farmer lending mean that since August 1987 LBP's financial
performance, as reflected by its P & L account, is virtually unaffected by its
performance with small farmer loans. With the exception of possible provisions
and write offs for IRF loans and, in future, PCA loans, LBP's agrarian business
is fully paid by ARF. Hence, no cost discipline is imposed by financial results.
Indeed, to maximize profits, the signals are that LBP should expand its agrarian
staff, regardless of effectiveness, thereby increasing the proportion of overhead
which can be passed on to ARF as a reimbursable cost. Fortunately, LBP is not
responding to these inappropriate signals; rather, there is every indication that
it is managing very effectively and trying to make the best use of ARF resources.
Nevertheless, in the interests of sustainability, and to encourage economic
pricing of rural credit and improve collections, in the long run LBP/ARF rural
credit arrangements should changed that LBP bears at least some of the risk and
the cost of its small farmer credit programs.
34.      As compensation to ARF for absorbing the whole of the net costs of its
agrarian sector operations, LBP makes a contribution from its own profits back
to ARF (Table I), as determined by its Board of Directors. In future, however,
it is recommended that the LBP:ARF agreement be renegotiated so that LBP has a
greater incentive to serve the agrarian sector efficiently. Specifically: (a)
ARF should reimburse LBP for only a proportion of its "agrarian costs";
(b) interest income from small farmer loans should belong to LBP (thereby
2/ As at October 16, 1989, ARF had received only P9 billion of the P50
billion scheduled for 1987-1992.

rewarding collection); and (c) a minimum of 15X, and probably more, of the small
farmer credit risk should be shouldered by LBP (thereby penalizing the making of
bad loans). Following a board resolution in May 1990, LBP is now putting the
recommendation concerning absolution of 15X of the credit risk into practice.
35.      Interet Rate Structure in the Agrarian Sector. LBP plans to phase out
direct lending to small farmers and to act exclusively as a wholesaler in the
agrarian sector. Its present interest rate on direct loans to small farmers is
182 (raised from 15X in 1990).  This is still low compared to its lending to
cooperatives or RB's (12X and 14Z), because the four to six percent differential
is substantially less than the cooperatives' or RBs' true intermediation costs.
LBP's rate structure should be such that farmer borrowers can access funds more
cheaply through cooperatives (or RB's) than directly.   Other major factors
determining the level of interest rates charged by LBP should be its projected
long r"n level of intermediation costs to the various types of borrower, the rate
of inflation and real market interest rates.

\1  Losses provided for by sector are assumed to be all against non current Loans.
\2  Gross figures tend to overstate the weakness of the portfolio as they Include In the numerator and

PHILIPPINES
RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
LBP Lending to Rural Cooperatives
1.          During the last four years, LBP has achieved some remarkable results
in serving the credit needs of small farmers in the Philippines (defined as
farmers who cultivate up to 5 ha of rice or 7 ha of corn). The number of small
farmers benefiting from credit increased from about 33,000 in 1988, to about
100,000 in 1989, and over 200,000 in 1990. The amount of credit released (for
the period January 1 - September 30 each year) increased from about P200 million
in 1988, to about P730 million in 1989, and about P1,800 million in 1990. The
actual amount of loans exceeded planned targets by about 20X in both 1989 and
1990.
2.          LBP delivers the credit to the small farmers using three channels
directly to individual farmers (retail), and via financial intermediaries
(wholesale), that is, cooperatives and RBs. LBP has been expanding the volume
of wholesale credit and stagnating retail credit, as shown in Table A.  The
volume of wholesale loans released in 1990 more than tripled compared with 1989
(P1,502 million vs. P427 million), increasing from 30X in 1988 to 83X of total
credit.
3.          Most farmers in the Philippines rely on informal credit arrangements
through landlords and traders, at extremely high interest rates, which bind them
to traditional marketing channels. The introduction of institutional credit at
reasonable interest rates is essential to promote the development of the agrarian
sector, ?,ut direct bank lending to individual farms is costly and ineffective.
Cooperatives have an advantage in serving as financial intermediaries because of
the closeness of their management to the farm community: cooperative managers
usually know farmers' needs, on the one hand, and repayment capability, on the
other hand. One of LBP's proclaimed policies is to revitalize the cooperative
movement to become a vehicle for accelerated delivery of credit to small farmers.
4.          The number of cooperatives furnished with credit by ULP in 1990
tripled over 1989 and the amount lent during this year quadrupled (Table B). The
number of cooperatives borrowing from LBP increased from 230 (with about 11,000
beneficiaries) in 1988 to 1,870 (with about 133,000 beneficiaries) in 1990.
Furthermore, the volume of loans released per cooperative in 1990 (January 1 to
September 30) was P578,000, compared to P227,000 in 1988. For 1991, LBP plans
to extend P5,000 million to small farmers, which is approximately twice the 1990
figure (Table C), with the main growth again being in lending to cooperatives.
In 1990, the amount of loans per cooperative member increased by 1.25 over 1989,
that is, from P5,633 to P7,038 released in 9 months, compared to a negligible
increase for the other beneficiaries (Table D).  This is partly due to the
increase in the level of insurance per hectare provided by PCIC, which determines



- 68 -
Annex 2.2
Page 2 of 10
the per hectart ceiling for (.top loans.   LBP's lending to cooperatives is
financed by the Agrarian Reform Funds (ARF). The loans carry a low interest rate
(12% p.a.) compared to the rate of inflation: 1988 - 9.7%, 1989 - 12.1X, 1990 -
13.1% (November 1989 to November 1990). The program provides mainly short-term
production loans (about 97X of the total volume in 1989), which are released in
a staggered way according to the specific crop's requirements, and repaid at
harvest.
5.          To reduce the risk of lending to a large number of small farmers and
for newly established cooperatives, LBP has taken several measures during the
last three years. LBP decentralized organizational system functions as a kind
of "financial extension service" that provides both credit and financial advice
to cooperatives and farmers.  This has been facilitated by the establishment
through September 1990 of 84 field offices, organized under 12 regional offices.
LBP also conducts an extensive training program for the field office personnel,
and has developing comprehensive operational procedures covering many subjects
such as the checking of creditworthiness, loan application and appraisal,
monitoring both the usage and the repayment of the loans, and requiring the use
of a standard bookkeeping scheme.
6.          LBP's field operations group is a sub-unit of its agrarian sector.
The number of field offices (FOs) increased from 40 (with 590 employees) in 1988
to 84 FOs (with 1,203 employees) in 1990, or a growth of more than 15 times
(Table E). The field operations group provides assistance to cooperatives, pre-
cooperatives and farm associations in the following areas:  organization and
registration, training, technical support, credit, marketing, and incentives for
high performance. In order to fulfill these tasks, LBP undertook a comprehensive
training program for the field operations personnel, as shown in the bottom of
Table E. The training budget increased from P1.4 million in 1988 to P4.5 million
in 1990. This growth exceeds that of the number of employees; thus there was a
deepening in the training program - the training expenses per employee increased
from P2,400 in 1988 to P3,700 in 1990.
7.          Table F shows that the growth in the "output" per employee, measured
by the number of financial beneficiaries and volume of loans extended, between
1988 and 1990, was remarkable - from 56 financial beneficiaries and P350 million
per employee in 1988 to 172 and P1,501 million, respectively, in 1990.  Only
"lending  output"  is  measured  above.    Other  aspects  of  efficiency  and
effectiveness of FO employees such as the level of service rendered to the
farmers are not examined because of lack of data. Analysis of the September 1990
data pertaining to the individual FOs indicates that there are signs of returns
to scale, measured by the number of employees in a FO. In other words, the FOs
with a larger number of employees show a higher level of both financial
beneficiaries and volume of loans per employee, compared to the offices with
fewer employees (see Appendix A). One possible explanation is that the larger
FOs are the more experienced veterans.

8.          The collection rates by type of LBP borrower for the years 1987-89,
as presented in Table G, are relatively high: for the individual borrowers 89-
90X, for the cooperatives 93-1OOZ, and for RB's 98-100. A similar situation
holds  for  1990  (Table  H).    The  (weighted  average)  collection  rate  for
cooperatives is relatively high, but is not high enough to secure the full
repayment of all the loans, especially in Regions I and VIII, which represent 10l
of the borrowing farmers. It should be noted that the high collection rates are
partially due to the PCIC insurance plan. The relatively high collection rates
of cooperatives, compared to individual borrowers, are due to the advantages
enjoyed by cooperatives as financial intermediaries (para. 3) and the
effectiveness of LBP's field operations. However, it is likely that, as new
cooperatives come on stream and the level of borrowers' experience is reduced,
the repayment performance will deteriorate. Approximately one quarter of LBP's
borrower cooperatives were registered before 1988, that is, at least 3 years old
in 1990. It is reasonable to assume that the age of the cooperative affects both
the level of accumulated equity and the level of management.
9.          The figures in Table I show that the level of equity of LBP's
borrowing cooperatives is very low and that most of the cooperatives are at an
early stage of economic activity. The weighted average of equity per cooperative
member for 324 cooperatives is P642 (about US$23), ranging approximately between
P300 and P1000 per member for various regions. The average equity compared to
the average volume of loans released during January 1 - September 30, 1989, was
as follows.
-PesAos
Loans released per cooperative (609 cooperatives)         406,400
Loans released per financial beneficiary                    5,689
Equity per cooperative (324 cooperatives)                  52,800
Equity per member                                             642
Overall, the amount of loans released to cooperatives is about eight times higher
than the cooperatives' level of equity. The low level of equity may be explained
by the age of the cooperatives and presumably by the corruptive use of theLr
equity funds in the past, which makes farmers reluctant to pay out equity
capital.
10.         To minimize the risks of the tremendous expansion of loans to
cooperatives by LBP, the following measures would be desirable:
(a)   Presently there are several issues of FO manuals and guidelines for
lending to cooperatives which were prepared in recent years.    A
comprehensive revised version of such a manual should be issued to
the FOs, similar to those available for other units of LBP.
Guidelines for quick monitoring are also needed.

Annex 2.2
Page 4 of 10
(b)   The cooperatives should be required to keep separate accounts for
the income and expenses related to facilities financed by medium-
term loans from LBP.
(c)   The reporting procedure from the FOs to the region, and from the
region to the headquarters, provides mainly consolidated figures.
There is an advantage of having at hand, at the higher levels of LBP
management, also the detailed figures for both monitoring and
analysis purposes. Given that the FOs are, or will be in the near
future, equipped with personal computers, an inexpensive system of
transferring data by sending diskettes from the FOs to both the
region and the headquarters should be developed.
(d)   LBP developed a procedure for evaluating the highest performing
cooperatives   to  provide   the  yearly   "outstanding   farmers
cooperatives". It is advisable to widen the scope of evaluation by
building an index of performance of every cooperative relative to
both the average performance and to its own past performance, both
for purposes of comparative monitoring and as a motivational tool.
(e)   The FOs need to mal.e a more active effort to improve bookkeeping by
the cooperatives, particularly the newly established ones.   A
possible solution would be for the FO to hire a qualified bookkeeper
to handle the books of infant cooperatives and their apprentices.
The expenses should be covered by the direct beneficiaries.

Appendix A
Estimation of Returns to Scale
1.        The efficiency of the field offices is measured by the ratio of
"lending output" per employee.   The returns to scale for the group of field
offices is measured by
Weighted average ratio
R    -   - - - - - - - - - - -
Simple average ratio
Where     o    Weighted average ratio is calculated by relating total Olending
output" to total employees (total for all field offices); and
o    Simple average ratio is the average over the individual field
offices' ratios.
R is larger than unity in the case that the efficiency of the larger field
offices is higher than the efficiency of the smaller field offices, where the
size is measured by the denominator of the ratio; that is, the number of
employees. The opposite holds when R is smaller than one.
2.        The following simplified example illustrates the meaning of R:
Field Office:                         A          B       Total
"Lending output" - loans extended          1000      5000      6000

R is larger than unity, indicating that the efficiency of the larger field office
(B) Is higher than that of the smaller field office (A).

Nature of Sub-loans SuRRorted under ALF, 1985-89
Evolution of ALF Lendin8
1.   By December 31, 1989, 2013 sub-loans had been supported under ALF.  The
total loan amount was P5,338 million, or about US$250 million at the weighted
average exchange rate for the period of US$1 - P21.  Table A summarizes the
development of the program over the period.   It is clear that over time new
onlending rates declined, volumes reinvested increased, and the proportion of
funds going to larger unit loans, to larger borrowers and to working capital also
increased.

2.    Distribution of New and Expansion Sub-projects.   The available data
indicate that banks preferred to finance established projects with proven records
of profitability. Of the total sub-loans, 951 were for the exparasion of existing
projects. The remainder went to finance scart up projects, mostly for prawn and
poultry meat production. Prawn projects were primarily intended for the export
market; poultry projects tended to be contract growing arrangements with large
poultry integrators and an assured market for the produce.

3.    Size of Sub-Borrowers.  A large proportion (56X) of ALF financing went to
small- to medium-sized projects with assets that totalled less than P 5.0 million
before financing. This group accounted for 922 of the total number of projects
financed.

4.    Sub-sector Distribution of Sub-loans.  ALF loans were extended to a broad
spectrum of agricultural investments (Table D): agro-processing and post-harvest
facilities constituted the largest share (32X) of total ALF availments by amount;
seasonal crop production represented 24X, of which 23.5X was for rehabilitation
of the sugar industry mainly in the provinces of Negros Occidental and Negros
Oriental in the Visayas; fisheries development, particularly prawn production fer
export, 15X. Only an insignificant amount went to farm mechanization.

5.    Sub-loans Distribution by Purpose.  With regard to the purposes for which
the ALF loans were utilized, 40£ went to working capital, 31Z to seasonal
production credit, and 292 to a combination of working cRpital and acquisition
of fixed assets.

6.    Sub-loan Size.   The average loan size under the ALF program increased
progressively from P1.080 million in 1985 to P3.063 million in 1989, or an
overall average of P2.058 million. The rural banks had the smallest average loan
size at P0.114 million and the commercial banks, the largest at P3.605 million
per borrower.

7.    Institutional  Participation.    As  of  December  1989,  89  financial
Institutions were accredited for ALF funding as follows:   commercial and
government banks 22, thrift banks 20, rural banks 46, and one non-bank.   Among
the participating financial institutions, the commercial banks had the highest
availment at 72X, followed by the thrift banks at 25X. The remaining balance of
3X was shared among the rural banks, non-bank institution, and the specialized
government banks.

8.    Regional Distribution of Sub-2rojects.  The share of the regions outside
the National Capital Region was 72Z of total ALF loans by amount and 97S by
number. Region III (Central Luzon) led all others with disbursements of 321 of
total ALF releases. Region IV (Southern Tagalog) and Region XI (Western Visayas)
came next with the availments amounting to 191 and 201, respectively. Region
VIII (Eastern Visayas), a depressed area, received very minimal assistance
because the financial institutions were reluctant to invest in that area.
9.    Loan Maturities. The repayment period of short-term sub-loans was normally
set at 12 months, except for sugar and banana production, which were granted a
six-month roll-over, for a total of 18 months. Medium- and long-term loans had
maturity periods up to 15 years, including a grace period of not more than 7
years. The overall avera&e maturity of ALF loans was 2.65 years. Rural banks
and some thrift banks tended to make use of the maximum terms allowable for the
different sub-projects. The commercial banks were more conservative in extending
longer term credits.
10.   Imnact on Sub-Borrowers.   CBP tried to evaluate the impact of ALF by
reviewing 84 specific sub-borrowers, which accounted for about 5 of the sample
beneficiaries.   The main difficulty of the review was that, sinee all sub-
projects examined were expansions of existing businesses, it was difficult to
dlsaggregate between performance of the core businesses and the incremental
business supported by the loans. Overall, the sample indicated that P122 million
sub-loans support.w total investments of P209 million and created a total of 732
incremental jobs, with an average investment per job of P286,000 (US$8,000). As
a rough guide to sub-project profitability, tle returns from the projects which
had been going for at least two years were as follows:

12.   This analysis, coupled with field visits by a Bank mission, supports the
conclusion that typical ALF investments have been moderately, but not
spectacularly, profitable. A review of detailed models prepared by LBP, and also
by UP Los Banos for GFSME. together with on site discussions with entrepreneurs,
suggests that projected financial rates of return at constant prices for well-run
operations funded under ALF would typically be in the following ranges:
Pigs                                        15 - 25X
Poultry                                     20 - 302
Prawn Culture                               20 - 502
Plantation Crops, e.g. Blk. Pepper          20 - 50X
Agri. Industry (Rice milling)               20 - 50X
The wide range of expected results is attributable to a variety of factors,
including whether the investment is new or a strategic expansion; relative access
to inputs and local labor costr; and access to markets and transport facilities.

RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
ALF/CLF Cash Flow Proiections
1.    ALF/CLF projections are detailed in Table A, with supporting schedules
on subloan repayments in Table B. The basic assumptions on the five-year draw
down of the World 3ank loan, subloan composition and inflation rates are given
in the first section of Table A.   Other sources of ALF/CLF funds flowing into
LBP for relending under the ALF/CLF program are: (a) the ALF funds passed over
by CBP or collected from CBP sub-borrowers; (b) future repayments of CLF sub-
loans to LBP from PFIs and (c) LBP's retained net profit from ALF/CLF
operations. Outflows from the LBP-controlled ALF/CLF comprise: (a) capital
repayments to CBP of ALF funds; (b) capital repayments of the CLF loan; and
(c) new subloans made (interest received from subloans is assumed to be equal
to interest payable plus operating costs and so is netted out of the cash
flow).
2.    The flow of funds in Table A is from the standpoint of LBP.  Inflows
from CBP are on the basis of the amortisation schedule already submitted to
LBP, while the draw down of CLF assumes US$40 million in 1981/82, US$30
million in the three subsequent years, and US$20 million in the final year of
the project disbursement period. Repayments of LBP sub-loans by PFIs are
based on the amortization schedules shown in Table B. These assume
accelerated disbursement in the first year (with 70% of the funds being loaned
for short term operations), but that in future about 301 of funds are lent of
a seasonal basis, 20X for two years, 401 for an average of five years, and 10X
for an awyerage of seven years. The estimated LBP net profit contribution is
based on the assumption that LBP makes a net profit of 21 per annum on the
cash balance of the ALF/CLF resources, but that on the loaned amounts it
breaks even with interest receivable equalling interest payable plus costs
(including gross receipts tax). On this basis, total inflows would be about
01.8 billion in the first year of the project, increasing to P2.8 billion by
project years four and five. Capital repayments of funds received by LBP from
CBP and representing ALF resources would increase from about P80 million in
1991/92 to P200 million by 1997/98. Assiming that LBP's policy is to retain
about 151 of the ALF/CLF resources as cash, the funds available for new
subloans would increase from about P1.5 billion in 1991/92 to P2.4 billion in
1994/95 and 1995/96. Further financing of CLE' is not shown in these Tables.



- 84 -
Annex 3.1
Page 2 of 5
3.    The third section of the Table A shows the year end position of ALF/CLF
resources. It includes the cash balance built up and held within LBP and the
outstanding balance of subloans made by LBP. These are financed by the ALF-1
loan from the Central Bank to LBP, the CLF loan from the World Bank to LBP and
the LBP equity share of the ALF/CLF built up from operating the fund. In
addition, there is a declining portfolio of old CBP loans which were made
under the ALF and which continue to be administered by LBP. In current terms,
the total portfolio of ALF/CLF loans is estimated to grow from P2.3 billion in
June 1991 to P5.7 billion in June 1996 (from P2.2 billion to P3.2 billion in
constant 1990 currency values). Over the period 1991/92 to 1995/96, an
average of about P 1.5 billion in new loans would be made annually.
4.    Table C shows the "without project" situation, that is the flow of funds
without any ALF/CLF. From this it can be seen that ALF lending would fall
from the estimated 1990/91 level of about P700 million to an average of about
P0.4 billion per year in constant 1990 terms for the period 1991/92 to
1995/96. Over the five-year period (1991/92 - 1995/96), lending with the
project would be approximately P1.1 billion per year higher in constant ternus
than without the project.

RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
Eligibility Criteria For Cooperatives Under CLF
1.        The following eligibility criteria would be used to select viable and
well-managed cooperatives to participate in the project pilot plan. Since the
criteria should be stated in a quantitative manner, a discretionary floor has
been set for several of them, but the floor figures can be adapted to specific
situations.
(a)  Viability of the Cooperativet:
(i)       Economic activity of at least four years;
(ii)      Stable Membership of at least 50 farmers;
(iii)     Board members attended at least three training courses;
and all members attended at least two training courses.
(b)  Accounting and BookkeeRing:
(M)       Audited financial statements (balance sheet and income
statement) for at least three years;
(ii)      Quarterly financial statements prepared during the last
year;
(iii)     Updated accounting records (e.g., current transaction
recorded not later than a month delay; quarterly
statements prepared not later than a quarter delay).
(c)  Financial AsRects:
(i)       A minimum amount of retained earnings;
(ii)      The co-op should have a financial/credit officer;
(iii)     Timely  repayment  of  at  least  three  consecutive
production loans, or two consecutive years of a
facility loan; and
(lv)      Ongoing ties with marketing outlets for marketing the
member's produce.
2.        Since not all the criteria and the floor figures can be applied
conclusively, cooperatives demonstrating a hlgh level of performance in the
following crltical criteria will be allowed to participate: (a) training (para.
1 (a), (iv) and (v); (b) updated bookkeeping records (para. 1 (b), (iii)); and
(c) timely repayment of loans and marketing arrangements (para. 1 (c), (iii) and
(iv)).

RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
Project Training PrograM
1.        Two main training programs would be carried out by LBP under the
project as follows: (a) for ALF/CLF related staff in LBP and the PFIs; and (b)
for cooperative staff and management.
Training of ALF/CLF Staff
2.        LBP would review the broad range of tasks to be performed under the
project by its ALF/CLF Unit and PFI's staff at different levels; the skills
already available within the institutions; and the skill gaps to be addressed by
the training program. The findings of this review would be used to design the
course modules, identify the clientele to be trained, and determine the frequency
of the courses. Based on a preliminary assesrment, the following represents a
broad outline of the program.
3.        Training Objectives would be to remedy the skill gaps of officers and
staff (senior, middle and operating) associated with ALF/CLF lending in LBP and
participating Banks.
(a) Potential trainers would be pooled and trained to assume the lead
role in teachers' training.   For this priority activity, LBP
would draw on the combined resources of its staff, Central Bank
Institute (CBI) faculty and the faculties of other agencies with
training capabilities.
(b) Senior level officials in ALF/CLF would be oriented on policy and
decision-making requirements of ALF/CLF lending.
(c) Skills of ALF/CLF staff would be upgraded in procedures for sub-
project processing, accounting, monitoring and reporting of
ALF/CLF transactions.
(d) All levels of participating bank staff would be trained under the
same program as ALF/CLF staff, with emphasis on medium- and long-
term project appraisal, environmental matters, and inflation
implications on sub-borrower cash-flow and sub-loan repayment.
(e) The skills of staff in LBP's ALF/CLF Unit in charge of PFIs
accredit&tion analysis would be upgraded in institutional
appraisal, with special emphasis on rural banks.

4.        Selection of Participants of ALF/CLF Training.  A standard requirement
would be that Course Participants would be those staff who most need the skills,
by virtue of being involved in ALF/CLF lending. Participants in the teachers
training course would be in a position to continue with the program until staff
requirements are met.
5.        Skills and Training Needed.   Courses would be designed following
completion of the review process, but are generally expected to be as follows:
(a) Senior level officers would be given a familiarization briefing
on the decision-making and policy formulation requirements of
ALF/CLF.
(b)  Middle-level office:s would receive additional training in loan
appraisal, environomental matters, monitoring, accounting, and
loan documentation for short-term, and medium- and long-term
credit.
(c) Operations staff would be trained in loan processing, collateral
valuation and custody, record keeping, bookkeeping and reporting;
(d) Loan team members would receive additional training in loan and
project appraisal and supervision with special attention to
inflation implications concerning sub-borrower's cash-flow, value
of collaterals, profit and loss accounts, sub-loan repayment,
environmental implications.
(e) LBP staff responsible for PFIs accreditation would be trained in
conducting institutional appraisals.
6.        Senior officers of ALF/CLF units and the participating banks would be
provided with information mainly through lecture-discussions and open forums.
For middle-level officers, training would emphasize case studies and situations,
loan appraisal, lending decisions, portfolio management and control reports. For
operating staff, training would consist of lectures and simulation of loan
application processing and collateral evaluation.  For loan team members and
credit supervisors, a combination of lecture, discussion, and case studies would
be undertaken.
7.        Evaluation of Training Activities.   The training program would be
evaluated at two different stages. The first stage would involve an assessment
of knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired from the training. The second stage
would consider the impact of training of job behavior and institutional
functioning. The latter would be spread over a longer period than for the first
stage, since the former is immediately observable while the latter would require
a longer term.

8.        Training Costs.   LBP would fund costs of the training faculty,
materials and facilities, while the boarding tnd lodging costs of participants
would be proportionately borne by the concerned participating banks.
Cooperative Training
9.        Training Objectives. The main objective of this training program would
be to upgrade the capability of participating cooperatives to perform a financial
intermediary functions in providing credit to members and mobilizing savings.
More specifically, the program would deepen members' knowledge and understanding
of the cooperative as an economic enterprise dealing with marketing, processing,
inputs supply, credit provision and/or resource mobilization.
10.       Training would be directed at members and management.
(a)  Potential trainers would be pooled and trained.  LBP would draw
on various resources such as universities and other government
agencies with training capabilities.
(b)  Farmers  would  be  oriented  in  the  value  and  advantage  of
collective actions to solve common technical issues, basic co-
operative structure and members' responsibilities.
(c)  On-the-job  training and practice would be offered in basic
business activities, mainly bookkeeping, accounting, marketing,
and management.
(d)  Loans administration procedures would be introduced, such as loan
appraisal and processing, credit risk evaluation, credit
worthiness analysis (links between production credit and co-
operative marketing and between credit and member savings),
interest calculation, collection procedures, supervision, past
due loans and remedy procedures, legal aspects and forms, and
internal control system.
11.       Selection of Participants.   This training program would be offered to
those cooperatives which are participating or are candidates to participate in
the ALF/CLF Cooperatives'  Experimental Pilot Plan (Annex 3.2).   This is a
selected group of viable and well managed co-ops that cAn be upgraded, through
adequate training and institutional building measures, to perform financial
intermediary functions in providing credit to their members and mobilizing
savings.
12.       Categories and Kind of Training to be Offered.  Courses would be design
to respond to identified skill needs and are generally expected to be as follows:

CBP's Loan Classification System
1.          Central Bank Requirements.  CBP has issued detailed regulations to
determine adequate provisions to cover probable losses and, thus, to determine
the net equity level of banks. CBP's Circular 1224 of January 20, 1990 defines
"past due loans accounts". !/ CBP's Circular 1222 of January 19, 1990
establishes rules to review Loan portfolio and other risk assets of banks and
other financial  intermediaries.    It establishes  that "failure  to account
appropriately for losses or make adequate provisions for estimated future losses
may result in misrepresentation of the bank's financial condition". It requires
that loans be classified into the following categories:
(a)   Unclassified loans, those that do not have greater-than-normal risk;
(b)   Classified loans:
Mi)    Loans Especially Mentioned,  superior in quality to substandard
loans but are potentially weak (e.g., deteriorating economic or
marketing conditions that may affect the quality of the loan, lack
of collateral, credit information and/or adequate financial
statements or documentation, and thus require closer management
supervision) --Minimum Required Provision 0%;
1/    The Circular defines that a bank should consider an account past due,
when: (a) loans payable on demand are not paid on the date indicated in
the demand letter or if not paid within six months after the date of
grant; (b) bills discounted or time loans if not paid on maturity dates;
(c) letters of credit if dishonored upon presentation or not paid within
thirty days from original entry, whichever comes earlier; (d) total
outstanding balance of loans where installment of arrears have reached
minimum arrears in accordance with the following schedule: (i) monthly
installments, 6 payments; (ii) quarterly, 2 payments; (iii)
semiannually, 1 payment; and (iv) annually, 1 payment. Notwithstanding
the above, when total arrears reach or exceed 201 of the total
outgtanding loan, the entire loan shall be considered as Rast due. For
other modes of installment, the same applies when arrears reach ten
percent of the total outstanding amount. All items in litigation shall
also be considered past dues.

(ii)   Substandard Loans, loans or portions thereof that appear to involve
a  substantial  and  unreasonable  degree  of  risk  because  of
unfavorable record or unsatisfactory characteristics. Such loans
that imply the possibility of future los-es to the bank should be
classified as substandard, unless repayment seems reasonably
assured.    Typical  substandard  loans  are:    (1)  loans  under
litigation, (2) past due loans for more than six months without
reduction in principal, (3) loans to borrowers with inadequate
equity, poor earnings, or whose properties securities securing the
loan have declined in value, (4) unsecured loans past due for more
than 90 days; (5) unsecured renewed/extended loans without at least
20% repayment of principal before renewal or extension, (6)
unsecured unmatured loans which have become unsound due to
unfavorable results of operations of the borrower, (7) unsecured
loans to distressed industries or when repayments of which are
imperiled -- Minimum Required Provision: 25%;
(iii)  Doubtful loans, loans or portions thereof with the characteristics
of substandard loans, when in addition: (1) without at least 20X
of repayment of principal in 12 months or without unfavorable
credit information; (2) no additional collateral has been added in
cases when collateral have declined in value, (3) there is high
probability of loss but to enhance collection such classification
has been deferred -- Minimum Required Provision: 50%; and
(iv)   Loss, loans or portions thereof which are considered uncollectible,
including: (1) when the interest is unpaid for six months or more;
(2) installment loans with interest past due for six months, unless
it is well secured and in process of collection; (3) when the
whereabouts of the borrower are unknown, or he is insolvent or
permanently impaired; (4) when collateral are considered worthless
and guarantors are insolvent; and (5) when doubtful loans without
any payment in 12 months or with information that renders
collection highly improbable -- Minimum Required Provision: 100%.
(c) Accounts Receivable:
(i)    Arising  from  Loans,  should  be  classified  similar  to  their
respective loan and investment documents; and
(ii)   Other Receivables of more than:  (1) 60 days as Substandard, (2)
180 days as Doubtful, and (3) more than 360 days as Loss.
(d) Accrued Interest Receivable on loans still uncollected for 6 months should
be provisioned with a 10OZ allowance.

RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
LBP's Financial Projection
1.        Tables A-E project future financial results for LBP.  The key Agrarian
Reform assumption is that during 1991, the backlog of old applications is cleared
up, and in 1992 and after, land reform financed by LBP continues at 20,000 ha.
annually. Alternative projections with higher rates of Agrarian Reform activity
(70,000 ha/year) are given in Tables D and E.
2.        LBP's balance sheet is projected in current terms over time as Table
B, and in constant termsl in Table E. These show total assets growing from P23
billion in 1990 to P63 billion in 1996 in current terms, and from P21 to P33
billion in constant terms. As a result of continued profitable operation, equity
would also grow from P6 billion to P14 billion (from P5.9 to P7.3 billion in
constant terms) over the same period.  Other major sources of funds include
deposits, which are projected to grow from P8 billion to P16 billion (from P7.7
to P8.3 billion in constant terms); ALF/CLF which would grow from P0.6 billion
to P6 billion (from P0.5 to P3.3 billion in constant terms); and ARF which would
increase from P1.9 billion to P11.4 billion in current terms) (from P1.d to P6.8
billion in constant terms). Land Reform Bonds would increase from P1.4 billion
to P3.7 billion (from P1.3 to P2.0 billion in constant terms), while other
sources of financing would increase from P4.3 to P11.8 billion in current terms
or from P4.0 to P6.2 billion in constant terms.
3.        Overall, as a result of ALF/CLF and increased small farmer lending, the
proportion of loans to total assets would increase from 47X in 1989 and 40X in
1990, to 59X by 1996.
4.        Profit and loss account projections (Table C) are for LBP to remain
profitable, and for its income after tax and payment of a contribution to CARP
to be sufficient to increase the real value of its equity (after inflation). Its
annual real return to equity is projected to be about 3-1/21.
5.        Under present and likely future arrangements, ARF would continue to
cover the administrat;ive cost of LBP's agrarian operations, to finance the
mismatch between LBP Bonds held by landowners and corresponding mortgages given
to smallholders, and to finance and bear 851 of the risk on lending to small
farmers.   Estimates are given as Table D.  Under the base assumption, a net
amount of P14 billion would need to flow from ARF to LRP during 1991-96. This
is equivalent to about P9.9 billion in constant terms. 'Tnder the alternative
scenario (Table D (a)) the amouat of funds needed would be 020.9 billion in
current terms, or P14.1 billion in 1990 constant terms.
I At constant mid-1990 prices. As there was inflation during 1990 itself,
there is an adjustment between current and constant terms for the 1990 balance
sheet, (which reflects the year nd position), as well as for the balance sheets
of other years.
