Program Development       The Program Development Objective is to increase the agri-food
Objectives and            sector’s productivity and diversification with the goal of
Contribution to CPS       maintaining higher rates of agricultural growth and
                          employment.
                          The proposed DPL is a key component of the current Country
                          Partnership Strategy (CPS) (FY10-FY13). It also contributes
                          directly to the three pillars around which the World Bank’s program
                          is structured:
                          (i) Growth, competitiveness, and employment;
                          (ii) Service delivery to citizens; and
                          (iii) Sustainable development in a changing climate.
                          Furthermore, it is linked to the two cross-cutting themes of
                          governance and territoriality.
Risks and Risk Mitigation Macroeconomic Risk. Morocco faces three exogenous
                          macroeconomic risks: (i) the possible deterioration of the ongoing
                          global economic conditions - especially in Europe; (ii) the volatility
                          of the agricultural output due to its dependence on changing climatic
                          conditions; and (iii) continued high world prices of food and energy.
                          Morocco also could suffer from endogenous risks, essentially those
                          related to a slow or non-consequential implementation of the needed
                          reforms resulting primarily from resistance of vested interests
                          groups. Morocco will face reduced growth prospects in case the
                          above mentioned exogenous shocks materialize. Morocco’s
                          management and mitigation of these risks are predicated on the
                          Government’s strong commitment to proceed with the ongoing and
                          envisaged reforms outlined in the Program Document.

                            Sector risk. Agriculture sector reforms are back on track after some
                            delays following the appointment of the Government. Government
                            commitment to sector reform is high given the continuity provided
                            by the re-appointed Minister of Agriculture, the ownership within
                            the relevant line-ministries of the strategic vision embedded in the
                            Plan Maroc Vert (PMV), and the strong commitment to the

                            by vested interests and marginalized stakeholders, especially
                            considering the current socio-political climate in Morocco. This is
                            most likely to occur in relation to reforms associated with domestic
                            markets and irrigation. Specific measures to mitigate risks
                            associated with domestic markets have been identified, including
                            development of a Social Plan.

               drought. The dependence of Moroccan agriculture on rainfed yields,
               particularly for poor and vulnerable farmers, coupled with increased
               water scarcity and a changing climate poses long run concerns for
               the agriculture sector. The Government is aware of the situation and

                                  PROPOSED LOAN
                           TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO


                                  I.     INTRODUCTION

1.       This Program Document proposes a second Development Policy Loan (DPL) in
support of the Plan Maroc Vert to the Kingdom of Morocco. The proposed operation is the
second of a programmatic series of two single-tranche DPLs of EUR 150 million each. The
series follows a request by the Government of Morocco (GoM) in February 2009 and confirmed
in January 2010. The first DPL in this series was approved by the Board of the World Bank on
15 March 2011. The program supports the implementation of four components of the agri-food
sector strategy outlined in the Plan Maroc Vert (PMV), the GoM’s agricultural development
strategy for the period 2008-2020. These components include: (A) domestic markets; (B)
agricultural investment support; (C) agricultural services; and (D) irrigation water. The
objectives of the operation are to: (A) improve the efficiency of domestic markets; (B) improve
the socio-economic impacts of projects directed to small farmers; (C) improve agricultural
services; and (D) improve the use and management of irrigation water and the planning of
irrigation infrastructure.

2.      The program supports an ambitious Government initiative in the agriculture sector
and builds on extensive dialogue between the World Bank and the GoM and is
underpinned by a large body of analytical work and sector operations. The proposed
program has benefited from a broad range of analytical work recently completed by the World
Bank and others. Key analytical activities completed by the World Bank include economic and
sector work, policy notes, and topical research and analysis covering strategic themes such as
agri-food trade, wholesale markets and food security, agricultural subsidy schemes, contract-
farming, land markets, rural poverty, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and territorial
development. The program also builds on the outcomes and experience from past and ongoing
World Bank operations in water and irrigation, integrated rural development, human
development, and public sector administration reform. Additional value added of the World
Bank includes bringing global best practice lessons to the implementation of the PMV and
furthering inter-ministerial coordination.

3.     The policy framework supported by this program has helped the Ministry of
Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries (Ministère de l’Agriculture et de la pêche maritime,
MAPM) inform, focus, and leverage the support of other donors and the private sector. A
large number of multilateral and bilateral donors have mobilized around the investment agenda
set out by the PMV. Key players include the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), United States Agency for International Development
(USAID), European Union (EU), African Development Bank (AfDB), French Development
Agency (AFD), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Belgian Cooperation
(BC), German Development Bank (KfW), and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Most
of the donors support the implementation of Pillar II investment projects in specific agri-food

4.      The wave of democratization that has swept the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) region since the start of the Arab Spring has also enveloped Morocco although its
experience has been a reasonably peaceful one with social demonstrations taking place
regularly across the country during 2011-12 and only sporadic outbursts of violence noted.
This social movement, known as the “February 20 Movement?, started with calls for political
change, a curbing of corruption and a more inclusive development process. His Majesty King
Mohammed VI’s response was to propose, in March 2011, a broad and comprehensive package
of political reforms that gathered the support of the population through a constitutional
referendum held on July 1, 2011. 2 The constitution sets the basis for a more open and
democratic society, provides mechanisms for the construction of a modern state and institutions,
and lays the foundation for decentralization. The constitution also contributes to improving the
status of women in Morocco through the adoption of the principle of equality between men and
women and through provisions on increasing the participation of women in decision-making
bodies. Also, Morocco lifted all reservations pertaining to the Convention on the Elimination of
All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Efforts to reduce gender discrimination
within the legal system produced changes in the country's criminal code, labor code, and code of
personal status.

5.       The Constitution introduces a new institutional model based on separated, balanced
and complementary powers. In addition, it reinforces the principles of good governance,
human rights and protection of individual freedoms, as well as increased institutional
responsibility and accountability. The main changes reflected in the constitution are: (i)
strengthening the role of Parliament through greater oversight powers over the Government; (ii)
elevating of the Prime Minister status to that of Head of Government; (iii) enhancing the
independence of the judiciary as a power that is autonomous from the executive and the
legislative; (iv) respecting all human rights as they are universally recognized; (v) establishment
of important institutions, including the National Council for Human Rights, the Ombudsman
system, the Competitiveness Council, the National Authority for Integrity and the Prevention and
Fight against Corruption; (vi) establishment of the Council for Youth and Community Work;
(vii) establishment of advanced regionalization as a democratic and highly decentralized system
of governance; and (viii) establishment of the agency for gender parity and against
discrimination.

6.      Transparent elections, held on November 25, 2011 were won by the “Parti de la
justice et du développement? (PJD), an Islamic party that had traditionally been in active
opposition and has seen its support increasing steadily in recent years. The PJD won 27
percent of the vote, almost twice that of the second largest political party. An intense period of
discussions among political parties then followed, leading to the formation, in early January

7.     The Arab Spring protests and constitutional changes represent real pressure on the
Moroccan State for meaningful and quick change. While the people seem to be willing to
support the Government and its mandate, they are expecting and indeed demanding that the
Government break with the past and usher in more credible and faster reforms, notably in the
areas of job creation and improvement of the quality of public services delivered. Morocco is
thus on the threshold of potentially profound social, political and economic transformation. The
Government is determined to assume more ownership of the political process and to pursue the
reforms in this context.

8.      Many important tasks are awaiting the Parliament. In addition to adopting various
organic laws–such as the new Budget Organic Law and the one planned for regionalization– and
establishing the institutions dedicated to human rights and economic and social development, the
Parliament will need to start reforming mechanisms that govern the relationship between the
legislature and the executive. The Government’s program voted by Parliament on January 26,
2012, is in line with such challenges as it centers on the rapid implementation of the Constitution
and promotes good governance, transparency, and accountability within the public sector.

       A. MACROECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS OVER THE LAST DECADE

9.      Morocco made significant economic headways during the last decade. Growth pattern
shifted to a higher level averaging 4.9 percent over 2001-2011, much higher than the average
rate of the 1990s (2.8 percent). Inflation was subdued, recording less than two percent in
average over the period. The growth and inflation performance allowed gross domestic product
(GDP) per capita to almost double over the last decade to reach the equivalent of US$3,100 in
2011. The unemployment rate declined from 12.3 percent in 2000 to 8.9 percent in 2011.
Absolute poverty decreased from 15.3 percent to roughly nine percent between 2001 and 2007.
Based on these achievements, Morocco gained “investment grade? rating in 2007, which was
confirmed over 2009-2011 despite ongoing world economic turmoil. Annex 7 presents additional
details of Morocco’s achievements in the last decade.

10.     These achievements were in part the result of sound macroeconomic policies. The
steady consolidation of public finance turned fiscal deficits 3 into surpluses in 2007 and 2008
(averaging 0.3 percent of GDP). The fiscal deficits widened to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2009 and
4.7 percent of GDP in 2010 but remained manageable. The Treasury total debt steadily declined
from 68 percent of GDP in 2000 to 50.3 percent of GDP in 2010. Monetary policy sought to
keep inflation under check while managing both liquidity and the exchange rate in an effective
manner. In addition to timely adjustments of its money policy rate and reserve requirement rate,
the Central Bank implemented an adequate mix of its other instruments, including foreign
exchange swaps, issuance or buyback of debt securities, and the purchase or sale of securities in
the secondary market.

to increase investment and employment opportunities. Gross investment, which used to hover
around 25 percent of GDP on average in the 1990s, picked up in the 2000s to reach 38 percent of
GDP in 2008 (Figure 1). Morocco also sought to deepen its integration into the world economy
through the signing of many free trade agreements (FTAs) culminating with the “Advanced
Status? awarded by the European Union (EU) in 2008. Foreign direct investments (FDI) inflows
increased to reach an average of 4.3 percent of GDP over 2006-11, thus contributing to the
expansion of the country’s stock of capital.

12.      Notwithstanding those economic achievements, Morocco remains confronted with
important human and social challenges. Morocco’s social and human development outcomes
are still below expectations. Economic vulnerability (poor and vulnerable) remains widespread,
meaning that a quarter of the population–around 8 million people–is either in absolute poverty or
under constant threat of falling back into poverty. The partial closure of the rural-urban income
gap has not cancelled disparities: 70 percent of poverty in Morocco is still rural and in 2007 the
urban poverty rate was 4.8 percent compared to 14.5 percent in rural areas. Income of the poor
has been growing at a slower rate than the average income. There has been a remarkable
increase in access to education, but overall illiteracy rates and gender disparity in access to
secondary education remain high: 21 percent of male youth and 42 percent of female youth are
illiterate and 72 percent of rural women are illiterate. Both education quality and learning
outcomes lag behind those of other countries with similar income levels. Even with progress in
increasing overall life expectancy and reducing average infant mortality rate, levels of infant and
maternal mortality remain high, and lag Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targets. In sum,
inequality, gender inequality, and urban-rural disparities in poverty and social outcomes remain a
challenge.

13.     Morocco’s ongoing human and social challenges reflect the slow structural
transformation of the economy. To be sure, Morocco’s production structure has gradually
shifted toward services with both primary and secondary sectors’ shares in GDP declining over
time. However, while the increased service orientation of the economy is emulating trends
observed throughout the world, the weak performance of the manufacturing sector stems from

                                                     4
the relatively slow modernization of the industrial sector, which also explains the performance of
Moroccan exports. The latter continue to be concentrated around relatively undiversified, low
knowledge, low value-added, traditional products. As a result, Morocco has not fully reaped the
benefits from the market access opportunities and trade dynamics of its trading partners. Exports
have been kept below potential and their contribution to growth and employment has yet to be
unleashed.

14.     Morocco’s slow structural transformation seems to be less due to the lack of
investment than the low return on investment. Investment in Morocco appears to be less
productive than in other emerging economies. Public investments are concentrated in relatively
low productive projects or in projects that need time to fully mature. Indeed, a large share of
public investments made over the last years has been directed to the tourism sector, phosphate
related industries, energy, and infrastructure projects (highways, ports, airports, small dams, free
trade zones, etc.). Investments in those sectors require time to be operational at full capacity and
thus profitable. The Government has launched analytical efforts to investigate the issue and
propose remedies.

15.     The agri-food sector is an important pillar of the Moroccan economy. Representing
15 percent of Morocco’s GDP and 23 percent of the country’s exports, and employing close to
half of the labor force, the agri-food sector (together with the forestry and fishing) is a key pillar
of the Moroccan economy. In the rural areas it is the primary source of employment and income
for about 80 percent of the labor force. Although rural poverty decreased from 25 percent in
2001 to 14 percent in 2007 largely due to the combined effect of increases in the value of
agricultural production, diversification of the rural economy, and increases in remittances, the
contribution to overall inequality of the gap between rural and urban living standards in Morocco
is the highest of any Middle East and North Africa (MENA) country. In fact, poverty rates in
rural areas are almost three times as high as in urban areas and 70 percent of poverty in Morocco
remains rural. With a Gini coefficient of 0.6, land remains inequitably distributed: a majority of
low-productivity smallholders owns only 26 percent of cultivated land, while a minority of less
than one percent of mostly commercial and export-oriented farms owns about 14 percent.

16.      The agri-food sector’s growth potential is constrained by the dualistic nature of
farming in Morocco. The vast majority of the 1.5 million agricultural holdings are semi-
subsistence farms that have low productivity and product quality levels and limited market
integration. These farms are small (70 percent are less than 5 hectares) and largely rainfed and
vulnerable to recurrent droughts. Farm work is performed by both men and women, with a
significant portion of women’s work remaining unrecognized, unpaid, or underpaid. Farms often
have aging household heads with a low education (more than 45 percent of the heads of farming
families are over 55 years old, and 81 percent are illiterate) and have limited adoption of modern
production technologies. Traditionally, in order to meet their food and feed needs and partially in
response to the incentives provided by Government subsidy schemes and market protection,
smallholders typically engaged in the production of low-value agricultural commodities such as
wheat and barley. This large group of smallholder farmers co-exists with a small but very
efficient group of commercial farmers producing milk for domestic markets and crops (such as
citrus, tomatoes, strawberries, grapes, melons, and peppers) for high-value export markets. This
sub-sector of mainly irrigated production accounts for 7 percent of GDP, 50 percent of

                                                  5
Morocco’s agricultural value added, generates over 75 percent of Morocco’s agricultural exports,
and provides jobs to 50 percent of the rural labor force, many of whom are women.

17.     In an effort to directly encourage growth of the agri-food sector, Morocco launched
a transformative agricultural development strategy - the Plan Maroc Vert (PMV) for the
period 2008-2020. The PMV is an ambitious strategy that aims to transform this sector into a
stable source of growth, competitiveness, and broad-based economic development in rural areas
through a combination of agricultural investments and systemic public sector reforms. At its
outset, up to 170 billion MAD of combined public and private sector investments from 2009 to
2020 was envisaged in around 1,450 commercial (Pillar I) and smallholder (Pillar II) agriculture
investment projects; the latter focusing mainly on marginalized rural areas. Since 2008,
investments in the agri-food sector have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of about 12
percent, totaling over 24 billion MAD. Of the total investments in the PMV to date, 5.6 billion
MAD have been directed to Pillar II projects. These investments have resulted in sector growth
both in terms of volume and value, thanks in part to favorable climatic conditions over some
agricultural campaigns since the launch of the PMV. The total volume of agriculture production
increased by 40 percent between 2005-2007 and 2011, while agriculture value added per worker
increased by 53 percent between 2007 and 2010.

18.     The PMV is facilitating a paradigm shift from a highly protected agriculture sector
to a more open market sector which emphasizes integrated value-addition along the agri-
food chain in order to create better opportunities for small and large farmers alike. In
combination with the GoM’s ongoing National Program of Irrigation Water Conservation
(Programme national d'économie d'eau en irrigation, PNEEI) and the systemic public sector
reforms undertaken by the PMV, these investments are to realize the agri-food sector’s domestic
and export growth potential, particularly in fresh and processed high-value fruits and vegetables,
stemming from Morocco’s geographic position and privileged access to the EU and US markets,
rising domestic demand for quality food driven by growing incomes, favorable climate, and
abundant and relatively low cost labor. The PMV is leveraging these advantages in a number of
ways. First, the PMV is increasing the agriculture sector’s resilience to climate change through
crop switching which reduces dependence on vulnerable crops such as cereals, improved
management of water and irrigation resources, and integrating the use of multi-risk insurance.
The PMV also aims to increase the sector’s competitiveness by emphasizing production of
higher value crops. Thus far, 35 percent of agricultural production in terms of volume has been
targeted for this increased competitiveness, and this is expected to increase to 50 percent of
production by 2020. Across the sector, agricultural intensification efforts, driven by a 50 percent
increase in the use of mechanized tractors and 100 percent increase in the use of certified seeds,
have led to an increase in outputs. Total production of cereals has increased by 52 percent, while
the share of cereals in total agricultural output has fallen from an average of 23 percent from
2000-2005 to 15 percent from 2006-2010. This is largely due to crop switching efforts focusing
on higher value crops: for example, marginal areas used for cereal cultivation are in the process
of being converted into olive orchards. Olive production has thus increased by 83 percent. Also,
a focus on increasing competiveness in livestock and dairy value chains is demonstrated by an
increase in animal feed production which supports the 22 percent growth in red meat and 35




                                                6
percent increase in milk products. Other selected high value agri-food chains have seen growth
in output, such as citrus (36 percent) and dates (45 percent). 4

19.     Key indicators suggest solid progress has been achieved through DPL/1. Under
Component A, the launch of two new private slaughterhouses since 2010 and the preparation of
another three will increase competition and modernize management in the sector. Under
Component B, whereas in 2010 five percent of small farmers benefited from Pillar II projects,
this figure was over 25 percent in September 2012. Moreover, the percent of new Pillar II
projects proposed by farmers’ organizations or associations increased from 15 percent in 2010 to
nearly 37 percent in 2012. Under Component C, a 480 percent increase in training since 2010
translates into improved agricultural services, as does the introduction of 51 new private sector
agriculture advisory contracts and the HAACP certification of an additional 300 food production
units. Under Component D, declarations and authorization of groundwater abstraction have
increased by 67 percent and the number of farmers participating in collective reconversion to
drip irrigation increased from 3,000 to nearly 20,000. The DPL/2 will further contribute to the
PMV’s transformation of the agriculture sector.

    B. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN MOROCCO

20.     Since 2008, Morocco has been hit by a number of adverse exogenous shocks. Like
other emerging countries, Morocco has suffered from the global finance crisis as well as the high
global fuel and food prices. Given its strong trade exposure to the EU, Morocco has been
particularly vulnerable to developments in the euro area and the resolution of the sovereign debt
crises in Spain, Italy and other countries. Yet, even under a mild scenario of orderly resolution,
Morocco’s external demand will remain weak under the current projections for growth in the EU
and other advanced economies. At the same time, prices of the main commodities have remained
high, with the price of Brent crude averaging nearly US$ 113.4 in September 2012, up 18.6
percent from its lowest level of June 2012. In addition, cereal prices have soared following
droughts in the United States and Russia, which may lead to another food crisis in the coming
months. Internally, Morocco has suffered from a decline in its agricultural output that has put
more pressure on the balance of payments and the budget due to increasing food imports,
especially cereals.

21.     Despite those negative exogenous shocks, Morocco’s non-agricultural output is
projected to remain robust in 2012. Over the first three quarters of 2012, while the agricultural
sector suffered from insufficient rainfall resulting in an 8.8 percent drop in production, non-
agricultural GDP increased by 4.5 percent, allowing GDP growth to post a positive rate (2.7
percent) although it is one of the lowest rates in a decade. Domestic demand remains the main
driver of growth. Public consumption gained 5.1 percent while household consumption increased
by 4.5 percent over the period benefiting from the recent wage rises and relatively low prices of
non-food products. Investment increased by 3.2 percent, mostly driven by programs of social
housing, public works, and industrial equipment.

22.      The Government and the Central Bank have shown continued commitment to
control inflation. Despite higher world prices of imported commodities, inflation has remained
relatively low, mostly because of basic food and fuel subsidies and prudent monetary policy.
Subsidies have allowed the Government to control consumer prices of basic food and fuels. As a
result, the average consumer price index increased just marginally over the first nine months of
2012, edging up to 1.1 percent, similar to the same period last year. Among all sectors, higher
food prices have contributed the most to inflation (up 2 percent). The upward adjustment of the
administered prices for fuel products in June 2012 and related direct increase in transportation
prices (by 2.6 percent) has had limited indirect effect so far on overall inflation.

23.     Morocco’s unemployment rate has been stubbornly high. Less than half of the
Moroccan population is actually active (either employed or looking for a job), which reflects one
of the lowest participation rates among comparator countries. Participation rates 5 have been
steadily declining from 55.3 percent in 1999 to 48.6 percent over the first three quarters of 2012.
The unemployment rate remained quasi-stable over the same period, reaching 9.1 percent of the
active population or about one million unemployed. Regarding the profile of the job seekers, 4
out of 5 unemployed are urban jobless, 2 out of 3 are youth aged 15-29, 1 in 4 jobless holds a
university diploma, half of the unemployed look for their first jobs, and more than two third have
been jobless for more than one year. Efforts to engage young women in the workforce are
ongoing but hampered by cultural, social, policy and institutional challenges that limit women’s
access to formal employment opportunities: women constitute only 42 percent of the labor force.

24.     The economic turmoil in Europe and continued high prices of commodities have
had negative consequences on Morocco’s fiscal balance. The fiscal deficit 6 deteriorated to 6.9
percent of GDP in 2011 and central Government debt jumped to 53.7 percent of GDP. In 2012,
the fiscal deficit is estimated to stay high. The deficit reached 5.1 percent of GDP at end-
September 2012 (up from 4.2 percent of GDP during the same period last year). Given the
impact on subsidies of higher world prices of basic food and fuel products, the deficit is expected
to increase over the rest of the year. However, the decision of the Government to increase the
prices of liquid fuel products in June 2012 (up 19.6 percent for gasoline, 14 percent for gasoil,
and 13.4 percent for industrial fuel), should help reduce the projected deficit by 0.6 percent of
GDP this year and 1 percent of GDP in 2013. This measure, combined with strict controls of
recurrent expenditures, should contain the fiscal deficit to around 6-6.5 percent of GDP in 2012.

25.     The current universal and open subsidy system and higher wage bill are
increasingly testing Morocco’s record of fiscal prudence. Despite the good performance of
tax collection over the first nine months of 2012 (up 5.5 percent), Government revenues could
not compensate for the expansion of current expenditures (up 11.3 percent), mostly due to higher
subsidies and a larger public wage bill. The cost of the subsidy system (6.5 percent of GDP by
end-September 2012 vs. 6.2 percent of GDP by end September 2011), along with the
Government wage bill (11.5 percent of GDP, up from 10.7 percent of GDP), explain 75.3 percent
of the increase in current expenditures. Subsidies and the wage bill represent 61 percent of total
expenditures. Subsidies rocketed to a historical record level of US$5.93 billion (48 billion MAD)

26.     Even though deficit financing has been exclusively through domestic market, there
are no apparent signs of crowding out private investment, as interest rates eased over the
period. Net external financing has been negative as disbursement from multilateral creditors was
very low, but is expected to scale up over the rest of the year. Overall, the central Government
debt increased by 4.6 percentage points of GDP by June 2012, bringing it to about 55.3 percent
of GDP– compared to 50.7 percent of GDP end-June 2011– of which 12 percent of GDP is
foreign-exchange denominated. This debt level remains manageable provided the Government
continues implementing the announced measures for this year to consolidate public finances,
notably through reducing the unnecessary current expenditures, rationalizing transfers to public
entities, including state-owned enterprises (SOE), and improving tax collection and fighting
fraud and tax evasion.

27.     The weakening fiscal situation has been putting the balance of payments under
stress. The trade deficit continued to deteriorate in 2012 due to sluggish external demand,
notably from Europe, and higher world prices of imported commodities. The trade deficit
increased by ten percent over January-October 2012 compared to the same period last year. Total
nominal imports increased by 6.6 percent, entirely due to higher import prices, while exports
grew by three percent reflecting volume effect. Morocco suffered a loss of 5.6 percent in its term
of trade. Tourism receipts declined by 2.5 percent and workers’ remittances dropped 3.1 percent.
The current account deficit is therefore estimated to have widened to ten percent 7 of GDP over
the period; trends indicate that the annual deficit at the end of 2012 would reach nine percent of
GDP. On the capital account side, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows grew by a healthy four
percent during the period, thanks to foreign investors’ continued confidence in the Moroccan
economy. However, total net external capital flows were not sufficient to finance the current
account deficit and net international reserves declined by almost US$4 billion since end-2011 to
reach the critical level of US$15.5 billion in October 2012, corresponding to 3.8 months of
imports coverage. Nevertheless, the Government’s raising of US$1.5 billion on international
financial market in December, coupled with an expected scaling up of disbursement from
multilateral and bilateral financing sources should boost foreign reserves to more than 4 months
of imports by the end of the year.

28.    To stimulate economic activity and help finance the economy, the Central Bank
decided to reduce its policy rate from 3.25 percent to 3 percent in March 2012 – rate
confirmed in December – and money reserve requirement for banks from 6 to 4 percent in
September 2012. These decisions were taken to inject liquidity into the money market to meet
7
    Bank staff estimates.

                                                              9
financing needs of economic agents in a context of low inflation and a balance of inflationary
risks tilted to the downside. As a result, money supply increased by 3.6 percent by end October
2012 (year-on-year), compared with a growth of 5.0 percent during the same period in 2011.
Bank credit to the economy increased by 4.0 percent (compared to 7.0 percent last year), mostly
driven by credit to corporate treasuries (up 10.4 percent), which in part reflects liquidity needs of
businesses to compensate for large arrears overdue by the public sector. Credit to housing also
increased substantially (up 5.8 percent) due to extending social housing programs backed by the
Government. Consumption credit jumped 11.1 percent in part because of easier access to credit
and the relatively low prices of housing equipment. At the same time, credit to business
equipment dropped by 1.0 percent. Non-performing loans remained at 4.3 percent of total credit
to the private sector, stable over the period January-October 2012. Overall, the conduct of
monetary policy has remained in line with the objective of price stability.

   C. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

29.     Morocco’s macroeconomic room for maneuvering has narrowed considerably. The
twin deficits that have accumulated to finance the series of adverse external shocks since 2008
have largely exhausted the room for maneuver that Morocco had built prior to these crises
through prudent macroeconomic policies and management. They unveiled two main weaknesses
that are endangering Morocco’s external and fiscal sustainability in case of a further
deterioration of its external or domestic environment. First, the low structural transformation of
the economy, which hinders the prospects of a rapid increase in competitiveness, exports, and
quality job generation. Second, the pursuit of highly onerous fiscal policies, such as the universal
subsidy system and tax exoneration programs. These two weaknesses are contributing to the
reversal of the downward trend of public debt and the depletion of foreign reserves to critical
levels.

30.    Macroeconomic prospects in the medium term will greatly depend on the scope,
depth and pace of Morocco’s reform programs as well as developments in Europe – the
main trading partner of Morocco. Morocco is expected to benefit from ongoing reforms to
improve the economy’s overall competitiveness and the effectiveness of sectoral policies. The
current reforms to strengthen governance and justice, consolidate public finance, and deepen
decentralization are critical to achieving long-lasting improvement in economic efficiency,
productivity, and employment. Under these assumptions, economic growth should recover to
around 5 percent by 2015. Inflation is projected to remain under control at 2.5 percent or below.
Main macroeconomic indicators are presented in Table 2 below.

31.     Should the underlying sources of growth be slow to materialize, growth prospects
would have to be adjusted downward. A potential deterioration of the world economy,
particularly in Europe, would negatively impact the medium term macroeconomic outlook
through reduced prospects on exports, including tourism, as well as on workers’ remittances and
FDI flows. Similarly, sustained high commodity prices, a deterioration of the regional context
and prolonged global financial uncertainties would have an adverse impact on Morocco’s
prospects. Moreover, there is a potential risk that even pre-crisis growth levels might not be
sustainable over the medium term if internal demand remains the key driver of growth.

32.     In line with the Constitutional requirement, the Government has further committed
to fiscal stability and to progressively decrease the budget deficit to the medium term target
of about 3 percent of GDP by 2016 through the implementation of a set of critical reforms.
The key measures include:

    Revenues include VAT of local governments.

                                                                         11
   •   Reforming the universal subsidy system. Fully aware of the considerable financial
       burden the current system imposes on public finances, the Government announced the
       launch of the reform of the subsidy system with the 2013 Budget law. In essence, the
       overall goal is to improve its efficiency through targeted social programs while
       progressively allowing for international market price pass-through, especially for fuel
       products. Currently, the key axes of the reform are: (i) progressive removal of untargeted
       subsidies; and (ii) identification of alternative targeted systems to support poor and
       vulnerable households;
   •   Implementing civil service reform including the implementation of a new
       remuneration system. Following a long preparation phase, the Government has now
       reiterated its plans to roll out a comprehensive civil service reform including a clear and
       well defined remuneration system. Together with measures foreseen in the new Organic
       budget law soon to be submitted to Parliament, these measures will result in better
       management and control of the wage bill;
   •   Accelerate the fiscal and pension reform agenda. Key fiscal reform measures include
       maintaining momentum of the ongoing tax reform to broaden the tax base, improving the
       efficiency of the Value Added Tax (VAT), strengthening tax administration, and
       removing unproductive tax exemptions. These measures would offset the negative impact
       of the reduced top rates on corporate and personal income taxes. Another key measure is
       the commitment to a comprehensive reform of the pension system, starting with a
       parametric reform of the public sector pension fund (Caisse marocaine des retraites,
       CMR) in order to ensure it has a balanced budget in the short term;
   •   Enhancing the efficiency of public investment as well as that of the private sector.
       The Government strategy seeks to consolidate public investment efforts in social sectors
       (health, education, social housing) while working on the profitability of existing
       investments, mainly in sectors such as industry, agriculture and tourism. In particular, the
       Government plans to support high value added industries, mainly through PPP funding
       for training, infrastructure and logistics. Regarding small and medium size enterprises
       (SMEs), the Government intends to support marketing of their products, especially
       abroad.

33.       The Government’s debt strategy is to diversify financing sources and take on a
greater proportion of external financing (Table 3). Three main factors underpin the decision
of the Government to reinforce its external sources, especially multilateral and concessional. The
first is linked to Morocco’s public debt maturity structure. The maturity of public debt has fallen
in recent years and will fall further given that the Government mostly financed its needs through
issuing short-term T-bills in the domestic market. The main reason behind this choice is to avoid
affecting long-term floating rates for banks’ domestic lending to the private sector, especially
housing credit, as they are indexed to primary market rates on long-term securities (10 and 15
year bonds). The second relates to the higher balance of payments needs. The third is due to the
current higher borrowing requirements of the Budget, in a context of tightening liquidity of the
domestic financial markets after a long period of an over-liquid money market.

34.     In this context, new external financing schemes are being put in place. The most
important one was the August 2012 Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) of US$ 6.2 billion
approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The PLL is part of the proactive approach
of the Government to ensure new external financing lines to be able to cope, if necessary, with a
deterioration of internal and external balances that would emerge from a possible worsening
situation in Europe. State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are also seeking more external financing in
line with the Government policy. To this end, Office chérifien des phosphates (OCP) benefited
from a Euro 100 million loan recently. MedZ, a subsidiary of Caisse de dépôts et de gestion,
specialized in developing industrial zones and incubating firms in emerging sectors, has
benefited from Euro 150 million awarded by Agence française de développement (AFD) and
Euro 100 million by European Investment Bank (EIB). The Euro 100 million from AFD credit
will be used by MedZ for the early repayment of domestic banking loans with onerous
conditions. The Government has raised US$1.5 billion from the international market in
December 2012.

35.     Despite its deterioration in 2012, the external position is expected to remain
sustainable over the medium term provided that key critical reforms under
implementation take hold. As noted earlier, the current account deficit is expected to
deteriorate in 2012 and to progressively edge downward to around 5.5 percent of GDP in 2016
benefiting from improved export potentials and a recovery of tourism activities and workers’
remittances. This scenario critically assumes that Morocco would benefit from its continued
reform efforts in trade and competitiveness, supported among others by the World Bank. These
reforms, along with sector strategies already under implementation, would translate into higher
productive private investments, including FDIs, and progressive gains in competitiveness of its
exports, including tourism. In this context, external debt is expected to follow an inverted U path
reaching a maximum at 40.9 percent of GDP in 2016 before steadily dropping thereafter, while
net foreign reserves will remain above 4 months of imports.

36.    Balance of payments financing requirements constitute a moderate concern in the
medium term, given the country’s relatively low outstanding external debt and still
adequate foreign reserves. As the current account deficits are projected to steadily improve in
the medium term, financing them through traditional multilateral and bilateral credit lines along

                                                          13
with other private capital flows, including FDIs should not be a major constraint. In addition, the
Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) countries recently confirmed their intention to invest US$5
billion over the next five years in FDIs. Any remaining financing gap could be filled by tapping
international financial markets. The PLL from the IMF will continue to provide a useful line of
credit.

37.     The authorities are considering a possible move to a more formal inflation targeting
system in conjunction with a more flexible exchange rate. The Central Bank has developed
the necessary prerequisites and tools to shift to an inflation targeting framework. However, the
timing of this reform should be carefully considered as it requires measures to ensure fiscal
sustainability especially with regards to reforming the subsidy system so as to prevent a negative
impact on financial stability. The current exchange rate regime has contributed to
macroeconomic stability, yet given the rigidities of the economy, the recent trends in the current
account balance would suggest that it could possibly be undermining international
competitiveness. In the future, a more flexible exchange rate policy would help strengthen
structural reforms to foster competitiveness and weather external shocks.

38.     A comprehensive public debt sustainability analysis indicates that the fiscal
framework remains sustainable although it would weaken under some medium term
downside risks, notably those related to “no policy change? assumption (A2) and growth shock
(B2). Indeed, when the debt sustainability analysis was run under the assumption of “no-policy-
change? scenario, the debt stock increased over the period 2012-2017, before reversing the trend,
while under the scenario of “reduced GDP growth by half standard deviation? the debt stock
steadily increases. All the other scenarios 9 proved fully sustainable over the medium term (See
Annex 7).

39.     In sum, Morocco is facing growing economic and fiscal challenges. Assuming that the
ongoing key fiscal and structural reforms, including those envisaged in the 2013 budget Law
adopted in Parliament and described above, are implemented in a timely fashion, Morocco’s
macroeconomic framework would remain adequate and sustainable in the medium term. In
particular, the projected macroeconomic outlook and the success of the structural reforms depend
on a robust fiscal consolidation, a prudent monetary policy, and more flexible exchange rate
policy over the medium term that supports external competitiveness. Until now, the negative
effects of the global environment on Morocco have been weathered relatively well, thanks to
strong economic fundamentals and sound macroeconomic policies carried out over the last
decade. Yet, in contrast to when the international crisis struck in 2008, the Government today has
much smaller margins for maneuver. Its commitment to deepen and expand the current reform
efforts is key to the prospects for a sustainable recovery of investment, growth, and employment
in the years to come.



9
  The Scenarios are as follows: A1. Key variables are at their historical averages; A2. No policy change (constant
primary balance); B1. Real interest rate is at baseline plus one standard deviations; B2. Real GDP growth is at
baseline minus one-half standard deviation; B3. Primary balance is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation;
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one-quarter standard deviation shocks; B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation
in 2012 and B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2012

   III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

40.     The GoM has an ambitious agricultural development strategy, the Plan Maroc Vert
(PMV), for the period 2008-2020. The PMV, launched in April 2008, constitutes an ambitious
investment program in the agri-food sector and provides a road map for implementing a series of
systemic public sector reforms. The ongoing National Program of Irrigation Water Conservation
(Programme national d'économie d'eau en irrigation, PNEEI) is an integral part of the strategy.
The PMV’s development was motivated by several factors, including: (i) the desire of the
Government to confront problems of falling productivity and low incomes in the agri-food
sector; (ii) the higher and more volatile international food commodity prices in 2007; and (iii) the
domestic pressure to address the challenges in a sector that was perceived as a drag on the rest of
the economy. These factors continue to be pertinent in the current national and international
economic context. The PMV aims to transform the agri-food sector into a key source of
economic growth that contributes to employment creation and poverty reduction in rural areas.
At the same time, policy reforms and investments in a productive, dynamic and market-oriented
agri-food sector are designed to improve food security in Morocco, promote the country’s
integration in the global economy, and help the sector adapt to climate change. The vision laid
down in the PMV constitutes a paradigm shift from the strategies of the past which emphasized
food self-sufficiency through inward-looking, import substitution policies. The PMV recognizes
the opportunities and threats that come with an increasingly competitive global economy and sets
out to integrate the agri-food sector into this global framework.

41.      The PNEEI is an integral part of the PMV’s reform and investment agenda. The
PNEEI aims to improve agricultural revenues by supporting the conversion of the current
irrigation technologies by using more efficient irrigation technologies and practices, as well as a
better valorization of water at both the production and marketing level. These strategic objectives
were confirmed by the National Water Strategy developed by the State Secretariat for Water and
Environment (SEEE) in 2009. The PNEEI is a 15 year development program supporting the
conversion of an estimated 555,000 hectares of surface irrigation to drip irrigation, of which
220,000 hectares are situated within Large Scale Irrigation (LSI) systems. It is structured around
five components: (i) modernization of collective irrigation systems; (ii) modernization of
individual irrigation systems; (iii) improved agricultural water management; (iv) enhanced
technical assistance for drip irrigation and productivity improvements; and (v) targeted support
measures.

42.     The PMV’s investment program is structured around two pillars. An estimated 140
billion MAD of combined public and private investments are expected to be directed to a total of
955 commercial (Pillar I) and 545 smallholder (Pillar II) agricultural development projects in the
period 2008-2020. Pillar I investments aim to integrate commercially-oriented producers in high
value added and high productivity agri-food chains. Pillar II investments aim to increase incomes
of smallholder farms through crop switching, diversification, and intensification, as well as
strengthening farmer organizations and supporting their integration in suitable agri-food chains.
The overall philosophy is that Pillar I projects will rely largely on significant private sector
financing with some public support. Pillar II projects will mainly be financed by public
resources. In the period 2008-2020, total public investment resources for Pillar I and II projects

                                                15
(including cross-cutting reforms, see following paragraph) are expected to amount to 66.6 billion
MAD (approximately one-third of the total cost of the PMV) and would serve primarily to
leverage the private investment (approximately two thirds of the cost of the PMV) resources
required to realize the program. Under both pillars, the process of value creation is to be driven
by a voluntary aggregation of farmers and farm organizations (agrégés) around private investors,
traders, and/or entrepreneurs (agrégateurs). One of the most innovative features of the PMV is
that it conditions Government support on the conclusion of tri-lateral contractual arrangements
between agrégateurs, agrégés, and the GoM. The contract farming model is designed to help
overcome existing land constraints, promote farmer organization, and enable producers’ access
to finance, knowledge, and technologies, support risk-sharing, and improve marketing. Of the
1,500 projects 10 envisaged under the PMV, 459 are currently being implemented. They include
134 Pillar I projects totaling 28.6 billion MAD and 325 Pillar II projects totaling 10.3 billion
MAD.

43.      To achieve the successful implementation of the two pillar strategy, the PMV’s
investment program is accompanied by a series of cross-cutting reform actions. The key
strategic axes of this cross-cutting systemic public sector reform program include:
    (i) Reorienting the role of the Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries (MAPM)
          towards functions regarding the planning, piloting, and implementation of programs, and
          delegating other agricultural services functions to private actors through Public Private
          Partnerships (PPPs);
    (ii) Improving the agricultural business environment through improved access to investment
          financing as well as a realignment and improved targeting of agricultural subsidy
          schemes;
    (iii) Pursuing new agricultural Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and reorienting existing ones
          to improve access to high value export markets and gradually liberalize protected sub-
          sectors;
    (iv) Reducing domestic market distortions through increased investment and improved
          management of marketing infrastructure and liberalizing distribution of fruit, vegetables,
          and meat;
    (v) Strengthening irrigation water services by delegating management of LSI systems to
          private operators, extending existing irrigation perimeters, promoting on-farm drip
          irrigation, and ensuring inter-agency coordination of investment programs;
    (vi) Reorganizing and strengthening the advisory services, through a National Advisory
          Strategy, including the creation of a national advisory agency and a policy strengthening
          private advisory agents.
    (vii)         Mobilizing agricultural land by accelerating the process of private sector
          participation in the operation of state-owned and collective lands and promoting contract
          farming.

44.   Before the launch of the programmatic DPL series, the GoM had already been
undertaking important institutional reforms and arranged for program financing. With

10
  These projects were identified through a participatory planning and consultation process at the regional level and
each year specific projects are/will be further developed into bankable projects by the regional directorates. The
design of these investments is based around a supply chain concept. Priority supply chains have been defined for
each region based on their economic and agro-climatic conditions.

                                                        16
respect to the PMV’s agricultural policy and institutional reform agenda, the MAPM established
16 Regional Agricultural Directorates (DRAs) contributing to more de-concentrated service
delivery in each region. In addition, the Chambers of Agriculture were restructured and their
number was reduced from 37 to 16 in the context of strengthening decentralization. In another
nod to de-concentration, MAPM’s Regional Agricultural Directorate (DRAs) and Provincial
Agricultural Directorate (DPAs) prepared in consultation with sector stakeholders 16 Regional
Agricultural Plans (PARs) including territorial-based agricultural investment proposals (Pillar I
and II), which were adopted by the Regional Councils, the Chambers of Agriculture, and the
local authorities in April 2009. It also signed results-oriented contract programs with 17 priority
agri-food chains (filières) on the basis of the PARs. Professional associations (Inter-professions)
were established for these priority agri-food chains. Furthermore, specialized agencies such as
Agricultural Development Agency (ADA) 11 and ONSSA 12 were created and tasked with
implementing the PMV’s investment program (Pillar I and II) and the new Food Safety Law
respectively. In December 2009, the GoM concluded its agricultural trade negotiations with the
European Commission. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which was adopted by the European
Parliament on February 16th 2012, liberalizes with immediate effect 55 percent of tariffs on
Morocco's agricultural and fisheries products (rising from 33 percent) and 70 percent of tariffs
on the EU's agricultural and fisheries products over a period of 10 years (rising from 1 percent).
With regards to program financing, the MAPM signed a multi-year agreement on the financing
of the PMV (2009-2015) with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) in April 2009. 13 In
addition, the MAPM and MEF revised the relevant Decrees and Implementing regulations
(Arrêtés) related to the Agricultural Development Fund (Fonds de développement agricole,
FDA), the GoM’s principal agricultural subsidy instrument, with a view to simplify procedures
and aligning support measures with the strategic directions of the PMV.

45.     The MAPM is undertaking extensive and regular consultations in relation to the
PMV. The MAPM regularly organizes consultations in the context of the annual review of the
16 PARs and the monitoring of the implementation progress of the contract-programs signed
with the 17 priority agri-food chains, as well as during the national conference on the agricultural
sector (Assises de l’agriculture), carried out annually in Meknes. At Pillar I and Pillar II projects
level, the ADA organizes regularly supervision missions including consultations with groups of
beneficiaries. Consultations specifically addressing environmental aspects were carried out as
part of the Strategic Environmental Impact Evaluation of the PMV commissioned by ADA with
staff of the MAPM at central and local level, farmers associations, private stakeholders,
chambers of agriculture, and donor community between December 2011 and March 2012. Three
consultations were organized by the MAPM in relation to the reforms supported under the DPL
series, and specifically to validate the findings of the Environmental Due Diligence Review, with
ministerial staff, representatives from non-government organizations working on environmental
issues, and representatives from universities between 2010 and 2012. Further consultations took
place in November 2012 through January 2013 in the context of the Social Plan related to
11

   Loi 25-08 portant création de l’Office national de sécurité sanitaire des produits alimentaires publiée au Bulletin

13
   The agreement defines the total (public and private) financial needs associated with the implementation of the
PMV during the period 2008-2020, which are estimated at 17 billion USD. The public financing share of this
amount (including donor resources) is estimated at 8 billion USD.

                                                         17
domestic market reforms. As part of the gender analysis of the PMV, the MAPM is
programming consultations over the first half of 2013.

46.    The World Bank built on the consultations carried out by the MAPM. Consultations
with universities and professional organizations were organized by the World Bank in relation to
the preparation of the CPS. To prepare the CPS Progress Report, the World Bank also organized
consultations with civil society, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, other
donors, and the GoM. During the preparation of DPL/1, consultations were organized with
dedicated stakeholder focus groups in the context of the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
(PSIA). During the preparation of the DPL/2, additional consultations have taken place in the
context of a Social Plan in relation to Component A (Domestic Markets), the Political Economy
Analysis of the Irrigation Sector Reforms (June 2012), and as part of the gender analysis of the
DPL series (November 2012).

47.      Consultations highlighted some concerns related to the PMV, and identified possible
improvements. The following concerns were highlighted during the consultations: (i) large
number of intermediaries and lack of transparency in fruit, vegetable, and red meat value chains
contributing to relatively high consumer prices and low producer revenues; (ii) weak human and
technical capacity of producers and producer organizations constraining technology transfers and
access to finance; (iii) insecure land rights and land fragmentation limiting agricultural
investments; and (iv) unsustainable use of water resources. Suggestions included: (i) improving
financial support mechanisms for producers and producer organizations; (ii) developing strong
support structures for producers and producer organizations; (iii) strengthening the dialogue
between Government and professional organizations; and (iv) promoting efficient water use and
agricultural land management. The consultations confirmed the importance of the PMV and
relevance of the specific actions in the programmatic series, including modernizing domestic
marketing and distributions systems, improving the effectiveness of available public investment
support under Pillar II through increased transparency and accountability, strengthening
agricultural services to producers and producer organizations, and improving the sustainability of
irrigation water resources.

            IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

   A. LINKS TO THE CPS

48.      The proposed DPL contributes to the objectives of the World Bank Group’s
Morocco Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2010-2013 and to the shift in
emphasis of the World Bank program under the CPS progress report discussed by the
Board in June 2012. It addresses the three long term development challenges facing Morocco
identified in the CPS: (i) enhancing growth and employment; (ii) reducing social disparities; and
(iii) ensuring sustainability. By supporting the GoM’s pursuit of institutional and policy reforms
in relation to domestic markets, agricultural investments and services, and irrigation water
resources, it also contributes directly to the three thematic pillars around which the World Bank’s
program is structured: (i) growth, competitiveness, and employment; (ii) service delivery to
citizens; and (iii) sustainable development in a changing climate. Furthermore, all four
components of the DPL support the objectives of the CPS’s cross-cutting themes of governance

                                                18
and territoriality. The operation is fully consistent with the World Bank’s program going
forward, as discussed in the CPS Progress Report, allowing for continuity while also adhering to
the MENA Region’s strategy of “doing things differently? in the post-Arab Spring context. The
proposed DPL is also aligned with the World Bank’s framework for engagement in MENA, by
contributing to three of MENA’s strategic pillars: (i) promoting sustainable growth; (ii)
increasing social and economic inclusion; and (iii) strengthening governance. The DPL supports
the renewed focus of the CPS Progress Report on gender. In addition to a significant proportion
of female project beneficiaries, DPL/2 encourages the client to support enhanced participation
opportunities for women and has triggered MAPM to launch a comprehensive gender analysis of
the PMV in 2013.

     B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

49.     The World Bank and the IMF maintain a close collaboration in Morocco. Regular
exchanges between Fund and World Bank country teams are customary. Discussions focus on
the respective work programs, country priorities, recent developments and prospects, and reflect
the growing weight of DPLs in the World Bank’s Morocco portfolio. The Fund participates in
World Bank project review meetings where relevant. Similarly, World Bank staff was consulted
in the context of the IMF’s 2012 Article IV consultation with Morocco, which was concluded by
the IMF’s Executive Board on February 1, 2013. The IMF has also completed its first review of
Morocco’s performance under the economic program supported by the PLL arrangement
(approved on August 3, 2012 in an amount equivalent to US$6.2 billion) and reaffirmed
Morocco’s continued qualification to access PLL resources. The Public Information Notice
issued by the IMF on February 5, 2013 is provided in Annex 6.

50.      The World Bank works closely with other donors. The programmatic framework and
results indicators established by the Policy Matrix of the proposed DPL have been leveraged by
the MAPM to organize its work with other donors supporting the PMV. Though no joint
activities are foreseen under the programmatic series, the World Bank, IFC, EU, AfDB, FAO,
IFAD, MCC, AFD, KfW, BC, and USAID have been coordinating their respective preparation
and implementation activities on a bilateral basis to avoid overlaps and ensure coherence. The
financial and technical assistance programs thus developed by other donors in parallel to the
DPL series focus on financing (i) Pillar II projects focusing on specific agri-food chains and in
certain regions, and related institutional capacity-building efforts at central, regional, and local
level; (ii) institutional capacity-building and investments in sustainable natural resource
management; (iii) irrigation efficiency measures. The financial assistance programs take the form
of either project or budget support. The analytical and advisory needs related to the DPL
program identified in Annex 5 are being co-financed by the GoM, the World Bank and other
donors on a case by case basis. MAPM has been organizing yearly donor round tables to monitor
and evaluate progress with respect to implementing the PMV and enhance sector dialogue. In
parallel, regular meetings have been chaired on a rotating basis by donors involved in the PMV
program to discuss operational and topical questions related to their PMV support programs.




                                                19
     C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

51.      The proposed DPL/2 builds on recent World Bank operations in the agriculture and
agriculture-related sectors. The institutional and policy reforms supported under the proposed
DPL/2 aim to improve the efficiency of the domestic markets, the socio-economic impact of
projects directed to small farmers, the agricultural services, and the use and management of
irrigation water and the planning of irrigation infrastructures. The DPL/2 builds on the
experience of the DPL/1 as well as the Irrigation-based Community Development Project (DRI-
PMH), the Rainfed Agricultural Development Project (DRI-MVB), and the National Initiative
for Human Development (INDH) Project all of which have been supported by the World Bank.
The implementation of these projects highlighted important institutional and structural
constraints that need to be relaxed to effectively promote integrated rural development. It also
underlined the need for greater attention to the marketing aspects of agricultural development, as
well as the importance of support structures for producers and producer organizations. The
actions aimed at improving the use and management of irrigation water under the DPL series
include some of the actions originally foreseen under the irrigation water component of the
Water Sector DPL series launched in 2007. While the irrigation water component of this Water
Sector DPL series was completed successfully, the series was closed in 2009 after completion of
the first operation in the series due to the non-realization of prior actions related to sector
governance and integrated water resources management. The recently completed Public
Administration Reform Loan DPL (PARL) series strengthened the GoM’s overall public sector
management through improved budget management, human resources management, control of
the public payroll, and e-government. The MAPM has been actively engaged in the PARL
Performance based budget contracts between the central MAPM services and three pilot DRAs
(Gharb, Chaouïa, and Rabat) have been put in place for 2012 with World Bank technical
assistance. The remaining 13 DRAs are expected to follow suit.

52.     The DPL/2 will be complemented by other World Bank operations recently
approved or currently in the pipeline. The second INDH Program for Result operation, which
became effective in September 7, 2012, further strengthens the capacity of local Government,
civil society actors, and marginalized groups, to effectively participate in decision-making
processes at the local level. The Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF)/GEF grant for Integrating
Climate Change in the implementation of the PMV (PICCPMV), which became effective in
October 2011, is closely aligned with the DPL, supporting the integration of climate change
adaptation measures into selected Pillar II projects in five target Regions (Gharb, Chaouïa,
Rabat, Doukkala, and Tadla). Similarly, the proposed Social and Integrated Agriculture project
(ASIMA) to be financed under GEF-5 is expected to support land and biodiversity conservation
measures in selected Pillar II projects in marginal areas of two target Regions (Souss and
Marrakesh). The proposed Green Growth DPL (under preparation), which builds on the World
Bank’s analytical work on climate change mitigation and adaptation, will reinforce the actions
undertaken with respect to the sustainable use of land and water resources. The institutional and
policy reforms supported under the irrigation water component of the DPL will improve the
effectiveness and the sustainability of the investments financed within the framework of the
ongoing Oum-Er-Rbia Basin Irrigated Agriculture Modernization project aimed at the
modernization of irrigation systems and the improvement of farmers’ access to technology,
financing, and markets. Furthermore, the Second Education Sector DPL (under preparation)

                                               20
operations support human capital building in rural areas through improved effectiveness and
efficiency of service delivery and learning outcomes at the primary and lower secondary
education levels. Finally, the proposed First Competitiveness DPL (under preparation) and the
proposed Second Financial Sector DPL (under preparation) will contribute to an improved
business environment, which among others would benefit the agricultural and rural sectors.
While the First Competitiveness DPL seeks to improve the investment climate, further trade
policy reform and trade facilitation, and improve economic governance, the Second Financial
Sector DPL fosters household and SME access to financial services, increased financial stability,
supervision and regulation, and capital market development.

     D. LESSONS LEARNED

53.     A programmatic series of DPLs is the appropriate instrument for supporting the
implementation of systemic public sector reform programs in Morocco provided the
institutional environment is sufficiently mature for the proposed reforms. Programmatic
DPLs have become the GoM’s preferred instrument for implementing public sector-wide,
systemic reforms, as demonstrated by many of the past, ongoing, and pipeline World Bank
operations in the financial, public administration, solid waste, and education sectors.
Programmatic DPLs provide for the necessary flexibility in implementing a broad and complex
systemic reform program such as the one embedded in the PMV, while supporting the GoM’s
and stakeholders’ commitment to the implementation of the program over the medium term.
Furthermore, they establish an overall framework for coordinating other donor programs in the
sector. Provided the proposed reforms are sufficiently embraced by the Government, a
programmatic DPL is the right lending tool to support their implementation.

54.      Lessons learned from DPL/1 and applied to the preparation of DPL/2 include the
importance of close collaboration between the MAPM and World Bank teams and the
importance of flexibility. Success in the delivery of the DPL/2 operation comes from the
MAPM and WB teams working closely together to diagnose the constraints to the agriculture
sector and to jointly articulate a strategy to overcome them. Open and frank dialogue creates a
strong program with buy-in and trust on all sides. As a result, DPL/2 has been able to adhere
closely to its initial structure even as conditions have changed. The second year of the operation
saw significant slippage in two triggers: (i) wholesale market pilots (Component A); and; (ii)
irrigation tariff reform (Component D). By working closely together and being flexible the
World Bank has supported the GoM respond to the political risks inherent in these key reforms
and take advantage of opportunities as they presented themselves, such as the liberalization of
the domestic distribution of red meat and the restructuring of the irrigation utility statutes.

55.     Strong government-wide ownership and commitment are fundamental to a
successful implementation of systemic public sector reform programs. Realizing the
ambitious reform program laid down in the PMV will require the continuous mobilization of a
broad range of actors at both the political and technical levels of Government as well as various
sector stakeholders. The PMV reform agenda has the support of the highest levels of the State,
the Government and key sector stakeholders. In his statements delivered in June 2008 and April
2009, His Majesty King Mohamed VI highlighted the need to address the rural-urban gap by
promoting broad-based agriculture modernization and competitiveness, adapted to regional

                                               21
specificity, while taking into account water-resource constraints and preservation of the
environment. In addition, the PMV has been adopted as a government-wide agricultural
development strategy with financing secured through a multi-year agreement on the financing of
the PMV (2009-2015). Moreover, results-oriented ‘contract-programs’ embedded in the PMV
have been signed by the MAPM and key producer associations in 17 priority agri-food chains
and other relevant ministries specifying respective roles, responsibilities, and commitments. The
World Bank and the Ministry of General Affairs and Governance (MAGG) will continue to play
an important role facilitating inter-institutional coordination, in particular with respect to the
proposed reform programs related to domestic markets and irrigation water. Finally, Morocco’s
Advanced Association Status in the context of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is likely
to further promote and sustain reform momentum in the country as exemplified by the recently
adopted FTA on agricultural and fisheries products.

56.     Government efforts to promote integrated rural development can produce better
results by strengthening the links between the Government’s decentralized and
deconcentrated structures and increasing local capacity. The integrated rural development
approach promoted under the Stratégie 2020 de développement rural (2020 rural development
strategy), which had been adopted by the GoM in 1999, has been constrained by the complexity
of proposed projects, low technical capacity at the decentralized and deconcentrated government
levels, and insufficient accountability links between the decentralized and deconcentrated
services of the Government administration. In addition, the approach did not sufficiently take
into account the valorization and marketing aspects of agricultural development and necessary
support structures for producers and producer organizations. The PMV has taken this experience
into account by enhancing the governance and public financial management aspects of
agricultural investment support (Pillar II), providing training to increase local capacity,
encouraging greater local participation in decision making, and strengthening the links between
central and region services through the creation of specialized technical agencies such as ADA
and ONSSA.

57.      Investments in agricultural development must be accompanied by systemic reforms
that enable equitable and sustainable agricultural development. International experience
with agricultural development programs indicates that success depends on a variety of factors,
including: (i) suitable incentives for domestic market development and international trade; (ii)
strong agricultural institutions and the services to the rural population; and (iii) income
diversification and a vertical integration of production and marketing systems. The activities
supported under the DPL series seek to capitalize on these lessons by enabling producers to
better respond to opportunities in high value markets, to better take advantage of public
institutions and services, and to integrate themselves into the value chain.

58.     Agricultural land management reform is best supported with a targeted operation.
Agricultural land management was not incorporated in this DPL series because experience in
other regions has shown that agricultural land management programs are best supported under a
targeted operation led by the responsible line-Ministry. 14 Most land policy questions in Morocco


14
  See for example Albania Agricultural Services Project (ASP) 2001-2008 – Implementation Completion Report
(2008).

                                                     22
are under the authority of several ministries. Importantly, however, the contract farming model
used for the Pillar II investment program is successfully overcoming near-term land constraints.

     E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

59.     A large body of analytical work recently completed by the World Bank and other
multilateral organizations underpins the DPL series. Following the publication of the 2008
World Development Report Agriculture for Development, the World Bank conducted a sector-
wide diagnostic identifying key challenges and constraints facing the Moroccan agri-food sector
and outlining a series of policy recommendations in its Morocco Agricultural Sector Policy Note
(2009) and Morocco Agricultural Sector Review (2010). A similar exercise was conducted by
the World Bank at the regional level in the context of the report Improving Food Security in
Arab Countries (2009). An analysis of recent poverty trends in rural areas in Morocco is
provided by the World Bank’s Rural Poverty Policy Note (2010). The GoM’s past and current
agricultural trade policies have been reviewed in the World Bank’s Agricultural Trade Policy
Report (2010) and the WTO Trade Policy Review (2009), while a socio-economic impact
evaluation of agricultural market liberalization was conducted by the RuralStruc Study (2009).
Agricultural subsidy and support schemes were reviewed by the WTO Trade Policy Review
(2009) and an impact evaluation was conducted by the World Bank as part of the Opportunity
Cost Analysis of Morocco’s Cereal Policy (2009). All these analyses laid the ground for
Component A of the DPL series. Furthermore, key issues supporting the choice of focusing
Component B on small farmers were examined by the World Bank in its Case Study Review of
Contract-farming (2010), presented during a workshop on contract farming models organized by
the MAPM in January 2010, and its Land Market Development Study (2008). An assessment of
the climate change adaptation aspects of agricultural development was conducted by the World
Bank’s Study on Climate Change Impact on Moroccan Agriculture (2010), underpinning the
focus on agricultural innovation system under Component C. Territoriality and governance
questions were the subject of the World Bank’s Regional Development Study (2009) and Policy
Notes on Decentralization and De-concentration (2009), and Territorial Development (2009).

60.     This large body of analytical work highlights the potential linkages between the
DPL series and the reduction in rural poverty. Research outcomes underline that, despite the
sharp decrease in rural poverty observed between 2001 and 2007, persistent rural poverty and
vulnerability driven by low productivity subsistence agriculture, weak diversification, poor
human capital endowments and gender gaps, remain a significant development challenge for
Morocco. It stands out as the country with one of the largest inequalities in living standards
between urban and rural areas in MENA and among other countries with similar incomes per
capita and a high gender gap index, underscoring the magnitude and scope of disparities between
men and women. In the context of the PMV, the GoM has embarked on a process of market-
oriented agricultural investments and policy reforms. It aims to increase producer incomes and
create on- and off-farm employment by promoting high value crop production for both domestic
and export markets. At the same time, it seeks to maintain a minimum level of domestic
production in a number of strategic staple crops and other commodities through better targeted
public support measures. As highlighted in the 2008 World Development Report, supporting
agricultural growth and development can be an effective source of poverty alleviation in rural
areas. Success of the GoM’s new strategic direction, however, will critically depend upon

                                              23
producers’ capacity to respond to market price signals and integrate into modern domestic and
export-oriented market networks and value chains. At a minimum, this will require producers’
access to (public and private) investment capital and core public goods such as high quality
marketing infrastructure (as promoted under Component A of the DPL series) and adequate
agricultural services and support institutions, including research (as promoted under Component
C). Confidence between producers and market-oriented investors/traders will be reinforced, for
example through proper contract enforcement (as supported under Component B with reference
to the contract farming model). Furthermore, the strategy would need to ensure sustainable
resource management, in particular water, and take climate change risks into account (as
addressed under Component D).

61.      The reform agenda developed by the GoM for the agri-food sector is also the
product of extensive analytical work. The PMV was commissioned by the MAPM and
includes a diagnostic of national and international experience with agricultural development and
a roadmap outlining the ongoing agricultural investment program and policy reforms. The
MAPM also commissioned a study on municipal slaughterhouses identifying a series of priority
facilities to be upgraded, directly contributing to the design of Component A of the DPL series.
The MAPM’s Conseil général du développement agricole produced a report in May 2009 with
recommendations for the implementation of the Pillar II investment program of the PMV taking
into account the specific needs of smallholder agriculture in mountainous areas and oases, which
backs up the focus of Component B on smallholders in marginal areas. A series of studies
commissioned by the MAPM and other relevant Ministries concerning institutional reforms in
the areas of municipal fruit and vegetable wholesale markets, agricultural risks, extension and
advisory services, and irrigation water management PPPs, have been finalized, providing
important inputs to both Components A and D.

62.    Additional analytical and advisory work will continue to facilitate the
implementation of the proposed reforms. A list of analytical and advisory work to be carried
out during the preparation and implementation period of the second DPL is presented in Annex
5. The activities would be co-financed by the GoM, the World Bank, and other donors.
Importantly, the IFC has finalized a technical assistance program structured around two
components: (i) improving agricultural investment policies and promoting investments; and (ii)
improving the legal and institutional framework governing wholesale markets, thus in synergy
with Component A of the DPL series.

V.     THE PROPOSED SECOND DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN IN SUPPORT OF
                         THE PLAN MAROC VERT

     A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

63.     The proposed DPL series supports the implementation of the GoM’s PMV program
(2008-2020) by targeting supply and demand constraints to agricultural development. The
program development objective is to increase the agri-food sector’s productivity and
diversification with the goal of maintaining higher rates of agricultural growth and employment.




                                              24
64.     The DPL series is structured around four of the key cross-cutting policy and
institutional reform priorities identified in the PMV. Demand constraints to agricultural
development are covered by Component A (Domestic Markets) of the DPL program, and supply
constraints are covered under Components B (Agricultural Investment Support), Component C
(Agricultural Services), and Component D (Irrigation Water). The series aims at supporting the
achievement of four critical outcomes: (A) improve the efficiency of domestic markets; (B)
improve the socio-economic impacts of projects directed to small farmers; (C) improve
agricultural services; and (D) improve the use and management of irrigation water and the
planning of irrigation infrastructures.

65.     The proposed operation is the second in a programmatic series of two DPLs. The
GoM has asked for the World Bank’s financial and technical assistance to implement key cross-
cutting policy and institutional reforms identified in the PMV, including the governance and
public financial management structures of the agricultural investment program under Pillar II of
the PMV. The World Bank is well positioned to assist the GoM in implementing its agri-food
reforms in light of its experience in supporting the design and implementation of similar
operations in other regions. 15 In addition to sharing international best practices, World Bank
support of an inter-ministerial policy dialogue encourages collaboration and maximizes
development impact. The analytical and advisory needs identified in Annex 5 are co-financed by
the GoM, the World Bank, and other donors. A SCCF/GEF grant (US$4.35 million) focused on
integrating climate change adaptation in the implementation of the PMV (PICCPMV) is closely
aligned with the DPL series. If approved, the proposed GEF grant (US$6.44 million) for the
Social and Integrated agriculture (ASIMA) would further complement the DPL series by
supporting land and biodiversity conservation measures in marginal areas.

      B. POLICY AREAS

Component A. Domestic Markets

66.    The 38 municipal fruit and vegetable wholesale markets in Morocco are plagued by
decaying infrastructure, inadequate management, limited marketing services, and poor
sanitary conditions. The Charte communale, which is in the process of being revised with the
ongoing decentralization, stipulates that the communes have a monopoly on decisions regarding
the establishment and management of fruit and vegetable wholesale markets in their



16
  Annex 3 presents a comparison of the DPL/2 triggers envisioned under DPL/1 and the completed DPL/2 prior
actions.

                                                     26
jurisdictions. 17 Prices are in principle set by the market management and a fixed tax (redevance)
of seven percent on the gross sales value of each transaction is levied by the commune. The tax
is collected by intermediaries (mandataires) contracted by the communes, who retain a share of
the collected tax, while the remainder flows into the budget of the commune. 18 The lack of
uniform rules governing the operation of markets and the reinvestment of market revenues have
contributed to opaque management and poor physical condition of the markets.

67.     Dysfunctional domestic marketing and distribution systems for fruits and vegetables
result in high marketing costs, low producer incomes and high consumer prices, while
undermining incentives for quality. Current legislation prohibits farmers and traders from
selling directly to retailers in urban communes. They are obliged instead to market their produce
through the fruit and vegetable wholesale market of the commune where the retailer is located. 19
But farmers, especially small ones, often lack the resources to transport their products to distant
wholesale markets. As a result, their produce is often first traded in a wholesale market closer to
the farm where a seven percent tax is levied, then marketed through a second wholesale market
(where an another seven percent tax is levied) of the commune where the retailer is located. The
current system depresses producer revenues and inflates consumer prices, both of which hurt the
poor disproportionately. It also reduces competitiveness, undermines incentive for value
addition, constrains producers’ integration in value chains, and distorts domestic trade flows.

68.     The weak services of wholesale markets have pushed many producers to market
their produce through informal channels. The MAPM has estimated that currently only 30-50
percent of the domestic fruit and vegetable production flows through the municipal wholesale
markets, with the remainder being diverted into informal markets that do not have the necessary
logistical platforms to preserve and/or improve product quality.

69.     The existing distortions combined with trade liberalization in the agriculture sector
could put local producers at a further disadvantage when it comes to the domestic market.
The gradual trade liberalization foreseen under the agricultural FTA with the EU could put
domestic producers in an increasingly disadvantageous position since importers are allowed to
market imported produce directly to retailers after paying the fixed transaction tax of seven
percent at the wholesale market of entry. Thus large modern retail operations may ultimately find
it less expensive to source high quality fresh fruits and vegetables outside the country than
within, because the transactions costs are lower.

70.     The domestic red meat marketing and distribution system faces similar challenges.
With the exception of fully prepared cuts, wholesalers cannot market meat directly to retailers if
the meat does not originate from the municipally owned slaughterhouse located at the point of
retail sale. 20 While communes are responsible for the overall maintenance of municipal
slaughterhouses, the slaughtering of animals and meat cutting are generally conducted by a large

number of small, private businesses run by chevillards. The latter typically purchase animals
from farmers and transport them to municipal slaughterhouses, where they slaughter the animals
and sell the meat to local butchers. Various municipal taxes are levied at the slaughterhouses and
enter the general budget of the commune, including a taxe d’abattage, taxes accessories for
complementary services offered by the slaughterhouse, and a surtaxe d’abattage au profit de la
bienfaisance. 21 In addition, a taxe spéciale de sauvegarde du cheptel is levied, which enters into
the FDA. While the level of the taxe spéciale is established by the Finance Law, the other tax
levels are established by municipal councils and thus vary from commune to commune. As with
fruit and vegetable wholesale markets, there are no mandatory reinvestments of slaughterhouse
revenues and no uniform rules for their operation. As a result, slaughterhouses generally suffer
from outdated infrastructure and equipment, inappropriate locations, inadequate services, and
sub-standard sanitary conditions. In addition to encouraging illegal slaughtering practices in the
informal market, these various constraints negatively affect producer revenues, consumer prices,
product quality and safety conditions, and domestic trade flows.

71.    The objective of Component A is to improve the efficiency of domestic markets by
reducing marketing costs and improving marketing services through the modernization of
fruit and vegetable markets and slaughterhouses. To this end, the DPL series supports the
following two institutional reforms:
    • Improve the institutional and regulatory framework governing fruit and vegetable
       wholesale markets
    • Improve the institutional and regulatory framework governing slaughterhouses

72.      These reforms are part of a process of institutional change that is projected to have
a major impact on Moroccan producers and consumers, as well as enabling the sector to
function more efficiently in the domestic market and to compete more effectively in the
international market. The impact of the reforms will take time to materialize because the
process of change involves many actors both in the central Government and in the municipalities
that traditionally have played a large role in regulating marketing at the local level. The legal and
institutional reform process is expected to be supported under the technical assistance program
currently being undertaken by the IFC.

A.1. Improve the institutional and regulatory framework governing fruit and vegetable
wholesale markets

73.    A national strategy and action plan for the restructuring of fruit and vegetable
wholesale marketing has been adopted by the key ministerial stakeholders. Following a
comprehensive national fruit and vegetable wholesale markets study, the MAPM, MICNT, and
MI, adopted a national strategy and action plan under DPL/1 for the restructuring of fruit and
vegetable wholesale marketing (Schéma national d’orientation des marchés de gros de fruits et
légumes). The Schéma national d’orientation includes: (i) an overall plan for wholesale markets
(Schéma d’implantation des marchés de gros) that takes into account the projected evolution of
domestic production, consumption, and trade trends until 2020; (ii) identification of viable
wholesale market ownership and management models, including required institutional and

regulatory adjustments; and (iii) necessary accompanying measures for the implementation of
the Schéma national d’orientation.

74.     New ownership and management models for fruit and vegetable wholesale markets
are being piloted on the basis of the Schéma national d’orientation to inform and build
momentum for the necessary institutional and regulatory reforms. Following the adoption of
the Schéma national d’orientation, the MI started to examine a possible revision of the status of
the intermediaries (mandataires) and the development of a draft Law (Dahir). In addition, three
pilot projects have been identified in rural areas that will introduce new ownership and
management models for fruit and vegetable wholesale markets. The pilot projects comprise the
Rabat, Meknès, and Berkane municipalities. The objective of the pilots is to demonstrate the
effect of potential win-win arrangements among local stakeholders. Generally, the pilots are
expected to modernize wholesale market infrastructure and services, and to pursue improved
management of the facilities by attracting private operators through public–private partnerships.
New options for payment and taxation systems are being developed, including the replacement
of the current fixed tax (redevance) of seven percent applied to the gross sales value of each
transaction conducted on the wholesale markets with a service-based fee system. Under DPL/2,
the signing of one agreement with local governments for launching the pilot projects has been
pursued. This convention is a precondition for a successful introduction of new ownership and
management models and accompanying institutional and regulatory reforms.

75.   The prior action for DPL/2 is: The agreement between the municipality of Berkane,
MAPM, and MI introducing a new management model in the Berkane fruit and vegetable
wholesale market, has been signed on February 14, 2013 22

76.     The expected result for this reform is the successful introduction of a new ownership
and management model for fruit and vegetable wholesale markets, including the introduction of
a service-based payment system. This result will be measured through the number of fruit and
vegetable wholesale markets under new management models launched.

A.2. Improve the institutional and regulatory framework governing slaughterhouses

77.     New ownership and management models for slaughterhouses are promoted under
the DPL series to improve the management of slaughterhouse infrastructure and services.
The ‘contract program’ for the red meat agri-food chain foresees the launching of eight
integrated projects (projets intégrés) driven by private entrepreneurs in the period 2010–2014.
Two integrated projects have already been launched by private investors with support of the
MAPM and ONSSA, and three more are under preparation. In addition, under DPL/1 ONSSA
has adopted the norms for sanitary and hygienic management of private slaughterhouses (Cahier
des prescriptions).The MAPM and ONSSA conducted a study of municipally owned
slaughterhouses that identified 12 priority slaughterhouses for modernization. The management
of these slaughterhouses will be delegated to private operators through concessions. Three

22
  Under DPL/1 the DPL/2 trigger for A.1 was: Three conventions will be signed between local government and
relevant ministerial departments for implementing fruit and vegetable wholesale market pilot projects introducing
new management models. While the prior action in DPL/2 focuses on only one pilot project in Berkane, the
objective to test new management models is still achieved.

                                                        29
municipal slaughterhouses have been identified by the MAPM and ONSSA as potential pilot
projects for introducing concession models. Pre-feasibility studies of these three pilot projects
have been realized with FAO technical support.

78.     Liberalization of the domestic red meat market. As initially envisioned, this reform
was to occur in a stepwise fashion, with concessions of municipal slaughterhouses to be
eventually followed the removal of municipal re-inspection requirements. Results achieved have
gone far beyond expectations. The prior action on the inter-ministerial adoption of a Cahier des
prescriptions for municipal slaughterhouses, as identified during the preparation of the DPL/1,
has been completed under DPL/2 but also superseded by the issuance of an inter-ministerial
decree allowing for the free passage of red meat in communes. This decree effectively allows
appropriately certified private suppliers to deliver carcasses to retailers without mandatory re-
inspection at municipal slaughterhouses.

79.       The prior actions for DPL/2 are:
      •   The specifications for technical, administrative and contractual requirements for
          operating municipal slaughterhouse concessions have been adopted by inter-ministerial
          decision No. 59 of MAPM and MI dated October 16, 2012
      •   Decree No. 2-12-612 dated December 4, 2012, amending and completing the Order
          (Arrêté) dated September 28, 1955 on control over hygiene and cleanliness of market
          meats, and the associated Order (Arrêté) No. 3466-12 dated December 4, 2012 issued by
          MAPM and MI, on the conditions of the entry and selling of market meats, have been
          published in the National Gazette No. 6115 dated January 7, 2013 23

80.     The expected result of this reform is the successful promotion of a new ownership and
management model for slaughterhouses, with reductions in: (i) the number of intermediaries in
the red-meat agri-food chain, (ii) reinspection taxes, and (iii) the size of the informal sector. This
result will be measured through: (i) number of private slaughterhouses launched; and (ii) number
of slaughterhouse concessions under new management model launched.

Component B. Agricultural Investment Support

81.      Implementing the PMV’s agricultural investment program directed to small
farmers (Pillar II) has posed significant governance and public financial management
challenges. ADA was established in 2008 to manage and monitor the implementation of the
Pillar II (and Pillar I) investment program. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms have been put
in place, but must be further improved and strengthened. The Pillar II (and Pillar I) projects
included in the PARs were largely developed by the DRAs and DPAs in consultation with
potential beneficiaries. However, stakeholder consultations prior to the launch of the DPL series
revealed important information needs on how potential beneficiaries can access available
investment support and underlined the key role MAPM’s support structures, agrégateurs, and
other sector stakeholders play in assisting potential beneficiaries in this process. In this context,
the de-concentration at the level of the DRAs of the decision-making processes as regards the

23
  Under DPL/1 there was only one DPL/2 trigger for A.2. This second prior action under A.2 in DPL/2
demonstrates the GoM’s desire to go above and beyond what was originally envisioned and that the GoM is
committed to improving the institutional and regulatory framework governing slaughterhouses.

                                                      30
identification and implementation of Pillar II projects, though important, should be reinforced to
bring the agricultural investment program’s governance structures closer to beneficiaries and
ensure the participation of all relevant stakeholders in the decision-making processes. Pillar II
projects are financed through the general budget, grants, and loans from national and
international donors, the Hassan II Fund for Economic Social and Development, and
contributions from the Rural Development Fund (FDR) (while Pillar I is largely financed
through the private sector with the support of the FDA). Of the 1,500 projects envisaged under
the PMV, 325 Pillar II projects representing 10.3 billion MAD are currently being implemented
(in addition to 134 Pillar I projects representing 28.6 billion MAD).

82.     The sustainability of Pillar II projects largely depends on the success of the
proposed contract farming (agrégation) model. As outlined in Section III, value creation
should be achieved through a voluntary aggregation of farmers (agrégés) around private
investors, OPA, traders, and/or entrepreneurs (agrégateurs). Public investment support provided
under Pillar II serves primarily to leverage the private investment resources required to cover the
remaining investment costs and is conditioned on the conclusion of tri-lateral contractual
arrangements between agrégateurs, agrégés, and the GoM. This contract farming model is
intended to help overcome existing land constraints, promote farmer organizations, support risk-
sharing, optimize production and marketing links, and enable producers’ access to finance,
knowledge, and technologies. International experience suggests that the success of such vertical
integration critically depends on a sufficient level of trust between agrégateurs and agrégés to
enter into a mutually beneficial contractual relationship.

83.    The objective of Component B is to improve the socio-economic impacts of projects
directed to small farmers. To this end, the DPL series supports the following two institutional
reforms:
    • Improve the governance and public financial management of projects directed to small
       farmers
    • Establish a legal and institutional framework to support contract farming

B.1. Improve the governance and public financial management of projects directed to small
farmers

84.     Good governance and public financial management rules for the Pillar II
investment program have been strengthened. International experience shows that
transparency and stakeholder participation are critical to the effectiveness of publicly financed
projects. The transparency of ADA’s governance and public financial management systems for
the Pillar II investment program has improved with the development and wide dissemination
under DPL/1 of operational manuals that outline the procedures for: (i) prioritizing the use of
budget allocations for implementing Pillar II projects; and (ii) preparing, submitting, and
implementing Pillar II projects. In addition, an internet-based project monitoring and evaluation
system of the implementation of Pillar II projects has been established at the central (ADA) and
regional level (DRAs). It functions on the basis of clearly established baseline indicators and
reporting requirements. To these ends, a monitoring and evaluation framework based on results
indicators for each individual Pillar II project has been developed.


                                                31
85.      Stakeholder participation in the decision-making process for the Pillar II investment
program has been enhanced. Under the proposed operation, accountability has been further
improved by supporting stakeholder participation in the decision-making processes related to the
identification of Pillar II projects. Fifty-four stakeholder-based provincial committees (45 DPAs
and 9 ORMVAs) have been created to be responsible for preselecting Pillar II project proposals.
The committees would include MAPM’s de-concentrated services and are complemented by
sector representatives (OPAs, Regional Chambers of Agriculture), research institutions, and
provincial government representatives on an as needed basis. Some OPAs in agri-food chains
such as argan have majority female members, facilitating greater participation of women
associations and cooperatives in project selection. The de-concentration of the Pillar II project
selection committees has increased the percent of new Pillar II projects proposed by OPAs from
15 to 37 percent from 2010 to 2012. An internal regulation specifying the internal decision-
making procedures of the provincial technical committees have been developed by ADA. In
addition, the MAPM has developed a circular stipulating that all project documents pertaining to
Pillar II projects, including procurement packages, would have to be made public at the level of
each Center of Works (Centre des travaux, CT). 24

86.     The prior action for DPL/2 is: Fifty-four pre-selection technical committees for projects
directed to small farmers at the de-concentrated level, have been established by MAPM in 2012

87.     The expected result of this reform is increased participation, transparency,
accountability, and gender equality in the decision-making and implementation process of Pillar
II projects as operational procedures are formally established and disseminated, local
stakeholders participate in the project identification process, and monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms are put in place. This result will be measured through the percent of new Pillar II
projects submitted by the OPAs.

B.2. Establish a legal and institutional framework supporting contract farming

88.      The Decree governing public support of contract farming (Agrégation) projects
under Pillar II have been promulgated. Contract farming has two important positive effects:
(i) it improves the efficiency of the investments by encouraging integration rather than isolated
initiatives; and (ii) it facilitates the incorporation of small farmers into modern integrated value-
chains managed by the private sector. The GoM allocated resources for Pillar II projects for a
total of 830 million MAD for 2011. In this framework, the signing of the multi-year agreement
on the financing of the PMV (2009-2015) by the MAPM and the MEF, the circular regarding
budget installment and transfer procedures for financing Pillar II projects, and FDR contributions
to Pillar II projects have been important achievements, and has resulted in an increase in the
percent of small farmers benefiting from Pillar II projects from 5 percent in 2010 to over 25
percent in 2012. In addition, the Decree and implementing regulations (Arrêtés) on Government
support of aggregation projects have been published under DPL/1. 25

89.     A legal and regulatory framework for contract farming has been put in place.
Creating an enabling environment for contract farming is critical for the effective involvement of
small farmers in domestic markets. A law on contract farming has been published in the National
Gazette in July 2012. The Law facilitates the implementation of the contract farming model
underlying the Pillar I and Pillar II investment support program. It provides a framework for
contracts and the establishment of special courts for resolving contract-related disputes between
agregés and agrégateurs, ultimately creating a basis for their contractual relationships. A draft
Implementing Decree (Décret d’application) has been prepared by ADA and submitted to the
MAPM’s Directorate for Legal and Administrative Affairs for review. Upon validation by the
Directorate, the draft Implementing Decree will be submitted to the General Secretariat of the
Government (SSG).

90.     The prior action for DPL/2 is: Law No. 04/12 on contract farming has been published
in the National Gazette No. 6070 dated August 2, 2012 26

91.     The expected result of this reform is the institutionalization of the incentives granted to
small farmers in the framework of the contract farming. This result will be measured through the
percent of small farmers benefitting from Pillar II support.

Component C. Agricultural Services

92.      A disjointed public agricultural innovation system constrains technology transfers
to farmers. In addition to the human capital constraints outlined in section II, the effective
transfer of technologies to farmers is limited by a public agricultural innovation system that is
underfunded and understaffed and lacks formal coordination of research, training and extension
activities. The allocation of funds to research programs and extension activities has typically
been based on interactions between and within the different layers of the public administration.
Producers, particularly smallholders, have limited participation in the decision-making process.
Only a few producer organizations perform research and extension activities. The public
extension and advisory service delivered by MAPM reaches only a small share of the total
agricultural population. These trends in the public agricultural innovation system are
counterbalanced to some extent by the increase in private operators—including input suppliers
and exporters—that are expanding their field presence to engage in research and extension
activities aimed at improving their profitability.

93.     International food safety and quality standards will become increasingly important
determinants of competitiveness. Following the adoption of the new food safety law and the
signing of the agricultural FTA with the EU, Moroccan producers and processors need to meet
stringent international food quality standards in order to take advantage of high value export
markets opportunities and to compete effectively with foreign imports on the increasingly
demanding domestic market. The rules-based food control system that focuses on final food
products is shifting to a modern risk-based system underpinned by self-monitoring by producers
and processors across the value chain. The public plant health and veterinary services, under the

26
  Under DPL/1 the DPL/2 trigger for B.2 was: A draft law on contract farming will be submitted to Government for
approval. The prior action completed under DPL/2 goes above and beyond what was originally envisioned by
publishing the law in the National Gazette.

                                                      33
aegis of the Food Safety Agency (ONSSA), will have a key role in helping producers and
processors adjust to international food safety and quality standards such as the Hazard Analysis
and Critical Control Point (HACCP) and International Standards Organization (ISO). In addition,
they would need to encourage compliance with these standards by separating their risk
assessment, risk management, and risk communications functions. The information generated
from food safety risk assessments will be used to evaluate available strategies for risk
management. Risk communication requires the interactive exchange of information throughout
this process among risk assessors, risk managers, and sector stakeholders.

94.   The objective of Component C is to improve agricultural services. To this end, the
DPL series supports the following two institutional reforms:
    • Improve the effectiveness of the agricultural innovation system
    • Establish an effective food safety control system

C.1. Improve the effectiveness of the agricultural innovation system

95.      The program builds on a series of actions taken by the MAPM since the adoption of
the PMV. The MAPM reorganized its decentralized services by establishing 16 Regional
Agricultural Directorates (DRA), which now oversee the Ministry services at the provincial
(DPA) and local level (CT). The regional and provincial agricultural directorates prepared, in
consultation with sector stakeholders, 16 Regional Agricultural Plans (PARs) including
territorial-based agricultural project proposals (Pillar I and II), which have been adopted by the
regional councils. The MAPM also signed results-oriented ‘contract programs’ with 17 priority
agri-food chains on the basis of the PARs, both of which are subject to annual reviews. In
addition, the previous 37 Chambres d’agriculture have been restructured into 16 Chambres
régionales d’agriculture and the National Institute for Agronomic Research (Institut national de
la recherche agronomique, INRA) has established six additional research centers to ensure its
presence in each region in Morocco. The DPL series builds on these reforms by supporting four
levels of the agricultural innovation system, including: (i) the decision-making process regarding
the strategic orientation of agricultural research, extension, and training activities at the national
and regional levels; (ii) the financing mechanism for agricultural research; (iii) the organization
of the extension and advisory services system; and (iv) local capacity-building.

96.     The MAPM’s funding mechanism for applied research has been improved and
expanded to include research and development to promote demand-driven agricultural
innovation partnerships and to ensure the effective transfer of new technologies. The
circular governing the MAPM’s funding mechanism for applied research has been amended so
that project proposals for both applied research and research and development are selected
competitively according to established procedures and transparent criteria. Decisions on funding
of proposals will be taken by the National Coordination Committee for Research and
Development, established on October 20, 2011 and composed of representatives of the MAPM,
INRA, higher education bodies (IAV 27 and ENA 28), ONSSA, Association of Chambers of
Agriculture, and other professional associations. Financing under the amended Circular is
conditioned on: (i) partnership agreements between different parts of the agricultural innovation

system; and (ii) formal arrangements for the transfer of the newly developed technologies to
beneficiaries. The expansion of the competitive funding mechanism with research and
development projects was not foreseen at the start of the DPL series. It is expected that public
funds for applied research and research and development projects will thus be allocated in a
more efficient and demand-driven way, reinforce links between (public and private) research and
education institutions, farmers and farmer organizations, and (public and private) extension and
advisory services, and ensure transfer of results to farmers. A budget of 7 million MAD for the
competitive funding mechanism was included in the 2013 Finance Law, and currently all nine of
the ongoing research and extension projects are funded by the competitive financing mechanism.

97.      Regional Coordination Committees for Research and Development have been
established to formalize and promote cooperation between the various actors in the
regional agricultural innovation system and inform the priority research themes to be
financed under the reformed competitive funding mechanism. The regional committees
include representatives of the DRAs, INRA, Chambres régionales d’agriculture, and other
professional associations. They represent institutionalized mechanisms for coordinating regional
agricultural innovation activities among public, private, and civil society actors. The committees
are responsible for coordinating the overall planning and implementation of development
activities, including Pillar I and Pillar II projects envisaged by the PARs. This would improve the
decision-making process for defining priorities in research and development, applied research,
extension, and training, as well coordination of implementation. An internal regulation
specifying the internal decision-making procedures governing the National Coordination
Committee and the Regional Coordination Committees has been validated in September 2012.

98.     A pluralistic approach to delivering agricultural advisory services would be
implemented to diversify and improve the quality of extension and advisory services
offered to farmers. The MAPM has prepared a National Agricultural Advisory Services
Strategy which proposes a mixed (public and private) integrated system for delivering
agricultural advisory services to farmers. In this context, the MAPM envisages: (i) setting-up a
system of private agricultural advisors (Conseillers agricoles); and (ii) creation of a National
Agency for Agricultural Advisory Services (ONCA). The Law No. 58/12 establishing the
National Agency for Agricultural Advisory Service was resubmitted to the Government and
adopted by the First Chamber in July 2012 and by the Second Chamber in November 2012. A
study aimed at further defining the institutional arrangements governing the ONCA is under
preparation. It is expected to help further clarify the division of labor between the ONCA and the
existing public institutions delivering agricultural advisory services (ORMVA/CDAs, DPAs,
CTs, CRPII), the recently established Chambres régionales d’agriculture and private agricultural
advisors (Conseillers agricoles). The Conseillers agricoles will be contracted by the MAPM,
producer organizations, and private firms to provide a broad range of services (e.g., rural
mobilization, extension, advisory). By 2012, over 50 extension advisory service contracts with
the private sector had been issued.

99.       The prior actions for DPL/2 are:
      •   The National Coordination Committee for Agricultural Research, Extension, and
          Training Activities has been established by MAPM on October 20, 2011 and the sixteen
          Regional Coordination Committees for Agricultural Research, Extension, and Training

                                                35
         Activities have been established by MAPM with uniform rules of operation in 2011 and
         2012
     •   The National Agricultural Advisory Services Strategy and Action Plan for Delivering
         Agricultural Advisory Services, and the associated sixteen regional action plans, have
         been adopted by MAPM on March 9, 2011 and May 9, 2012, respectively

100. Expected results of this reform are: (i) improved effectiveness of the system of
agricultural research and development thanks to better coordination and synergies between
stakeholders; and (ii) reinforced capacity of stakeholders, including farmers, to design and
implement Pillar II projects. These results will be measured through: (i) percent of research and
extension projects funded through the competitive financing mechanism; (ii) number of
extension advisory services contracted to the private sector; and (iii) number of training days per
category of actor, of which percent for women.

C.2. Establish an effective food safety control system

101. The GoM has put in place a legal and institutional food safety framework in line
with international standards. Under DPL/1, a new food safety law 29 was promulgated in
March 2010 that reflects existing international principles on risk analysis, in particular the
standards and codes of the Codex Alimentarius Commission. 30 In addition, the Government
created ONSSA to bring all administrative structures involved in food safety and quality
controls 31 in a single body. 32 The underlying approach has been food risk analysis in its three
constituent components: risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. Following
the model already in place for the delivery of some veterinary services such as compulsory
vaccination campaigns, ONSSA expanded the sub-contracting of some advisory and inspection
functions to accredited private service providers while maintaining overall responsibility for
resolving disputes and ensuring a high quality and transparent system. Thanks to the renewed
emphasis on institutional food safety, there has been a 100 percent increase in the number of
HACCP-certified agri-food processing units, totaling 600.

102. Implementing texts of the new food safety law would be adopted and cost recovery
mechanisms for certain food safety services would be introduced. The implementing texts
foreseen under the new food safety law, including its implementing Decree and the associated
implementing regulations (Arrêtés), would determine: (i) technical conditions that
establishments, including slaughterhouses, must satisfy for approval of their activities; (ii) the

   The Codex Alimentarius is a collection of internationally recognized standards, codes of practice, guidelines and
other recommendations relating to foods, food production and food safety. Its texts are developed and maintained by
the Codex Alimentarius Commission, a body that was established in 1963 by the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The WTO Agreement on the Application
of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures uses the Codex Alimentarius as an important reference to determine the
limits within which a member country can adopt food safety, animal health and plant protection measures that have
an impact on international trade.

modalities of the implementation of self-control and traceability systems; and (iii) labeling
requirements. In addition, a system introducing cost recovery mechanisms for certain sanitary
and/or phytosanitary services (such as certification of seeds and seedlings, diagnosis, disease
control, and livestock identification) would be implemented.

103.   The prior actions for DPL/2 are:
   •   Decree No. 2-10-473 dated September 6, 2011 implementing Law No. 28/07 on the
       sanitary safety of food products, has been published in the National Gazette No. 5984
       dated October 6, 2011, and four associated implementing Orders (Arrêtés) have been
       submitted for approval by MAPM to the Secretary General of the Government in 2012
   •   The cost-recovery system for veterinary and food products safety services has been
       adopted by inter-ministerial decision of MAPM and MEF dated August 30, 2011

104. Expected results of this reform are to improve management of food safety risks and
enhance international competitiveness. This result will be measured through: (i) number of
HACCP-certified agri-food processing establishments; and (ii) percent of shipments of
Moroccan food and agricultural export products refused by the EU on sanitary grounds.

Component D. Irrigation Water

105. Improved use and management of irrigation water will be critical for Moroccan
agriculture. The agricultural sector accounts for 85 percent of water withdrawals in Morocco
and faces an increasing water deficit due to mounting water scarcity and rising competition from
urban, industrial, and tourism sectors. In addition, irrigation practices dominated by surface
irrigation and deficient water service contribute to low water valorization (the average value-
added of irrigation water is 1.63 MAD/m3, which is well below its potential of 4 MAD/m3). An
important pillar of the GoM’s strategy of reducing current and future water deficits while
increasing the productivity of irrigated agriculture is to improve water management at the level
of farmers and service providers as well as water infrastructure planning at the level of the State.
Farmers need to rationalize water use based on market costs and benefits with the ultimate goal
of putting water to its highest valued use. Service providers need to reduce losses and improve
the quality of service delivery. Service delivery is constrained by a combination of factors
including: tariffs below operations and maintenance (O&M) costs (average cost recovery rate is
76 percent); collection rates lower than targeted in some ORMVAs (Gharb and Loukkos),
generating important arrears; water revenues not exclusively allocated to the water service
(hence, no relationship between tariff increases and service improvement); poor maintenance due
to insufficient budget; long procedures for procurement and staff recruitment; and constraining
mechanisms for allocating water to farmers. Coordination of investment planning and financing
between government institutions involved in the water and irrigation sector is insufficient,
resulting in a persistent gap between water mobilization capacity through dam storage and area
irrigated (108,000 ha of land located downstream of dams could be irrigated but is not equipped
with irrigation infrastructure).

106. Climate change is likely to exacerbate water scarcity in the longer run. In the
majority of river basins in Morocco, withdrawals from multiple aquifers already exceed
renewable groundwater amounts, and water resources are expected to decrease even more as a

                                                37
consequence of climate change. Recent studies suggest that Morocco may experience gradually
increasing aridity because of higher temperatures as well as lower and more volatile
precipitation. This could result in a more pronounced overexploitation of groundwater and a
decrease in the availability of surface water for irrigation, with significant variability among river
basins. These changes are expected to negatively affect agricultural yields and increase the
volatility of agricultural production.

107. The GoM adopted a National Program of Irrigation Water Conservation (PNEEI)
to help address these challenges. The PNEEI forms an integral part of the PMV. The program
aims to improve agricultural revenues by supporting the conversion to more efficient irrigation
technologies and practices as well as a better valorization at both the production and marketing
level. It supports the conversion of an estimated 555,000 hectares of surface and sprinkler
irrigation to drip irrigation, including 220,000 hectares in Large Scale Irrigation (LSI) areas
(collective conversion) and 335,000 hectares in private irrigation areas (individual conversion).
The PNEEI is structured around five components: (i) collective modernization at the level of public
schemes including off-farm and on-farm irrigation equipment; (ii) individual modernization at the level
of private farms; (iii) improving agricultural valorization at both the production and marketing level;
(iv) enhancing technical support for farmers, irrigation service providers, and equipment suppliers;
and (v) other support measures. Upon completion of the program, the total irrigated area with
drip irrigation is expected to cover close to 50 percent of the surface equipped for irrigation.

108. The objective of Component D is to improve the use and management of irrigation
water and the planning of irrigation infrastructures. To this end, the DPL series supports the
following three institutional reforms:
    • Improve the application efficiency of farmers’ water use while preserving aquifers’
       sustainability
    • Improve the performance of irrigation service operators
    • Improve irrigation infrastructure planning by the Government

D.1. Improve the application efficiency of farmers’ water use while preserving aquifers’
sustainability

109. Monitoring of groundwater abstraction will be reinforced to improve the
sustainability of irrigated agriculture. The GoM has significantly improved the incentive
framework for the development of drip irrigation by introducing substantial subsidy increases for
the acquisition of on-farm drip irrigation equipment. However, international experience suggests
that deployment of drip irrigation by itself does not necessarily encourage conservation unless
accompanied by an effective monitoring and control of water resources abstraction, especially
for groundwater. In Morocco, surface water (a large part of which is stored in dams) is controlled
by river basin agencies (RBAs). This helps to ensure that, in dry years, surface water demand is
adjusted to surface water availability by reduction of irrigated areas. However, groundwater is
directly abstracted by private farmers with almost no control by RBAs despite a water law that
requires water users to register their wells and apply for an abstraction authorization. Hence,
groundwater abstraction is currently much higher than the renewable volume in most aquifers.
Current support to improve the efficiency of farmers’ water application through conversion to
drip irrigation is complemented by efforts to enhance the knowledge and monitoring of

                                                  38
groundwater abstraction. The regulations set by the GoM to support drip irrigation were
amended under DPL/1 in order to condition the disbursement to farmers of subsidies for drip
irrigation to the installation of meters on their wells and the registration of their wells to the RBA
in view of obtaining an abstraction authorization. Since 2010, an additional 17,000 farmers have
participated in collective reconversion to drip irrigation and there has been a 67 percent increase
in the number of declarations and authorization of groundwater abstraction. Ultimately, the
combination of these two measures will contribute to enabling the GoM to monitor groundwater
exploitation and, consequently, to improve the sustainability of irrigated agriculture using
groundwater. To be effective, these measures should be complemented by the enhancement of
RBAs’ capacity to monitor and police groundwater abstraction. The World Bank and other
donors are supporting the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment (MEMEE) and
RBAs through capacity enhancement projects. 33

110. Farmers’ financial contribution to investments in the modernization of off-farm
irrigation systems would be reduced to promote the conversion to more efficient irrigation
in Large Scale Irrigation (LSI) areas. Experience over the last decade shows that conversion to
drip irrigation is developed mainly in areas where groundwater is accessible, generally outside of
LSI perimeters. The PNEEI aims to develop drip irrigation in LSI perimeters as well, with an
objective of 220,000 ha to be converted by 2025 by replacing open canals networks with
pressurized pipelines systems. The Agricultural Investment Code of 1969 established that
farmers in LSI have to financially contribute to the Government investment efforts through
“direct participation? covering 40 percent of the cost of the initial investment in new off-farm
irrigation infrastructure, but this “direct participation? was waived for agricultural properties of
less than five hectares or for the first five hectares of agricultural properties of less than 20
hectares. In 1997, the Law No. 23/97 amended the Agricultural Investment Code to remove the
waiver for smallholders and to introduce provisions to require all farmers (including
smallholders) to cover the costs of subsequent modernizations. In this way, after 1997, all
farmers in LSI had to cover 40 percent of the cost of modernized off-farm irrigation
infrastructure. This hindered farmers (especially smallholders) participation in collective
conversion projects planned by the Government as part of PNEEI implementation. DPL/2
supports an amendment to the Law No. 23/97 to restore the provisions of the Agricultural
Investments Code which exonerated of “direct participation? smallholders and beneficiaries of
rehabilitation and modernization investments, in order to encourage farmers’ participation in
collective conversion projects. An amendment to the Law 23/97 has been prepared by the
MAPM and submitted to the General Secretariat of the Government (SGG). “Direct
participation? rates will be determined by the by-laws.

111. The prior action for DPL/2 is: The draft Law amending Law No. 23/97 on farmers’
financial contribution to the costs of modernizing off-farm irrigation systems, has been submitted
by MAPM to the Secretary General of the Government on October 9, 2012

112. The expected results of this reform are: (i) the improved monitoring of groundwater
abstraction in areas where drip irrigation is developed; and (ii) the facilitation of the conversion

33
   These include the ongoing USD1 million PHRD Grant TF092827 for "Strengthening Capacity to Adapt to
Climate Change Impacts on Water Management in the Oum er Rbia Basin Project", and the GIZ – AGIRE program
to support Integrated Water Resources Management in Morocco.

                                                   39
to drip irrigation in LSI areas. These results will be measured through: (i) percentage increase in
the number of declarations received of groundwater abstraction points and the number of
authorizations delivered for groundwater abstraction; and (ii) cumulative number of farmers
participating in projects of collective conversion to drip irrigation.

D.2. Improve the performance of irrigation service operators

113. In 2004, with support from the World Bank, the GoM prepared a reform of LSI
service providers aimed at delegating irrigation service management to the private sector
through Public Private Partnerships (PPP). This reform built on the successful
implementation of a PPP in the El Guerdane, and was integrated in the PMV in 2008. As initially
designed, the programmatic DPL series supported the implementation of this prerequisite
through two main steps: DPL/1 promoted improvement in the collection of arrears and DPL/2
intended to promote tariffs adjustments to reach cost recovery of O&M.

114. Actions to incentivize farmers to pay arrears were successful. Within the framework
of the previous Water DPL series supported by the World Bank, the GoM had launched two
successive operations in 2006 and 2008 waiving interests and fees associated with accumulated
arrears for farmers who pay their debts related to irrigation water within a period of twelve
months. These operations allowed the ORMVAs to recover 315 million MAD. The GoM
launched a third debt forgiveness operation under DPL/1, which is estimated to have recovered
additional 398 million MAD for the ORMVAs.

115. The initially proposed irrigation water tariff adjustments plan could not be
pursued. Morocco is among the countries that has made significant progress in irrigation service
cost recovery. In LSI areas, water is billed on a volumetric basis and the O&M cost recovery
rates in 2010 varied between 68 percent and 100 percent, depending on the utility. The GoM
intends to continue narrowing the gap between the irrigation water tariffs and the O&M costs in
LSI areas with the objective to reach 100 percent in all perimeters. To this end, in September
2009 the GoM issued an implementing regulation (Arrêté) announcing five biannual tariffs
increases to send a clear price signal to farmers and to future companies potentially interested in
PPPs. After the implementation of the first tariff increase, this measure sparked public protests
by farmers in a number of LSIs, which led the GoM to postpone the measure. The GoM has
again stressed that the socio-political conditions make the approval of the proposed irrigation
water tariff adjustments particularly difficult. In the meantime, the GoM, with support from the
World Bank and other donors, launched a political economy analysis of the proposed irrigation
sector reform (regarding the tariff increase and the PPP agenda). This study relied on a
comprehensive consultation process with all stakeholders, and included a staff survey and focus
group discussions within the ORMVAs of Gharb, Loukkos, and Tadla. The study revealed the
resistance of various stakeholders in the implementation of the reform and recommended
refocusing the reform process to first improve the service delivery and efficiency of the
ORMVAs.

116. MAPM opted to restructure the ORMVAs to isolate irrigation water service
delivery from its other mandates and to establish this service into subsidiary companies
and to regroup all deconcentrated services of MAPM at the regional level under an

                                                40
umbrella institution named ORDAR. Building on the results of the political economy analysis
of the irrigation sector reform and taking into consideration the institutional reforms launched
under the PMV, including the creation of the National Food Safety Agency (ONSSA) in 2009, of
the National Agency for Agricultural Advisory Services (ONCA) in 2012, and of the Agriculture
Development Agency (ADA) in 2009, the GoM, with support from the World Bank, launched a
study to review the possible next steps of the irrigation water service reform. This study
recommended continuing the institutional restructuring of ORMVAs in order to refocus the
irrigation water service delivery into a dedicated allowing them to function as real Irrigation
Utilities. Taking into consideration the recommendations of the study and in order to embed the
irrigation water service delivery within the broader reform of its deconcentrated services, the
MAPM decided to isolate irrigation water services and establish them as subsidiary irrigation
companies, functioning with principles of transparency and financial and managerial autonomy.
In the meantime, MAPM undertook efforts to reorganize its deconcentrated agencies and
services at the regional level to regroup all of them into Regional Agriculture and Rural
Development Offices (Offices régionaux de développement agricole et rural, ORDAR). The
regional irrigation companies will be set as subsidiaries of the ORDARs. Each ORDAR will
serve as a common platform for local delivery of all regional services (extension, food safety,
irrigation, investment, and research) associated with MAPM. The creation of ORDARs
represents a major initiative by MAPM to make service delivery more responsive and
accountable to regional stakeholders and clients.

117. Undertaking this fundamental restructuring of the ORMVAs will require a two-step
process. As a first step, MAPM will legally create Regional Agriculture and Rural Development
Offices (Offices régionaux de développement agricole et rural, ORDAR), replacing the current
ORMVAs as well as all deconcentrated services of MAPM (DRAs, DPA, etc.). The draft law
proposed by MAPM creates the ORDARs and states that irrigation water service delivery will be
corporatized into regional irrigation companies. The actual establishment of said companies will
take place as a second step, after the law creating the ORDARs is enacted. However, the draft
law creating the ORDARs explicitly states that each of the regional irrigation companies to be
created will operate along the key principles of transparent and accountable service delivery and
financing, management of revenues and expenditures to ensure sustainability, and reporting to an
independent board. The World Bank agreed to MAPM’s request to replace the initial prior action
(D.2) on irrigation water tariffs with the submission to the SGG of the draft law creating the
ORDARs and setting the basis for the establishment of regional irrigation companies. This
fundamental restructuring will change the cost structure of the irrigation water service and render
the tariff adjustment plan proposed in 2009 obsolete. Tackling the institutional, legal and
managerial framework of the irrigation utilities improves the link between service delivery and
tariffs and is considered an important strategic step on the path to bringing PPPs into the sector.

118. The prior action for DPL/2 is: The draft Laws creating the ORDARs and setting the
basis for the establishment of subsidiaries of the ORDARs, which will be in charge of irrigation
management and which will have the legal personality and financial autonomy, have been
submitted by MAPM to the Secretary General of the Government on January 15, 2013 34


34
  Under DPL/1 the DPL/2 trigger for D.2 was: The adjustment plan for irrigation water tariffs will be implemented
according to an updated calendar. The revision to the prior action in DPL/2 represents an even more substantial

                                                       41
119. The expected result of this reform is the improved institutional arrangement for local
delivery of all services associated with MAPM and, in a second step, the establishment of
corporatized regional irrigation companies which will have a legal personality and financial
autonomy. This will ultimately make possible the introduction of the private sector for the
management of irrigation services. This result will be measured through the number of ORDARs
created.

D.3. Improve irrigation infrastructure planning by the Government

120. An integrated investment plan for water mobilization and irrigation infrastructure
development would promote better coordination among different government actors. Weak
planning coordination of water mobilization (responsibility of MEMEE) and irrigation
infrastructure (responsibility of MAPM) has contributed to underutilization of already mobilized
water resources. In 2010, the gap between the potential area irrigable by reservoirs and the actual
area irrigated by these reservoirs reached 108,000 ha. The investment needed to fill this gap is
estimated at 15 billion MAD. MAPM elaborated a program to close the irrigation infrastructure
gap. This program is included in the multi-year agreement on the financing of the PMV (2009-
2015) signed between MEF and MAPM and is currently being implemented. In order to avoid
future gaps created following the construction of new dams, the GoM adopted under DPL/1 an
integrated investment plan for the development of irrigation perimeters located downstream of
the dams programmed by the MEMEE for the period 2010–2012. This new integrated approach
of planning allows MEF to allocate financial resources consistently for investments in water
mobilization as well as investments in irrigation infrastructure development.

121. The prior action for DPL/2 is: Adequate funding for the irrigation perimeters located
downstream of dams under construction has been allocated in the Borrower’s budget laws for
2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013

122. The expected result of this reform is improved coherence in the planning of
investments in water mobilization and investments in irrigation systems. This result will be
measured through the percentage of fully budgeted irrigation schemes associated with dams
under construction or planned.

                             VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

    A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

123. Although the operation is expected to have significant positive impacts on poverty
and social inclusion, preparation has included assessments of potential negative
distributional impacts and related mitigation measures. A Poverty and Social Impact
Analysis (PSIA) was carried out during DPL/1 preparation. It focused on the potential impacts of
the: (i) restructuring of the fruit and vegetable wholesale markets and slaughterhouses on formal
and informal operators; (ii) implementation of Pillar I and II projects including contract farming;

reform than what was envisioned that will create the institutional framework necessary for improvements in service
delivery while enabling the overall long term strategy of introducing PPPs into the sector.

                                                        42
(iii) irrigation water tariff adjustments; 35 and (iv) agricultural services reform and introduction of
enhanced food safety and quality standards. The DPL/1 PSIA also built on consultations carried
out in the form of specialized workshops involving key institutional actors. Consultations in
relation to Component A (Domestics Markets) focused on the wholesale markets for fruits and
vegetables in the potential pilot cities of Meknès, Rabat, and Agadir, and the slaughterhouses of
Meknès, Rabat, and Marrakech. The geographic scope for the other three components
(Agricultural Investment Support, Agricultural Services, and Irrigation Water) comprised the
regions Marrakech Tensift Al Haouz, Souss-Massa-Draa, Abda-Doukkala, Chaouia-Ourdigha,
Greater Casablanca, and Taza-Al Hoceima-Taounate. With the preparation of DPL/2, three
additional studies (and corresponding consultations) were undertaken: (i) a Social Plan in
relation to Component A (Domestics Markets); (ii) a Political Economy Analysis of the
irrigation sector reform, jointly financed with the Belgian Technical Cooperation in relation to
Component D (Irrigation Water); and (iii) a gender analysis of the PMV, specifically targeting
the Components supported through the DPL.

124. The reform under Component A (Domestic Markets) is likely to primarily benefit
large numbers of small farmers, even if those at the interface between formal and informal
sector, may be negatively affected. The first type of impact concerns the delocalization of
markets and slaughterhouses away from the city centers into peri-urban and rural areas.
Employees as well as informal sector workers could face a steep rise in transport costs to retain
their revenues, which may be attenuated by funding transport options (depending on whether the
wholesale markets and slaughterhouses are publically or privately operated). A second type of
impact concerns the restructuring of the management model through PPPs. The risk is that
existing operators and their personnel as well as groups of informal sector workers (petty traders
and restaurateurs, guards, transport people) would lose sources of revenue. Relevant actors at the
level of Morocco’s 38 wholesale markets who could be negatively affected by the proposed
reforms include 374 mandataires and their personnel (an estimated total of 1,343), 640
municipal wholesale market employees, and between 14,000 and 16,000 informal sector
workers. Similarly, at the level of Morocco’s 180 municipal slaughterhouses on average between
60 to 80 chevillards and their personnel (estimated between 50 to 60 workers and 20 to 30
slaughterers), and a portion of municipal officials could potentially be disadvantaged through the
proposed closure, re-designation, or introduction of the new management models at selected
sites.

125. The MAPM recognizes the importance of undertaking specific mitigating actions to
facilitate wholesale market and slaughterhouse reform. The development and implementation
of communication and consultation plan is a key tool to raise awareness among stakeholders
about the goals of increased efficiency and effectiveness pursued by the reform program, as it
can be used to highlight the expected impacts and envisaged solutions to the different groups of
interest. The MAPM is well aware from their earlier experience with introducing concessions in
slaughterhouses and that the reform will benefit from greater recognition of the contribution of
informal sector workers to the wholesale market and slaughterhouse operations. In this regard,
the effects of both delocalization and privatization of wholesale markets and slaughterhouses
could be partly mitigated by internalizing the impacts within the process and encouraging
operators to take actions such as: (i) setting-up transport facilities linking old and new sites; (ii)
35
     This builds on the analysis undertaken as part of the previous Water Sector DPL.

                                                           43
re-absorbing (i.e. formalizing) informal sector workers; and (iii) guaranteeing security to
employees. The GoM is aware that social programs centered on training, skilling and re-skilling,
and aimed at economic reconversion and reinsertion of impacted stakeholders will need to be
designed to accompany the proposed reforms. Tailored vocational training programs as well as
financial incentives and technical support can facilitate the development of microenterprises
whose activities need to be integrated with the Domestic Market reform. At the institutional
level, slaughterhouse working conditions are improved through the Cahier des prescriptions
(concessions) stipulating the technical, administrative, and contractual requirements for
operating structures, including those related to urban transport, health and hygiene, security and
infrastructure maintenance.

126. The Social Plan under preparation will outline measures for mitigating negative
impacts on groups economically active in the wholesale markets and slaughterhouses. The
Social Plan (Plan d'accompagnement social) has the underlying objectives of ensuring that the
welfare and employment concerns of these groups are addressed as new systems are put in place
while strengthening social acceptance of the reform. It will include the following elements:
    • A set of fundamental principles to guide design and implementation;
    • Measures for the redeployment, reintegration, and retraining of affected workers and
         economic agents linked to the wholesale markets and slaughterhouses, as appropriate;
    • A communication strategy/plan targeting both national and local stakeholders;
    • A cooperation framework for government stakeholders;
    • A detailed series of intermediary steps for the Plan’s implementation; and
    • Cost estimates of the measures, based on an estimation of the number of persons affected.
To strengthen its viability, the Social Plan will take into account and address
institutional/governance issues at the national as well as local level. It will also account for
differences at the local level in terms of number and profile of persons affected and the economic
environment, as well opportunities created by the reform measures. Finally, an assessment of
existing national and local support mechanisms and resources will be incorporated, along with
identification of new support measures required. As much as possible, at the implementation
level, the Social Plan will encourage stakeholders to draw on lessons learned from similar
reforms in Morocco as well as internationally. The preparation of the Social Plan was launched
during a workshop held on January 3, 2013, aiming to validate the proposed methodology.
Participants included representatives from MAPM, MI, and the relevant professional
organization (Confédération Marocaine de l’Agriculture et du Développement Rural,
COMADER). The Social Plan’s ultimate success lies in its design, implementation, and as well
as good cooperation at the operational level between MAPM, MI, and MICNT. Ministerial
support and oversight, such as through the working committee which meets periodically, will be
important for seeing it through. The World Bank is providing technical assistance for the
development of the Social Plan.

127. Reforms promoted under Component C (Agricultural Services) to put in place food
safety standards imply the need for resources and expertise to ensure compliance. To this
effect, ONSSA is working with small processing facilities with limited capacity to develop
upgrading plans. The contract farming model may also be a powerful tool to bring groups of
farmers up to the new standards in the framework of Pillar II projects.


                                               44
128. Measures promoted under Component D (Irrigation Water) aiming at enhancing
irrigation efficiency have largely beneficial impacts, but require capacity building and
awareness raising efforts to improve implementation. An in-depth analysis of the linkages
between quality of service delivery and irrigation water tariffs was carried out during the
preparation of the DPL series, accounting for the point of view and perception of the different
groups of interest involved in the reform. The consultations with farmers and stakeholders
carried out during the PSIA data collection under DPL/1 highlighted fairly localized rather than
generalized opposition to tariff increases. Although certain farmers face constraints (particularly
within smallholder farms and in farms growing low value crops), there is typically no capacity to
pay problem. The main drivers of opposition are often related to the relationship between
farmers and local political structures such as provincial and regional councils and chambers of
agriculture (e.g., in the Tadla perimeter), which ends up influencing the acceptability of the new
irrigation water tariffs. The consultations highlighted that farmers do not see direct
improvements in service quality associated with tariff increases. This is partly a perception
problem that will be overcome with the removal of food safety and extension services from the
mandate of ORMVAs, allowing them to focus on their core mission of irrigation service
delivery. It is also partly the reality of a budget process that includes separate revenue and cost
centers, a problem that will be tackled in the reform of the statutes of the ORMVAs. The MAPM
is committed to the stepwise reform of the ORMVAs to show an improvement of service
delivery. The Political Economy Analysis of Irrigation Sector Reform examines the factors that
derailed earlier attempts at tariff reform, assesses the potential distributional impacts of irrigation
sector reform on the different stakeholders, identifies possible strategies for reform, defines
mitigating measures for potential negative impacts, and suggests a Government communication
strategy to accompany reforms. Consultations at the regional level have been carried out in three
irrigation perimeters (Loukkos, Gharb, and Tadla) that have differing economic, technical, and
climatic characteristics.

129. Efforts by MAPM to enhance gender equality in the PMV are currently underway,
with significant positive implications on the efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability, and
equity aspects of the reform process. The MAPM has commissioned a comprehensive gender
analysis of the PMV which will strengthen the agriculture strategy’s overall social inclusion
goal. The analysis will be carried out in the first half of 2013. In addition, a gender analysis of
the DPL series, conducted by the World Bank, highlighted the potential areas for action. While
no specific gender issues were identified for Component A (Domestic Markets), for Component
B (Agricultural Investment Support), recommendations include supporting capacity building of
the technical committees to develop and apply gender criteria in the selection of Pillar II projects
and promote gender considerations in their implementation. Similarly, for Component C
(Agricultural Services), the competencies of the Regional Coordination Committees for Research
and Development could include gender based criteria in the selection of priority research themes.
Specific mechanisms integrated into the National Agricultural Advisory Services Strategy and
Action Plan are already in place and can be easily used to report how the Plan is reducing the
gender gap in access to advisory services with the associated measurable indicators. Regarding
Component D (Irrigation Water), both women and men farmers are expected to benefit in similar
ways from the development of drip irrigation in LSI areas. The employment potential of women
and men will largely depend on the new crops adopted and will differ considerably by region.



                                                  45
130. While not part of the World Bank’s support, the Government’s agricultural land
mobilization objectives in the framework of the PMV are likely to lead to overall positive
effects, although the potential localized opposition should be taken into consideration. In
order to achieve its objectives, the Government aims to mobilize roughly 700,000 ha of
collective land. As this land mobilization takes place within a program of agriculture
development projects under PMV Pillar I and II, it can generate a number of broadly positive
effects, such as the valorization of land, increased access by small holders to public and private
investments within PMV projects, and job creation. The key risk to implementation is that land
mobilization stirs up tensions among stakeholders regarding the transfer of rights. This risk is
generally context specific, and not inherent to the implementation of the PMV but to all
collective land transactions in Morocco. In addition to encouraging the creation of
cooperatives/associations of rights holders, good communication between the authorities and the
rights holders is critical to success. An additional mitigation measure under consideration is that
each Pillar I and II project include a mini social assessment addressing issues around land tenure.
Another risk concerns the mobilization of land where there are not sufficient water resources to
realize the proposed Pillar I or II projects. To minimize this risk, ADA and the DRA have set up
social (and environmental) screening criteria to contribute to project sustainability.

     B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

131. Over the last decade, Morocco made significant progress in improving the
institutional and legal framework for environmental protection. The State Secretariat (in
charge of Water and Environment), within the Ministry of Mines, Energy, Water and
Environment (MEMEE), has become a full-fledged environmental administration. Morocco
developed a comprehensive environmental strategy in 2005 -the National Environmental and
Sustainable Development Strategy- with four main priorities: water protection, waste reduction
and management, water quality improvement, and soil protection. In addition, the Government
passed Law No. 12/03 in 2003 defining the requirements for Environmental Impact Assessments
(EIAs) and creating a national committee within the MEMEE for the review and oversight of
EIAs. Furthermore, the Council of Government recently enacted two decrees related to the
establishment of the national and regional EIA committees as well as a decree for public
consultation and disclosure. Additional measures are also being taken to strengthen the
Moroccan environmental institutions and legal framework with the support of various donors and
international development agencies, notably GTZ. All these developments strengthen the
environmental protection framework in Morocco, both at national and local level, and contribute
to the necessary legal and institutional capacity to manage the potential environmental impacts of
the proposed reforms.

132. The assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the reforms under the
proposed DPL series concluded that on balance it is likely to have significant positive
effects on the environment. As per Operation Policy (OP) 8.60, the World Bank assesses
whether specific country policies supported by a DPL series are likely to cause significant impact
on the country’s environment, forests, and other natural resources. To this end, an Environmental
Due Diligence Review was undertaken under DPL/1 (November 2012) and reviewed under
DPL/2 (December 2012). The assessment identified the primary transmission channels through
which the proposed reform actions could impact natural resources, and estimated the potential

                                                46
magnitude of these impacts. In addition, an assessment was conducted of the political, legal, and
institutional framework governing these potential environmental impacts as well as the capacity
of the environmental authorities in Morocco to address them. The Environmental Due Diligence
Review of DPL/2 also benefitted from the strategic environmental impact evaluation of the PMV
program commissioned by ADA in August 2012. ADA commissioned extensive consultations
with staff of the MAPM at central and local level, farmers associations, private stakeholders,
chambers of agriculture, and the donor community between December 2011 and March 2012. In
addition, three consultations were organized by MAPM between 2010 and 2012 in relation to the
reforms supported under the DPL series, and specifically to validate the findings of the
Environmental Due Diligence Review with ministerial staff, representatives from non-
government organizations working on environmental issues, and representatives from
universities.

133. The reforms under Component A (Domestic Markets) are likely to have
intermediate negative environmental impacts. Potential negative effects include the
concentration of pollution sources (water, land, air, noise) as a consequence of the increase in
volume of transactions per facility (both wholesale markets and slaughterhouses). This increase
in volume stems from: (i) a reduction in the number of facilities at national level due to the
rationalization of the network; and (ii) an estimated increase in the volume of agricultural
transactions by 2020 (+280 percent in fruit and vegetables and +75 percent in red meat). These
potential negative effects, if not properly mitigated, could be important and long lasting. The
Environmental Due Diligence Review concludes that proper mitigation measures have been
already identified, and include: (i) the preparation and implementation of an EIA prior to the
construction and/or rehabilitation of wholesale markets and slaughterhouses, as required under
the Moroccan Law; and (ii) the adherence to the technical specifications (Cahier des
prescriptions techniques) for the proper management of private and municipal slaughterhouses,
as prepared under prior actions under A.2 of DPL/1 and DPL/2. The Environmental Due
Diligence Review also highlights that the new construction and/or rehabilitation of wholesale
markets and slaughterhouses can have a number of positive environmental implications. Among
others, the upgrade in the facilities can facilitate consolidated and improved waste handling and
disposal, thus enhancing environmental sustainability and public health.

134. The reforms carried out under Component B (Agricultural Investment Support), C
(Agricultural Services), and D (Irrigation Water) are expected to have positive
environmental impacts on water and land resources management. The Environmental Due
Diligence Review concludes that potential positive impacts can be further enhanced by
including: (i) environmental screening mechanisms governing the identification and selection of
Pillar II projects (Component B); and (ii) the promotion of monitoring mechanisms for
groundwater extraction (Component D).

     C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

135. Responsibility for implementing the program rests with the MAPM. The Strategy
and Statistics Directorate (DSS) of the MAPM will be responsible for the overall
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the program in collaboration with other
government stakeholders such as the MEF, MICNT, MI, and SEEE. In addition, a Steering

                                               47
Committee including the representatives of the Government departments and organizations
involved in the program has been established at the level of the Ministry of Governance and
General Affairs (MAGG) and is responsible for supporting the inter-ministerial coordination of
the implementation of the DPL program.

136. Monitoring and evaluation of the program will be an integral part of the supervision
process. World Bank staff will focus on the outcomes of the program and the adjustments that
need to be made to the operation as it evolves, to take into account the latest country
developments, stakeholder support, and feasible options for realizing the intended development
goals. While taking into account the goals of the DPL program, the review will be largely based
on the policy reform actions, results indicators and associated target values included in the
proposed Policy Matrix (Annex 2) and Results Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (Annex 4)
respectively. At the same time, the overall status of the Government’s program will be monitored
to determine whether country conditions and the specific policy actions of the proposed
operation have been met. The selected monitoring indicators and associated target values focus
largely on measuring progress in terms of institutional gains achieved under the DPL program,
rather than development gains on the ground. In fact, the program’s development gains are
unlikely to materialize in the relatively short timeframe of the proposed program and hence
would be difficult to measure.

        D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

137. A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment was
undertaken in 2009 jointly by the European Commission and the World Bank. The PEFA
report has confirmed substantial progress in Public Finance Management (PFM) reforms in
Morocco. The results based on the PEFA ratings indicate in particular that Morocco has an
overall credible, comprehensive, and transparent budget. The PFM system also supports the
achievement of aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources and efficient service
delivery. The main strengths of the Moroccan PFM are the following aspects: (i) credible and
transparent budget; (ii) transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities; (iii) timeliness and
regularity of Government’s banks’ accounts reconciliation; (iv) accurate and timely in year
budget reports covering expenditures at both commitment and payment stages; and, (iv) strong
cash and debt management. The main challenges of the Morocco PFM relate to: (i) improvement
of the budget classification, since despite the level of detail, accuracy, and reliability, it does not
yet allow for reliable direct tracking of program-related spending being financed under priority
programs; (ii) timeliness of annual statements which are submitted for external audit 15 months
after the end of the fiscal year; (iii) the limited extent of legislative scrutiny of external audit
reports; and (iv) the frequency and scope of audit rated average as is follow-up of audit
recommendations. The Government is committed to address these challenges and, in order to do
so, has introduced measures to: (i) move to a performance based budgeting framework, (ii)
develop a multi-year agreement on the financing of the PMV (2009-2015) to assist in fiscal
sustainability, (iii) modernize its accounting and internal audit framework; and (iv) improve
revenue management. The 2009 PEFA is also contributing to the Government’s reform process
by providing information on the extent to which reforms are yielding improved performance. In
addition, the Kingdom of Morocco publishes its annual budget on the MEF website 36 as well as
36
     http://www.finances.gov.ma/portal/page?_pageid=53,1&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL

                                                   48
in the official gazette in a timely manner, following adoption by Parliament. In conclusion, the
strength of Morocco’s PFM system and the Government’s commitment to reform, taken
together, are, in the World Bank’s view, adequate to support this DPL.

138. Foreign exchange - No safeguard assessment of the Central Bank (Bank Al-Maghrib)
was conducted by the IMF. However, the Central Bank is audited on a yearly basis with the audit
report being disclosed publicly. The 2009, 2010, and 2011 audits were unqualified. However, the
World Bank was not able to review the Management Letter, and therefore has limited
information on the foreign exchange control environment. The World Bank should receive and
review the management letter in order to obtain a clearer view on the Foreign exchange
environment.

139. With reference to the flow of funds, the proposed loan will follow the World Bank’s
disbursement procedures for development policy operations. Once the loan is approved by
the World Bank’s board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in
compliance with the stipulated release conditions as defined in the Loan Agreement (the World
Bank is satisfied with: (i) the program being carried out by the Borrower and (ii) the adequacy of
the Borrower’s macroeconomic policy framework) and in a single instalment. The account into
which the loan proceeds will be deposited forms part of the country's official foreign exchange
reserves. Flow of funds (including foreign currency exchange) is subject to standard public
financial processes. The Government budget is comprehensive, unified and subject to centralized
treasury account.

     E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

140. The loan proceeds will be deposited by the International Bank of Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD) in a dedicated account opened by the Borrower and acceptable to
the World Bank at the Central Bank of Morocco (CBM) (Bank Al Maghrib), upon
submission of a signed withdrawal application. Such arrangements mitigate the fiduciary risk
of any possible loss or diversion of the loan proceeds from the foreign currency Bank account
into which loan proceeds are deposited. The Borrower should ensure that upon the deposit of
loan proceeds into said account, an equivalent amount, in the local currency, is credited to the
treasury current account at the Central Bank. The Borrower will report to the World Bank within
30 days after the loan disbursement on the amount deposited in the foreign currency account and
credited to the budget management system. If the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Loan Agreement, IBRD will require the Borrower to promptly upon
notice refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IBRD. Amounts refunded to the
World Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The loan proceeds will be administered by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF).

                                               CBM                    MEF
                     World Bank            Euro Dedicated        MD Budget Account
                                            Bank Account             at TGR


141. Although an audit of the use of the funds may not be required, IBRD reserves the
right to ask for a transaction audit. This audit, when asked for, will cover the accuracy of the

                                               49
transactions i.e., receipts and payments of the dedicated account, including accuracy of exchange
rate conversions; confirming that the dedicated account was used only for the purposes of the
operation where no other amounts have been deposited into the account. Also the auditor will
have to obtain confirmation from corresponding bank(s) involved in the funds flow regarding the
transaction. The time period for submission of the audit report to the World Bank is 6 months
from the date a request for such audit is issued.

     F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

142. Inter-sectoral reforms are slower than expected. There is a risk that the sector reforms
proposed under the PMV are delayed. These risks are mitigated by the continuity provided by the
re-appointed Minister of Agriculture, the ownership within the relevant line-ministries of the
strategic vision related to the PMV, and the demonstrably strong commitment to the
implementation of the PMV by His Majesty the King. In addition, Morocco’s Advanced
Association Status with the EU and bilateral agricultural trade liberalization will help maintain
reform momentum in the agri-food sector. A Steering Committee of all government stakeholders
involved in the implementation of the DPL program has already been established at the level of
the MAGG. Furthermore, significant reform actions had already been undertaken by the
Government prior to the DPL series, including the creation of 16 DRAs, establishment of
specialized agencies such as ADA and ONSSA, regionalization of the Chambers of Agriculture,
creation of Interprofessions for 17 priority agri-food chains, reform of the agricultural subsidy
system under the FDA, and the signing of an agricultural FTA with the European Commission.
A multi-year agreement on the financing of the PMV (2009-2015) has been signed between the
MEF and the MAPM and the MAPM’s budgets for 2011, 2012, and 2013 have been in line with
the multi-year agreement on the financing of the PMV.

143. Some of the proposed reforms may be opposed by vested interests and stakeholders,
especially considering the current socio-political climate. The proposed reform agenda for
domestic markets may meet resistance from municipalities as well as the vested interests of
current agents and intermediaries linked to the municipal fruit and vegetable wholesale markets
(mandataires) and users of slaughterhouses (chevillards). Important mitigating measures include
the development and implementation of a communication and consultation plan, social measures
supporting re-training, and improved regulations governing working conditions at wholesale
markets and slaughterhouses (WMS). Resistance of municipalities in relation to the domestic
markets reform program is being mitigated through the demonstration effect of the win-win
arrangements in the new wholesale market ownership and management structures piloted under
the program. Specific measures to mitigate the risk of opposition stemming from the vested
interests of current agents, intermediaries and users at the level of the fruit and vegetable
wholesale markets and slaughterhouses, water users, and stakeholders on collective lands, have
been proposed based on the PSIA completed under DPL/1 and continue to be taken into account
in the design of the program. They will be further complemented by the outcomes of the soon to
be completed study on the political economy of the irrigation sector reform including safeguard
measures ensuring enhanced stakeholder consultation and participation in the decision-making
processes related to the proposed reforms.




                                               50
144. The private sector may be hesitant to participate in the proposed contract farming
model for the Pillar I and Pillar II investment program. Although central and local
administrations play a mediating role between producers and potential investors and active
mobilization of investment resources is pursued by ADA, the risk of a lack of confidence
between potential agrégés (organized farmers) and agrégateurs (investors, traders, and
entrepreneurs) could undermine the design of the PMV’s Pillar I and Pillar II investments. The
adoption of the Law on Contract farming could mitigate this condition by creating a supportive
legal and institutional environment, for example through the establishment of a procedure in the
law. The agrégateurs will sign contracts with both ADA and agrégés in order to benefit from
Government investment support under the PMV. The modernization and liberalization of
domestic marketing and distribution systems supported under the DPL program, the proposed
IFC support program for improving the agricultural investment climate and promoting
agricultural investments, as well as the enhanced subsidies and investment support under the
reformed FDA constitute additional mitigating measures by promoting greater cooperation
between producers and investors through an improved incentive framework.

145. Heightened risks to the outlook related to macroeconomic stability and fiscal
balances require decisive actions to put the fiscal stance back on a sustainable path. On the
one hand, Morocco faces three exogenous macroeconomic risks: (i) the possible deterioration of
the ongoing global economic difficulties - especially in Europe; (ii) the volatility of the
agricultural output due to its dependence on changing climatic conditions; and (iii) continued
high world prices of food and energy. On the other hand, Morocco also could suffer from
endogenous risks, essentially those related to a slow or non-consequential implementation of the
needed reforms stemming from resistance of vested interests groups or from a waning political
determination to implement politically and socially sensitive policies, such as the subsidy reform.
Morocco would face reduced growth prospects in case the above mentioned exogenous shocks
materialize. In particular, in the event that the current European economic uncertainty evolves in
a recession in the order of a -1 to -1.5 percent GDP growth in 2013, World Bank estimates for
Morocco indicate a reduced growth rate by half point for the same year. Should oil prices remain
at current high levels, Morocco would likely see its GDP growth prospects reduced relative to
the baseline scenario. This would also have important fiscal implications that pose perhaps the
most significant medium term macroeconomic risk - that of deterioration of the fiscal balance
which would be exacerbated by the increasing costs of the subsidy system. Morocco’s
management and mitigation of these risks are predicated on the Government’s strong
commitment to proceed with the ongoing and envisaged reforms outlined earlier. The
Government is also adopting specific measures in the event of a negative agricultural outcome
that relate to the suspension of import duties on cereals and support to affected farmers and
livestock producers. It is devising strategies to cope with potentially sustained high oil prices,
including requesting World Bank support to develop mechanisms to hedge commodity price
risks. More importantly, it is devising measures to mitigate the impact of subsidies on public
finances to be eventually introduced in 2013 after the partial adjustment to oil prices
implemented early June 2012. In this regard, there is broad understanding that the needed
consolidation of public finances will require three critical measures the Government is already
working on: deepening of fiscal reform, regaining control over the wage bill evolution and
subsidy reform.



                                                51
146. Morocco remains vulnerable to chronic drought, adverse climate events and
fluctuations in energy prices. The dependence of Moroccan agriculture on rainfed agriculture,
particularly for poor and vulnerable farmers, coupled with increased water scarcity and potential
for negative climate events in the medium and long run pose serious social and economic
concerns. The Government is well aware of the situation and is devoting considerable efforts that
would lead to an integrated strategy to address these issues. The new strategy addressing the
impact of global warming as well as the PMV are key contributions to foster this agenda. The
World Bank is expected to continue to support such efforts in the sector through the proposed
Green Growth DPL. In addition, the existing SCCF/GEF grant on integrating climate change
adaption in the implementation of the PMV is closely aligned with the DPL series.

Subject: Agricultural Sector Letter of Development Policy

Mr. President,

As you are aware, since the late 1990s, Morocco has been undertaking a raft of visible reforms
that have led to structural changes and remarkably robust activity in the different areas of
economic activity. Because of these reforms, the gains made by the domestic economy have
been strengthened while maintaining domestic economic equilibrium, despite the rapid
changes in the international environment and years of drought. These reforms have been
reflected, in particular, in the acceleration of economic growth, support for the private sector,
greater competitiveness of our productive fabric, Morocco’s enhanced level of integration into
the global economy, improvement in the public finance situation, efforts to reduce poverty and
exclusion, and improvement in the human development indicators used to record further
progress that tangibly and significantly impacts the lives of the people.

Against this backdrop, the Government is determined to continue these reforms and ensure the
preservation of financial equilibrium in accordance with the provisions of the new constitution.
In the Government’s 2012-2016 program adopted by the Parliament, the Government made a
commitment to work toward preserving and strengthening financial and macroeconomic
equilibria, with the aim of guaranteeing, among other things, a national and international
investor-friendly business climate.

In order to ensure external equilibrium, the Government will seek to correct the external
structural disequilibria noted with respect to the trade balance and the current account balance
of payments by identifying and eliminating constraints to investment and competitiveness, in
the context of an integrated vision, including the constraints linked to production factor cost,
logistics, exports, education and training, and the investment climate.


                                               69
I- THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR

Agriculture is an important pillar for Morocco’s development. Its economic and social weight,
the key linkage it provides to the rural areas, and its myriad functions in the food, economic,
social, and environmental areas, in particular, make it a powerful engine of our country’s
development.

The importance of the agricultural sector is reflected in its significant contribution to national
GDP (15 percent to 20 percent) and job creation, particularly in rural areas where agriculture
remains the main employer (80 percent) and the main source of income (1.5 million farmers).

National agriculture meets the needs of the local food market either fully or partially. National
demand met by local production has been put at 55 percent for grain, 100 percent for fruits and
vegetables, 43 percent for sugar, 20 percent for oil, 90 percent for dairy, and up to 100 percent
for meats. Grain, vegetable oil and oil seeds, sugar, and dairy products account for 66 percent
of the average value of agricultural imports.

Food exports account for 19 percent of the country’s global exports (DH 22 billion) and are
comprised largely of fresh citrus and fresh and canned vegetables, which account for 20
percent, 20 percent, and 16 percent, respectively, of the average value of agricultural exports.

Irrigated areas, which cover 1.4 million hectares or 15 percent of agricultural land, account for
45 percent of agricultural value added. This land, although unevenly distributed throughout the
country, constitutes hubs of development that contribute significantly to strengthening and
stabilizing Morocco’s food security situation and to improving living conditions in rural areas.

Furthermore, our agriculture revolves mainly around grain (70 percent of the utilized
agricultural area (UAA) and 10 percent of employment) and is thus too vulnerable to climate-
related events. For this reason, it is important to adapt agricultural policies to the
agroecological diversity offered by the country and to the effects of climate change.

In the case of a sizeable part of the sector and in terms of the different regions, the network of
actors is fragmented, weak, disorganized, and incapable of handling the challenges of modern
agriculture using its own resources. Indeed, the deficient nature of the network of actors and a
lack of organization of the sectors around agroprocessors (agrégateurs) with strong investment
and management potential, continue to be the main reason for the low productivity of
Morocco’s agricultural sector, as well as the lack of investment and development. This is also
the main reason for inadequate financing of the sector by the national banking system, which
meets a mere 16 percent of needs in this area.

Marketing is a key phase in the development of agricultural products, with proven
competitiveness during the production stage. A sales strategy for both the domestic and export
markets needs to be developed in order to achieve fixed objectives. Depending on the

                                               70
situation, the domestic market could derive benefit from and/or serve as a catalyst for this
process.

However, the domestic marketing channels are plagued by structural deficits linked to the lack
of liberalization and competitiveness as well as dysfunctions in the setting of benchmark prices
and the exchange of information pertaining thereto at the national level, as well as limitations
that curb the development of a modern distribution system.

Transaction costs for agricultural products remain high. Efforts are being made to modernize
domestic market distribution channels (reform of wholesale commerce, upgraded
infrastructure, the promotion of quality through labeling, traceability, geographic origin, etc.).

From the standpoint of strategy, the effective functioning of the domestic market built around
organized actors facilitating the supply of quality products to Moroccan consumers at
competitive and/or affordable prices is reflected in the following main features:
   • Enhanced market access through the gradual liberalization of domestic markets;
   • Upgrading of quality and hygiene standards;
   • Promoting the modernization of marketing channels.

Furthermore, domestic agriculture has been clearly placed on a path of openness to
international markets, either through unilateral trade liberalization initiatives or bilateral or
multilateral free trade agreements.

This openness has allowed the sector to outsource a portion of its productive potential and
thus help achieve progress with the domestic and external markets. An effort is underway to
adapt the mechanism for supporting and protecting the domestic agricultural production
sectors, based on the objectives set for the sector, while being mindful of Morocco’s
international commitments.

Taking into account international market conditions and the projected long-term trends in
international markets for agricultural products (trend toward higher demand, high prices for
food products, greater demand for biofuels, significant volatility in agricultural commodity
prices), adjustment of tariff protection measures should be accompanied by the establishment
of a framework conducive to more efficient allocation of sector resources and improved
competitiveness of national sectors, which ensure growth of the sector and food security for
the country.

This also entails enhanced long-term projections with respect to investors and operators and an
effort to foster long-term commitment by actors.

To build on our progress and benefit from the strategic position that Morocco can enjoy as a
platform for trade flows, business, and investment, an aggressive export promotion strategy is
also necessary, in particular through the harmonization of regulations and procedures,
continued support for sector momentum, the promotion of quality and the Moroccan label for

                                               71
high-value commercial products, the development and promotion of certain niche markets and
local products, market exploration, etc.

To address these different constraints, Morocco implemented its new national road map for
the agricultural sector called the Morocco Green Plan [Plan Maroc Vert PMV] two years ago. It
is aimed at modernizing agriculture and harmoniously integrating it into the domestic and
international markets.

This Plan aims to make the agricultural sector the main engine of national economic
development over the next 15 years, where clearly defined, quantitative targets are set and
shaped at the territorial level through Regional Agricultural Plans.

II- GOVERNMENT’S AGRICULTURAL STRATEGY

The Morocco Green Plan adopted a pragmatic global approach aimed at mobilizing all
agricultural development actors. It rests on two pillars:

     The first pillar focuses on modern, production-driven agriculture that complies with
       market rules by relying on private investment in high-value-added and high-productivity
       sectors.
     The second pillar focuses on support for social agriculture and combating poverty in
       areas with fragile economies by increasing the incomes of poor farmers through the
       implementation of integrated and economically viable projects.
    
The socioeconomic impact of this strategy is far-reaching in terms of value added, investment,
job creation, and higher income for farmers. In addition, the Morocco Green Plan is based on
restructuring the sectoral framework and enhancing cross-cutting factors, in particular those
related to water and land policies and interprofessional collaboration.

Central to this plan is enhanced upstream and downstream integration with strengthened
investment. This agro-industrial downstream process, which possesses significant potential for
development, adopts the model of agro-processing arrangements (modèle d’agrégation)
between small and medium-sized actors and larger ones.

In order to cover the entire sector, this strategy involves a portfolio of projects that are useful
to both modern and intensive agriculture (Pillar 1) and social agriculture (Pillar II):

   The objective of Pillar I: Strengthen and develop efficient agricultural processes that are in
    line with market rules, based on new private investment flows organized around new and
    equitable agro-processing arrangements (700 to 900 specific agro-processing arrangements
    and investment amounting to DH 110 billion to 150 billion over a ten-year period);
   The objective of Pillar II: Develop an approach oriented toward combating poverty by
    significantly increasing the agricultural revenue of the most vulnerable farmers, particularly


                                                72
   in fragile zones (550 social projects amounting to DH 15 billion to 20 billion over a ten-year
   period).

The founding principle is one of public intervention where private initiative is inadequate to
foster a growth process. Private investment is generated by national and international
investors entering the sector, with investment focused on win-win agro-processing
arrangements resulting from Morocco’s tailored and specific supply.

This development plan has required significant reforms and is based on organized and
accountable governance that is replicated in each region of Morocco by the various sector
participants and operators—farmer representatives, local governments, professionals, and the
relevant government ministries.

Morocco Green Plan: Achievements

During its first phase of execution, a series of important institutional reforms was launched as
part of the Morocco Green Plan. They include:

      The reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries (MAPM) at the
       central level (May 2009), with greater decision-making authority being granted to the
       regions;
      The establishment of a new Agency for Agricultural Development (agence de
       développement agricole ADA) to promote private investment in the agricultural sector
       and a National Food Safety Office (Office national pour la sécurité sanitaire des
       aliments), with the promulgation of a law on the safety of food products, currently an
       important tool for regulating and organizing the agroindustrial sector;
      The establishment of 16 Regional Agricultural Directorates [Directions Régionales de
       l'Agriculture DRA] and 16 Chambers of Agriculture [Chambres d'Agriculture] with
       portfolios composed of the 16 Regional Agricultural Plans [Plans Agricoles Régionaux
       PAR], which represent the individual Morocco Green Plan goals for each region from the
       standpoint of projects, investments, employment, exports, etc.);
      The creation of the Agency for the Development of Oasis and Argan Zones [Agence pour
       le Développement des Zones Oasiennes et de l’Arganier] (approved by the Council of
       Government in May 2010);
      The establishment of a Center for Resource Promotion (pillar II) (CRP II) in Ifrane;
      The creation of the National Food Safety Office.

With a view to achieving the objectives pertaining to wealth and job creation and poverty
reduction, win-win partnerships were concluded and implemented with stakeholders at various
levels (sectoral, regional, etc.), and related to the following:

   •   17 program contracts concluded between the Government and professionals for the
       following sectors: sugar, citrus, grain, market gardening, date palms, milk, red meat,
       poultry farming, seeds, olive growing, fruit farming, organic farming, apiculture, camel

                                              73
       rearing, argan, rosebush, saffron, as well as institutional mechanisms for annual
       monitoring and evaluation of their implementation;
   •   The establishment of 15 interprofessional associations bringing together all actors in the
       value chains;
   •   16 Regional Agricultural Contracts for the individual implementation of the Morocco
       Green Plan in each region in terms of projects, investments, jobs, and exports have been
       implemented with the local partners (local governments, Chambers of Agriculture, and
       the relevant ministerial departments);
   •   The establishment of a Project Management Office to manage program contracts
       concluded between the Government and professionals;
   •   Partnership agreements concluded between the Government and local banks are also in
       place to provide financial assistance, including the establishment of a specialized
       structure to provide financing to small farmers. Other partnerships were also launched
       with relevant public and private sector operators (water sector operators,
       agroprocessors [agrégateurs], national and international donors, NGOs, etc.);
   •   A complete revision of the agricultural incentive system with a view to enhancing its key
       role in the expansion of agricultural investments and ensuring its effective contribution
       to the achievement of the objectives of the Morocco Green Plan in all the production
       sectors involved.

       The rapid on-the-ground implementation of this reform of the Agricultural Development
       Fund was made possible by major support measures, including in particular the
       strengthening of the role of one-stop windows in province-level agricultural directorates
       and regional agricultural development offices, the implementation of an information
       system through which all subsidy requests from farmers are processed, and the
       unveiling of a communication and information plan for farmers and potential investors.

The MAPM has put in place a new risk management and agricultural insurance strategy, with a
view to supporting implementation of the Morocco Green Plan. At the start of the 2011/2012
agricultural season, the MAPM, in collaboration with Mutuelle Agricole Marocaine d'Assurances
(Moroccan Mutual Agricultural Insurance Company, MAMDA), introduced the “comprehensive
climate? insurance product to cover grain and vegetable harvests threatened by a raft of
climate hazards. This product, developed to meet the expectations of agricultural sector actors,
provides nationwide coverage for the following major climate risks: drought, hail, frost, high
winds, sandstorms, and flooding. Since its inception, this new product has proved extremely
popular with farmers, surpassing the ambitious target of 300,000 hectares set by the
Government and MAMDA to reach 327,000 hectares by end-2011.

A new Agricultural Council strategy was designed and seeks to strengthen support for farmers
and increase the transfer of agricultural know-how on the ground. This strategy will help
ensure the provision of a public outreach service to all farmers, and achieve a coverage rate of
1 advisor per 1,350 farmers by 2015, compared to the current rate of 1 advisor per 3,800
farmers.


                                              74
This strategy is structured around three main objectives:

 -       The development of the private agricultural council, with an appropriate legal
         framework, and the gradual reduction of subsidies for agricultural council services under
         certain conditions;
 -       The revitalization of government services by modernizing local government structures and
         implementing new modern communication and knowledge management tools; and
 -       The empowerment of bodies representing farmers (Chambers of Agriculture and
         interprofessional associations) through a contractual commitment set forth in a
         participatory road map.

The strategy seeks to provide sustained and effective support of projects and productive
sectors included in the Regional Agricultural Plans. It has been broken down into multi-year
action plans that define new governance mechanisms, tools, and methods for disseminating
agricultural knowledge, with a view to establishing a versatile and effective agricultural council
mechanism that will be in line with the ongoing changes in the agricultural sector.

The mainstreaming of gender into the agricultural strategy is another area covered by the
Morocco Green Plan. Indeed, the contributions made by rural women to the agricultural sector
are manifested in:

     -     Their strong and effective participation in agricultural activities;
     -     Their involvement in the development of biological resources;
     -     Their role as managers; and
     -     Their organizational and team work skills.

In light of the immense potential of rural women and the important value added they are
capable of generating for agricultural development, the Department of Agriculture, in
conjunction with the World Bank, is currently launching a study to strengthen the “gender?
dimension in the Morocco Green Plan, with the ultimate aim of creating conditions conducive
to greater competitiveness of microenterprises headed by women and increased involvement
of rural women in the economic growth process in their regions.

Morocco Green Plan: Key Figures

Four years since its launch, the new agricultural strategy has been strengthened and
implemented. It has given visibility to national and international actors and is an effective
development and anti-poverty tool for Morocco.

As a result of the various actions launched since the implementation of the Morocco Green
Plan, production outcomes have improved considerably in all sectors except the sugar sector.
The MAPM plans to correct this situation with the prompt signing of the new sugar program
contract that targets a 53 percent self-sufficiency rate by 2020, thereby equipping the sector
upstream with the resources needed to ensure its development.

                                                     75
The MAPM and the agricultural professionals involved agreed to implement far-reaching
programs to upgrade the production sectors, by not only establishing quantitative objectives
but also by providing assistance with interprofessional organization through support with
overall value chain structuring (quality promotion, research, training, technology transfer, etc.).
By way of example and to better illustrate the real progress achieved by the Morocco Green
Plan on the ground, growth production figures for the various sectors for the periods 2005-
2007 and 2008-2012 are as follows:

   -   +67 percent for olives: an increase from 774,000 metric tons to 1,295,000 metric tons;
   -   + 42 percent for grain: an increase from 57 million Qx to 80 million Qx T;
   -   +40 percent for dates: an increase from 81,000 metric tons to 114,000 metric tons;
   -   + 40 percent for white meat: an increase from 363,000 metric tons to 508,000 metric
       tons;
   -   +28 percent for citrus: an increase from 1,251,000 metric tons to 1,599,000 metric tons;
   -   +21 percent for milk: an increase from 1.68 billion liters to 2.03 billion liters; and,
   -   + 17 percent for red meats: an increase from 363,000 metric tons to 426,000 metric
       tons.

In terms of the impact of the Morocco Green Plan on overall agricultural growth, there was a
sharp increase in the agricultural value added per person and the gross domestic product for
the agricultural industry, as illustrated below:

III-               Development Policy Loan:

While the Morocco Green Plan continues to implement its major reforms, the Development
Policy Loan (DPL), the focus of this Letter of Development Policy, seeks to support the
implementation of this Program that focuses on the following areas:

              -    The integration of farmers into the domestic market;
              -    The improvement of the socioeconomic impact of Pillar II projects targeting small
                   farmers;
              -    The improvement of agricultural services; and
              -    The improvement of irrigation water use and management and of planning.

1. Integration of farmers into the domestic market

The general objective is to improve the institutional and regulatory framework governing
wholesale fruit and vegetable markets, slaughterhouses, and their management, with a view to:
   - Ensuring greater access by producers to quality wholesale markets and slaughterhouses;
   - Increasing agricultural revenue;
   - Improving the quality and safety of agricultural inputs and products; and
   - Reducing the transaction costs for fruit, vegetables, and meat on domestic markets.

In order to achieve these objectives, the Government essentially implemented the following
measures under the first DPL, which have:
    - Improved the institutional and regulatory framework governing wholesale fruit and
       vegetable markets with the implementation of a National Policy for Wholesale Fruit and


                                                              77
           Vegetable Markets and the implementation of pilot projects for fruit and vegetable
           markets introducing new management models.

A strong interministerial partnership was established to ensure constructive and pragmatic
monitoring of these actions. A monitoring committee appointed by the Minister of Agriculture
was set up to work closely with the partners involved with the national policy for wholesale
fruit and vegetable markets, consistent with the program’s direction.

This effort will be continued under the second DPL with the signing of three agreements
between local governments and the relevant government ministries for the implementation of
pilot projects for wholesale fruit and vegetable markets that seek to introduce new
management models.

First, an agreement will be signed between the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of
Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and New Technologies,
the Oriental Region, the Urban Commune of Berkane, the Rural Commune of Madagh, and the
Oriental Development Agency. This agreement aims to define a partnership framework
between the contracting parties with a view to establishing a wholesale fruit and vegetable
market that will be managed using a new method. Two other pilot projects for wholesale fruit
and vegetable markets will follow.

       -   Improved the institutional and regulatory framework governing slaughterhouses and
           red meat distribution systems through the development of standard technical
           specifications for private slaughterhouses on one hand and integrated projects on the
           other.

To that end, the program contract for the red meat industry promoted outsourcing
management of commune-level slaughterhouses to the private sector as the major area of
focus for the development and operationalization of the industry.

In this connection, the first DPL facilitated validation of two sets of Specifications regarding the
efficiency of slaughterhouses. The first relates to the standards defining sanitary, hygienic, and
facility requirements for private slaughterhouses (adopted by ONSSA in 2010), while the second
pertains to contractual, administrative, and technical requirements for the operation of private
municipal slaughterhouses (adopted by the MI and MAPM in November 2012).

Moreover, as part of the effort to develop the red meat industry, a draft decree amending and
supplementing the vizirial decree of September 28, 1955 on food safety control of “viandes
foraines? 37 and a joint draft decree from the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of
Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries establishing the conditions for the introduction and sale of
market meats were submitted for the approval of the General Secretariat of the Government.


37
     Viandes foraines refers to meat from slaughterhouses sold outside of its place of origin.

                                                            78
2. Improvement of the socioeconomic impact of Pillar II projects targeting small farmers

The overall objective of Pillar II is to improve the socioeconomic impact of projects by improving
their governance and funding and establishing the legal and institutional framework governing
agro-processing (agrégation).

To that end, the Government adopted a participatory, inclusive, and transparent approach to
implement Pillar II projects. The Regional Agricultural Plans have provided the Ministry of
Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries with a clear road map that lays out a short-, medium-, and
long-term vision. The planned actions seek to strengthen good governance with a view to
ensuring ownership of projects and thus their sustainability.

This approach also helped ensure that small farmers in the target areas, including women and
young people, contributed to the decision-making and implementation process for Pillar II
projects. A project prioritization manual and a procedures manual are being drafted for this
purpose.

Improvements to the on-the-ground implementation procedures for Pillar II projects were
made as follows:

   -   The introduction of contracts as a prerequisite for implementation of Pillar II projects
       (circular dated February 23, 2012 disseminated to the Regional Agricultural
       Directorates, Province-level Agricultural Directorates, and the Regional Agricultural
       Development Office (ORMVA), calling on these entities to ensure compliance with a
       number of prerequisites prior to commitment of credit to Pillar II projects);
   -   The introduction of a new implementation procedure for Morocco Green Plan projects
       that stipulates, among other things, the strengthening of the participatory approach
       during all project phases;
   -   Decisions to appoint members of the Local Technical Committees (50 decisions relating
       to the Province-Level Technical Committees); and
   -   The integration of the environment and climate change component into the Morocco
       Green Plan.

This adaptation to the prevailing conditions helped create a climate of confidence with the
farmers, as evidenced by the year-on-year increase in the level of involvement and the
“influence? of the farmers and their Agricultural Professional Organization (OPA) in Pillar II
projects.

In 2010, five percent of small farmers benefited from Pillar II projects; by September 2012, this
figure had risen to over 25 percent. Furthermore, the percentage of new Pillar II projects
proposed by professional agricultural organizations jumped from 15 percent in 2010 to more
than 36 percent in 2012.



                                               79
In addition, an on-line monitoring and evaluation system for implementation of Pillar II projects
is being upgraded at both the central (ADA) and regional (DRA) levels, and will be based on
clearly defined reference indicators. To that end, a monitoring and evaluation framework
comprising results indicators for each Pillar II project has already been developed by ADA.

A circular from the Minister of Agriculture was also disseminated in the regions to communicate
the documents on Pillar II projects.

Similarly, the Government institutionalized the incentives provided to small farmers under the
agro-processing arrangements (agrégation): Law No. 04-12 on agricultural agro-processing
arrangements was published in the Official Gazette of August 2, 2012 and a decree regulating
government incentives for investments in agro-processing arrangements projects is being
published in this regard. The implementing decrees for this law are being drafted.

The model of agro-processing arrangements is based on the conclusion of a tripartite
agreement between the agro-processors, the small farmers involved in the agro-processing
arrangements (agrégés), and the Government seeks to help overcome existing land constraints,
promote small farmer organizations, encourage risk sharing, optimize production and
marketing links, and enable producers to gain access to financing, knowledge, and technologies.

3. Improvement of agricultural services

The general objective is to enhance the effectiveness of the agricultural innovation system and
strengthen the efficiency of sanitary food control:
    • Improved efficiency of the agricultural innovation system: the Government has already
       established structures (committees, working groups, etc.) and tasked them with
       monitoring program contracts signed with the sectors (vertical approach), which include
       all extension and training components. The Government of Morocco also decentralized
       the deconcentrated services of the Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries and
       the Chambers of Agriculture.

       It also created six regional centers for the National Institute for Agronomic Research,
       developed a legal framework for private agricultural advisors, and established the
       training center (CRP II) in Ifrane.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries launched the agricultural advisory services
with a view to supporting implementation of the Morocco Green Plan using a versatile
agricultural advisory mechanism that is based on the gradual autonomy of farmers and the
accountability of the actors.

The Government regulates and stimulates the development of private agricultural advisory
services, while remaining responsible for the provision of a public outreach service to farmers.
Private stakeholders are responsible for replicating government actions.


                                               80
The implementation of the agricultural council strategy launched in 2011 along with projects
currently being executed has produced the following results:
    - The establishment of the National Agricultural Council Board (Office National de Conseil
       Agricole ONCA): draft law 58-12 is in the process of being published;
    - The introduction of the strategy coordination and monitoring mechanism (PMO);
    - The modernization of the local network: rehabilitation and equipping of local structures;
       and
    - The establishment of the virtual agricultural knowledge network with the signing of an
       agreement between the MAPM and FAO for the establishment of the “VERCON project?
       virtual network.

In addition to the adoption of this strategy and with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of
the agricultural research and development system, a competitive financing mechanism for
applied research and extension projects (MCRDV) was established under the first DPL. National
and regional advisory committees were established to coordinate applied research, extension,
and training activities (horizontal approach), including activities not included in the program
contracts. These committees are composed of representatives of the public and private sectors
and civil society, and observe uniform rules of operation.

The MCRDV’s national coordination committee was established by the MAPM on October 20,
2011. To date, nine research and development projects have been identified, six of which were
selected by this committee for financing by the competitive mechanism. These projects will be
implemented over a three-year period (September 2012-September 2015). The budget
earmarked for this mechanism amounted to DH 6 million in 2012, and the sum of DH 7 million
has been projected for 2013.

   •   Establishment of an effective food safety control system. The Government of Morocco
       has already established the National Food Safety Office through Dahir No. 1-09-20 of 22
       Safar 1430 (February 18, 2009) promulgating Law No. 25-08 establishing the National
       Food Safety Office, and approved the Law on Food Safety. The program will therefore
       focus on the application of the implementing provisions and the necessary ensuing
       administrative actions. These actions would be bolstered by an integrated information
       and support campaign for consumers, producers, and agroindustrial enterprises.

4. Improvement of irrigation water use and management and of planning of hydro-
agricultural facilities

The following objectives are targeted:
- Improve the efficiency and sustainability of water use by farmers;
- Improve the performance of irrigation service operators; and
- Improve planning of hydro-agricultural facilities.




                                              81
The Government will take the following steps to achieve these objectives:
   • Continue efforts to promote the development of drip irrigation while encouraging
      farmers to declare their water abstraction with a view to more efficient and
      sustainable irrigation water use. The Government of Morocco has already significantly
      improved the incentive framework for drip and supplemental irrigation development
      with the introduction of a proactive policy to shift to irrigation water-saving techniques
      by modernizing public irrigation networks and providing substantial financial incentives
      for the purchase of on-farm irrigation equipment in order to galvanize the National
      Irrigation Water Conservation Program (Programme National d'Economie d'Eau en
      Irrigation PNEEI).

The Government implemented measures to supplement this incentive framework by revising
the farmer participation rate in the cost of off-farm irrigation network modernization
equipment and by requiring farmers receiving subsidies to comply with the law on water
abstraction. In this connection, the decree and directive regulating government aid for drip
irrigation were published and a draft amendment of Law No. 23-97 is being submitted to the
Secretariat General of the Government for its approval.

       •   Improve the technical and financial performance of irrigation service operators
           with a view to ensuring the efficiency and sustainability of hydro-agricultural
           facilities. The Government of Morocco recently launched a comprehensive structural
           reform of decentralized and deconcentrated services in order to provide a clearer
           vision of the future of the irrigation water service within ORMVAs and the conditions
           for providing efficient and sustainable water services.

The projected reform provides for an overhaul of the deconcentrated services of the
Department and Regional Agricultural Development Offices by integrating them into the 16
Regional Agricultural and Rural Development Offices. These offices will be tasked with
contributing to the updating and development of the Regional Agricultural Plans and ensuring
the implementation of these plans and the Regional Rural Development Plans, and will be
responsible for delegated management on behalf of the Government and regional and local
authorities.

The reform also establishes the conditions for managerial and financial autonomy of the
irrigation service. Plans are therefore in place to entrust management of the water services to
an independently managed subsidiary of a limited liability company that will be responsible for
the operation and maintenance of the irrigation networks, as well as management of the water
service in the areas currently managed by the Regional Agricultural Development Offices. This
subsidiary’s relationship with the Government and the ORDAR will be governed by an
agreement that will ensure that revenues are allocated for the operation and maintenance of
the networks, with a view to improving the water service and guaranteeing the sustainability of
the hydro-agricultural facilities. Relationships with users will be governed by water supply
contracts to provide quality water services based on a rate structure that will cover service
costs.

                                              82
Actions to be taken under this second DPL will entail the introduction for approval
(Transmission to Secretariat General of the Government) of 16 draft laws pertaining to the
establishment of the Regional Agricultural and Rural Development Offices and the transfer to a
subsidiary of provision of water services in the irrigated areas managed by the ORMVAs, with a
view to ensuring their financial and managerial autonomy.

      •    Ensure coherence of irrigation investments with water mobilization investments in
           order to use available water more efficiently. The Government has planned an
           irrigation development program downstream of existing dams with a view to reducing
           the gap between areas dominated by dams and areas with irrigation networks.
           Proposed actions seek to anticipate potential gaps that could develop subsequent to the
           planned construction of new dams, through the establishment of investment plans and
           feasibility studies on the irrigation systems.

IV-       Monitoring and Implementation Arrangements for the Reform Program

In addition to the operational monitoring and evaluation of the program to be carried out by
the Strategy and Statistics Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries,
the steering committee, which was established under the first DPL in the Ministry of General
Affairs and Governance, will be responsible for the interministerial coordination and strategic
monitoring of its implementation. This committee is composed of representatives of the
government ministries and organizations involved in the program, namely, the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and
New Technologies, the National Food Safety Office, and the Agency for Agricultural
Development.

Mindful of the need to secure buy-in of the objectives and implementation arrangements for
the Morocco Green Plan, the Government of Morocco intends to design a communication
strategy that will include messages and identify the target groups and appropriate resources
required to achieve this goal.

Given the scale of this reform program, the continuation of an ongoing effort, the Government
of Morocco is counting on your institution’s support through a Development Policy Loan.

I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to thank you for the World Bank’s interest in the
development of this sector.

Very truly yours,

The Minister of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries

ANNEX 6: FUND RELATIONS NOTE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Morocco
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 13/13
February 5, 2013

On February 1, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Morocco1: 42

Background

Morocco has a track record of strong macroeconomic policies that, over the last decade,
contributed to solid growth, low inflation, comfortable external reserves, financial deepening,
and poverty reduction. These favorable developments have helped Morocco cushion the impact
of the international crisis and respond to pressing social needs. In the context of political
transitions in many countries in the region and high social demands, a new constitution was
adopted in July 2011 in order to pave the way for broad-ranging political changes and reforms,
including strengthened roles for the head of government and Parliament. Morocco’s positive
record helped it qualify last August for a 24-month arrangement under the Precautionary and
Liquidity Line (PLL), which aims to provide insurance against external shocks. More recently,
this performance has been challenged by a deteriorating external environment and, in 2012, poor
rainfall. Growth is expected to slow in 2012 to 3.2 percent, largely due to a lower-than-average
cereal crop, but nonagricultural GDP growth is projected to remain robust at around 4.5 percent.
Headline inflation has remained subdued at 1.6 percent (year-on-year) in November 2012,
despite significant increases in the prices of several subsidized energy products in June, as part
of the government’s effort to contain the fiscal cost of subsidies. Core inflation (excluding food
and transport) was close to zero due to the large negative contribution of lower communication
tariffs. Despite relatively strong growth, unemployment has remained around 9 percent since
2010.

The fiscal deficit should decline to about 6 percent of GDP in 2012, thanks to a combination of
measures notably the increase in some energy-administered prices in June and the control of
nonessential spending. Delays in the adoption of the 2012 budget and in disbursement of
external grants resulted in lower-than-projected investment. This, in turn, helped offset the
subsidy bill that reached about 6.2 percent of GDP. The 2013 budget envisions a further
reduction of the deficit by 1.4 percent point of GDP to 4.7 percent of GDP. For the medium
term, the authorities aim at a deficit below 3 percent of GDP.

  Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

                                                         95
The current account deficit is expected to increase to 8.8 percent of GDP in 2012 as import
growth, pushed by energy-related imports, outpaced slow export growth. Tourism receipts and
remittances are projected to fall slightly relative to 2011, reflecting the deterioration in the
European economy. While gross international reserves (GIR) fell steadily in 2011 and most of
2012, they stabilized at around four months of imports in the last quarter. The issuance of a
US$1.5 billion sovereign bond at favorable terms in late 2012 provided additional support in this
regard.

Monetary conditions have remained broadly supportive. Lower international reserves had a
substantial restrictive impact on bank liquidity, contributing to slowing credit growth to 7
percent in 2012. To help fill the liquidity shortage, the central bank stepped up its liquidity
injection, including by extending eligible collateral for its repo. The policy interest rate was cut
by 0.25 percentage point to 3 percent in March 2012 and has remained unchanged since then. In
September 2012, it also cut its reserve requirements for banks by 2 percentage points to 4
percent.

Morocco’s social indicators have improved over the past decade. Higher economic growth,
lower unemployment, better health and educational outcomes, better access to basic
infrastructure, and a marked reduction in poverty rates are tangible evidence of the progress
made in fostering inclusive growth. However, unemployment remains high particularly among
the youth. The authorities’ reform agenda includes measures to boost potential growth, tackle
inequalities in the distribution of income and access to health care, particularly across regions as
well as reduce unemployment.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the authorities for their overall sound macroeconomic policies,
which, over the past decade, have helped deliver solid growth, low inflation, and poverty
reduction despite continued high youth unemployment. This strong performance has been
challenged recently by external and domestic shocks in a context of pressing social demands.
Directors agreed that the authorities’ program of fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary and
financial policies, and structural reforms to boost competitiveness and inclusive growth and
rebuild shock buffers is appropriate to deal with these challenges. They emphasized that the
outlook hinges on the timely and sustained implementation of the reform agenda.

Directors welcomed the fiscal consolidation envisioned in the 2013 budget and beyond to help
maintain external and fiscal sustainability, while emphasizing that consolidation should be as
growth-friendly as possible. They welcomed the steps being taken toward reforming the subsidy
system, and called on the authorities to move ahead resolutely in this area to aid medium-term
fiscal adjustment and better assist the most vulnerable groups of the population. Directors also
stressed the importance of moving ahead with pension reform to ensure the system’s viability.
They encouraged a careful approach to fiscal decentralization so as not to increase fiscal risks.
They welcomed plans to lower the ratio of the government wage bill to GDP and accelerate tax
reforms. Directors concurred that clear communications and high-quality social dialogue will be
key to successful implementation of the fiscal reform agenda.



                                                 96
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance to be appropriate. They encouraged the
authorities to move toward greater exchange rate flexibility to enhance external competitiveness
and the economy’s ability to absorb shocks, in coordination with other macroeconomic and
structural policies.

Directors called for stepped-up efforts to foster higher and more inclusive growth, including by
boosting youth employment and reducing inequalities in income and in access to health care and
education. They underscored the importance of structural reforms to enhance external
competitiveness and diversify the export base. They welcomed planned reforms to improve the
business climate and promote small and medium-sized enterprises, both crucial to accelerate
private-sector-led growth.

Directors noted that the financial sector remains sound overall. They commended the
authorities’ efforts to further strengthen financial regulation and supervision, particularly in light
of increasing international exposure of Moroccan banks. In this regard, they welcomed the
authorities’ interest in an Financial Sector Assessment Program update. Directors encouraged
the authorities to strengthen legislation against money laundering and terrorism financing, and to
intensify reforms to promote financial development and deepening.

Directors agreed that Morocco continues to meet the qualification criteria for a Precautionary
and Liquidity Line (PLL) arrangement. They noted that the arrangement provides useful
insurance against exogenous shocks and that the program supported by the PLL is on track.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to continue to treat the PLL as precautionary.

     Source: Government of Morocco and staff calculation and estimate
     1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
     2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
     denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
     3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
     4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
     5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
     6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
     7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
     8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
     9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
     10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
