SUBjECTs    Project Completion Report on Kenya
Nairobi Third Water Supply Engineering Project
(Credit 1566-RE)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Kenya - Nairobi Third
Water Supply Engineering Project (Credit 1566-KE)" prepared by the Infrastructure
Operations Division, Country Department II of the Africa Regional Office with
Part II contributed by the Borrower.
The project aims at providing technical asoistance in the preparation
of long-torm plans for the development of Nairobi' e water supply system aud its
resource and demand management and designing the next (third) Implementation
phase for possible Bank funding. The project also included capacity building
within the Water and Sewerage Department of the Nairobi City Council.
The project achieved its principal objective, preparation of a'future
project that is now under implementation. Other important achievements were the
comprehensive training program and the carrying out of oparation, smagement and
finance studies. The follow-on implementation of these efforts was not totally
successful, e.g. the decision on tariff increase was substantially delayed, and
the improvements identified for City's Council computer center had to be deferred
to the subsequent investment project.
Overall,  the project outcome is rated as satisfactory.   Its
institutional achievements are rated as partial and the sustainability of its
benefits as likely, mostly on account'of the project's successful implementation
of the training program.
The PCR is of good quality and provides an accurAte account of
project's achievements. The project is scheduled to be audited as part of a
cluster of two water projects in Nairobi.

This is a Project Completion Report (PCP) for the Nairobi Third Water Supply
Engineering Project, for which Credit No. 1S66-KE in the amount of SDR 6,20 million (UJS$
6.00 million equivalent) was approved on March 26, 1985. The Credit was closed on June 30,
1991, three years behind schedule. The last disbursement was on October 1, 1991, and the
undisbursed balance of SDR 0.04 million (US$ 0.06 million) was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrascture Operations Division of the Eastern Africa
Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and Ill). Part II was prepared on behaf of the
Borrower, the Nairobi City Council (NCC) by its Water and Sewerage Department (WSD).
Preparation of this PCR was carried out in March/April 1993, and is based ih   alh  on
the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit and Project Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower and interni Bank memoranda. Parts I and
MI were sent to the Borrower on April 15, 1993, and Part II was received on June 25, 1993.

Backgrolnf and Epject pein
1.    Development of the water supply system of Nairobi bad genealy kept pace with the
growing demand. Ihe last major expansion, substatlSly completed in 1983, was made with
financial assisance from the bank (Second Nairobi Waw Supply Project, Loan 1520-KE). This
project incrsed the water supply capacity to about 230,000 mlday, which was expected to meet
the demands up to 1987. The Government requested the Bank in mid-1983 to support the
preparation of the next, third phase expansion of the Nairobi sysem. A PPF advance of US$ 1.0
million was provided in July 1984, for financing the early phase of the consutancy worL
2.    Isiuonally, Nairobi's waer system was managed by the Water and Sewerage
Departmet (WSD) of the Nakobi City Commission (NCC). WSD had shown a decling
performance during the implementation of the second phase project, maiy due to shortag of
experienced staff. However, WSD's financial position, in contrast with NCC's overall financial
position was strong and efforts were made to recruit new staff, to mainain and Improve WSD's
operational and project implementon capacity.
3.    The need for a third extension phase of Nairobi's water supply as part of the Nairobi city
long term development plan was clearly identified during the appraisal of the previous project.
The project design therefore provided for (a) preparation of a long term program to manage wat
resources (and demands) on a regional basis; (b) detadled desIgns for the third phase extensiou;
and (c) substantial assistace and taing program for WSD's manpower developmet.
ImpemenSion Expriec
4.    The project start-up and early progress was satisory and the project coept ("project
definition") was presented by the Consultants in October 1985, and after some addional
refinement was agreed to in January 1986. Progress on the detailed engineering design, however,
was slower than expected and by late 1987, it became clear that even If the follow-on project
could be appraised in 1988, its implemention could only commence in 1989 at the earliest, and
completion would take at least 4 - 5 yeas. It was proposed, therore, to change the planning
horizon from 1995 to 2000 - 2005. The subsequent redesigp of some part of the fure Project
(notably to increase the capacity of the treatment works and the transmission mains) sted In
early 1988, together with the reassessment of the enviroental impact of dhe project and the
preparation of the Environmental Action Program. The design modifications were ready by end-
March 1988, and the future project was appraised in June 1988.
5.    The Operation, Maintenance and Fiac  (OMF) Study was caried out simultaneously
with the ft phase of engineering consultacy, and provided a usel base for WSD's



reorganizaon, preparation of a suitable training program and for the redesign of the structure of
water and sewerage tariffs. Specialist consultants were also appointed to review and assess the
needs for upgrading NCC's computer center.
Pa)iect Resuts
6.    Overall, the Project was successfl in meeting Its principal objective, i.e., the preparation
of the future project. The train  component of the Project has been successful and helped to
overcome the chronic staffig problem of the organizatun with intensive training on all levels and
undoubtedly Improved WSD's operational effick:icy. Less successful was the improvement of
NCC's computer facilities (shared with WSD) which was finally deferred to the main Investment
project.
7.    WSD's financial performance was satisfactory during the project period, and it was able
to build up sufficient reserves to contribute over US$ 100 million equivalent to the main
investment project. By mid-1986, NCC reduced its liabilities to the Water Fund (resulted from
NCC's unuthorized use of war and sewerage revenues for other purposes) to KSI 50 milion,
and the tariffs were increased by an average of 40% in FY87/88. NCC, however, began to drain
agai substantial amounts from the Water Fund in FY88/89 and its condtued use of this source
led i=Ab6 to the suspension of disbursements under the Tlird Nairobi Water Supply Ptoject
(October 1992).
ftWect Sutialj
S.    WSD had a commendable record in maintning and opeaing Nairobi's water supply and
sewerage systems, even in periods of financial difficulties and manpower shoraes. However,
without a solid financial and institutional base, sustainiity of water supply and sewerage
services could be in danger. The major risks in this regard are:
(a)   delay in introducing tariff increases as and when required - a 35% taiff increae
was introduced in 1984, and another 40% in 1987 - however, this has not been
followed by any futher increase to date J1;
(b)   contumed use of the Water fund to finance NCC's operations other than water and
sewerage services - NCC's liabilties to the Water Fund were reduced to KSh 50
million by 1988 (apprisal of the follow-on investnt project). The unauthrized
use of these Funds, however, has continued periodically thereafte which resulted
In insufficient zasb flow for WSD to finance its contribution to the project costs;
and
(c)   inefficient billing and collection - at the time of the appraisal of this project, the
arrears amounted to about 120 days of billing; these increased to about 250 days
by 1989. It is estiated that about 60% of the unpaid bills belong to ministries
and other government institutions. Efforts have been made to improve the billing
1/    At end-March 1993, when this PCR report was prepared, a tariff increase had been
approved but not yet put Into effect.

the closing date of this project.

9.    The main technical. objective of the engineering project, L.e., the preparation of
preinvestment studies and detailed engineering designs for a future investment project was met,
although the project scope (design horizon) had to be extended in mid-ream, which resulted in
some delays in the actual start-up of the main project.
10.   The "institutional" objective of the project was only partially met. The training
component was successful and WSD's institutional capacity improved. Because of the
institutional and financial wealness of NCC, which was not adequately addressed in the
Engineering Credit, NCC remained to a great extent dependent financially on the revenues from
water and sewerage operations: hence its repeated unauthorized use of the Water Fund.
II.   Project implemenion, from start to substni completion took 6 years (verus the 3
year program as originally enisaged), although project funds in the las 2 yeanr were utilized
manly for training.
12.   In summary the main lessons leared are:
(a)    Training of the Borrower's staff in procurement procedures and thorough review
of procurement documents are essential to avoid delays in project implemeion
(b)    The risks amsociated with the performance of the Borrower (NCC) were
underestimaed compared to its principal project implementig arm (WSD). The
Bank should have been more decisive in exercising its remedies for non-
compliance with the credit covenants. Although implementation of the investment
project itself has been good, disbursements under the follow-on main project
(Ihird Nairobi Water Supply Project, Cr. 2060-KE, which became effctive in
March 1990) were suspended in October 1992, because of govemment faiure to
raise tariffs, continued NCC borrowing from the Water Fund, and continued
problems with arrears to WSD.
(c)   It is clear that the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Department should be an
independent public (or private) entity, if it ever is to be allowed to become a
financially self-sustning organzation.

1.    Kenya's economy In the early 1980's was adversely affected by the droughts in 1979/80
and 1983/84. Although industrial growth was still at a reasonable level of 3.5% per annum,
naricultural output stagnated. Migration to urban areas increased; overall urban growth wan-about
7% per annum, increasing the need for urban services.
2.    Development of the water supply system of Nairobi had generally kept pace with the
growing demand. The last major expansion, subsnially completed in 1983 was made with
fincial sistance from the Bank (Second Nairobi Water Supply Project, Loan 1520-KE). This
project increased the water supply capacity to Nairobi to about 230,000 m3lday, which was
expected to meet the demands up to 1987.
3.    It was against this background that Government requested the Bank in mid-1983 to
support the preparation of the next, third phase expansion of the Nairobi system. A PPF advance
of US$ 1.0 million was provided (request date: May 18, 1984, approval date: July 5, 1984) for
financing the early phase of the consultancy work.
4.    Institutionally, Nairobi's water system was managed by the Water and Sewerage
Department (WSD) of the Nairobi City Commission (NCC). WSD had shown a declining
performance during the implementation of the second phase project, mainiy due to shortage of
experienced staff. However, WSD's financial position was strong, in contrast with NCC's overall
financial situation which had rapidly declined since 1974/75. NCC, in order to meet its financial
obligations made unauthorized use of the revenues generated by water supply and sewerage
services (Water Fund) until 1983/84. After the dismissal of the Nairobi City Council in 1983, the
appointed City Commission made considerable efforts to repay its liabilities to the Water Fund,
and the water and sewerage tariffs were raised by 35% on the average to enable WSD to
contribute to the preparation of a future project.

C.    Pect Objectives and Descr:ton
5.    The main objectives of the Engineering Project were to:
(a)    prepare a project which would meet Nairobi's rapidly expanding water demands
up to the mid-1990's;
(O)    strengthen the operations and financial management of WSD to undertake the third
phase Investment;
(c)    assist NCC in improving the performance of its Financial Department and its
computer facilities;
(d)    assist in the preparation of a long-term program to manage water resources on a
regional basis;
(e)    assess Nairobi's sewerage and sanitation requirements.
Project Descipution
6.    The main components of the Project were:
(a)    consultancy services for
(i)     feasibility studies;
(1i)     detailed engineering designs (including contract packagig and prepaation
of bid documents);
(iii)    associated studies for environmental assessment and preparation of an
EAP; and
(iv)     dam expert panel.
(b)   technical assistance and training for NCC and WSD, including:
(i)     institutional (operational, management and financial studies);
0i)      improvement to NCC's computer center;
(ii)     manpower development through long- and short-term training.

7.    The need for a third expansion phase of Nairobi's water supply as part of the Nairobi City
long-term water development plan, was clearly identified during the appraisal of the Second



-3.
Nairobi Water Supply Project in 1977 1/. At that time, it proved economical to defer
construction of an expensive dam and storage reservoir for at least seven years to a later phase, to
be prepared under thbis engineering credit. The feasibility study phase of the Project was designed
to rewiew and supplement the previous studies ("project definition") together with the grepaation
of a long term prog=         , MA     watr resources rand demands) on a regional basis. Detailed
desigm were to be prepared In Xt following phase.
8.    The project also provided for (a) an independent dam expert panel, and (b) an
environmental impact assessment study.
9.    Due to a two-year delay in final commissioning of the previous project, changes in the
City's administrative structure, and senior personnel changes in the policy making levels of the
parent Ministry of Local Government (MLG), the forward planning for the third expansion phase
fell behind schedule. In order to speed implementation, a high level interministerial committee
was established. NCC with government support appointed consultants to carry out the
preinvestment studies and subsequent detailed engineering. To assist the Government and NCC
recover project momentum, the Bank approved in July 1984 a PPF advance of US$ 1.0 million
to help finance the early phase of the consultancy 2/.
10.   The Borrower was the Republic of Kenya. The credit amount was on-lent to the Nairobi
City Commission, and direct responsibility for the project implementation lay with its Water and
Sewerage Department. Prior to appraisal, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within WSD
was strengthened with additional staff and detailed job descriptions were prepared for the
members of the unit. In order to ensure project sustainability, special emphasis was given in the
project design to the Operation, Management and Finance (OMF) Study (carried out by specialist
subconsultants), and to the training component. To ensure WSD's finncial viability, a 35% tariff
increase was approved (see also para. 4) and NCC gradually reduced Its outstanding obligation to
the Water Fund.
13.    Projec Implementaion
11.   The Project was appraised in late 1984, approved by the Board on March 26, 1985 l/,
and became effective on August 21, 1985. The engineering consultants had started work already
in mid-1984 financed partially through the PPF advance (see also para. 9). The early progress
was satisfactory and the project concept ("project definition") was first presented by the
Consultants in October 1985, and after some additional refinement was agreed to in January 1986.
Progress on the detailed engineering designs, however, was slower than expected and by late 1987
it became clear that, even if the follow on project could be appraised in 1988, its implementation
could only commence in 1989 at the earliest, and (substantial) completion would take at least 4 -5
years. WSD, therefore, proposed to change the planning horizon from 1995 to 2000 - 2005. Te
Bank (and the cofinanciers) agreed to the proposal, and the work to redesign some parts of the
future Project (notably to increase the capacity of the treaunent works and the transmission mains)

started in early 1988, together with the reassessment of the environmental impact of the project
and the preparation of the EAP. The design modifications were ready by end-March 1988, and
the future project was appraised in June 1988 4/.
12.   The OMP Study, carried out by specialist subconsultants, was completed by end-1986.
The findings and recommendatiow; provided a useful base for VWSD's reorganization, preparation
of a suitable training program and for the redesign of the structure of water and sewerage tariffs.
However, the recommendations in regard to institutional restructuring - particularly the split of
water supply and sewerage were not realistic and the training proposal did not explore local
opportunities.
13.   NCC/WSD also appointed consultants to review and assess the needs for upgrading
NCC's computer center. This consultancy resulted in some improvement but did not achieve its
ultimate objective of upgrading and extending the computer facilities to adequately cope with both
NCC and WSD's needs. An independent computer center for WSD is now being set-up, under
the main investment project; however, the existing arrangement of sharing the capacity of the
computer facilities has had an adverse effect on WSD's billing and revenue collection operations.
14.   In order to reduce losses in the system (which were as high as 35% to 40% after the
completion of the second phase project) WSD on its own also hired consultants for leak detection
and control. his proved to be very useful in reducing the losses and improving WSD's
operational efficiency, and was later incorporated in the Engineering Project E/.
15.   The training component of the Project has been successful. A special training program,
tailored to the needs of WSD, was provided by IRCU f/, mostly for mid-and lower-level staff.
About 20 professional staff were sponsored to participate in 12 to 18 month diploma and/or
M.Sc. courses, and 13 other staff attended relevant short courses (I to 3 months). This training
program helped to overcome the chronic staffing problem of the organization, and undoubtedly
improved WSD's operational efficiency.
16.   In mid-1986, because of the rapid depreciation of the US$ versus the £Stg (the currency
of payment of foreign costs under the consultancy contract), to ensure availability of funds for
foreign cost payments, agreement was reached that NCCJWSD would not seek the reimbursement
of 50% of local expenditures which were to be financed by the Credit. In addition, for the same
reason, WSD did not use project funds for the local (IRCU) training component.
F.     rject ReBslts
17.   Overall, the Project was successful in meeting its principal objective i.e., the preparation
of the future project, and providing adequate training to ease WSD's long-lasting staffing
problems. Less successful was the improvement of NCC's computer facilities (shared with WSD))
which was finally deferred to the main investment project.

18.   WSD's financial performance was satisfactory during the project period, and it was able
to build up sufficient reserves to contribute over US$ 100 million equivalent to the follow-on
main investment project 21. By mid-1986, NCC reduced its liabilities to the Water Fund to
KSH 50 million, and the water and sewerage tariffs were increased by an average 40% in FY
87/88. NCC, however, began to drain again substantial amounts from the Water Fund in
FY88/89 and its continued use of this source led inter alia, to the suspension of disbursements
under the Third Nairobi Water Supply Project (October 1992).
19.   The Closing of the Credit was extended by 3 years and the Credit actually closed on June
30, 1991. 85% of the funds were disbursed by June 1989. The remaining 15% was utilized
mostly for the T.A. and training component.
20.   No economic rate of return was calculated for the engineering project.
G.    Project Sustainability
21.   WSD had a commendable record in maintaining and operating Nairobi's water supply and
sewerage systems, even in periods of financial difficulties and manpower shortages. However,
without a solid financial and institutional base sustainability of water supply and sewerage services
could be in danger. The major risks in i - regard are:
(a)    delay in introducing tariff increases as and when required - a 35% tariff increase
was introduced in 1984, and another 40% in 1987 - however, this has not been
followed by any further increase to date I/;
(b)    continued use of the Water fund to finance NCC's operations other than water and
sewerage services - NCC's liabilities to the Water Fund were reduced to KSh 50
million by 1988 (appraisal of the follow-on investment project). The unauthorized
use of these Funds, however, has continued periodically thereafter which resulted
in insufficient cash flow for WSD to finance its contribution to the project costs;
and
(c)   inefficient billing and collection - at the time of the appraisal of this project, the
arrears amounted to about 120 days of billing; these increased to about 250 days
by 1989. It is estimated that about 60% of the unpaid bills belong to ministries
and other government institutions. Efforts have been made to improve the billing
cycle, but sufficient improvement in collection of revenues was not achieved by
the closing date of this project.
22.   Non-compliance with the financial covenants in regard of above, led to the suspension of
disbursements under the Third Nairobi Water Supply Project. In the period of October 1992 to
March 1993, although considerable efforts were made to improve WSD's financial position,
2/    WSD's financial data (balance sheets and income statements) for the project period,
included in Part III, Clause E, demonstrate WSD's underlying finacial viability.

introduction of overdue tariff increase, sufficient repayments to the Water Fund, and reduction of
arrears to 150 days by mid-1993, are still awaited.

23.   The performance of both the Bank and the Borrower was satsfactory during the
preparation and early (feasibility) phase of the project. WSD's performance in the technic&'
preparation and extension of the design horizon was excellent.
24.   During the detailed engineering design phase more attention and assistance to WSD by the
Bank staff in the preparation of bids and contract documents might have helped to avoid delays in
procurement. Project supervision was generally satisfactory.
25.   WSD's financial (cash flow) problems are related more to the follow-on investment
project, which ran simultaneously with the engineering project in the period 1989-91. WSD's
underlying financial strength was demonstrated by the fact that reimbursement request for local
cost was substantially reduced to save IDA funds for foreign payments. Revenue collection
performance was WSD's weakest spot; it stemmed partially from the inefficient computer
faciities (biling problems), but also to a large degree from political interference, and weak
financial management.

27.   The engineering consultant performance was mediocre. lle major problems were (a)
timely review/revision of the project scope as a result of extended design horizon; (b)
underemated costs of certain contracts; and (c) inadequate quality of bid documents and
handling of procurement matters on behalf of NCCIWSD.

28.   No staff appraisal report was prepared for this project. The President's Report (No. P-
3943-KE) was however, sufficiently detailed for the purpose of the engineering project.
29.   Record keeping by WSD and its Project hnplementation Unit (PIU) was satisfactory, after
an initial period. The quality of project accounts has also been generally satisfactory.
L.    Findings and Lessons Leared
30.   The main -technical' objective of the engineering project, i.e., the preparation of
preinvestment studies and detailed engineering designs for a future investment project was met,
although the project scope (design horizon) had to be extended in mid-stream, which resulted in
some delays in the actual start-up of the main project.
31.   The "institutional- objective of the project was only partially met. The training
component was successful and WSD's institutional capacity improved. Because of the



-7 -
institutional and financial weakness of NCC, which was not adequately addressed in the
Engineering Credit, NCC remained to a great extent dependent financially on the revenues from
water and sewerage operations: hence its repeated unauthorized use of the Water Fund.
32.   Project implementation, from start to substantial completion took 6 years (versus the 3
year program as originally envisaged), although project funds in the last 2 years were utilized
mainly for training.
33.   In summary the main lessons learned are:
(a)    Training of the Borrower's staff in procurement procedures and thorough review
of procurement documents are essential to avoid delays in project implementation;
(b)    The risks associated with the performance of the Borrower (NCC) were
underestimated compared to its principal project implementing arm (WSD). The
Bank should have been more decisive in exercising its remedies for non-
compliance with the credit covenants. Although implementation of the investment
project itself has been good, disbursements under the follow-on main project
(Third Nairobi Water Supply Project, Cr. 2060-KE, which became effective in
March 1990) were suspended in October 1992, because of government failure to
raise tariffs, continued NCC borrowing from the Water Fund, and condnued
problems with arrears to WSD.
(c)   It is clear that the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Departnent should be an
independent public (or private) entity, if it ever is to be allowed to become a
financially self-sustaining organization.



PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Comments
1.    The Bank's (Part 1) of the project review is considered to be reasonably accurate and
describes the project design and implementation stages adequately. However, there are some
comments andlor clarifications on-Part I that need to be stated here.
2.    The tariff increase was made in May 1993 of 37%.
3.    The arrears build-up resulted from a combination of errors in billing, increase in quantity
of water sold and increase in tariff. This made the arrears due from the 60% who were not
paying bills, to increase.
4.    The delays in procurement could have been reduced if the Bank's response and/or
comments on contract documents were made quickly and on time. In some cases, the Bank;s
response took very long to be received and this could have been speeded up. However, Nairobi
City CouncilJWater and Sewerage Department received a lot of professional advice from the Task
Manger and this helped to minimize delays.
5.    The relationship between Nairobi City Council/Water Sewerage Department and the Bank
was cooperative and candid during the project.
6.    The technical objective of the project was achieved and detailed designs of the project
scope became available for the project's implementation.
7.    The development of the Water and Sewerage Department institutional set up commenced
and with a vigorous staff development through training, it continues to be stronger and more able
to manage the tasks assigned to Water and Sewerage Department.
8.    The financial viability of the Water and Sewerage Department will depend upon its being
able to produce and market water and sewerage services at least cost, irrespective of whether it is
an independent public or private entity.
9.    The data in Part m are noted. It is, however, not clear whether the report should have
covered the period to end of engineering credit closing date or not. This is because some of the
events relate to periods beyond the closing date of engineering credit 30th June, 1991.
B.    Review from Borrower's Perslective
10.   The project was successful in preparing the designs and procurement documents for the
project and these have since been used in the physical implementation of the project The design
period for the project was changed to a longer period in 1987, since the project would generate
greater benefits. This also has assured the future Water Supply Plans for Nairobi beyond the year
2005 - 2010. The training element was very successful and contributed effectively to the
management of the Water and Sewerage Department in particular and Nairobi City Council in
general. The issues that were the subject of the October 1992 suspension have been addressed,
and it is expected the suspension will be lifted during the third quarter of 1993.
