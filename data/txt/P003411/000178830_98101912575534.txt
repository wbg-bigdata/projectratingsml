NORTH CHINA PLAIN AGRICULTURE PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The project would be the first integrated large-scale attack on
soil salinity and waterlogging in China. It would serve as a model for
future agricultural developments in the North China Plain where crop
production is affected by salinity and waterlogging. The project would
provide drainage and irrigation for about 200,000 ha, covering parts of nine
counties, and would also include agricultural inputs and support services to
increase productivity. A population of over 1.2 million, or about 280,000
farm families, would benefit directly from the project through increased
production of crops such as wheat, corn, cotton, oilseeds, rice, and
earnings from tree planting. The project would also lead to annual foreign
exchange savings of about US$70 million.
1.02      This report is based on the findings of a preparation mission
which visited China in November 1980 comprising W.T. Smith, T. Daves,
R.C.Y. Ng, W.P. Ting (IDA), M. Fireman, and K. Anderson (Consultants); a
preappraisal mission in May/June 1981, comprising W.P. Ting, S.J. Khoo, V. Li
(IDA), K. Anderson, J.K. Wang and T.B. Wiens (Consultants); and an appraisal
mission in October 1981 comprising W.P. Ting, S.J. Khoo, V. Li (IDA),
C. Houston, and T.B. Wiens (Consultants).
The Agriculture Sector /1
1.03      Agriculture, including livestock, forestry and fisheries is one of
the most important economic sectors in China. It provides sustenance to
nearly 1 billion people and is the main source of livelihood for a rural
population of some 800 million, and accounts for over 30% of the country's
GDP. Agricultural production is carried out by farmers organized into
collective units under the commune system and on state farms. Part of the
production also comes from privately-controlled household plots.
1.04      Agriculture in China is dominated by foodgrain production, which
accounts for some 65% of total agricultural output, and 80% of its cropland.
/1 For more details on China's agriculture sector, see China: Socialist
Economic Development, Annex C: Agricultural Development, Report
No. 3391-CHA.



- 2 -
Despite the country's vast land area of about 960 million ha, only about
10.4% or 100 million ha are arable. The ratio of population to ha of arable
land is just under 10. Thus farming is intensive, with very high inputs of
labor, extensive use of chemical and organic fertilizers, and considerable
development of irrigation and drainage. Just under half of the arable land
is irrigated. China accounts for less than 8% of the world's arable land but
provides food for about 22% of the world's population. This has been made
possible because of the generally high standards of crop production.
1.05      Foodgrains.  The major foodgrains are rice, maize and wheat, which
accounted for about 45%, 18% and 17% respectively of total foodgrain produc-
tion during 1977-79. Soybean, sorghum and millet, which are foodgrains of
lesser importance, together accounted for about 7% of total foodgrain output.
Foodgrain production during the 1970s increased at an average of more than 3%
p.a. from 240 million tons in 1970 to 332 million tons in 1979. The increase
resulted mainly from changes in the cropping pattern in favor of the
foodgrains which have relatively higher yields, the significant expansion of
pump irrigation in the Chang Jiang Basin and North China Plain, and increased
use of chemical fertilizers. Foodgrain production was further boosted in 1978
and 1979 by policy changes which provided increased incentives for producers
(para. 1.27) and favorable weather conditions, so that output in those years
increased by an average annual rate of over 8%. However, production in 1980
declined to 318 million tons from the record 1979 crop of 332 million tons
due to poor weather conditions. In recent years, gains in food output have
not kept pace with the increase in demand due to growth in population and
incomes and increased feedgrain requirements for livestock. The country
imported 10.5 million tons of foodgrains in 1979 (1.2 million tons over 1978)
or about 3% of total consumption. Grain agreements with major supplier
countries indicate that grain imports will range from 12-16 million tons for
the next few years.
1.06      Oilseeds.  Among the more important oilseeds in China are ground-
nuts, rapeseed, sesame seed, sunflower seed, and linseed./l The area sown to
oilseeds increased from 4.5 million ha in 1970 to 8.0 million ha in 1980 and
production increased from 3.8 to 7.7 million.tons during the period. Despite
this growth, China imported 0.8 million tons of oilseeds in 1979 and levels of
per capita oil availability remain low relative to requirements.
1.07      Cash Crops.  These crops include cotton, jute, sugarcane, tea, mul-
berry (for sericulture), fruits, vegetables and tobacco. Cotton, the most
important, accounted for 4.9 million ha or 38% of the area sown to cash crops
in 1980. The 1980 crop of 2.7 million tons of lint was a new record.
However, production has been insufficient to meet domestic demand as reflected
in the increasing levels of cotton imports in recent years. Imports in 1979
/1 Soybeans in China are not included among the oil-bearing crops but among
foodgrains.

amounted to 480,000 tons. China is now the world's largest importer of
cotton.
1.08      Livestock.  Animal husbandry accounts for about 13% of the value of
agricultural output. Meat production, largely pork, increased by about 16%
p.a. in 1977-80, compared with 3.4% p.a. in 1957-77. Reasons for the rapid
increase were higher feedgrain allocations and improved producer incentives.
The country's livestock production is dominated by pigs and poultry reared in
private plots under intensive systems, integrated with crop production and
concentrated in regions with dense population and easy access to markets.
With 320 million head in 1979, the country's pig population is the largest in
the world. Other livestock includes sheep, goats, cattle and camels, which
are found largely on the extensive grasslands in the north and western border
regions.
1.09      Fisheries.  Total fisheries production increased from 3.2 million
tons in 1970 to 4.3 million tons in 1979 or about 3% p.a. Production in
recent years, however, has declined, due to a decrease in capture fishery
production. Marine fisheries accounted for about 76% and inland fisheries 24%
of total production during 1977-79. About three-fourths of the production
from inland waters is derived from the culture of fisheries in ponds. This
kind of fish culture has a long tradition in China and has developed as an
integral part of the farming system.
1.10      Forestry.  The forest cover in China increased from 8.6% of the
total land area in the early 1950s, to 12.7% at present, or about 120 million
ha, located mainly in the northeastern and southwestern parts of the country.
So far 28 million ha have been afforested. However, prime timber areas are
exploited more rapidly than regrowth occurs. Timber output in 1979 totalled
54 million cu m, compared with 5 million cu m in the early 1950s. Annual
fuel-wood utilization amounts to 120 million cu m, roughly two thirds of which
is collected by the people. Wood still serves as an important energy source
and timber products generally are in short supply.
1.11      Marketing and Pricing.  The Government controls the marketing and
pricing of agricultural products and inputs . It fixes production quotas for
the major crops: grains, oilseeds, cotton and sugar, which are purchased and
distributed by state-managed procurement agencies at pre-determined prices.
A portion of the production in excess of the quotas, amounts of which are
determined before each harvest according to projected yields, are sold to the
Government at above-quota prices which are also pre-determined. The rest of
the surplus production can be sold to the Government at negotiated prices or
on the free market. Production quotas are also established for a range of
cash crops and livestock products. Minor crops, such as vegetables and other
products produced in household plots, are sold in rural markets at prices
regulated either by the provinces or counties. This marketing and pricing
system has been broadly maintained since the 1950s, although the importance
and scope of free markets have varied over time. Policy reforms since 1976
have expanded the operation of free markets.



- 4 -
The two most important marketing agencies for agriculture are the Ministry
of Food, which procures and distributes grain and oilseed crops, and the All
China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, which purchases most
cash crops and distributes some agricultural inputs and tools, as well as
consumer goods, in the rural areas. Some products, such as sugar, rubber
and pigs for slaughter, are purchased by specialized branches of the
Ministry of Commerce.
Irrigated Agriculture
1.12      Major efforts to develop China's land and water resources were begun
in the 1950s and were the main focus of rural investment during that decade.
Huge projects for flood control, drainage and irrigation employing hundreds of
thousands of workers were undertaken on the North China Plain and in other
areas.  Since 1949, protection from flooding along the major rivers, especial-
ly the Yellow River, has been greatly improved. The Ministry of Water
Conservancy estimates that nearly a third of the arable land amounting to
some 32 million ha of formerly flood-prone lands are now protected by dikes.
1.13      Since 1949 some 86,000 reservoirs have been constructed, with a
total storage capacity estimated at about 400 billion cu m. The large reser-
voirs (320) are used for multiple purposes, flood protection, irrigation and
hydropower, while medium-size (2,200) and small facilities (more than 80,000)
are usually constructed for irrigation. Individual storage capacities of
the large reservoirs exceed 100 million cu m and those of the medium size
facilities range from 10-100 million cu m. Total irrigation development is
now estimated at some 45 million ha versus about 16 million ha in 1949. This
represents some 45% of the total arable area, in contrast to an estimated
17% for other developing countries. About 30 million ha are irrigated by
pumping, of which some 11 million ha are irrigated by 2.1 million tubewells,
80% of them in northern China.
Support Services
1.14      Agricultural Research and Extension.  The Chinese Academy of Agri-
cultural Sciences (CAAS) is the principal organization for agricultural
research work. Subordinate to the Ministry of Agriculture, it has responsi-
bilities for a network of national research institutes and for technical
oversight and coordination of provincial research programs. Currently,
there are some 31 national research institutes in this Academy, focussing
mainly on applied research. Each province also has a local research network
with a provincial academy of agriculture as the lead institution. Below the
provincial level are prefecture and county-level institutes which have
programs of research, demonstration and extension. Other agriculture-
related ministries or specialized agencies, including those responsible for
forestry, fisheries and irrigation, also sponsor and coordinate research
work. Considerable success has been achieved in developing improved rice,
wheat and maize varieties that are high yielding, early maturing and
resistant to major diseases. The Chinese have also developed and planted
on some 5.9 million ha, a hybrid rice that gives 20-30% higher yields than
conventional varieties.



-5-
1.15      The importance of close coordination between research work and
extension activities was recognized early in China. The linkages were further
reinforced in recent years, giving rise to a seven-level research and
extension network. The three higher levels -- national, provincial and
prefectural -are operated by the central and provincial governments and are
concerned mostly with research; the four lower levels -- county, commune,
brigade and team -- deal mainly with the demonstration and popularization of
improved technologies and techniques, training and other extension-related
activities. Linkages are maintained through regular meetings of technical
staff at different levels, staff exchanges between scientists and skilled
farmers, and through bases established by research institutes at the commune
and brigade levels. However, the numbers of qualified staff, especially at
the middle and senior levels, are severely limited and facilities and
equipment are generally lacking. These problems stem from the disruption of
scientific research and training during the Cultural Revolution. The
authorities are now re-establishing the education system to increase the
number of technicians, but with many extension workers near or past normal
retirement age, the build-up will take several years to accomplish. A Bank
Group-supported project is being prepared to strengthen education and research
in the agricultural sciences by providing facilities and technical assistance
for selected agricultural colleges and research institutes.
1.16      Training.  Responsibility for the management of agricultural educa-
tion is vested in both the Ministry of Education and ministries responsible
for agriculture, water conservancy, forestry, etc. The Ministry of Agricul-
ture is responsible for most of the educational facilities; it supervises
seven colleges at the national level and 38 institutions at the provincial
level. The Ministry also supports 214 senior secondary schools for
agriculture. The agricultural education system is still recovering from the
long period of closure and anti-professional bias of the Cultural Revolution.
The first graduates from the newly re-established education system will be
available in 1982, and a scheme of post-graduate education has only recently
been formulated. Critical shortages of staff exist at all levels. This
problem is being addressed by a Bank Group-financed project (Ln/Cr-2021/1167)
which would strengthen higher education by helping to increase the output and
quality of education and research in the disciplines of science and
engineering.
1.17      Seed Production.  A comprehensive system has been developed for
producing seed, especially for cereals. Breeder seeds from colleges,
academies, counties or research stations are multiplied by county-managed
seed farms. Some communes also operate their own seed breeding and
multiplication farms. The seed farms are responsible for purification,
storage and testing of seeds. Stock seeds produced by these farms are sold
to seed companies for the multiplication of certified seeds. The system is
now suffering from poor management and lack of proper drying, processing and
storage facilities. The technical supervision given to the collectives
responsible for seed multiplication is inadequate, resulting in the
production of inferior seeds. The central government has recently embarked
on a program to improve the facilities, management and quality control in the
production of certified seeds.



- 6 -
1.18      Agrochemicals.  Chinese agriculture has long depended on organic
fertilizer, particularly pig manure, as the main source of plant nutrients.
Chemical fertilizer has also grown in importance and its production reached
52 million tons (gross weight) in 1979, a 24% increase over the level in 1978
and almost double that of 1976. Annual application of chemical fertilizer
exceeds 125 kg (nutrient weight), a level more than twice that for all
developing countries. Nitrogenous fertilizer accounts for 80% of total
production, followed by phosphate (19%) and potassium (1%). The production
of the latter nutrients is inadequate and with limited imports, there is a
considerable shortage of phosphatic and to a lesser extent, potassic
fertilizer. Studies based on soil analysis show that phosphate may now be
one of the major limiting factors in increasing crop yields in some of the
areas in southern China, where use of chemical nitrogen is heavy.
1.19      To reduce crop losses (estimated at 5-20% in China) due to pests,
pesticide application rates have grown rapidly since the mid-1950s. Total
production of pesticides in 1979 was 522,000 tons, with insecticides making
up the bulk. In the past, more than 120 individual compounds were produced
commercially, including some organochlorines like DDT and BHC, which have
been banned in many countries. The Government is aware of the problems
associated with the use of organochlorines and is shifting to organophos-
phates, carbamates and other safer pesticides. Fungicides are also widely
used for seed treatment and control of foliar diseases. Significant
quantities of modern pesticides are imported.
1.20      Agricultural Credit.  The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) is
responsible for the provision of credit for agriculture and rural development
in China. Established in 1951, the Bank has operated as a separate institu-
tion only during 1955-57, 1963-65, and from March 1979 onwards. In the
intervening years, rural credit operations were handled by the People's Bank
of China, the country's central bank. The ABC continues to be under the
overall supervision and jurisdiction of the People's Bank. At the end of
1980 it had a head office in Beijing, 27 branch offices-one in each of the
provinces and the three municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai,
374 central subbranch offices in the prefectures, 2,211 subbranch offices in
the counties, 24,803 offices in the communes and 403 offices in the state
farms. The bank's work, especially the loan and deposit operations, is
complemented by some 59,000 local credit cooperatives organized at state
farms and at the commune and brigade levels. Although they are separate
entities, the credit cooperatives in practice function as the smallest
operating units of the bank.  They play a major role in the bank's credit
operations at the commune and lower levels. The cooperatives act as the
bank's agents in channelling short-term and small loans to farmers and the
collectives. The larger and longer-term loans are provided directly by the
bank.
1.21      In conjunction with the central and local governments, the ABC
exercises general responsibility for the planning, allocation and distribu-
tion of credit funds, including Government grants and subsidies, for agri-
culture and related activities. The subsidies and grants are provided



- 7 -
through the bank to the collectives, mainly communes, in support of invest-
ments which the Government considers are of high priority. Major recipients
of the bank's credit funds are individual farmers, collectives, state farms
and certain state-owned enterprises which supply agricultural inputs and
procure or process farm products. The bank also promotes, and provides a
channel for rural savings as well as banking services, and supervises the
management and operations of the credit cooperatives.  It had an outstanding
loan portfolio of Y 47.6 billion at the end of 1980. About three quarters
of the loans are short-term (less than one year) and the remaining medium-
term (mostly 1-5 years). The present interest rate charged for short-term
loans, mainly for production credit and working capital, is 0.48% per month
(5.76% p.a.). Longer-term loans, mainly for agricultural equipment and
machinery, are charged at the preferential rate of 4.32% p.a. These
interest rates reflect an upward adjustment of about a third in early 1982.
A small element in the loan portfolio consists of relief loans at zero
interest.
Past Developments
1.22      When the People's Republic was founded in 1949, the agriculture
sector was suffering from severe dislocations associated with decades of war-
fare and civil disturbance.  Destruction and deterioration of economic infra-
structure were widespread and the institutional framework for production,
marketing and technical services was in near total disarray.  As a first task
in agricultural development, efforts were made to reconstruct the economic
infrastructure and restore the institutional framework. Despite limited
capital and technical resources, recovery was rapid and pre-war levels of
production were attained by 1952/53. Development efforts during the First
Five-Year Plan period (1953-57), which concentrated largely on land develop-
ment and irrigation facilities, raised agricultural production to new record
levels. However, production during the next several years was adversely
affected by bad weather and the disruptions of the Great Leap Forward move-
ment to an extent that crop output did not recover to 1957/58 levels until
about 1964.
1.23      Several measures were taken during the 1960s to revive agricultural
production: raising of procurement prices, intensification of research and
expansion of input supplies to producer goods industries to increase the
production of chemical fertilizer, tractors, irrigation pumps and other
equipment. The research effort resulted in the development of many new and
improved high-yielding varieties, especially rice and wheat.
1.24      During 1966-76, achieving self-sufficiency in foodgrain production
was the focus of agricultural policies. However, progress was slow because
of the effects of the Cultural Revolution, which disrupted production and
scientific research and training. Cotton and oilseeds production was
depressed, and grain output fell short of the full potential. Although there
were substantial increases in the availability of such modern inputs as
agricultural machinery, irrigation and chemical fertilizers, the growth of
agricultural production during the period was only 2.9% p.a., slightly below
the long-term trend.



-8-
1.25      Since 1977 a number of policy changes have been introduced that
are aimed at boosting agricultural production. These have included improved
producer incentives, greater autonomy to the collectives and state farms in
production and planning decisions and expansion of private plots. These
changes, coupled with a large increase in the supply of chemical fertilizer,
and favorable weather conditions in 1978-79, resulted in a growth of more
than 8% p.a. in agricultural output over these two years. Cash crop
production (cotton, oilseeds) recovered sharply and growth of animal
husbandry was also rapid. Agricultural ouput in 1980 was checked by poor
weather conditions. However an increase in cash crop and meat production
helped raise overall agricultural output by 2.7%, so that the average growth
(plus sideline industries) over the three-year period 1978-80 was 6.7% p.a.
Development Plan for the 1980s
1.26      The development of agriculture has been accorded high priority by
the Government as reflected in its post-1978 statements on economic policy.
Thus, the share of agriculture in the state capital construction budget, the
source of financing for large schemes and investments, is planned to
increase from 14% in 1979 to 18% during 1980-82. Funding for agricultural
support services, including research and extension, would also increase from
6.3% to 8% of total plan expenditures during the same period, while annual
credit for agriculture is planned to increase from Y 13 billion in 1978 to
about Y 26 billion by 1985.
1.27      The basic long-term objective for the agricultural sector is to
increase the production of food crops and economic (industrial) crops to meet
requirements created by population and income growth. Achievement of this
objective will help realize other sector goals of expanding rural employ-
ment and minimizing the use of foreign exchange for food and fiber imports.
In land-scarce China, attainment of the production objective requires
increased productivity from existing cropped areas. Improved incentives to
producers are essential in this regard and have been at the heart of recent
policy reforms. These incentives include: (a) encouragement of household
agricultural activities and individual enterprises through expanding the
area of private plots, lifting restrictions on free markets, and widening
the range of commodities for local trade; (b) encouragement of larger
allocations to individuals out of the collective income; and (c) creation of
subcontracting systems within collective agriculture and state farms which
permit small production groups or households to retain production in excess
of some agreed norm. By increasing yields of food crops and cotton on
already-cropped lands, the proposed project would contribute to achievement
of Government's objectives for the agricultural sector.  The recently
improved incentives for producers are expected to contribute to the success-
ful implementation of the project.
Project Formulation
1.28      The Government estimates that some 6 million ha of land in the North
China Plain are affected by varying degrees of salinity and waterlogging.



-9-
The soils in this area are basically good and, where adequate irrigation and
drainage have been provided, crop yields are high. Because of the land
constraint in China, the Government objectives are to raise yields on these
saline areas as well as reclaim large tracts of saline wasteland. With
improved drainage and irrigation. the potential of these lands for increased
production is considerable
1.29      Despite considerable progress in water resource development, large
areas of the North China Plain still suffer from waterlogging, salinity, and
drought. Waterlogging is a condition in which the water table rises so high
that it saturates the root zone and damages the crop. It can arise in a
variety of situations: in poorly drained, low-lying land; in areas where
irrigation has been introduced without adequate drainage; or where the
natural drainage systems are impeded by flood embankments, roads, etc.
Water tables tend to rise in the rainy season and fall in the dry season and,
in the absence of irrigation and drainage, crops can suffer from drought for
much of the year and can then be damaged by waterlogging when it rains.
Soil salinity occurs, or pre-existing soil salinity is worsened, where a high
water table prevents downward percolation and water-borne salts become
concentrated in the soil through evaporation. The Government estimates that
some 6 million ha of land in the North China Plain are affected in varying
degrees by salinity and waterlogging. With irrigation and drainage, these
lands can be reclaimed and become highly productive for a wide range of
crops.
1.30      The nine counties included in the project were chosen primarily
because each one has a large pilot project where irrigation and drainage
techniques have been tested to form a basis for large-scale developments.
Each county also has a well designed and maintained main drainage system
capable of disposing of runoff from the drains in the project areas. Six of
the nine counties have waterlogging and salinity problems. The other three
counties suffer from widespread waterlogging and drought but soil salinity
is not present. The project also includes areas in danger of becoming saline
because of inadequate drainage, especially the lateral and sublateral drains
needed to carry runoff to the main drains and control the water table.
1.31      The project was prepared by the engineering and agricultural staff
in the counties with help from the provincial Land Utilization Bureaus, the
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the Land Utilization Bureau of
the Ministry of Agriculture.  Preparation of the project began in August 1980,
and each county prepared detailed project proposals consisting of thematic
maps together with detailed quantity and cost estimates. The proposals put
forward by the counties included some longstanding plans for river improve-
ment, enlargement of main drains and drainage pumping stations. The proposals
for water table control and irrigation systems are based on recent experience
in the pilot projects. The depth and spacing of drains and the number and
depth of tubewells will vary from place to place according to soil types, the
severity of salinity and waterlogging, and aquifer characteristics.



- 10 -
1.32      The proposals were reviewed by a Bank mission in October/November
1980. This mission found the basic concept of the proposed project sound and
there was ample evidence of the capability of the counties to implement the
project. The mission recommended, however, that the counties and central
government agencies develop a consistent set of design criteria for
drainage systems, and this was noted by the Government. The Government
subsequently revised the project proposal by increasing the number of
counties from five to nine.  The total project area, was reduced to
concentrate on land where the need for salinity control and drainage is most
urgent.
1.33      In addition to the construction of drainage and irrigation works,
the project would include components designed to enhance the project contri-
bution to land and water development in the North China Plain. A compre-
hensive soil and water studies would be carried out in each of the project
areas to observe the project's impact on soils, water tables, water quality
etc. The studies should produce results of value to the future operation of
the project and the planning of future projects. At the same time a program
to monitor and evaluate the project's agricultural, economic and social
effects would be carried out. The project also includes the North China
Plain Agricultural Study. The objectives of the study would be to identify
the main constraints to higher crop production in selected areas of the
North China Plain; to formulate agricultural development plans to overcome
these constraints; and to identify and prepare future agricultural projects.
Lessons may also be learned which are applicable to the land areas which are
already irrigated in the North China Plain.
2. THE PROJECT AREAS
Location
2.01      The project would be located in nine counties:  Qihe, Lingxian and
Yucheng counties in Shandong province north of the Yellow River, Guoyang,
Suixi and Mengcheng (Anhui Province) and Shangqiu, Ningling and Minquan (Henan
Province), all south of the Yellow River (see Map IBRD 16135). Lingxian,
300 km southeast of Beijing is the nearest to the capital and Mengeheng,
860 km to the south is the furthest. The project has a cultivable area of
about 200,000 ha of which approximately 178,000 ha are presently cultivated.
Further details of areas, population, etc., are shown in Table 2.1.
Climate
2.02      About 90% of the rain falls in the period from the end of April
through the end of October, and only light snow falls in the winter months.
Some 65% of the rain falls in July, August and September mostly in the form of
intense storms which cause widespread flooding. Damaging droughts occur
nearly every year. Temperatures range from 400C in the summer to -200C in
the winter. The number of frost-free days ranges from 200 to 220. Climate
data (annual means) are summarized in Table 2.2.

Soils and Topography
2.03      The soils of Qihe, Lingxian, Yucheng, Ningling, Minquan and Shangqiu
are mostly coarse to medium-grained silty loams which, when provided with
adequate surface drainage, are well suited to wheat, maize and cotton, the
main field crops grown in these counties. The project area covers about
150,000 ha of cultivable land in these six counties. About 94,000 ha are
affected in varying degrees by salinity, of which about 19,000 ha are
uncultivated and much of the remaining 56,000 ha are severely affected by
drought and poor drainage.
2.04      The soils of Suixi, Guoyang and Mengcheng counties, known as
"shajiang" black soils, are very heavy clays with low to very low permea-
bility. The project areas covering nearly 50,000 ha are subject to water-
logging particularly in low-lying areas where the drainage systems are
inadequate. The soils are calcareous throughout with small lime and iron
manganese concretions, evidence of a long-term waterlogged condition.  The
soils are not saline and with adequate drainage can support a wide range of
crops, but are probably best suited to rice. Irrigation is also needed to
protect the crops from droughts which occur almost every year.
2.05      The project areas are between 20 and 45 meters above sea level
with slopes ranging between 1:5,000 and 1:10,000. To the eye the land
appears flat with very little relief. However, small differences in
elevation can lead to significant differences in land capability. Higher
areas generally tend to be free from salinity, whereas low areas commonly
suffer from salinity and waterlogging and are subject to crop damage from
surface flooding.
Population, Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.06      Farm families account for about 98% of the project area's population
of 1,151,000. The average size of cultivated land per farm family is about
0.6 ha. There are 85 communes in the project area which are further subdivi-
ded into 1,634 production brigades. Each production brigade comprises on the
average 8-15 production teams which are made up of 20-50 families, often the
inhabitants of a natural village.
Present Status of Irrigation and Drainage
2.07      Of the 200,000 ha of cultivable land in the project area, about
71,000 ha are presently irrigated; 35,000 ha from surface water and 36,000
from groundwater. Lingxian, Yucheng and Qihe counties are within the areas
served by major canal systems supplied through intakes along the left bank of
the Yellow River. Mengcheng, Guoyang and Suixi counties are supplied by
canals taking off from the Huai River. Shangqiu, Ningling and Minquan
counties are supplied by water from wells.



- 13 -
2.08      Channel improvement has been carried out on virtually all of the
rivers and streams in the project areas. Rivers have been straightened and
deepened, and flood dikes have been constructed. During the flood season
river levels are generally above the surrounding ground level and, therefore,
large pumping stations have been built to dispose of surface runoff into the
rivers. The works are, however, incapable of handling floods over a
1 to 3-year frequency. An important aim of the project would, therefore, be
to increase the capacity of the main drainage system. Laterals and sub-
laterals have also been constructed in parts of the project area, but they are
mostly too widely spaced and too shallow to be fully effective either for
surface drainage or for lowering the water table. The project would include
deepening the existing lateral/sublateral drains and using them for water
table control as well as surface drainage.
Groundwater
2.09      The project areas are underlain by thick sequences of quaternary
and recent alluvium consisting of alternating and interfingered layers of
clay, silt, and fine sand with occasional coarse sand to fine gravel.
Exploratory wells show a thickness of alluvium of at least 400 meters but
similar deposits probably continue to considerably greater depths. The
principal aquifers are the layer of fine sand interbedded with less permeable
layers of silt and clay. In a typical well 50 m deep, there may be two or
three layers of sand with a total thickness of 10 to 25 m. Some individual
sand layers are as much as 20 m thick; particle sizes are generally from 0.05
to 0.5 mm. The aquifers, although fine-grained, are very permeable with
individual wells furnishing from 30 to more than 100 cu m/hr and with
specific capacities typically 5 to 15 cu m/hr/m.  The quality of groundwater
is suitable for irrigation over most of the project areas with total
mineralization generally less than 1000 mg/l. Typically the cations are
nearly equal parts of sodium, calcium, and magnesium and the dominant anion
is bicarbonate. In the Lingxian and Yucheng areas there are some localities
underlain by brackish to saline groundwater which would in the future be
served by surface water.
2.10      Recharge of the aquifers results from infiltration of rainfall, deep
percolation losses from irrigation, and seepage from rivers and canals.
Probably as much as 20% to 25% of rainfall is available for recharge although
in most areas some of this potential recharge is rejected because groundwater
levels are already so close to land surface. Water levels are generally with-
in 1 to 3 m of land surface, with seasonal fluctuations of 1 to 2.5 m.
Frequent measurements in many observation wells have shown that water levels
rise rapidly in response to rainfall. Groundwater occurs under unconfined or
subartesian conditions. Over large areas the individual sand layers are
probably hydraulically interconnected and can be treated as a single aquifer.
Movement of groundwater is slow, with very low gradient, generally
paralleling the local and regional topography.

Pilot Projects
2.11      There are numerous pilot projects in the North China Plain aimed at
solving the problems of waterlogging and salinity. The ones listed below for
Shandong and Henan provinces are of interest since they are close to the pro-
posed project areas. A pilot project has also recently been set up in Anhui
province to address the problem of Shajiang soils. Although some of the pilot
projects date back to the mid-1960s and early 1970s most of the work has been
accomplished over the past five to six years. The pilot projects in the
three provinces are listed below:
Shandong Province
Nanbei Zuhuang, Yucheng County: 2,000 ha established in 1975 operated by
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Soil and Fertilizer
Research Institute.
Linxi, Lingxian County: 500 ha established in 1974 also operated by CAAS.
Henan Province
Wuliyang, Shangqiu County: 400 ha operated by Henan Provincial College
of Agriculture initiated in 1974.
Li Zhuang, Shangqiu County: 2,300 ha established in 1971 now operated by
CAAS and Ministry of Water Conservancy.
Dawu Zhuang, Shangqiu County: 350 ha begun in 1965 and directed by the
Henan Provincial  Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
Anhui Province
Xiaomadian, Mengcheng County: 2,400 ha established in 1978 operated by
Anhui Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
2.12      Although the pilot projects have been designed and operated by a
number of different agencies the technique evolved for controlling salinity
and waterlogging is basically the same in each area. This consists of a
system of open drainage combining the functions of surface and subsurface
drainage, and a supply of water to leach salts from the soils and irrigate the
crops.  The design of subsurface drains depends to a large degree on judgement
and experience gained from large-scale field trials. While numerous formulae
have been derived in the USA, China, Russia and other countries, the results
they yield are sensitive to small changes in the assumed soil properties (per-
meability, storativity etc.) which in practice are difficult to measure. The
pilot projects have shown that a depth of about 2.5 m is neccessary in the
lateral drains to provide effective subsoil drainage. Spacing of laterals



- 15 -
show some variation between pilot projects but, for the soils commonly encoun-
tered in Shandong and Henan provinces, a spacing of 400-500 m has been shown
to be adequate. Once the water table is lowered the leaching of the soil can
be quickly accomplished since salts are present usually in only the top
20-25 cm. Initially, in some projects, the leaching proved to be a lengthy
process because of delays in installing tubewells or bringing in surface
water. However, where there is adequate pumping capacity the feasibility of
flushing salts from the soils with ample quantities of water in less than one
year has been demonstrated.
2.13      The nature and magnitude of benefits attributable to improved
drainage and irrigation can be seen by comparing the 1979 economic charac-
teristics of a sample of production teams which have benefited from the pilot
projects with unimproved production teams farming saline land outside the
pilot project area. The improved production teams typically grew less sweet
potato and miscellaneous grain and more cash crops. Yields of wheat increased
from 1.1 ton/ha for unimproved teams to about 2.9 ton/ha for improved teams;
maize, from 2.1 ton/ha to 2.9 ton/ha; soybean, from 0.8 ton/ha to 1.0 ton/ha;
and cotton, from 0.3 ton/ha to 0.6 ton/ha. Income from animal husbandry also
significantly increased. Collective net income of the unimproved teams
was Y 50 per capita (of which Y 43 was distributed to team members, none of
which was cash income). In the improved teams, net income averaged Y 123, of
which Y 99 was distributed (Y 61 in cash).
3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The project would be the first large-scale attack on soil salinity
and waterlogging in China and would serve as a model for future development
of the more than 6 million ha of land in the North China Plain affected by
salinity and waterlogging. The project would provide drainage and irrigation
for about 200,000 ha, covering parts of nine counties, and would also include
agricultural inputs and support services to increase agricultural
productivity. The principal features of the project are;
(a) excavation to increase the capacity of some 70 km of river
channels and 1,260 km of existing main and branch drains;
(b) construction of 3,200 km of lateral drains and 8,200 km of
sublaterals,
(c) construction of new pumping stations for drainage and irrigation
and installation of approximately 3,000 HP of pumping capacity;

(d) construction of about 8,450 tubewells, and procurement of pumps
and motors for these wells and for about 4,010 existing wells;
(e) various works to improve water control at the field level con-
sisting of land smoothing on about 60,000 ha, and field ditches
and field drains to complement the drainage works and tubewells;
(f) additions of 700 km of 10 kV lines, 1,470 km of 380 V lines, and
related substations and provision of transformers;
(g) construction and improvement of 130 km of rural roads;
(h) procurement of agricultural machinery and construction
equipment;
(i) procurement of phosphate fertilizer and insecticides;
(j) tree planting along field borders and establishment of orchards
and wood lots;
(k) a program to strengthen research and extension services in the
project areas;
(l) a comprehensive program of soil and water studies in each project
area including technical assistance for the studies; and
(m)  an agricultural study of selected areas in the North China Plain
to help formulate future agricultural development plans and to
identify and prepare future projects.
Project Works
3.02      Drainage Works.  Rivers and streams have been canalized to form
the main backbone of the drainage systems in each of the project areas. In
addition there is a fairly extensive system of branch drains at spacings of
1,500-3,000 m. The aim of the proposed improvements of the river channels
and main and branch drains would be to provide discharge capacity needed to
handle surface runoff from a five-year storm (about 210 mm over three days,
depending on location). In general, the bed levels of existing channels
would be lowered by 0.5-1.0 m.
3.03      Lateral drains in most parts of the project are too widely spaced
to serve as adequate collectors of storm runoff and are not deep enough to
have an appreciable effect on water table depths. As a result of these defi-
ciencies, severe and prolonged flooding often occurs in the project areas and
this leads to waterlogging and salinity. A major feature of the project
would be to provide a much more effective system of laterals and sublaterals.



- 17 -
3.04      In Shandong and Henan where soils are mainly silty loams the
laterals would be at spacings of 400-500 m and be 2.5 m deep. Field
observations in the pilot projects (para. 2.12) supported by theoretical
analysis show that at such spacings and depths the laterals would ensure
drawdown of the water table to about 2 m within 90 to 120 days following the
end of the rainy season. They would also be sized to convey runoff from a
5-year storm. Sublaterals, at spacings of 200-250 m, would serve mainly to
carry surface runoff to the laterals and be about 1.5 m deep. However, to
promote leaching in the saline areas and to ensure water table control some
sublaterals would be 2 to 2.5 m deep.
3.05      In Anhui, salinity is not the problem so much as controlling the
water table to provide a healthy crop root environment. Lateral drains at a
spacing of about 500 m and with a depth of about 2 m would mainly serve to
remove surface water. Sublaterals, at the relatively close spacing of
80-100 m with depths of 1.2-1.5 m would be constructed over much of the
project areas to ensure that within 10 days of a heavy rain the water table
would drop to 0.7 m below ground surface.
3.06      The drainage systems would require many bridges and culverts to
carry roads over branch, lateral, and sublateral drains. These would be
constructed of brick in most cases but reinforced concrete would be used for
large spans. Pumping stations and tubewell pumphouses would be constructed
primarily from brick. Concrete pipe for culverts is made in the counties.
At some locations it would be necessary to pump drainage flows from the
branch drains into the rivers. The total installed capacity of drainage
pumps would be about 3,000 HP. Details of the drainage systems are
summarized in Table 3.1.

3.07      Tubewells.  The project would provide for the construction of
8,450 new tubewells and installation of pumps and motors. About 11,130
tubewells have been drilled in the project areas to date and of these the
project would provide 4,010 new pumps and motors to replace old and
inefficient units. Thus, the project area would have a total of 19,580
tubewells.  Depth of wells ranges from 30 m to 100 m.  All well drilling
is carried out by provincial or county drilling crews who have gained
considerable experience over the past few years. Wells are drilled by
locally-made rotary rigs.  Concrete pipe sections (70 cm diameter for auger
holes and 40 cm for drilled holes) are used for casings. The screen
portion, a porous concrete pipe made with a uniform fine gravel and just
enough cement to form a binder, extends from the bottom of the hole to 6 m
from the ground surface. The screen is surrounded by a 10 cm filter pack of
washed sand. The top 6 m consists of a plain concrete pipe. The completed
wells would be equipped with centrifugal pumps and about 5,920 would be
powered by 4 to 5 hp electric motors, and 6,540 by diesel engines. In
general, the service unit for a tubewell would be the area bounded by
adjacent pairs of laterals and sublaterals; for example, with a lateral
spacing of 400 m and sublateral spacing of 200 m, a service unit would be
8 ha. For the project as a whole the average area served by a tubewell
would be about 9 ha. The number of new and existing wells and their
physical characteristics are summarized in Table 3.2 by province.

3.08      On-farm works.  Field drains would be constructed to carry rainfall
runoff to the sublaterals and laterals. These would be V-ditches about 60 cm
deep at spacings of 80-100 m. About 1,000 m of field irrigation ditches would
be provided for each additional tubewell. The field ditches and drains would
be built by each production team within the area it farms. Similarly, land
smoothing would be carried out by the production teams in areas where needed
to improve water control; it is estimated that about 60,000 ha would require
some degree of smoothing. The production teams would employ their own members
or members of other production teams as hired labor.
3.09      Rural Electrification.  Each county already has rural electrifica-
tion systems which reach varying proportions of the communes and brigades.
Energy is purchased by the county from the nearest power plant or major
substation and the interconnecting 110 kV line is usually owned by the
county. Within the county, subtransmission is at 10 kV and distribution at
380 V. To expand the system, the project would provide 700 km of 10 kV lines,
1,470 km of 380 V lines, 750 10 kV/380 V transformers (totalling 38,000 kVA)
for wells and three substations. Assurances have been obtained from the
provincial governments that an adequate power or fuel supply would be made
available for tubewells in the project areas.
3.10      Rural Roads.  About 130 km of the existing roads in the project
areas of Mengcheng, Guoyang, and Suixi counties are narrow and unpaved,
making them impassable after heavy rains. About 100 km would be
asphalt-surfaced and 30 km would be earth roads.
Agricultural Development
3.11      Agricultural Machinery and Construction Equipment.  The project
includes farm machinery to provide for greater timeliness in farm
operations, particularly during periods of peak labor demand at the time of
plowing, sowing and harvesting. Double cropping is practiced over a major
portion of the project area, and in view of the variations in the frost-free



- 20 -
periods, timeliness of operation is important. Additional machinery and
equipment include: (a) about 720 12-hp two-wheeled tractors and accessories,
to be purchased by production teams and groups of individuals; these are in
demand because of their multiple uses in cultivation and transport, and the
utility of the power train as a power source for well pumps, threshers, and
small processing machinery; (b) 50 25-hp tractors and 1,000 accessories for
existing 25-50 hp tractors, including sowers, cultivators, and harvesters,
to raise the efficiency of their use; (c) 100 power sprayers, to be purchased
and managed on a custom basis by county plant protection companies;
(d) 160 stationary threshers, to meet increased requirements under the
project. About 20 pieces of construction equipment including bulldozers,
loaders, backhoes and scrapers would be procured for use on a trial basis in
Lingxian county. Provision is also made for sprinkler equipment for trial
of sprinkler irrigation in the counties.
3.12      Fertilizer and Agrochemicals.  The soils over virtually all of the
area covered by the project are deficient in phosphate. Domestic production
of phosphatic fertilizers, while increasing, does not meet current demands,
and shortfalls are expected in the project areas. Therefore, following
completion of the drainage works, and after the salts have been leached from
the soil, the project would finance an initial application of diammonium
phosphate (DAP), as a soil amendment at a rate of 235 kg/ha. A total of
47,000 tons of DAP would be provided. To meet increased requirements for
agrochemicals, the project would also provide 140 tons of imported
carbofuran mainly for the control of cotton pests.
3.13      Tree Planting.  Because of the need for fuel, construction materials
and fodder, only a fraction of crop residues in the project area is currently
returned to the soil. As a result, the organic content of the soil is low,
contributing to poor soil structure. Tree planting would alleviate the
shortage of rural fuel and construction materials and thereby encourage the
recycling of crop residues. Commercial forests of Paulownia, Platanus,
poplar, elm and other species would be planted at 1,500 trees/ha in a
5 x 1.5 m spacing, with successive thinning. Short stature crops or creepers
would be intercropped in the first 3 years after transplanting. Orchards,
mainly apples and pears (300 trees/ha), would also be intercropped prior to
maturity. Field border plantings and shelter belts at 75 trees/ha would
usually be planted in offset pair of rows with 7 x 3 m spacing, to reduce
wind penetration. In intercropping of selected grain with Paulownia, trees
would be planted with a 50 x 5 m spacing to minimize shading. Tree planting
offers a high rate of return to investment, and would contribute to farm
incomes. Therefore, the project would include nurseries for the production
of about 35 million seedlings for orchards, border plantings, and shelter
belts along roads, canals and drains in the project area.



- 21 -
3.14      Research, Extension and Training.  Each county has an agricultural
research institute and an agrotechnical extension station. The research
institutes would verify and assess improved farming practices in different
locations in the project areas. The main emphasis would be on varietal
screening, fertilizer trials, pest and disease control and productiqn of
breeder seeds. Proven techniques would be popularized by the agrotechnical
extension stations. Most research and extension facilities are poorly
equipped to serve the needs of the collectives and farmers. To meet the
research and extension needs of the project, the facilities at county research
and extension centers would be improved. The project would include construc-
tion of laboratories, dormitories and lecture rooms, and provision of dif-
ferent types of laboratory equipment. Details are given in Annex 1.
3.15      The project would include the local training of extension staff
from communes and brigades. The courses would be offered about five times
a year, each session lasting about 30 days. The topics covered include
(a) varietal improvement; (b) seeds; (c) soil/fertilizer; (d) crop protection;
(e) tree planting; (f) livestock; (g) agricultural machinery; (h) irrigation
and drainage; and (i) project management. The courses would be given by
county research and extension personnel, with assistance from the provincial
technical staff. In support of the training program, some additional training
facilities and equipment have been included in the project for the county
research institutes.
Soil and Water Studies
3.16      A comprehensive program of soil and water studies would be carried
out in each of the project areas to guide the operation of the project and
provide a basis for the planning and design of future drainage and irrigation
projects in the North China Plain. The studies would be undertaken by the
technical bureaus in the counties with specialist assistance from the
national and provincial agricultural research institutes. The project would
finance the program's equipment requirements and consulting services to assist
the project authorities in setting up the program and for periodic technical
review of the findings. An assurance was obtained from the Government that
a report presenting the main findings of the studies, with terms of
reference agreed with IDA, would be prepared by the central PMO and
submitted to IDA for review not later than December 31, 1986. The program
of studies would include:
(a) observations of changes in soil salinity, both short-term for
different leaching procedures and long-term changes during
project operation;
(b) observation of changes in water table levels both seasonal and
long-term;
(c) maintenance of complete records of quantity and quality of all
surface and groundwater use in the project areas;



- 22 -
(d) monitoring of tubewell performance including any changes in
water quality and yield;
(e) collection and analysis of data to obtain estimates of recharge;
(f) investigations to determine crop water requirements and develop
improved irrigation and crop practices;
(g) soil surveys to supplement and upgrade existing soil maps;
(h) soil and fertility studies to identify factors limiting crop
yields; and
(i)  trials of alternative methods for design and construction of
tubewells and drains.
North China Plain Agricultural Study
3.17      The North China Plain contains some of the best land in China for
wheat, corn, cotton and oilseeds and cropping intensities of 140 to 150% are
achieved in many areas. There is still potential, however, in many parts of
the Plain to raise yields and production which in turn would increase farm
incomes and reduce China's imports of foodgrains and cotton. The objectives
of the study would be to: (a) identify the main physical, agronomic and
financial constraints to higher crop production in selected areas of the
North China Plain; (b) formulate agricultural development plans to overcome
these constraints; and (c) to identify and prepare future agricultural
projects. The study would initially concentrate on the lands bordering the
Tuhai River in Shandong Province which is parallel to and north of the Huang
He. This area covers about 2.7 million ha in a strip of land some 300 km
long and 90 km wide. The study covered by this project will probably include
this area and two or three other areas of similar size. It is likely that
there would be some overlap in studies of selected areas; for example, a
study of the second area could well begin before completion of the first
area. The studies would be carried out primarily by the staff of the
provincial and county agricultural bureaus with assistance from specialist
institutes at the provincial and central government levels. Technical
support would also be provided by local and foreign consultants.
Water Supply and Demand
3.18      At present about 71,000 ha, just over one third of the total pro-
ject area, are irrigated, 35,000 ha from surface water and 36,000 ha from
groundwater. In the future, with the project, there would be only a small
increase in surface water and virtually all of the additional demand would be
supplied from groundwater. In general, surface water would be used in areas
where the groundwater is unsuitable for irrigation. Water supply and demand
at full development for project areas in the three provinces and for the
project as a whole are summarized in Table 3.3.

/a Includes canal and ditch losses and deep percolation estimated to be 30%
for surface water and 20% for groundwater.
3.19      In the long term, the project's water supply would be limited only
if pumping exceeds aquifer recharge. As shown in Table 3.3, annual with-
drawal from groundwater would be in the order of 300 mm. Recharge would be
from three sources: (a) rainfall, (b) deep percolation from applied irri-
gation water; and (c) seepage from rivers, drains and canals. From
observation in the pilot project areas, it estimated that about 20% of the
rainfall and 15% of the applied irrigation water go to recharge. There is
also evidence in the pilot project areas that periodic floods, passing
through rivers and main drains from upstream areas, make a significant con-
tribution to recharge at least equal to recharge from rainfall. As indicated
in Table 3.3 there appear to be good prospects for a long-term balance
between pumping and recharge. A further possible constraint on water supply
would be a significant decline in water quality.  However, in all the project
counties there are numerous wells that have operated for long periods



- 24 -
without changes in water quality. As explained in para. 3.16, observations
to detect any undesirable trends in aquifer depletion or water quality will
be an important part of the soil and water studies program.
3.20      Water requirements are based on current irrigation practices in
the project areas (Annex 2). These requirements are fairly close to those
calculated using the Radiation Formula /1 for the main cereal crops maize,
wheat and rice. However, current water use for cotton and oilseeds in areas
with the best yields is much less than the calculated figure. Since there is
close agreement between the counties on water requirements for cotton and
oilseeds, the local estimates were accepted.
Status of Design
3.21      Maps showing the location of main and branch drains, major irriga-
tion canals and structures, groundwater and soil distribution in the nine
project counties have been completed (a typical layout is shown in Map IBRD
16375 for Yucheng project area). The maps are based on field surveys
conducted by Chinese technicians during project preparation. Auger hole
tests were made to determine hydraulic conductivity and, where deep drains
exist, actual draw down of observation wells was measured. Based on these
measurements, design criteria for deep drains for water table control have
been developed and tested in several pilot projects. The provincial and
county governments have completed preliminary design of drains and plan to
finalize detailed designs of the various project works by September 1982,
shortly before the start of construction.
Implementation Schedule
3.22      The project works would be constructed in a period of four years
beginning in October 1982. Each county has a detailed plan for the first
year's work program. In general, the emphasis in the first year would be on
improving main and branch drains and constructing some of the new laterals
and sublaterals. The proposed implementation schedule is shown in Figure
3.1. Improvement of main and branch drains and laterals and sublaterals
would commence in late 1982 and the work would be confined to the period
between December and March when the construction companies could recruit
off-season farm labor. Construction of structures and pumping stations
would proceed throughout the year as they would be done by permanent county
construction crews. Tubewell construction and on-farm works (field ditches
and drains and land smoothing), would also be year round. Extension of power
lines would proceed in phase with tubewell construction and most would be
completed by 1985. Buildings would be constructed mainly in the first two
years. Manual labor would be used for virtually all of the excavation and
structures. Assurances have been obtained from the Government that by
August 31 of each year, detailed work plans for the following year would
be prepared for IDA review.

Cost Estimates
3.23      The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$177.5 million
of which US$49.2 million or 28% would be the foreign exchange component. The
project has a relatively low foreign exchange component because the earth-
works, construction of structures and buildings, and tree planting would be
carried out mostly by manual labor using mainly local materials. The foreign
exchange costs are based on the estimated imported components of locally-
produced materials and goods, mainly materials and fuel. A summary of the
cost estimates, detailed in Annex 1, is presented below:

3.24      The cost estimates are expressed in June 1982 prices.  A physical
contingency of 15% has been applied to civil works and equipment costs.
Expected price increases which amount to 17% of the base cost plus physical
contingencies are based on the following rates of price escalation:

Financing
3.25      Of the total project cost of US$177.5 million, the IDA Credit would
finance US$60 million (34%). Since the foreign exchange component is small,
the 34% is a reasonable contribution to the project total cost. The provin-
cial governments would contribute US$39 million. The cost of on-farm works,
about US$20.7 million, would be borne by the production teams. The remaining
US$57.8 million would be provided by cash contributions from counties and com-
munes (US$45.8 million) and labor paid for by the collectives to construct
drains, drill tubewells and plant trees, equivalent to about US$12 million.
A financing plan is shown in Table 3.5.
Procurement
3.26     Civil works (US$66.3 million) and tubewell drilling (US$22.9 million)
scattered over nine counties would be carried out employing labor from collec-
tives over a period of three to four years and would not likely attract
foreign contractors. This type of force account construction in China is
efficient, low-cost, and provides off-season employment for the rural popula-
tion. It also reinforces the spirit of local participation and self-help
which is such an important part of rural development in China.
3.27      Phosphate fertilizer and agrochemicals (US$22.0 million), which are
in short supply in China, would be imported and therefore procured following
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
Rural electrification equipment (US$6.3 million) would also be procured
through ICB. A 15% preference margin, or prevailing customs duties, whichever
is lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.
Tubewell pumps and motors (US$12.3 million) and farm equipment (US$3.4 mil-
lion), would be purchased by collectives scattered across nine counties over a
period of three to four years and, therefore, bulk procurement in large
contracts would create problems in storage and distribution. Accordingly, the
existing procedure would be followed whereby the production teams would
purchase such equipment through county supply companies which act as agents
for local manufacturers. In each province, there are manufacturers producing
acceptable equipment at prices which are competitive with world market prices.

construction in Lingxian county would also be procured locally since the
small number of items involved would not justify setting up the after-sales

Total                                      60.0
Disbursements for force account works and pumps and motors would be against
statements of expenditure supported by progress reports showing physical
quantities and unit prices. Annex 9 explains the reasons for this approach.
Agreement was reached with the Governient on the unit prices for the items
listed in Annex 8. Since this is the first Bank Group-financed agricultural
project in China, the estimated disbursement schedule was based on the
mission's judgement of the implementation capacity of the counties. Most of
the civil works construction would be carried out employing the rural
population. In view of the past experience with this type of construction
the projected schedule is, therefore, shorter compared to Bank Group-financed
irrigation and drainage projects. It is estimated that disbursements would
be completed by December 1987. Estimated schedules of expenditures and
disbursements are presented in Annex 1.



- 29 -
Accounts and Audits
3.29      Each county and provincial Project Management Office would maintain
separate accounts in sufficient detail to record all expenditures for force
account construction and earthworks and payment to county well drilling crews,
equipment supply companies and consultants. The central PMO would collate the
half-yearly progress report showing these expenditures both half-yearly and
cumulative. For civil works, the expenditure would be broken down according
to the major elements of main, branch, lateral, sublateral etc. Assurances
were obtained from the Government that the accounts for each province would
be audited annually by independent auditors, which are expected to be from
the Provincial Bureau of Finance. The project's audited accounts would be
submitted to IDA within six months of the close of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.30      The project would not lead to any basic change in land use.  Drain-
age and irrigation would reduce salinity, waterlogging, drought, surface
flooding and improve the environment for crop production. The project would
have no adverse environmental effects.
4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      The organization for implementing the project would be based prima-
rily on the existing structure of the county governments and their relation to
the provincial governments and central government agencies. However, to
ensure the efficient channelling of funds and timely execution of the project,
Project Management Offices (PMOs) have been set up at the county, provincial
and central levels. Organization charts for the project and for the Ministry
of Agriculture are shown in Figures 4.1 and 4.2.
Agency Responsibilities
4.02      The County Governments.  Implementation of the laterals and sub-
laterals; rural roads and electrification; and pumping stations under the
project would be executed by the relevant technical bureaus of the county
governments.  A county typically has five or six committees and offices to
which these bureaus are attached. The Financial Office is responsible for the
activities of the Foreign Investments Bureau, and the state corporations
engaged in the purchase, supply, and processing of agricultural produce. In
addition, this office coordinates the local branches of the Agricultural Bank,
through which production and investment credits are made available to the
county. The Agricultural Committee has responsibilities for the activities of
the Bureaus of Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, Water Conservancy, and
Agricultural Mechanization. The Economic Committee oversees the Bureau of
Electric Power Supply.



- 30 -
4.03      The design and construction of laterals and sublaterals would be
the responsibility of the counties. County construction companies would
build structures, but the county would delegate responsibility for earthwork
to the communes, with supervision by county engineers. The communes would in
turn allocate the earthwork between the production brigades and production
teams. Compensation for the earthwork would be a combination of cash, food
and work points. Work points are used throughout China to measure individual
inputs to collective activities and to form a basis for distributing income
from such activities. Each production team keeps detailed records of work
points earned by all members of the team capable of work. When some team
members work on construction which has no immediate and identifiable effect
on their income, the value of each work point is in effect diminished.
Consequently, a payment is made to the production team or the workers by the
county. The total compensation per workday has a value of Y 0.8-4.0,
depending upon the extent of skill and whether the work is off-farm or
on-farm. The current rate averages Y 2/day. For off-farm works, current
government policy requires that the county provide cash subsidies of
Y 1.0-1.4/day, in order not to impose the extra financial burden on the
team. For on-farm works (para. 3.08) payment may be entirely work points
or cash levied from team households, since the land smoothing and drains
directly benefit the team's farm land. The same procedure is followed for
the irrigation ditches required to distribute water from the tubewells.
4.04      The Provincial Governments.  Responsibility for the excavation of
the main drains and design and construction of the branch drains would rest
with the provincial governments. This is because the main drains often
traverse a number of counties and their design has to be coordinated with
other water control works. Provincial construction corporations would carry
out the earthworks and structures employing local labor at Y 2/day, and their
own full-time skilled labor and supervisors.
4.05      The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) would be responsible for
channelling project funds from the central Government to the provinces,
counties and collectives. The bank has an extensive network of branches at
the provincial, county and commune levels. The provincial branches would
disburse project funds to the provincial government agencies for project
works undertaken by them and for expenses of the provincial Project
Management Offices (para. 4.09). Likewise, part of the project funds would
be channelled through the county branches for project works undertaken by
county government agencies and for expenses of the county PMOs (para. 4.07).
The remaining project funds would be channelled through ABC's commune
branches to farmers and collectives for the construction of tubewells, and
purchase of tubewell equipment, agricultural machinery, fertilizer,
agrochemicals, and seedlings. These funds would be recovered on behalf
of the counties/provinces from recipients in accordance with terms deter-
mined by the PMOs, which are likely to be the ABC's existing terms and
conditions. Thus funds for fertilizer, agrochemicals and seedlings would be



- 31 -
repaid in periods of up to one year at an interest rate of 0.48% per month
(5.76% p.a.) and those for tubewell construction and equipment and
agricultural machinery would be repaid in periods of 1-5 years at an interest
rate of 4.32% p.a. An increase in these lending rates is possible. They
are expected to remain positive in real terms.
4.06      The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) would have overall responsibility
for the project, in cooperation with the Ministry of Water Conservancy. MOA
comprises 16 bureaus and offices. Among them, the Bureaus of Land Utiliza-
tion, Foreign Affairs and Science and Technology and the Academy of Agricul-
tural Engineering Research and Planning would work closely with the provincial
and county governments in implementing the project and carrying out the
related studies. The Ministry of Water Conservancy, particularly the Bureaus
of Farmland Water Conservancy and Planning would, where necessary, provide
technical guidance and advice to the provinces and counties.
Project Management and Coordination
4.07      To facilitate project execution by the various bureaus, offices
and institutions in each county, the county governments would each establish
a Project Management Office (PMO) to handle the day-to-day affairs of the
project. In each county a senior official has been appointed as Project
Manager to supervise the PMO operations. The PMO would comprise a general
administrative office and four sections: engineering and construction,
research and training, finance and materials supply, and monitoring and
evaluation. It would be responsible for scheduling the work of the existing
offices and bureaus involved, such as the Water Conservancy Bureau (mainly
responsible for planning and design), and the various supporting bureaus
such as Finance and Procurement. The county PMO would also prepare annual
budgets for the project, maintain project accounts, monitor the operation
and maintenance of irrigation and drainage systems built under the project,
organize training for collective members, and monitor and report project
progress.
4.08      Supervising the county PMO would be a Project Committee, made up of
heads of the relevant administrative and technical units of the local govern-
ment. The committee would review the plans and programs of implementing
agencies and the annual budgets and meet periodically to review progress. The
committee would be placed on the same administrative level as the existing
committees in the county government. This form of management is based on the
model which has been responsible for executing the works in the pilot areas
and other major construction undertakings in the counties included in the
project.
4.09      A Project Management Office established under the provincial
government would carry out the functions of coordinating and supervising
project implementation in the participating counties, reviewing technical
standards for design, construction, operation and maintenance of project
works, ensuring prompt delivery of project inputs and reporting progress to



- 32 -
the central Government. The provincial PMO would be headed by a senior
provincial official as Project Manager, and include officials from its
technical bureaus. To supervise the provincial PMO and coordinate project
implementation within a province, a provincial Project Committee would be
set up in parallel with the existing committees in the provincial government.
This committee would be led by a high-ranking provincial government official
with heads of the relevant bureaus as members.
4.10      Project execution in all nine counties would be coordinated by a
central Project Management Office attached to the Ministry of Agriculture.
The office would be headed by a Project Coordinator. The central PMO would
be responsible for administration of the project as a whole and for overall
coordination with the Ministries and other central agencies involved. It
would also be responsible for liaising with IDA, preparing applications for
IDA disbursements, reviewing annual budgets, and for the procurement of agro-
chemicals and rural electrification equipment following international
competitive bidding. The China National Technical Import Corporation of the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, which is gaining experience
in procurement under ICB procedures, would assist in procurement by handling
bid invitation, bid evaluation and contract awards. The central PMO would
comprise a secretariat and three sections: finance, research and training,
and planning. Assurances were obtained from the Government that the central
PMO would be adequately staffed at all times with experienced and qualified
personnel, and that IDA would be consulted about any replacement of the
Project Coordinator. Assisting the PMO on technical matters would be a
technical advisory group made up of representatives from the Beijing
University of Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the
Academy of Agricultural Engineering Research and Planning and the Ministries
of Geology, Agriculture and Water Conservancy.
4.11      Both the central PMO and the technical advisory group would be
under a Central Project Committee to be chaired by a Vice Minister of the
MOA with representatives from other relevant Ministries concerned with the
project. The Committee would deal with policy matters and interministerial
coordination/cooperation, as well as liaise with other state commissions.
The Project Coordinator and the managers of the provincial and county PMOs
and the technical staff of the PMOs at the different levels have already been
appointed.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.12      The central PMO with the cooperation of the Economic Research
Institute of CAAS, and the county and provincial PMOs would monitor and
evaluate the impact and economic benefits accruing from the project. Bench-
mark surveys would be conducted in the project areas to determine the current
conditions and levels of inputs and production. Crop statistics and



- 33 -
physical and financial progress of the project would be collected by the
county PMOs. Consultants would be provided under the project (Annex 5) to
assist in developing suitable techniques and procedures for monitoring and
evaluation. In this connection, half-yearly reports on the progress of the
project would be prepared by the central PNIO (Annex 8), to be submitted to
IDA within one month of the end of each half-year.
4.13      The central PMIO would also prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR)
on the project not later than six months following the completion of credit
disbursements. The PCR which would be submitted to IDA should include an
assessment of the operating results and impact of the project, performance of
the implementing agencies and the major reasons for their achievements and
deficiencies with the view to drawing lessons which may usefully be applied to
the preparation and implementation of similar type projects in the future.
Agricultural Support Services
4.14      Agricultural services in the project area, described below, are
well organized and would adequately support the farmers in realizing the
benefits of desalinization, irrigation, and improved drainage.
4.15      Agricultural Research and Extension.  Numerous entities ranging from
central research agencies down to the production teams support research into
the improvement of saline and Shajiang black soils. At the central level,
there is the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) which, aside froma
its responsibility for providing support and guidance to provincial Academies
of Agricultural Science and county-level research institutes, maintains a
Saline Soils Improvement Station at Dezhou (Shandong). The latter has been
responsible for supervision of pilot projects in Lingxian and Yucheng. The
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Engineering Research and Planning, formed in
1979 with 260 researchers from CAAS, the Institute of Forestry, and other
organizations, also assisted in the pilot project in Yucheng. The Water
Conservancy Scientific Research Institute, under the Ministry of Water
Conservancy, conducts research on problems of water conservancy in the Huang,
Huai and Hai River basins. Otherwise, major research in the project area is
conducted by the provincial academies and agricultural colleges.
4.16      Each county in the project has a county agricultural research
institute and, under its supervision, research groups at the commune and
brigade levels. The main functions of research at this level are to verify
and promote new and improved farming practices. Personnel at the commune
level include college and middle school graduates. These institutes lack
laboratories and equipment, and there is a need for further staff training at
all levels. The project would provide funds for strenghthening and upgrading
the research facility in each county. Additional training would also be
provided for research and support personnel.



- 34 -
4.17      Around 100 personnel in each county are employed at the county or
commune levels in extension work (including research as described above). At
the county level, there is usually an agrotechnical extension station with
stations for seed improvement, plant protection, agricultural machinery,
animal husbandry, and forestry, each with 5-15 employees. Typically each
commune also has an agrotechnical extension station with one agronomist.
Experimental groups exist in some brigades and teams, which are involved in
demonstration trials and seed multiplication. This "four level research
network" (county, commune, brigade and team) uses meetings, short training
courses, and publications as its main vehicles for extension. Each commune
maintains 5-10 ha and each brigade 1-2 ha of demonstration and/or seed
multiplication fields.  The project would include the expansion of buildings
and equipment for county level training of commune and brigade technicians and
extension personnel.
4.18      Seed.  Provision of improved seeds in each county is the responsi-
bility of the county seed company. Breeder seeds from the provincial
Academy of Agricultural Sciences or the county agricultural research insti-
tutes are multiplied either by county-managed seed farms or else by commune
production teams or scientific experiment teams under contract to the seed
company. To maximize the returns from investments, it is important that
good quality seeds are available to production teams and farmers. To
strengthen the national seeds program, the Bureau of Seeds, MOA, has estab-
lished pilot projects in about 120 counties, and the provincial government
in about 200 counties. The pilot projects encompass all aspects of produc-
tion and processing of improved certified seeds. This seed improvement
scheme would be extended to the project areas. An assurance was obtained
that only seeds certified by or on behalf of the Bureau of Seeds, MOA, would
be distributed by the seed companies in the project areas.
4.19      Fertilizer.  Chemical fertilizer use in the project areas cur-
rently averages about 60 kg/ha nitrogen and 40 kg/ha phosphate (nutrient
weight). Domestic production of fertilizer has been given high priority by
the Government and will continue to grow as a result of large plants that
are already under construction. Five of these plants are in provinces where
the project is located. Smaller plants at the county level are being
modernized, and will provide most of the fertilizer required by the project
areas, supplemented by supplies from provincial fertilizer plants. Adequate
nitrogenous fertilizer will be available from these plants to meet the needs
of the project areas at full development. Soil survey results indicate
phosphate deficiency in most of the project areas, and the demand in China
for phosphate is expected to grow rapidly, especially with the projected
expansion in land planted to legumes, oilseeds and cotton. Domestic
production of phosphatic fertilizers at present falls far short of
requirements, hence imports will have to be expanded. Provision has been
made under the project to import diammonium phosphate for application in
deficit areas. Supply stations of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative are
established at each commune and would be responsible for provision of
fertilizer and other inputs to the production teams.

4.20      Agrochemicals.  Pesticides are readily available in the project
area through the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Higher standards of pest
control, especially for cotton, will be needed to achieve the higher yields,
resulting from better water control. The project includes procurement of
carbofuran and the purchase of power sprayers for use in orchards and cotton.
Expanding domestic production will be sufficient to meet requirements for
other agrochemicals.
Consulting Services
4.21      The Government would employ consultants to assist in (a) the soil
and water studies program, (b) monitoring and evaluation, and (c) the North
China Plain Agricultural Study. The services under (a) and (b) would best be
provided by a consulting firm able to call on a wide range of experts on
short-term assignment. The assignment would begin in early 1983 and continue
over a period of four years. The consultant input is estimated at about
35 man-months. The North China Plain Agricultural Study would also require
experts on short-term assignments to cover a wide range of disciplines, and
again there would be advantages in having these services provided by a con-
sulting firm with experience in such studies. The estimated input is
52 man-months, and the assignment would begin in mid-1983 and be completed
by the end of 1985. The use of consulting firms rather than individual
consultants would be much simpler from the standpoint of administration, it
would ensure that the work is properly coordinated and also give the imple-
menting agencies access to a wide range of experts. Consulting firms would
also help in purchasing field and laboratory equipment and in organizing and
conducting overseas training courses for project personnel. The estimated
overall man-month cost for specialists would be about $12,000, inclusive of
salaries, overhead, overseas allowances, travel, and living expenses while
in China. Assurances were obtained that the North China Plain Agricultural
Study would commence by July 1, 1983 under terms of reference agreed with
IDA, and that all consultants under the project would be selected in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines for consultants.
Operation and Maintenance
4.22      The county Bureau of Water Conservancy would be responsible for
the operation and maintenance (O&M) of river improvements and main pumping
stations. O&M of main and branch drains and their structures would be
carried out by the communes under the direction of the Bureau of Water
Conservancy which would inspect the project works periodically. The commune
sets aside funds for O&M every year. Likewise, the production brigades
would provide funds for O&M of lateral and sublateral drains and their
structures under the direction of the commune. Production teams would
operate and maintain on-farm drains and tubewells, and members would provide
the labor and funds. The collectives can also apply to the Provincial



- 36 -
Government for O&M subsidies in special cases such as floods and drought.
The county Project Management Office would appoint persons in the communes
and brigades to be in charge of O&M in the project areas. The annual cost
of operating and maintaining the drainage systems and tubewells is
estimated at about US$13/ha.
5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Present Cropping Patterns
5.01      The total cultivated area is about 178,000 ha.  However, the total
cropped area at present is estimated at some 245,000 ha, which represents a
cropping intensity of 138%. Of this area, wheat, which is the most impor-
tant foodgrain, accounts for some 93,000 ha; maize, 49,000 ha; soybeans,
24,000 ha; sweet potatoes, 24,000 ha; rice, 1,900 ha; and miscellaneous
grains (primarily sorghum and millet), 14,000 ha. Maize is more preva-
lent as a spring-summer crop in Shandong than in Henan and Anhui, where sev-
eral years of drought have contributed to a resurgence of sorghum, millet,
and sweet potato. Oilseeds are planted on 9,500 ha, the most important
being peanuts, with 4,300 ha, and the remaining area split between rape
and sesame.  Cotton, with 27,000 ha, is by far the most important cash crop,
but kenaf, vegetables and tobacco are also grown. Leguminous green manure
(sesbania, vetch, and alfalfa) is intercropped or grown on wasteland.
5.02      The most commonly encountered cropping system is wheat/maize, with
winter wheat (or barley) grown from late October to early June and maize
often sown in May between the rows of wheat before harvest. Other systems
based on wheat include wheat/soybean and wheat/sweet potato. Rotation
schemes generally feature three crops in two years. Single-cropped food-
grains, oilseeds and cash crops are usually sown in the spring from early-
to mid-April.
Future Cropping Patterns
5.03      Without the project, no significant change in cropping patterns is
anticipated. Recent changes in relative crop prices, more attention to farm
income levels, and decentralization of production, planning have already led to
significant increases in acreage in oilseeds, cotton and other cash crops, at
the expense of reduced grain acreage and some decrease in overall cropping
intensity.
5.04      With the project, improved irrigation and drainage would lead to
significant yield increases and this in turn would lead the farmers to reduce
the area under foodgrains, and increase the area under cash crops.  The
acreage under sweet potato and maize would be cut back.  These crops are
considered less desirable for human consumption. Wheat, sorghum, millet and



- 37 -
soybean would be maintained at present levels. In the project counties in
Anhui, the area planted to rice would increase from 1% to 5% of the total
cropped area.
5.05      Substantially increased area would be devoted to the oilseed
crops and cotton, because of their profitability. Rape is expected to
increase from 2,700 to 4,700 ha; peanuts from 4,300 to 9,000 ha; sesame from
2,500 to 3,700 ha; and cotton from 26,800 to 32,700 ha. Present and future
cropping patterns, yields and production are shown in Table 5.1.

5.06      Changes in land use with project are shown in Table 5.2.  Of
210,000 ha of land which. could be used for agricultural production, 25,000
ha of wasteland would be reclaimed for use in crop cultivation, commercial
forests and orchards. This would be partially offset by the loss of 6,000
ha absorbed by drainage works. Area cultivated in crops would increase by
4,000 ha, and overall cropping intensity would remain the same, at 138%.

5.07      Figure 5.1 shows the proposed cropping calendar.  There are
no major differences between the proposed calendar and existing practice.
Yields and Production
5.08       In the past, increased yields have been obtained for some crops due
to growth in numbers of tubewells, a rapid increase in supplies of chemical
fertilizer beginning in 1978, and the decentralization of farm management in
1980/81. In the future without the project, modest increases in yields and
production of wheat, maize, soybean, and kenaf are likely to continue because
only the yields of these crops have responded to larger applications of
chemical fertilizers in the absence of improvements in water conservancy and
management. With the project, increase in yields of all crops would occur,
comparable to those which have already occurred in the pilot projects (Table
5.1). Total production of foodgrains with the project would increase 44%,
from 334,000 tons at present to 481,000 tons. The combination of increased
acreage and yields would triple oilseed production, from 7,000 to 24,000
tons, and increase cotton production by 74%, from 14,000 to 24,000 tons.
Subsidiary Production
5.09       Because of higher crop yields with the project, the crop area
required to meet subsistence and quota requirements would decrease, the
supply of fodder would be augmented, and farm cash flow increased. There-
fore, the project would permit considerable diversification into subsidiary
farm production which would not occur without the project. Funds and
improved support services provided by the project would permit growth of
tree planting (Annex 3). With the project, the area in commercial forests
would increase by 13,000 ha, orchards by 2,000 ha, field border plantings



- 39 -
scattered over the project area by 116,000 ha (area of fields enclosed), and
intercropping of trees (primarily Paulownia) with grain by 44,000 ha (area
of grain intercropped). Production of fruit would increase by 13,000 tons.
Over a 20-year cycle, the production of 1.9 million tons of fuelwood and 1.2
million cu m of harvested lumber would alleviate the severe shortage of
rural fuel and construction materials and permit a higher proportion of crop
residues to be returned to the soil. The high net revenues derived from
tree planting would contribute to farm incomes.
5.10      With the project, a higher proportion of increased crop residue and
a greater proportion of grain production would be available for use as feed
and fodder. A small portion of reclaimed land would also be utilized as
additional forage area. The number of animals raised is expected to show
substantial growth, resulting in greater supply of animal manure which
would contribute to soil improvement and supplement chemical fertilizer as a
source of plant nutrients required to attain target yields.
Drying, Storage and Processing
5.11      In most of the project areas, farmers have sufficient on-farm
sun-drying areas, including drying space on farm roads and along drains, to
meet current needs, but additional floor space would be required to
accommodate production increases. The project would provide funds for
construction of additional 40,000 sq m of concrete drying floors. Storage
of distributed grain and other crops is at the farm level, and capacity is
easily expanded. Undistributed or marketed grain, oilseeds, and cash crops
are stored variously at team, commune, or county facilities, and existing
storage capacity (with the exception of minor cash crops) exceeds projected
increases in marketed volume under the project. Most of the counties
included in the project have factories for processing grain, oilseeds and
cotton; where needed, the collectives plan to construct such facilities. In
addition, many communes have small processing facilities, and most teams
have mills to process distributed grain. Existing capacity plus planned
additions would meet expected requirements under the project.
6. MARKETS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      China-s production of virtually all of the crops grown in the
project area has been insufficient to meet domestic consumption
requirements, and this has been reflected in increasing imports of these



- 40 -
crops in recent years. Net imports of grain, mainly wheat, were estimated at
14.7 million tons in 1980. In 1979 China imported over 0.8 million tons of
oilseeds and 0.85 million tons of raw cotton. Imports of these crops are
expected to continue at about the same levels through the 1980s. The
incremental output from the project (Table 5.1) would be easily absorbed by
the market, since it represents a small fraction of the imports required to
meet domestic needs.
6.02      The large volume of imports has been an essential part of
Government policy of raising supplies of basic foodstuffs while easing
procurement pressure in the rural areas. Government domestic grain procure-
ment rose only about 4 million tons from 1977 to 1980, despite a 35 million
ton increase in production. In the future, procurements are expected to
rise at a more rapid rate to meet the requirements of the large urban
population and regions specializing in cash crops. The project areas in
Shandong and Anhui are among the areas which are expected to make major
contributions to increased Government grain and cotton procurements.
Prices
6.03      The state has a near monopoly on crop procurement, and determines
all procurement prices. Until major price increases in 1979, procurement
prices had remained at about the same level for more than a decade. Soybean
prices are expected to be increased by 20% by mid-1982. Present (mid-1982)
farm gate prices are based on prevailing procurement price levels, with an
upward adjustment of 20% for soybean prices.
6.04      There are three tiers to the procurement price structure:  quota,
above-quota, and negotiated prices. Quota procurement prices apply to the
annual quota responsibilities of each team or household, amounts which in
the project area have been unchanged since 1971 and are not expected to
increase in the future. Above-quota prices apply to sales exceeding the
quota, the targets for which are determined 1-2 months prior to the harvest
of each crop. Above-quota prices exceed quota prices by 50% for grains and
oilseeds, 30% for cotton, and varying amounts for other crops. Negotiated
prices apply to sales by individual farmers (out of the amounts retained by
them or grown on private plots) to the state and occasionally to sales by
production teams in excess of above-quota targets. They are individually
negotiated and are similar to the prices prevailing on the free market.
In the project area at present negotiated prices normally exceed above-quota
prices by 10-20%. Quota and above-quota prices are uniform throughout the
project area for produce of equivalent quality.



- 41 -
6.05      The average farm gate price of each crop used in the financial
analysis of the project is a weighted average of quota, above quota, and
negotiated prices.  The weights for the quota and above-quota prices are the
amounts of each crop sold at these prices. The weights for the negotiated
prices are the amounts retained by or distributed to individual farmers,
including amounts used as seed and feed, based on estimates provided by
local authorities. Since teams may sell the excess over quota and
above-quota targets and individuals may sell any amount at free market or
negotiated prices, these prices best approximate the financial opportunity
cost of self-consumed crops.  Based on present quota prices, and with the
margin for above-quota and negotiated prices indicated in para. 6.04 above,
average future prices for each crop are estimated from its projected quota
sales, above-quota sales, and retained production.
6.06      For the economic analysis of the project, all farm inputs and
outputs were evaluated at projected 1986 economic prices expressed in
mid-1982 constant prices. The economic prices at the farm gate are based on
Bank Group commodity price forecasts, adjusted for quality, international and
domestic transport, and processing costs. Detailed derivations for 1982 and
1986 prices are shown in Annex 3. For crops which are not traded, economic
prices are based on financial prices adjusted by the ratio of economic prices
to financial prices of traded crops for the appropriate crop category
(foodgrain, oilseeds, or fibers). For want of comparable world price data on
which to compute border prices, all other products and all nontraded inputs
are evaluated at financial prices, with the exception of those shown in
Annex 3. Prices used for the financial and economic analyses are summarized
in Table 6.1
Farm Incomes
6.07      The traditional concept of farm income derived from an individually
operated plot is not applicable in the project area, where the land is
farmed collectively. To estimate farm family incomes a notional farm budget
has been prepared for a farm size of 0.7 ha, which is the average area of
land per farm family. Net farm income was taken as equal to the gross value
of production of crops, and tree products, less operating costs, including
depreciation and repairs of farm equipment, and taxes; plus income earned
outside the collective sector (Annex 3). The present average annual net
farm income per capita in the project area is about Y 173 (US$102). At full
development it would rise to Y 290 (US$171), an increase of 67%.
Project Charges
6.08      Cost recovery for the project would have several elements.  Payment
of unskilled labor (Y 28 million) for on-farm works, well-drilling, tree
planting and part of rural electrification would be the responsibility of the
production teams. An additional portion of project expenditure (Y 57 million)
would be recovered from repayments to ABC of project funds advanced to
beneficiaries for purchase of machinery, tubewells, chemical fertilizer and

year evaluation period and represent incremental conditions, i.e., with
minus without the project.

average term of 4 years and 5.76%/year for short-term finance with
average term of 1 year.

pump and motor replacement.
/e Net increment in quota and above-quota procurement, valued at the
difference between 1982 free market and procurement prices.
6.09      Inclusion of indirect cost recovery substantially increases the
cost recovery index. A portion of crops and animal products are sold to the
Government at administered prices which are generally lower than prices that

would prevail in free markets. In the future with project, annual
government crop procurements at quota and above-quota procurement prices
would increase by Y 91 million. The free market value of these procurements
would be Y 101 million, and the difference of Y 10 million annually would
represent indirect cost recovery. This would raise the cost recovery index to
44%.
6.10      A total cost recovery index of 44% is considered satisfactory.
Since per capita farm income at full development would only be US$171, the
Government does not intend to impose additional project charges.
7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      General.  The proposed project would increase yields on a total of
182,000 ha of cultivated land, by additional or improved irrigation on
153,000 ha; improved drainage on 139,000 ha; and improvement of 47,000 ha of
Shajiang black soil. lWheat and maize would continue to be the principal
crops, but 14,000 ha would be converted from foodgrains or wasteland into
oilseeds or fiber crops. About 25,000 ha of wasteland would be brought into
cultivation, forests or orchards. At full development, approximately 280,000
families, or 1.2 million individuals, would benefit directly from increased
production. The annual demand for farm labor would increase by about 15
million man-days, equivalent to about 50,000 full-time jobs. The network of
rural roads and electrification completed by the project would improve market
access and facilitate the development of rural sideline industries. The
research and extension infrastructure developed by the project would be of
future benefit to an administrative area four times the size of the project
area. The project would serve as a large-scale trial and demonstration of
techniques for desalinization, which could subsequently be applied to the
remainder of some 6 million ha of land affected by salinity and waterlogging.
The project would meet the Government's objectives of increased production of
food and fiber crops at a capital cost of about US$570 per benefited farm
family, or US$800 per hectare. At full development, the project would result
in a reduction in annual imports of grain worth US$27 million; soybeans worth
US$4 million; oilseeds worth US$12 million; and fiber crops worth US$26 mil-
lion, totaling US$69 million.
7.02      Foreign Exchange.  All tradeable components are valued directly in
foreign exchange and converted to local currency at the official exchange rate
of Y 1.7 = US$1 /1 and adjusted for local transport and handling. No detailed
studies of conversion rates for foreign exchange or local conversion rates
have been conducted, but preliminary and tentative estimates were made and
/1 Exchange rate at time of appraisal.

used in the sensitivity analysis. The conversion factors were 1.05 for
agricultural products and byproducts, 2.99 for electricity, 1.46 for fuel,
0.98 for lumber, 1.03 for cement, 1.17 for steel, and 1.04 for locally
procured machinery.
7.03      Farm Labor.  At full development, there would be about 280,000 farm
families in the project area, with an average family size of 4.6 persons.
During peak periods about 1.7 workers per family would be available for
farming activities. Assuming 25 workdays per month at peak periods, the
monthly labor available would be 11.9 million man-days. Total labor
requirements in crop cultivation were estimated by activity and month (Annex
3) and total monthly labor requirements in the future with and without
project are shown in Annex 4. Labor requirements in tree planting were also
estimated (Annex 3). The peak monthly demand falls in June and September
and is 9.1 million and 8.4 million man-days respectively, compared to the
available supply of 11.9 million man-days. The balance of the labor force
in these months would be fully utilized on animal husbandry and private
plots.  As an estimate of a market wage rate (Y 1.60/man-day), the economic
analysis utilizes the average value of distributed collective income per
manday, adjusted to the standard of a 15 work point man-day and valuing
distributed commodities at free market prices.
7.04      Investment Costs.  As calculated for the economic analysis, total
investment cost is US$151 million (including physical contingencies but
excluding price contingencies). In determining the US$ value, local costs
were converted at the official exchange rate of US$1 = Y 1.7.
7.05      Operation and Maintenance Costs.  The estimated annual O&M costs
are US$2.5 million; additional costs of US$1.6 million for replacement of
tubewell pumps and equipment are incurred at 15-year intervals. O&M costs
include pump station staffing (US$0.01 million); maintenance of off-farm and
canals (estimated at annual earthwork requirements of 2.7 cu m/m of main or
branch drain and 1.5 cu m/m for laterals and sublaterals, at Y 1/cu m, or
US$1.5 million total); maintenance of structures (at 2% of original cost
annually); repair of the electric power network (at 3% of initial cost or
US$0.2 million); and tubewell maintenance (at US$29/well/year, totalling
US$0.4 million). On-farm repair costs and depreciation, including
aintenance of on-farm drainage and irrigation channels and farm machinery,
are accounted for in farm production costs.
7.06      Production and Benefits.  Expected future yields, cropping
intensities and production with and without the project are discussed in
Chapter 5. The physical input requirements, unit prices and labor require-
ments are presented in Annex 3, and the gross and net economic returns and
labor costs in crop cultivation in Annex 4. Production, unit costs, and net
returns to tree planting are computed in financial prices in Annex 3. Due to
the lack of international price data, the economic returns to this subsidiary
activity are evaluated at financial prices. A summary of project benefits is
shown in Table 7.1.

/a  At full development   1991 for crops, and 1994-97 for trees.
7.07      Distribution of Benefits.  Members of the poorer teams within the
project areas, that is, those which currently lack irrigation facilities or
have a higher proportion of saline land, would receive the greatest benefits
from the project. In the recent past credit for other than current input
purchases has been largely unavailable to the poorer teams, whereas higher
ability to repay has made it easier for better-off teams to finance further
investment. With the project, additional funds would become available and
inequity in the distribution of agricultural credit would be reduced.
7.08      According to national statistics on distributed collective income
per capita (1979), 16% of production teams had distributions of Y 40 or
less per capita, 11% of Y 41-50, 32% of Y 51-80, 16% of Y 81-100, and
25% of over Y 100. Of the nine counties included in the project, two would
be classified in the bottom 16%, six in the second-lowest 11%, and one in
the median category, based on the official measure of distributed collective
income. Noncollective income represents about 60% of total distributed
income in the project area which probably exceeds the national average
proportion, and helps to narrow the gap between incomes in the project area
and the national average.  On average, incomes of project beneficiaries fall
at the bottom of the second quartile and many into the lowest quartile of
the rural income distribution.
7.09      Development Phasing.  Project works are phased over the period
1982-86.  Benefits would begin almost immediately, as tubewells are
installed and drainage systems completed. Crop yields would reach their
maximum over the five years after completion of works. The project,
including the benefits from tree planting would reach full development by
1991 for crops, and 1997 for tree planting (Annex 4).



- 47 -
7.10      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and
discounting the project's benefits and costs over 30 years the economic rate
of return is 30%. The high returns are due largely to the selection of
project areas where main drains are in place and shallow groundwater is
available for irrigation development.
7.11      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity of the rate of return was
tested to cost overruns, reductions and delays of benefits, and the effects
of applying estimated conversion factors to project costs and benefits. The
effects of these changes in assumptions are shown below. Further testing to
determine which variables would be most crucial to the success of the project
utilized two meaures of sensitivity; the crossover value and the
elasticity./l The results are presented in Annex 4, and discussed below.
Rate of return
Alternative                                                (%)
A 20% increase in construction costs                        26
A combination of 20% increase in construction
costs and a two-year delay in project benefits              19
A 25% reduction in project net benefits because
projected yields are not reached or costs of
production exceed projections                               23
Application of conversion factors                           33
7.12      The project's economic rate of return showed little sensitivity to
variations in the cost estimate or assumptions made concerning the timing of
agricultural benefits. The rate of return would be reduced to 19% in case of
a combination of a 20% construction cost overrun and a two-year delay in
project benefits. The analysis of crossover values indicates that project
/1 The crossover value is the value of the variable tested at which net
present value of project costs and benefits (discounted at 12%) is
reduced to zero. The elasticity is the percent change in net present
value due to a 1% change in the variable.



- 48 -
returns are moderately sensitive to projected increases in crop yields. If
yields were to be 15% lower than anticipated, the rate of return would fall
to 12%. However, this would entail increases of only 20% in crop yields
compared to the future without project. It is highly unlikely that the
project would have such a small impact on crop yields. Sensitivity to
assumed values of other variables, including crop prices, construction costs,
development period, and crop production costs is uniformly low, and there is
little likelihood that the crossover values would occur.
7.13      Risks.  The project areas have been carefully chosen to maximize the
probability of success. Each has an existing main drainage system and each
has a pilot area where drainage irrigation and land development techniques
have already been successfully demonstrated, therefore, no major technical
problems of implementation are anticipated. The project would be the first
IDA-assisted agricultural project in China and would be implemented at a time
of change in rural institutions and farmers' incentives. However, the basic
strength of the county governments should protect the project from any
significant administrative problems.
8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      At negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
on the following points.
(a) the provincial governments would ensure that an adequate power or
fuel supply is made available for tubewells in the project areas
(para. 3.09);
(b) a report presenting the main findings of the soil and water studies,
with terms of reference agreed with IDA would be prepared by the
central PMO and submitted to IDA for review not later than
December 31, 1986 (para. 3.16);
(c) by August 31 of each year, detailed work plans for the following
year would be prepared for IDA review (para. 3.22);
(d) unit prices for the items listed in Annex 8 have been agreed with
IDA (para. 3.28);
(e) the county and provincial PMOs would maintain separate accounts
for the project. These would be collated and examined by the
central Project Management Office and audited annually by
independent auditors which are expected to be from the Provincial
Bureau of Finance. The project's audited accounts together with
the auditor's report would be submitted to IDA within six months
of the close of each financial year (para. 3.29)



- 49 -
(f) the Government would ensure that the central Project Management
Office would be adequately staffed at all times with experienced
and qualified personnel, and that IDA would be consulted about any
replacement of the Project Coordinator (para. 4.10);
(g)  only seeds certified by or on behalf of the Bureau of Seeds, MOA,
would be distributed by the seed companies in the project areas
(para. 4.18); and
(h)  the North China Plain Agricultural Study would commence by July 1,
1983 under terms of reference agreed with IDA; and that all
consultants under the project would be selected in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines for consultants (para. 4.21).
8.02      With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for an
IDA credit of SDR 54 million (US$60 million equivalent) on standard IDA
terms. The Borrower would be the People's Republic of China.

/a US No. 1 Soft Red Winter Wheat, FOB Gulf Ports (projected from Canadian ref-
erence wheat using equation Y = 0.267 + 0.852X (R2 = 0.94, 13 obs.).
/b US No. 2 Yellow, FOB Gulf Ports.
/c Thai 5% broken, FOB Bangkok, adjusted for quality assuming rice milling
standards: 10% high quality (5% brokens); 60% medium grade (25-30% bro-
kens); 30% lower quality (42% brokens). Resulting conversion factor
applied to high-quality rice is 0.725. Import prices are used to
estimate the economic price because local production is of a variety
which is inferior to those exported by China, and is locally consumed as
a substitute for other (imported) grains.
/d CIF European ports.
/e Mexican lint SM1-16", CIF Northern Europe.
/f Diammonium phosphate, bulk FOB Florida.
/g Triple superphosphate, bulk, FOB Florida.
/h Based on the following data: average freight rate of wheat, Gulf-Japan,
1979/80 = $36/ton; Gulf-Rotterdam = $17/ton; difference = $19/ton.
/i Average rail freight charge from nearest port (Qingdao, Lienyungang or Tien-
jin) to food-deficit municipality nearest project site, based on distance
and freight rate schedule.
/j Assuming 50 km between collection or distribution point and consumer/distri-
butor location (nearest municipality) and truck freight rates of Y 0.20/
ton-km for agricultural products, Y 0.28/ton-km for inputs and Y 0.50/ton
surcharge for trips over 25 km.
/k Adjustment from milled rice to paddy-equivalent price (70%); shelled to
unshelled peanuts (65%).
/1 For TSP (46% P205), domestic price is average of local products based on
nutrient equivalence.

Soil and Water Studies
1.        A comprehensive program of soil and water studies would be carried
out in each of the project areas to guide the operation of the projects and
provide a basis for the planning and design of future drainage and irrigation
projects in the North China Plain. The studies would be undertaken by the
technical bureaus in the counties with specialist assistance from the
national and provincial agricultural research institutes. The program of
studies would include:
(a) observations of changes in soil salinity, both short-term
for different leaching procedures and long-term changes during
project operation;
(b) observation of changes in water table levels both seasonal and
long-term;
(c) maintenance of complete records of quantity and quality of all
surface and groundwater use in the project areas;
(d) monitoring of tubewell performance including any changes in
water quality and yield;
(e) collection and analysis of data to obtain estimates of
recharge;
(f) investigations to determine crop water requirements and
develop improved irrigation practices;
(g) soil surveys to supplement and upgrade existing soils maps;
(h) soil and fertility studies to identify factors limiting
crop yields; and
(i) location-specific trials on improved technology.

Monitoring and Evaluation
2.        A monitoring and evaluation program would be set up in each
of the counties. Its purpose would be to monitor agricultural, economic
and social impact of the project. Base-line studies of present yields,
cropping patterns, crop budgets and farmers- incomes would be collected
and changes from the base-line observed in each area following completion
of project works. This program would review each year the availability
of inputs and performance of supporting services with the aim of identifying
problems and formulating solutions. This program would include the procure-
ment of computers for each county and the training of project staff in
their use.
Consulting Services
3.        A consulting firm experienced in land and water resource develop-
ment would be employed by the Government to assist the project authorities
in setting up the soil and water studies and the monitoring and evaluation
program, and to review periodically the findings of both programs.
Specialists would visit China on short-term assignment once a year, and per-
haps more frequently in the early stages. Short-term training would also be
provided for project staff. Estimated inputs for the various specialists
are as follows:

NORTH CHINA PLAIN AGRICULTURAL STUDY
Background
1.        The North China Plain encompasses an area of over 300,000 sq km
covering part or all of the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui and
Jiangsu. Beijing is located on the northern edge of the Plain. The Huang He
(Yellow River) flows across the Plain from the southwest to northeast where
it enters the Bohai Bay. Among the many other rivers traversing the Plain
the best known are the liai He in the north and the Huai He which forms the
Plain's southern boundary. Except for some mountains in the center of
Shandong province the Plain shows little relief and is between 20 and 100 m
above sea level.
2.        The Huang He has been portrayed as "China's Sorrow" because of the
damage and loss of life caused by its devastating floods. Although there is a
history of river control works since 200 BC, the river was not successfully
controlled until 1949 and flood control works have been progressively
developed since then so that some major floods have been passed without
serious damage to life and property.  Considerable progress has also been made
in flood protection works along the many rivers crossing the Plain. In
parallel with the successful flood control effort there has, in the past
30 years, been a vast expansion of irrigation both from surface water and
ground water. While considerable agricultural benefits have been derived from
the flood control and irrigation works, new, problems have arisen and fresh
opportunities have been created. Flood embankments and other infrastructure
interfere with natural drainage patterns creating local drainage problems and
the need for more drains and pumping stations. Introduction of canal
irrigation without adequate drainage has caused water tables to rise and
resulted in waterlogging and salinity, or aggravated these problems where they
already existed. In other areas, remote from rivers, groundwater use has
exceeded recharge and there has been excessive drawdown of water tables. On
the other hand in many areas now protected from floods, droughts and other
water-related constraints, conditions exist for considerable increases in crop
production through the use of high-yielding varieties and modern inputs.

ANNEX 6
Page 2
3.        The North China Plain contains some of the best land in China
for wheat, corn, cotton and oilseeds and cropping intensities of 140 to 150%
are achieved in many areas. There is still potential, however, in many parts
of the Plain to raise yields and production which in turn would increase
farm incomes and reduce China's imports of foodgrains and cotton. The
objectives of the study would be to: (a) identify the main physical,
agronomic and financial constraints to higher crop production in selected
areas of the North China Plain; (b) formulate agricultural development plans
to overcome these constraints; and (c) identify and prepare future agricul-
tural projects.
4.        The study would initially concentrate on the lands bordering the
Tuhai River in Shandong Province which is parallel to and north of the Huang
He. The study area (Area A) would cover about 740,000 ha, of which nearly
50% is uncultivated because of salinity and waterlogging. Techniques for
resource evaluation, development planning, and project preparation would be
developed in Area A for other areas to be selected in the North China Plain.
The study covered by this project will probably include Area A and several
other areas. It is likely that there would be some overlap in studies of
selected areas, for example a study of a second area could begin before
completion of Area A.
5.        The study of each selected area would be in three stages.  The
first stage would aim at providing a broad understanding of the present
situation in regard to agricultural development. The second stage would
formulate an overall plan for agricultural development in the area, including
priorities for development by sub-area. The third stage would include
preparation of priority projects identified in the second stage.
6.        Stage I would include data collection and analysis relating to:
(a) present land use, crops and crop rotations;
(b) physical constraints such as drought, waterlogging
and salinity;
(c) resources available to overcome such constraints
including surface and groundwater resources and
access to main drains;
(d) socioeconomic factors relating to crop production
such as commodity and input prices, labor avail-
ability, organization of collectives, sideline
activities, etc.;
(e) agronomic factors such as availability of improved
crop varieties, seed production and quality, chemical
control and fertilizer needs, crop specialization
with regard to soil and water regimes, etc; and



- 81 -
ANNEX 6
Page 3
(f) other factors bearing on agricultural development such
as support services, marketing, storage, processing
and credit.
7.         Stage II would outline a phased development plan by sub-areas
together with proposals for overcoming the main physical, socioeconomic, and
agronomic contraints and improving supporting services and other facilities.
Criteria for ranking sub-areas in order of priority for development would be
developed and then applied in selecting sub-areas for detailed preparation.
8.         Stage III would include feasibility studies of several sub-areas
with priority for development including designs, cost estimates, and economic
and financial analyses.
9.         The studies would be carried out primarily by the staff of the
provincial and county agricultural bureaus with assistance from specialist
institutes at the provincial and central government levels. Technical
support would also be provided by local and foreign consultants. The
consulting services would probably be best provided through an association
between a local consulting entity (several have recently been formed) and a
foreign firm. A contract with a consulting firm rather than with individual
experts has the advantage that it can include, in addition to specialist
services, study tours and training at the firm's offices, computer services,
and procurement of instruments, vehicles, etc. needed for the study.
10.       The services of the foreign consultant would not be needed on a
continuous basis throughout the study, but would consist of one or two visits
each year. A preliminary estimate of the man-month input for various
specialties together with a cost estimate for the study is shown in Tables 6.1
and 6.2.

CHINA
NORTH CHINA PLAIN AGRICULTURE PROJECT
Accounting and Disbursement Procedures for Works Executed by Force Account
1.        All of the project works would be carried out by the provinces,
counties, and collectives. All of these entities have established accounting
systems for keeping track of expenditures on a wide range of activities
in the areas for which they are responsible. These accounts are kept in
considerable detail and there is believed to be a high degree of control
over public funds in rural areas of China. In particular, the communes
and production brigades and production teams maintain detailed accounts because
of the "work points system" which is the basis for compensating their members.
2.        A system to maintain separate accounts for project related
construction could be devised but it would have to be instituted in three
provinces, nine counties, 85 communes and over 1600 production brigades.
Such a system would cover all wages paid and materials consumed and could serve
as complete documentation for disbursements against force account work.
It would involve, however, a vast amount of data all prepared in the Chinese
language and the Chinese script. Clearly, therefore, it would have to be
summarized and translated. There is the risk that the implementing agencies
would encounter delays similar to those experienced in other countries where
force account disbursements rely on complete documentation. This could lead
to delays in disbursements and could create shortages of funds which would
in turn delay the projects. Even if such a system could be made to work,
the Government's auditors would face a difficult problem in relating expenditures
to physical progress and this in turn would create problems for the Bank in
being sure that the expenditures reported are consistent with the works
constructed. This is because the documentation would be in the form of wages,
material  expenses etc. but there would be no link to physical quantities.
3.        An alternative approach, to be implemented for this project, is to
disburse on the basis of agreed unit prices for major work items.- There is
already a considerable amount of data underlying the unit prices which have
been used in preparing the project cost estimates and these will be used in
the first year of the project. However, special field studies would be
undertaken in each province to update and if necessary revise the unit prices
for use in subsequent disbursement applications.
4.        The counties would each prepare a quarterly report on physical
progress in the format shown in Annex 8. This would form the basis for the
disbursement application for force account expenditures shown in Table 1,
These would be consolidated by the central PMO to produce an application
for the project as a whole.
