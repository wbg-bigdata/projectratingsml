Overall (Weighted) Rating:                                          Moderately Satisfactory**
* The PDO changed only slightly in the 2006 Additional Financing amendment, to add reference to
improved access to services and the expansion from 22 to 28 project districts. However, the core of the
PDO -- reducing livelihoods vulnerability to drought -- remained the same. IDA rated DO and IP as
Satisfactory at the time that the AF was approved by the Board. The KPIs to achieve the PDO were
reformulated in the AF amendment. As the task team and counterparts had been working on refining the
results framework from early on in project implementation, little emphasis was placed on accumulating
data for some of the original indicators. The final IE and the Borrower’s ICR used the revised KPIs to
assess outcomes. Given that 3 of the 6 original PDO indicators were similar to revised KPI 1 on food aid,
and a fourth was virtually the same as new KPI 3 on the nutritional status of children under 5 years of age,
the IL-ICR agrees with IDA ratings for these four original indicators, and assesses achievements to be in
the Achieved/Satisfactory range. The other two original indicators called for increases in the volume and
value of various livestock and other productive assets. ALRMP II made successful investments in both,
therefore the outcomes would also probably have been assessed to be either Partially Achieved or Achieved.
However, since they were dropped, and there were no similar indicators after the AF, the IL-ICR team did
not have sufficient supporting information on them and has no choice but to assess achievement of these
two original indicators to be Moderately Unsatisfactory. With four original indicators rated Satisfactory
and two Moderately Unsatisfactory, the IL-ICR team assesses overall achievements against original project
targets to be Moderately Satisfactory.

** Approximately 30.5% of total project resources were disbursed before the minor reformulation of the
PDO and revision of KPIs. See first part of Section H above. The overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory
at completion is based on a weighted average of the outcome ratings for the original and revised KPIs.

1.         Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1        Context at Appraisal

1.       The Arid Lands Resource Management Project Phase Two (ALRMP II) was the
latest stage in a nearly two-decades long partnership between International Development
Association (IDA) and the Government of Kenya (GoK) to strengthen drought
management and reduce vulnerability of pastoralists and small farmers in Kenya’s very
poor and fragile arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs). The partnership evolved from: (i)
emergency support after a severe drought in the early 1990s (Emergency Drought
Recovery Project, EDRP1); to (ii) the development under the first phase of ALRMP2 of a
community-based drought early warning system (EWS) for the arid districts; contingency
planning at the district level; institutional and financial arrangements to reduce response
times and improve drought management; small investments to reduce livelihoods
vulnerability; and finally (iii) to ALRMP II, which aimed to continue working in the arid
districts while extending parts of the program to the semi-arid districts, enhance and
substantially scale up the EWS and other institutional, financial and inter-agency
coordination arrangements, expand investments to improve livelihoods, and intensify
advocacy for a much stronger policy focus on the ASALs.

2.     Although not characterized as climate change adaptation projects, both the first
and second phases of ALRMP aimed to strengthen the coping, resilience and adaptive
responses of the rural poor in the ASALs to worsening drought conditions that are now
recognized to be consequences of long-term climate change and climate variability in the
Horn of Africa.

3.       The Implementation Completion and Result Report (ICR) by the Africa Region
and subsequent Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) by IDA’s Operations
Evaluation Department (OED, now the Independent Evaluation Group--IEG) assessed
that the first phase of ALRMP had high strategic relevance, that outcomes were
satisfactory with some drought management activities highly satisfactory, and that
institutional impact was also high.

4.     At the time of ALRMP II preparation, the IDA Country Assistance Strategy
FY04-07, Kenya’s draft 2001-04 PRSP (Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and
Employment Creation--ERS), and its Rural Development Strategy (KRDS, 2002)
emphasized poverty reduction, greater popular participation, and increasing
decentralization of decision making over resource allocation and service delivery. This

existing credits: Cr. 1758-KE (Animal Health Services – US$2.5 million), Cr. 1974-KE (Rural Services
Design – US$2.75 million) and Cr. 2199-KE (Second National Agricultural Extension – US$2 million
equivalent).

policy orientation reflected dramatic changes in the Kenyan political environment, as the
presidential elections of December 2002 brought about a peaceful transition from a
government that had been in place for 24 years to a new, participatory, and forward-
looking administration.

5.      The change in government and trend towards decentralization offered
opportunities for ALRMP II to scale up the agenda that had been initiated under the first
project, i.e., building capacity and empowering pastoralist and small farmer communities
in the ASALs to participate more actively in identifying and advocating for their own
development priorities – centered very much around reducing risks and vulnerability to
droughts. IDA also considered that the time was propitious for a stronger emphasis on
governance issues in Kenya, and saw community-driven development (CDD) as one
instrument for improving transparency, citizen capacity to engage upward, and downward
accountability by national and local governments. The first phase of ALRMP had been
in the forefront in piloting CDD in Kenya, and ALRMP II continued this effort.

6.     ALRMP II, the subject of this Intensive Learning Implementation Completion
Report (IL-ICR), was financed by IDA Credit 37950 of US$60 million equivalent,
approved on June 19, 2003, and by Additional Financing (AF) under IDA Credit 37951
of US$60 million approved on August 8, 2006, for a total of US$120 million equivalent.
The total value increased over time to US$124.1 million, as a result of exchange rate
changes.3

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

7.       The original PDO of ALRMP II was to enhance food security and reduce
livelihood vulnerability in drought-prone and marginalized communities in 22 ASAL
districts. This would be achieved by: (i) strengthening and institutionalizing natural
resources and drought management; (ii) empowering communities so that they could
successfully identify, implement and sustain their development priorities through CDD;
and (iii) fostering a conducive enabling environment for ASAL development through
policy support, advocacy and improvement of essential services, complementing existing
sector programs.

8.      PDO results were to be measured by the following original key performance
indicators (PAD A.2 and Annex 1):

        (i)    Decreasing annual trend in the number and percentage of people of targeted
               communities in each district seeking/receiving free food aid;

  In November 2006, the GEF Council allocated US$6.5 million from the Special Climate Change Fund
(SCCF) for a Kenya Adaptation to Climate Change in Arid and Semi-arid Lands (KACCAL) project, of
which IDA would develop US$5.5 million and the UNDP US$1 million. IDA approved the trust fund in
June 2010, but it is not yet effective. This IL-ICR does not cover KACCAL, although it does refer to some
preparatory studies that provided useful information for evaluation of ALRMP II outcomes.


                                                   2
       (ii)  Increasing annual trend in the percentage of communities with food
             consumption above national food poverty line at historically driest month
             (pastoralists) and before harvest (farmers);
       (iii) Decreased variability in food consumption at household level within and
             between years;
       (iv) Increased value and diversity of livestock, productive and household assets,
             with focus on female-headed households and marginal groups;
       (v) Increased diversity and amount of household income from sources that are
             drought-tolerant and environmentally non-degrading for targeted
             communities;
       (vi) Improved child nutrition and health indicators for children below 5 (weight
             for height/weight for age as an anthropometric proxy).

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

9.      The PDO was modified very slightly, and the key indicators were revised to (i)
reflect changes associated with the AF; (ii) consolidate and improve the measurability of
several of indicators; and (iii) better align the indicators with the evolving focus of
ALRMP II and expected causality between project interventions and outcomes.

10.   Revised PDO: To reduce livelihood vulnerability, enhance food security, and
improve access to basic services in 28 drought prone arid and semi-arid districts in Kenya.

11.    The minor changes to the PDO were the reference to access to basic services,
which had always been part of the project but were not explicitly captured in the original
PDO formulation; and the increased number of target districts from 22 to 28 made
possible by the AF in 2006.

Revised PDO Indicators:

       (i)   Decreasing proportion of people assessed as needing free food aid in each
             arid and semi-arid district affected by severity of drought;
       (ii) Reducing the time lapse between reported drought stress and response;
       (iii) Improved nutritional status of children below 5 years of age affected by
             severity of drought over time;
       (iv) Increased number of people with access to basic services (water, human, and
             animal health services and education);
       (v) Increased people’s participation in the project districts in local and national
             development as demonstrated by the reflection of arid lands concerns in the
             economic recovery strategy and other relevant national policies.

12.    The revisions to the PDO indicators partly reflected changes associated with the
AF (the increased emphasis on drought management and recovery). However, they were
mainly the result of work over the first few project years to strengthen the Monitoring &
Evaluation (M&E) framework. Revised Key Performance Indicator (KPI) (i) on the share



                                            3
of people needing food aid consolidated and replaced original PDO indicators (i), (ii),
and (iii), which had also dealt with food needs, and it made explicit the notion of
normalizing for drought severity to ensure proper inter-annual comparisons. Revised KPI
(iii) on child nutrition replaced original indicator (vi), making more explicit the focus on
drought impacts (amongst the many other factors that can influence child nutrition).
Revised KPIs (ii), (iv), and (v) were new; they provided monitorable measures of
outcomes that had always been considered important causal factors for achieving the
PDO, but for which there had not been original indicators. Original indicators (iv) and
(v) on assets and incomes were dropped, as the project emphasis was shifting towards
drought management and recovery. The IL-ICR team’s views on these changes are
included in Section 2.3.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

13.      The main intended beneficiaries of ALRMP II were (i) those households in the
ASALs whose vulnerability to droughts was reduced and access to services improved as
a result of project interventions, as well as (ii) those for whom the consequences of
droughts were lessened because of the impact of the project EWS, contingency fund and
coordination mechanisms on the timing of drought response efforts by GoK and other
actors. ALRMP II planned to focus on the most vulnerable people within the ASAL
districts, both from the standpoint of poverty4 and also with reference to gender (women),
age (children) and marginalized groups.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

14.     ALRMP II originally had three components, which are described below. All three
were to be implemented in the 11 arid districts; only Component 1 would be implemented
in 11 semi-arid districts. The semi-arid “extension? districts as they are referred to in
project documents were selected based on rainfall and vegetation types of agro-ecological
zones 5-7, and levels of food insecurity measured by qualification for World Food
Program (WFP) emergency food in the 2001 drought assessment.



4
  The 28 ASAL districts include 80% of Kenya’s total land area (58 million ha) and 25% of its population.
These are the poorest areas in Kenya – 75% of the inhabitants of the North-Eastern Province and over half
those in the Eastern Province live below the national poverty line (Kenya Poverty and Inequality
Assessment, 2009). The seven districts with the highest poverty rates are all in the ASALs. A large
proportion of the North-Eastern population is engaged in pastoral or agro-pastoral livelihoods, just 4% has
access to electricity, 88% of adults have not completed primary education, and 50% of children are not
enrolled in primary school. Due inter alia to lack of public infrastructure, only 8.7% of the population has
access to formal finance, significantly lower than the national average (18.5%). In 2003, the mean
household time to a water source was 85 minutes in the rural North-Eastern province -- more than 3 times
the national average (DHS 2003). The area is prone to increasingly unpredictable and prolonged periods of
severe drought.




                                                     4
15.      Component 1: Natural Resource Management and Drought Management
(US$99.7 million total cost, including IDA and GoK) had two sub-components: (i)
Natural Resource Management; and (ii) Drought Preparedness and Management. The
first sub-component aimed to improve knowledge, planning and implementation of
activities to make the most beneficial and sustainable long-term use of the natural assets
of the ASALs. The second sub-component supported enhanced work on drought
preparedness and response, to create a more effective drought cycle management system
at the national and the district level.

16.      Component 2: Community Driven Development (US$28.6 million total cost,
including IDA, GoK and communities) aimed to empower communities to take greater
charge of their own development agenda, through three sub-components: (i) Support to
CDD implementation; (ii) Community Capacity Building; and (iii) Capacity Building for
Backstopping Services. The first sub-component financed community-prioritized micro-
projects, to which communities would contribute 30 percent. The second sub-component
supported the training of communities and their management committees to build
capacity to identify priority investments, keeping in mind the special needs of
marginalized groups, and to implement the projects and account for the funding received.
The third sub-component financed communities’ support and backstopping from the
district level project staff and Mobile Extension Teams (METs).

17.     Component 3: Support to Local Development (US$16.6 million, including
IDA and GoK) had three sub-components: (i) Policy, Advocacy and Research; (ii) Local
Services Development; and (iii) Piloting Financial Services. The first sub-component
sought to ensure that the needs of the arid districts were adequately reflected in national
and sector policy initiatives. The second sub-component supported the strengthening of
local services in sectors that are essential to the sustainable development of arid lands
communities by complementing existing government and partner programs. The third
sub-component supported the piloting of low-cost delivery of financial services, to which
the ASAL population had very limited access.

1.6    Revised Components

18.      In 2006, to help GoK scale up selected project activities to deal with severe
drought consequences of 2.5 years of poor rains, IDA doubled its support for ALRMP II
by providing AF of US$60 million equivalent. The AF maintained the same components,
but changed the relative emphasis among them. Resources for Natural Resource
Management (NRM) and Drought Management (Component 1) were substantially
increased, although there were also small increases for Community Development
(Component 2) and Local Development (Component 3). The possibility of such a shift in
emphasis had been foreseen in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), which stated that
if severe drought persisted, relatively more of ALRMP II project effort would necessarily
shift into drought mitigation, response and recovery (PAD Critical Risks template, p. 43).




                                            5
1.7     Other significant changes

19.     Expansion of Geographic Coverage. When the AF was approved, six more semi-
arid districts were added that had initially been excluded from ALRMP II due to resource
constraints.

20.     Shift of GoK Ministerial Responsibility for ALRMP II. In 2003, the PCU moved
from the Ministry of Provincial Administration to the Ministry of State for Special
Programs, both in the Office of the President. In 2008, it moved again to a newly created
Ministry of State for Development of Northern Kenya & Other Arid Lands, coordinated
by the Prime Minister.

21.    Extension of IDA Credit Closing Date. In 2006, the Credit closing date was
extended from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2010 to accommodate activities under the AF.
On June 30, 2010, it was extended to December 31, 2010, i.e., a total of 18 months
beyond the original closing date, to facilitate completion activities and transition to an
expected follow-on operation.

22.     Informal Suspension of IDA Credit. Based on an understanding of preliminary
findings of an Institutional Integrity (INT) forensic audit, in July 2010 management
informally suspended IDA financing for ALRMP II, and the suspension remained in
place through closing on December 31, 2010 (Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.4. 5.1(b)).

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

23.     The task team drew on a wide range of inputs that collectively provided a sound
basis for the design of ALRMP II: (i) lessons learned during implementation of the first
phase of ALRMP and the predecessor Emergency Drought Project; (ii) a Beneficiary
Assessment Study of the first phase project; (iii) the ICR for the first phase, which was
completed in time to inform the appraisal of ALRMP II; (iv) a Social Assessment of
conditions affecting pastoralists and small farmers in the ASALs; and (v) work of the
pastoral thematic team that had participated in drafting Kenya’s 2002 PRSP, including
extensive consultations in the ASALs.5 As CDD activities had been piloted under the first
phase and were expected to be scaled up in the arid districts under ALRMP II, the team
also reviewed CDD experiences in the Africa Region.6

deepening community participation in preparation of the drought risk management plans;
(ii) the need to strengthen ALRMP’s M&E systems; (iii) the need for a clear framework
for management, protection and sustainable development of the arid lands natural
resource base; and (iv) the importance of requiring community contributions to CDD
micro-projects to avoid dependency and build ownership. The Beneficiary Assessment
came to some of the same conclusions and also emphasized the importance of an
enabling policy environment and institutions for the long-term sustainability of ALRMP
impacts. The CDD review focused on: (i) models of community participation and
indigenous management of water systems; (ii) the need to link CDD actions with local
government structures, and empower and strengthen local authorities; and (iii) potential
CDD contributions to improving local governance and accountability.

25.      The design team had a good range of skills and drew on appropriate peer
guidance (Annex 4), with a few exceptions. Although the CDD component of ALRMP II
reflects lessons from experience in the Africa Region, the team could also have drawn on
best practice knowledge available at the time from other regions (e.g., Indonesia, India,
Bangladesh, and Brazil). Inter alia, these would have included: (i) the importance of
having much clearer ‘rules of the game’ defined up front; (ii) greater clarity as to how
communities, beneficiary groups and micro-projects would be selected; (iii) how
decision-making would take place at all stages; (iv) the role of communities and other
actors in implementation, including how financial management (FM) and procurement
activities would be carried out; and (v) how O&M responsibilities would be defined and
discharged. The CDD manual was prepared during implementation, rather than up-front.
Indicators to measure CDD outcomes/outputs were weak, and some of these were
dropped at the time of the AF, which complicated the task of assessing empowerment
achievements at project completion. The M&E framework also had several shortcomings
(discussed below). The financial services activity responded to a perceived need to
strengthen access to finance by the ASAL population, but was not well grounded in
analysis of the Kenyan micro-finance sector. Objectives were vague and implementation
arrangements not commensurate with the challenge that the activity proposed to address.

26.      There were several areas of excellence in design, including: (i) innovative work
linking natural resource management and conflict resolution; (ii) multi-sectoral and inter-
agency coordination on drought management at national, district and local levels; and
(iii) the community-based drought Early Warning System (EWS) in which Kenya has
become a recognized regional leader.

27.     Project content and organizational structure were straightforward, and tightly
linked to the results chain to achieve the PDO. For the most part, the team avoided the
risk of including activities, however worthwhile, that were not critical to the central
objective of enhancing food security and reducing livelihood vulnerability in drought
prone and marginalized ASAL communities. One exception was the financial services
activity. The inferred objectives may well be important for long-term adaptation to




                                            7
drought conditions in the ASALs, but the link to the PDO was not clear, sub-component
activities were vague and little was accomplished.

28.     Several critical risks and mitigation measures were well defined. Some significant
risks, however, were underestimated, and the task team did not foresee fiduciary and
accountability risks that were noted in the course of implementation.

       (i)    The team’s assessment as ‘negligible’ of the risk that GoK would not
              institutionalize the drought management system into government structures
              proved optimistic, as this has been partially achieved to date. The system is
              functioning well on the ground, and GoK established a new National
              Drought Management Authority (NDMA) in November 2011 after ALRMP
              II completion. However, other important institutional arrangements have
              not yet been formalized, although the failure to do so thus far has been due
              more to delays caused by governmental organizational changes and the
              constitutional reform process than to lack of GoK commitment.

       (ii)   Fiduciary risks were detailed in the PAD Annexes. Since some procurement
              and financial management sub-risks were assessed to be Substantial or High,
              they should also have been reflected in the main PAD Critical Risks
              template. Risks related to accountability of expenditures at local levels and
              capacity for record-keeping were underestimated.

       (iii) The design team did not foresee the risk of suspension of financing, linked
             to the fiduciary risks noted above. The informal suspension undermined
             ALRMP II’s impact in the final project period and elevated risks to
             sustainability of project achievements. Subsequent to project closing,
             however, and with better understanding of the limitations of the findings of
             INT, both IDA and other partners have renewed commitment to future
             support for the agenda supported under ALRMP II. The risk to
             sustainability of the core interventions is thus rated Moderate.

2.2    Implementation

29.    Factors that affected implementation: ALRMP II implementation was affected
by several positive and adverse factors.

30.     Positive factors: A very seasoned and highly motivated Project Coordination
Unit (PCU), with good continuity in staffing and access to high-level decision-makers.
The PCU had gained considerable experience under the predecessor ALRMP (and
EDRP) operations. Although reporting responsibilities were changed twice during the
project period (see Section 1.7), key staff continued in place and the project enjoyed
consistently high priority, good access to senior officials, and timely and adequate
counterpart financing.

31.    Support by a wide range of stakeholders. Information generated by the project
(through the EWS) and its institutional structure (particularly the District Steering


                                             8
Groups--DSGs) came to be used increasingly by government, all major donors and other
stakeholders, and this in turn strengthened the project’s influence and effectiveness.

32.    Increasing attention to global climate change adaptation. When the 2006 Stern
Report and 2007 findings of the Fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) were published, ALRMP II – which was focused precisely on strengthening
coping skills and supporting adaptive responses to accelerating climate change – was
under implementation and producing results. As many countries and donors, including
the World Bank Group, began considering how to design such programs, ALRMP II was
already generating valuable lessons that were helpful to GoK in formulating its own
national position on climate change adaptation. This also enabled ALRMP II to attract
additional support, such as the Global Environment Facility—Kenya Adaptation to
Climate Change in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands Project (GEF-KACCAL) European Union
Drought Management Initiative Trust Fund (EU-DMI) and the proposed follow-up
Sector-wide Approach (SWAp) operation.

33.     Growing recognition of ALRMP II’s effectiveness as a social safety net for the
rural poor in the ASALs. When the global food security crisis emerged in 2008, although
the community-based EWS and organizational structure at district level in the ASALs
had been developed for other purposes, they served as another reminder of the
effectiveness of ALRMP II as a safety net able to reach the grass roots level quickly in
response to crises, and this added to the project’s legitimacy and influence.

34.     Economic growth. Much of ALRMP II implementation took place in a context of
strong economic growth (3.7 percent p.a. 2002-07) that contributed to a stable fiscal
situation and helped to ensure steady counterpart funding. A combination of shocks (on
the domestic front: drought and electoral crisis; on the global front: food security and
financial crises) made the situation in 2008-10 more difficult, but did not affect domestic
financing for ALRMP II.

35.     Adverse developments: Political instability. Highly contested elections in 2007
led to outbreaks of violence that were unprecedented in Kenya in recent years, and these
affected implementation of some project activities. They also resulted in a number of
organizational changes within government, which delayed consideration of several draft
policies that ALRMP II had helped to formulate, and the incorporation of some aspects of
ALRMP’s institutional arrangements into government structures (DSGs, Peace
Committees, and Drought Contingency Fund). Establishment of a long proposed National
Drought Management Authority took place in November 2011, after project completion.
The ongoing constitutional reform process will result in a new county structure at the
sub-national level, in place of districts, to which the institutional arrangements used under
ALRMP II will need to adjust. On the other hand, the new Constitution provides for
greater decentralization of government roles and responsibilities, consistent with ALRMP
II themes of greater local participation and voice.

36.    Increasing frequency, severity and duration of drought. The implementation
period of ALRMP II has coincided with several years of severe, prolonged droughts,



                                             9
together with more difficult ‘regular’ drought periods. ALRMP II responded well and
produced some very strong results in terms of assisting the ASAL population in coping.
However, these crises did cause the project to focus heavily on drought management and
recovery, and reduced somewhat the scope for concentrating on community development
and longer-term adaptation investments, as many households struggled during certain
periods with the challenges of day-to-day survival.

37.      Pace of implementation and disbursements proceeded largely as planned. The
Credit was signed and made effective as scheduled. Disbursement lags through 2006
when the AF was approved were marginal and usually related to timing of withdrawal
applications rather than real delays in activities. From approval of the AF through FY09,
activities stayed on track although absorbing the full incremental financing was
challenging and GoK therefore requested a six-month extension of the closing date to
December 31, 2010. IDA management approved the extension on June 30, 2010, but in
July it informally suspended disbursements. The final six months of implementation were
therefore disrupted, and project activities on the ground slowed down. As INT did not
provide its preliminary report to the government until April 2011, it was not possible to
process withdrawal applications and IDA therefore extended the normal four-month
period for final reconciliation of accounts to six months, to June 30, 2011.

38.     Implementation Status Report (ISR) ratings. Project ISRs from Effectiveness
through the Closing Date rated overall progress toward achievement of the PDO and
implementation progress (DO and IP, respectively) as Satisfactory. The only sub-rating
that slipped into the Unsatisfactory range on one occasion during this period concerned
financial management, for the reasons discussed in the fiduciary section below. For the
most part the IL-ICR team found ratings well supported by information in the ISRs, aide-
memoires and/or project files. However, the ICR team would have lowered the sub-
assessment of M&E in the early years of the project. An additional ISR, entered into the
Operations Portal four months after Closing, downgraded the DO to Moderately
Unsatisfactory and the IP to Unsatisfactory, mainly to reflect preliminary INT findings
(Section 2.4). The post-Closing Date ISR is listed in the Data Sheet. Pursuant to IEG
guidelines, the IL-ICR uses the final ISR before Closing for purposes of identifying
disconnects between completion and supervision ratings, and on this basis finds that there
is no disconnect. Furthermore, the INT findings have been revised several times since the
filing of the post-closing ISR, a development that was not foreseen at the time of the final
ISR.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Design

39.     The ICR on the first phase of ALRMP concluded that: “The main faults in the
project design were in not providing a sufficiently clear and detailed design for
monitoring and evaluation…? GoK and the task team attempted to address this in the
design of ALRMP II. In the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR), IEG advised that
14 of the 19 key indicators in the staff appraisal report for the first phase project related
to implementation rather than impact. While the other 5 indicators did seek to measure



                                             10
impact, none focused on qualitative aspects, e.g., responsiveness of district level
agencies. As the PPAR was issued in 2005, the recommendations were too late to
influence the design of ALRMP II’s original results framework, but they were helpful to
the task team in revising the KPIs at the time of the AF amendment in 2006.

40.     Despite the avowed intent to strengthen M&E, the ALRMP II PAD discussion on
the subject is somewhat diffuse. It refers to a baseline to be initiated before credit
effectiveness, a program of ongoing and periodic evaluations (including mid-term and
final termination evaluation), and a system of routine records and periodic monitoring
reports at community, district and project levels. The statement that “clear responsibilities
and procedures for M&E, including frequency, content and audience of project reports,
will be established early on in the project life? (PAD, p. 19) suggests inadequate
consideration of the project’s M&E needs during preparation. The KPIs were an
improvement over those of the first phase project, although there was some overlap
among the first 3 PDO indicators (on food aid) and one may have been difficult to
measure (i.e., consumption levels in respect of the national food poverty line in particular
months each year, for pastoralists and farmers). These were complemented by an
unwieldy set of 25 intermediate outcome/output indicators. The PAD had a logical
framework matrix and stated that a more detailed log frame was included in the Project
Implementation Plan (PIP), but the IL-ICR team was unable to find this. Baseline data
were not included in the log frame, although in many cases the team could have done so
based on its knowledge of the first phase project. Very few indicators had any
quantitative targets.

41.      Implementation and utilization of M&E arrangements have been mixed. On the
one hand, ALRMP II has a very elaborate Early Warning System (EWS) database drawn
from some 10,000 household questionnaires administered monthly, processed and with
results available on the web and distributed to district level monthly. The information is
widely used by the Kenya Food Security Steering Group (KFSSG), national and
international partners, and has shortened the response time and helped to improve the
transparency and governance of food relief efforts. ALRMP II also has: (i) participatory
needs assessments and plans for all 28 districts; (ii) assessments of potential conflict
flashpoints for the districts; (iii) annual project reports for each district; and (iv)
environmental audits, which were conducted almost every year. In other words, there is
an extremely rich amount of data that could support various research efforts. The absence
of a clear analytical structure to guide data collection, entry and analysis means, however,
that much of the information on hand may be difficult to reconcile/compare in a
statistically robust manner. These weaknesses also made it difficult for the project to
respond quickly and with comprehensive information to public criticisms when they
arose.

42.    Successive ISRs indicate a constant preoccupation by the task team to strengthen
M&E. The team developed a tighter set of PDO and output indicators, which were
adopted as part of the AF amendment in 2006 (see Section 1.3). Most of the changes
improve the log frame, although the IL-ICR has several reservations: (i) the KPI on
changes in the share of the population assessed as needing food aid refers to drought



                                             11
normalization (to be able to compare needs across drought years), but does not clarify the
methodology. There are different views on the subject and this has complicated end-of-
project evaluation; (ii) KPIs on asset/income accumulation and diversification were
dropped, although ALRMP II continued to invest in income-generating activities (IGAs);
(iii) there are no intermediate indicators to measure effectiveness of participatory
arrangements, and some indicators on gender and marginalized groups were dropped; (iv)
there is no effort to track specifically which other stakeholders are using the EWS, DSG
plans and coordination structures or the amount of additional resources being channeled
to the ASALs as a result of the project; (v) output indicators on financial services were
retained, although very little implementation was taking place/planned; and (vi) the
revised log frame still lacked baselines and targets for many indicators (although in a few
cases ISRs had more detail).

43.     A statistical baseline survey was carried out by the Central Bureau of Statistics on
behalf of the project in 21 of the 28 ASAL districts in 2004/05, covering 4,000 randomly
selected households. Later, as ALRMP II completion approached, the International
Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) was commissioned to conduct the final Impact
Evaluation (IE); a team including some very experienced researchers prepared a useful
report. Between June-August 2009, they re-surveyed a subset of the 4,000 households
using a similar questionnaire. Sample intervention and control communities were
identified and econometric techniques used to control for any underlying differences. A
survey was conducted of participants in the DSGs, and anthropometric data measuring
nutritional status of over 600,000 children was obtained for the period 2005-09. The
nutritional data (middle-upper arm circumference, MUAC) was then used to evaluate
welfare changes over time in a stochastic dominance framework, the first time such
techniques had been applied for that purpose, and the first to use stochastic dominance
analysis for MUAC data in particular. This analysis made it possible to detect project
impacts on the nutritional status of the worst off children. Qualitative information was
also gathered through focus group discussions in 21 of 24 treatment communities; and the
IE used this to prepare a social network analysis of changes in empowerment and ability
to access services.

44.    This IL-ICR is based on: (i) findings of the IE; (ii) several studies carried out in
preparation for the KACCAL GEF activity associated with ALRMP II, and others
financed by Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) and the EU in
preparation for a new follow-on project; (iii) ALRMP II project files; (iv) the Borrower’s
ICR, Borrower comments on IDA’s draft IL-ICR and other PCU contributions; and (v)
IL-ICR team analyses and consultations with a wide range of stakeholders in individual
and focus group meetings and three stakeholder workshops.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

45.     Safeguards.    The ALRMP II Environmental Category was B (Partial
Assessment). The project triggered IDA’s Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitats,
Forestry and Pest Management safeguard policies (OPs 4.01, and 4.09,
respectively). The project did not trigger any social safeguard policies and none arose



                                            12
during implementation. An Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Social Assessment
(SA) were carried out and an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) was
prepared and disclosed in the Bank Country Office and InfoShop. Environmental
considerations were integral to ALRMP II, since the project aimed to reduce vulnerability
in an environmentally fragile area subject to accelerating and negative climate change
impacts. Preparatory work on environmental issues was thorough and thoughtful, both as
part of the EA and EMF, and in the design of the three sub-components. The main risks
identified concerned potential cumulative impacts of small-scale investments that in
themselves were unlikely to be harmful, but in the aggregate could pressure the fragile
resource base (e.g., through over-extraction of groundwater, saline intrusion of aquifers
due to borehole investments). These aggregate effects were to be addressed both by
training and strengthening planning at the overall district level, and environmental
screening of individual sub-projects. ALRMP II design also provided for annual
environmental audits by independent consultants, in close consultation with Kenya’s
National Environment Management Authority (NEMA).7

46.     The IL-ICR team found Environmental Audits were done regularly during 2005-
08 and in 2010. It reviewed two of the audits and found them technically sound and
thorough. NEMA evaluated results, and comments were transmitted to ALRMP (to
component heads and partners) for follow-up. The reports were posted on the website
and the Drought Management Officers notice boards. Key findings were included in
flyers and brochures disseminated in the project area. ALRMP organized a public
awareness week, and used some District Agriculture Shows (e.g., in Garissa, Kilifi,
Malindi) to further disseminate environmental messages.8 A range of activities had taken
place as planned for DSGs, District Environment Officers, METs, Community Workers
and stakeholders. Prior to project implementation, ALRMP had profiled potential impacts
of the most common sub-projects, which helped alert beneficiaries and the DSG to the
need for mitigation measures. Environmental screening of individual investments
included public consultations. ALRMP II had at least two supervision missions per year.
These included frequent participation by environmental specialists; and aide-memoires
routinely addressed environmental issues, actions and follow-up.




7
  NEMA was under establishment during the first phase of ALRMP and became fully operational shortly
before the start-up of ALRMP II. Cooperation with IDA through ALRMP II and several IDA-GEF
activities has helped to strengthen NEMA capacity; in October 2011, NEMA achieved ISO 9001:2008
certification (www.nema.gov.ke).
8
  In field visits the IL-ICR mission was able to confirm dissemination of important messages. For example,
in a visit to the Kawana sand dam sub-project under the drought management component (aimed at creating
youth employment opportunities and improving livelihoods through enhanced irrigation activities and sale
of produce such as tomatoes, spinach, onions, capsicum and kale), the mission observed that youth group
had met often with the Mobile Extension Team (MET) on environmental safeguards, development of an
environmental management plan (EMP) and a Pest Management Plan (PMP). The latter recommended a
mix of farmer-driven, ecologically based pest control practices to reduce reliance on synthetic chemical
pesticides; the youths were fully aware of the non-eligibility of pesticides that include diazinon.

Fiduciary

47.      Procurement. GoK and the task team faced several challenges in designing the
ALRMP II procurement arrangements. The predecessor ALRMP had been the first IDA
CDD project in Kenya, at a time when national operational policies and procedures did
not envisage public funding of such decentralized community-led investments. Moreover,
the project was to be implemented in an immense land area, with the least developed road
network in the country, inhabited by dispersed pastoralist communities with very high
illiteracy. Procurement supervisions were done twice a year. Each mission covered a
few districts on an alternating basis due to the widespread nature of the project area, i.e.,
28 districts. Post procurement reviews (PPRs) were conducted once a year for the
districts covered during supervision missions. Although there was an expectation of a
gradual improvement in governance following introduction of the multiparty system in
2002, the pace of procurement reforms initiated in 1998 was sluggish and project
procurement risk was rated High (and has remained so throughout the implementation of
ALRMP II).

48.     In total, US$118.3 million was disbursed out of a total IDA credit of US$124.1
million (original Credit of US$60 million equivalent plus AF of US$60 million and gains
from shifts in the USD : SDR exchange rate). Of this, nearly US$80 million was spent on
works, goods and consultancy contracts. Expenditures on CDD activities were 16 percent
of the total (of which 11 percent for micro-projects and 5 percent for training and other
support activities); contracts executed by the PCU represented 64 percent; and the
remaining 20 percent or less related to procurement transactions carried out by the
Project District Coordination Units (DCUs).

49.     GoK prepared a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) that outlined the procurement
procedures for ALRMP II. This was supported by a Community Procurement Manual
and Community Accounting and Financial Reporting Manual that guided the Community
Development Committee (CDC) in carrying out day-to-day procurement activities. The
PIP prescribed a three-tier procurement implementation arrangement: (i) The PCU was
charged with the responsibility of procuring all International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
and a large proportion of National Competitive Bidding (NCB) goods and works
contracts, and all consultancy services contracts; (ii) DCUs were responsible for
procurement of goods and works required for common community facilities, and
procurement of goods for Components 1 and 3. Also, DCUs conducted procurement
training for CDC members, and provided technical support and oversight to
microprojects; and (iii) A procurement sub-committee of the Community Development
Committees (CDCs) was trained and designated to carry out procurement of goods and
works for Component 2.

50.    IDA supervised procurement implementation in two ways. ICB contracts and
consultancy contracts costing US$200,000 or more were subjected to prior review. IDA
also conducted annual PPRs on the procurement documentation for non-prior review
contracts at the PCU, DCU and CDC levels. The findings of all PPRs rated the



                                            14
procurement performance at the three levels as satisfactory, and IDA did not identify any
incidents of mis-procurement. PPRs at the district and community levels were carried out
during the supervision missions, and physical verification of goods and works
procurement constituted an integral part of the exercise.

51.   Financial Management.        The IL-ICR team reviewed the design and
implementation of FM arrangements.

52.     Flow of funds. Delays in disbursement were to be addressed to ensure timely
release of funds and authority to incur expenditures (AIEs) to districts. This action was
fully met and the disbursement rate of the project was one of the highest in the Kenya
portfolio. The PCU ensured that funds to districts were released together with the AIEs.
The disbursement rate on the credit was high in spite of the fact that ALRMP II financing
was suspended during the final six months before the Closing Date. There were some
challenges in raising community contributions and/or valuation of contributions in kind.
Disbursements were made to some community groups without the requisite community
contribution being made, as specified in the PAD.9 The reasons advanced by the PCU for
this were that some communities were too poor to make the contribution, or that it had
been made in kind but could not be quantified/valued and recorded. There were
challenges with in-country funds flow arrangement of moving funds from the Special
Account to the project account and eventually to the CDD accounts.

53.     Budgeting. A budget monitoring committee was established, but the line budget
approach of GoK differs from the IDA’s eligible expenditure format and this created
challenges in monitoring budget implementation. Therefore, there is a need to harmonize
IDA reporting with the GoK chart of accounts and budgets. GoK has now adopted a new
chart of accounts on the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS)
platform that enables reporting by both activity and line item up to district level.

54.     Accounting and Financial Reporting. The accounting capacity throughout project
implementation was assessed as adequate with 3 accountants at the PCU and project
district account in each of the 28 districts. The project jointly with IDA’s FM team
conducted regular capacity building training at Headquarters and districts. Delays in
rollout of IFMIS both at national and district level adversely affected the accounting
system with various material issues noted by auditors between project accounts and
IFMIS ledgers. This created material variances in the financial statements prepared by the
project and the corresponding project ledger accounts at the ministry and Minister of
Finance (MOF) level, and resulted in additional work of reconciling year-end accounts
for audit. This issue was the basis for audit qualifications by the Kenya National Audit
Office (KENAO) during the year-end audit review. The IDA FM team provided training
for the GoK Internal Audit Department (IAD). This allowed the IAD to conduct a



9
 However, in the aggregate community contributions of 30.9% slightly exceeded the share defined in the
project documents (30% - see Annex 2).

comprehensive risk-based fiduciary review of the project in January-March 2009. The
review consisted of detailed transaction review and on-site field audit at district and
community level. The review identified areas of internal control weaknesses that were
brought to the attention of the implementing agency for remedial measures. 10 On the
basis of the fiduciary review, the IAD included the project in the list of those that were
eligible for in-depth audit review that commenced in July 2009. Because INT had
already decided to undertake a separate and independent forensic audit, IAD, with
agreement of the World Bank, dropped the project from the in-depth audit. This decision
was taken to avoid duplication of effort, but ultimately put the project at a disadvantage
due to delayed completion of the forensic audit by INT and ambiguity regarding
interpretation of the findings. While the IDA Team detected control weaknesses, it is
questioned whether the severity and scope of potential issues was realized and whether
the recommended action was sufficient and followed-up systematically.

55.     The project was able to prepare and submit Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) to
the Bank within the stipulated time lines. However, the accounting weaknesses at district
and community level as well as the variances in project and ministry level accounting
records negatively affected the quality of the reports. The annual financial statements
were similarly affected as noted from the audit qualifications. In addition, the IFR was
prepared largely to meet the Bank’s financial covenants, but was not utilized fully by the
implementing ministry as a management tool. As part of the IDA FM team capacity
building measures, the project was able to submit analysis of funds disbursed to
communities per district as part of the quarterly IFR. However, the IFR did not indicate
the status of accountability of these funds once disbursed. This was in line with the
agreed FM arrangements of the CDD components, whereby disbursement via the IFR
was made on the basis of advances to communities and not final accountability by the
same. This was a portfolio level limitation for all Kenya CDD projects. The FM
arrangements at district and community level at the time would not have been able to
support such accountability within the deadline required for submission of the IFR. As
the IFMIS is rolled out to the district/county level, it will be possible in future Kenya
CDD projects to provide accountability of community advances before reimbursement is
made via IFR/Statement of Expenditure (SOE). The IFR is also an unaudited financial
report and supporting documents are not attached at time of submission and clearance.
However, the Bank FM supervision, and audit reports (KENAO and IAD) provide for
regular detailed transaction reviews to reconcile the IFR expenditures to the cashbooks,
payment vouchers and other underlying supporting documents.

56.     Internal Controls. The project developed a community grant manual for the CDD
component, and relied on GoK financial guidelines and regulations for Headquarters and
district levels. There was good compliance on both the grant manual and the GoK


10
  IDA had downgraded the FM rating to MS in the ISRs of December 2007, May 2008 and December
2008. On the basis of actions taken to correct weaknesses noted, the rating was upgraded to S in June 2009,
then lowered to MU in December 2009 and upgraded again to MS in June 2010, the final ISR before the
closing date.



                                                   16
financial regulations. However, internal control lapses occurred at Headquarters, district
and community level. This was partially due to the fact that GoK regulations on CDD
operations are not comprehensive. This is a country level FM capacity issue that was
flagged in FM supervision reports and GoK internal and external audits.11 In addition,
material internal control weaknesses were noted at the PCU, districts and community
levels. There was weak accounting capacity at community level that adversely affected
the project internal control environment. The FM reviews revealed instances whereby
project funds were not properly accounted for, or the payments were otherwise not
properly supported (e.g., weaknesses with fixed assets control, vehicle usage and costs,
workshops, staff advances/imprest, staff allowances, micro-project control, value-for-
money). These weaknesses were not detected before 2007, when a complaint was lodged
and an internal review undertaken. Adjustments in internal controls were introduced at
the time in response to these observations, but the effectiveness of these adjustments is
not known due to loss of records during the forensic audit and the absence of a
transaction-level audit subsequent to the introduction of changes. Some cases of
suspected fraud and corruption were noted in the audit reports, which, together with
additional outside reports of irregularity resulted in the subsequent INT forensic audit.
Follow-up on suspected fraud and corruption is still under way and not yet conclusive.
The questions about internal controls and difficulties reaching definitive answers confirm
that the risks were high. The fact that questions raised proved difficult to answer confirms
the need for better record keeping and faster access to primary records in response to
queries.

57.     Auditing. Audit reports were submitted on time and the PCU followed up on
findings. The audits were conducted in line with International Standards of Accounting.
The FM team conducted FM capacity building training of the KENAO which enabled the
auditors to conduct on-site field audit reviews at district and community level. The audit
reports were qualified on the basis of variances between the line ministry ledger accounts
of the project and financial statements prepared by the PCU, as discussed below.

58.     Social accountability. Although the original project design did not specifically
provide for social accountability mechanisms, agreements reached at the time of the AF
strengthened requirements for public disclosure and access to information, and scaled up
community, district, and national monitoring. The grant manual was revised over time
accordingly, particularly with respect to public reporting and complaints handling. There
were requirements that cheques to the communities be issued in public forum, project
budgets be disclosed at district level, and that district level financial reports be accessible
to community members. Finally, information related to the micro-projects was to be
disclosed at the project office in each district. Implementation of some requirements was
fairly consistent (e.g., public disclosure of micro-project information at district offices),
but less so in other cases (e.g., branding of micro-projects and other local investments),


11
   IDA is now working with an MOF-led effort to develop a new policy to ensure effective governance
structures and good financial management and procurement systems and guidelines for devolved funds at
national, county, facility and community levels (see Annex 2).



                                                 17
and supervision by IDA of social accountability dimensions was not systematic. Overall,
more could have been done to enhance social accountability mechanisms earlier, as was
already the case in some CDD projects in other countries.

59.     INT Review. In 2009, INT began a review of possible fraud and corruption in
ALRMP II, in response to information from outside the Bank and from a report by the
Africa Region conveyed in May of 2007. At the time of the 2007 report, INT reviewed
the response of the GoK and determined that further action by INT was not then required.
The issue was reopened in early 2009 in response, as noted above, to an in-depth review
of several projects by the FM team and to a renewed external report of irregularities. In
July 2010, INT provided a verbal report to Management, indicating that a high share of
expenditures incurred in financial years 2007 and 2008 in seven districts reviewed by
INT were questionable and suspected fraudulent. Upon receipt of the verbal report,
Management informally suspended IDA financing for ALRMP II. A preliminary written
report of findings was given to GoK nine months later, in April 2011, with further
annexed details provided in June 2011. The written report had a share of questionable
expenditures considerably lower than that contained in the earlier verbal report to
management. INT’s preliminary written report was published on the INT web site on
July 15, 2011. Kenya’s IAD reported back its assessment of the INT findings on August
16, 2011, questioning the methodology used by INT and the findings on the extent of
misuse of funds and/or corruption. The IDA Board of Directors was briefed on the status
of the review at several points, and requested a discussion that was held in October 2011.
Subsequent to the Board discussion, IAD and INT undertook an effort to resolve the
differences in approach and findings. In November 2011 the GoK agreed to repay KES
340 million (US$3.8 million at exchange rate of November 30, 2011), although
agreement has not yet been reached on the extent of and reason for ineligibility of
expenditures due to continued questions on methodology and procedure of the forensic
audit. This IL-ICR comments on the process of the review to the extent that it had a
bearing on supervision (Section 5.1(b)), on the impacts on implementation of the
ALRMP II program (Section 2.2), and the risks to sustainability of its achievements
(Section 4). The findings of the review and their interpretation are still under discussion
and beyond the technical scope of the ICR team.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

60.    Until the final stages of ALRMP II implementation, GoK, IDA and other partners
had expected that there would be a follow-up operation. Substantial preparatory work
was completed. As a result of issues related to the forensic audit, however, Bank
management stopped preparation work in late FY11, and no decision has been made on a
next round of support. IDA has been the lead partner for ALRMP. Other donors that had
planned to co-finance the next phase are therefore waiting for a decision by IDA.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

61.     The objectives of ALRMP II had high strategic importance for Kenya when it was
designed, and this continued throughout implementation and remains the case today.
Development challenges of the ASALs figured prominently in Kenya’s PRSP (Economic
Recovery Strategy – being drafted at the time the project was under preparation and
finalized in 2004), and were reiterated in the letter of Sectoral Policy submitted to IDA at
the time of credit negotiations. They were also well reflected in IDA’s Country
Assistance Strategy at the time. The PRSP states that “to address poverty reduction
targets, the ERS identified some priority programs that target poor communities, the poor
in arid and semi-arid areas, the urban poor and the marginalized poor.? The Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) from 2004 highlights that targeted programs under the pillar 2
poverty reduction and equity include community-driven development in the arid and
semiarid areas of Kenya The challenges of the ASALs figure in the more recent Vision
2030, and ALRMP II was expected to play an important role in helping to achieve several
outcomes of IDA’s current Country Partnership Strategy for Kenya, in relation to poverty,
decentralization and improved local governance, environment, natural resource
management and climate change adaptation. As global attention to climate change has
increased, Kenya has been identified as one of the countries likely to be severely affected
– some, though not all, of these challenges relate to worsening conditions in the ASALs.
Though not described as such, because the terminology was not in common use at the
time, ALRMP II is very much a climate change adaptation project, and its successful
implementation has yielded a number of important lessons that need to guide future
efforts and outcomes that should be sustained.

62.      The initial design of some ALRMP II activities, in particular the CDD
component and M&E arrangements could have been improved, but actions taken during
implementation overcame several shortcomings. Annex 2 offers suggestions for further
strengthening indicators for related interventions in the future. The project had several
innovative features that have attracted attention, in particular the community-based,
multi-sectoral EWS that incorporates indicators relevant to pastoralist communities and
the inclusion of conflict resolution activities as an integral part of the natural resource
management component. Impact evaluation also involved application of new research
techniques to assess impact of droughts, normalized for severity, on children at different
nutritional levels. This approach has the potential for much broader application.

63.     The project design and implementation were relevant and appropriate for the
achievement of the PDO. Shortcomings in design and implementation did not
compromise the achievement of the PDO, as confirmed through assessment of the agreed
indicators at project close.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

64.    The project achieved the PDO in its three core elements, i.e., reduced
vulnerability of livelihoods, improved food security, and better access to basic services.


                                            19
Focusing on the direct impacts, the IL-ICR team considers that the PDO has been
achieved and that the results can be attributed to ALRMP II. The three project
components were well justified from the standpoint of causality (the contribution that
they were expected to make, individually and collectively, towards meeting the PDO is
plausible); the revised PDO indicators were appropriate to assess the PDO. It would have
been useful to capture the donor and interagency coordination aspects of ALRMP II
either as a sixth PDO indicator or as an Intermediate Output/Outcome Indicator, because
the lessons may be very important for other programs.

65.     Drought-related vulnerability of beneficiaries in the ASALs declined compared
with the population not assisted by the project. Drought management, natural resource
management and access to services in the ASALS improved through activities that
engaged affected communities at the local level and increased attention to ASAL
development issues at the national sphere. Reduced vulnerability was measured mainly
by changes in beneficiary households’ needs for free food aid (KPI 1). For those
households that still needed food aid, ALRMP II facilitated inter-agency coordination and
shortened the time interval before they received assistance (KPI 2), thereby reducing the
extent of negative welfare impacts, for example the nutritional status of children under 5
years (KPI 3).

66.     The PDO is clear and the project structure and revised results framework provided
a good basis for implementing, and assessing progress towards achieving the expected
outcomes. Table F summarizes the findings with regard to the main PDO and
intermediate outcome/output indicators. Further details are provided below and in Annex
2, including linkages between component activities and indicators. Findings are based on
an assessment of available quantitative and qualitative data, including extensive
consultations with partner organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), line
agencies and beneficiaries.

67.     Decreasing the proportion of people assessed as needing free food aid in each
arid and semi-arid district affected by severity of drought (KPI 1: Achieved). KPI
1 addresses the food security and livelihood vulnerability dimensions of the PDO. The
Kenya Food Security Group’s Long Rains Needs Assessments estimate a decrease in the
share of people needing food aid in the ASALs districts, from 51 percent in 2000/01 to 28
percent in 2008/09. However, there are some differences in geographic coverage of the
two years, drought severity is not normalized, and it is not possible to determine
attribution.

68.    To address this, two further analyses were done, by ILRI for the IE and by the IL-
ICR team, to assess the impact of ALRMP II on the share of people assessed as needing
food aid in the project area. ILRI and the IL-ICR team also sought qualitative feedback
from stakeholders.

          The IE analyzed data on changes in food aid needs and on the relationship
           with relevant ALRMP II expenditures in 10 randomly selected project districts
           for the period 2004/05 to 2008/09. It concluded that: (i) there was a decrease



                                           20
            in food aid needs in most districts, compared with the reference district; and
            (ii) ALRMP II cumulative expenditures were negatively correlated with the
            percentage of people needing food aid. The relationship was statistically
            significant in the arid districts (where all three project components had
            operated), but not in the semi-arid districts (where only Component 1
            operated).

           The IL-ICR team analyzed sub-district level data from the ALRMP II
            household-based EWS, satellite-based rainfall estimates and ALRMP II
            micro-project investment data for the 2005-09 periods. Treatment and control
            divisions (sub-district administrative units) were identified based on
            cumulative ALRMP II expenditures on water, livestock and agriculture (KES
            100 per capita cut-off). The analysis covered 51 treatment and 46 control
            divisions, approximately equally divided between arid (52) and semi-arid (45).
            To adjust for drought severity, a cumulative rainfall index was developed
            based on a three-year weighted average of rainfall.12 The results indicate that
            treatment divisions did much better than control divisions in terms of the
            percentage change in the proportion of people assessed as needing food aid,
            and that the difference (-19.7 percent) was statistically significant at 5 percent.
            Also, at the division level where the IL-ICR team focused its analysis, for the
            population considered part of the treatment group the average share of people
            needing food aid fell from 31.9 percent in 2005 to 30.2 percent in 2009; the
            weighted overall average for the ASALs fell from 27.2 percent to 23.2
            percent. The fact that the share originally needing food aid was higher in the
            treatment divisions suggests that ALRMP targeted the worst off areas in the
            ASALs.

           In terms of qualitative assessment, these trends and differences between
            project-assisted and control areas coincide with the perceptions expressed to
            the IL-ICR team by development partners, government line agencies, NGOs
            and beneficiaries during stakeholder consultations (Annex 6). The qualitative
            information gathered by ILRI in 21 focus groups also found a decrease in
            vulnerability to drought, particularly in the arid districts where all project
            components had operated.

69.    Taken together the above results indicate that ALRMP II was able to reduce food
aid needs in those areas in which it operated.

70.    Reducing the time lapse between reported drought stress and response (KPI
2: Achieved) KPI 2 captures the food security dimension of the PDO. Although some
studies (e.g., by Tufts University) have reported that overall response time for the
2000/2001 drought was six months (and some of this information was included in ISRs),


12
  This drought normalization methodology differs from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI) used by ILRI in the IE; it is based on specialist advice from NASA.



                                                 21
the ILRI-IE found that users of the ALRMP Bulletin had a mean response time of 7.6
weeks in 2000, decreasing to 3.5 weeks in the drought of 2009. The analysis is based on
a survey by ILRI of DSG members in 10 study districts to find mean response times for
users and non-users. The DSG comprises all relevant actors (international organizations,
line Ministries, NGOs, community-based organizations and donors, with ALRMP II
acting as secretariat) that influence or are directly involved with emergencies at district
level. The ALRMP II EWS Bulletin has become, by far, the most common information
source on droughts: Seventy-eight percent of all relevant organizations used the Bulletin
in 2009, up from 32 percent in 2000. In sum, controlling for other factors affecting
change in response time, ILRI found that the use of the ALRMP II Bulletin was
significantly and negatively associated with the change in response time over the project
period. The IL-ICR team estimates that if only the activities of the Drought Contingency
Fund are considered, the response time would be even lower at 2.5 weeks.

71.     In terms of qualitative feedback, in the three stakeholder workshops conducted by
the IL-ICR team, participants (communities, line agencies, partner organizations
operating at field level) uniformly reported that they felt the drought response time had
decreased compared with the pre-project situation, and attributed this to the EWS, the
project contingency fund and the role ALRMP II played in promoting coordinated action
by all parties in using the EWS information. They felt this had significantly improved
knowledge about impending drought developments and their ability to take mitigating
actions.

72.     Improved nutritional status of children under 5 years of age affected by
severity of drought over time (KPI 3: Achieved). KPI 3 covers the food security and
vulnerability dimensions of the PDO. The IE used MUAC as an indicator of child
nutrition status. A two period (2005 and 2009) panel was constructed, summarizing
MUAC measurements of 602,000 children in 10 districts. Stochastic dominance analysis
across the distribution of MUAC scores indicates improvements in nutritional status over
time. The analysis made it possible to capture changes at the lower percentiles rather
than only those at the mean or median. For the 10th percentile, 15 percent of intervention
sub-locations had a negative change in MUAC scores while 25 percent of the control sub-
locations experienced a negative change. Put differently, 85 percent of intervention sub-
locations did not have a negative change (stayed the same, or improved) versus only 75
percent of control sub-locations. The fact that MUAC levels in treatment sub-locations
were initially worse than in control areas suggests that ALRMP II targeted the worst off
sub-locations. The IE concluded that the ALRMP II project effectively functioned as a
nutritional safety net for children under 5 years of age.

73.     Increased number of people with access to basic services (water, human and
animal health services and education) (KPI-4: Achieved). KPI 4 addresses the access
to basic services elements of the PDO. The IE compared changes in access to services in
treatment and control locations. Treatment communities experienced statistically
significant improvements in access to quality water sources; primary, secondary and
adult education; and to veterinary medicines than at the start of ALRMP II. The
percentage of households consulting medical professionals, using bed nets, and seeking



                                            22
veterinary extension services also increased, and negative health-related outcomes
(prevalence of child diarrhea and livestock mortality) decreased significantly. Animal
deaths declined by a quarter and deaths from diseases by nearly half. Changes from
2004 to 2009 were significant within intervention sites for most services (ALRMP II had
a significant impact on access to services in the areas where it made investments),
however differences between treatment and control areas were not statistically significant,
suggesting that investments by others also took place in control areas. This may be a by-
product of the good inter-agency coordination through the DSG that stakeholders
emphasized during IL-ICR consultations in Nairobi and the field (Section 3.6). ALRMP
II advocacy on behalf of the ASALs also probably helped to improve service delivery in
both intervention and control communities.

74.    The IL-ICR team also paid particular attention to water issues. The IE found that
time to water had increased in the treatment and control locations. The IL-ICR team
found that between 2003-09, the mean household time to water fell from 85 minutes to
42.6 minutes in the rural North-Eastern province, while the national average did not
change significantly (IL-ICR calculations based on Demographic Health Survey (DHS)
2003 and 2008/09). On distance to water, the EWS shows that between 2005-10 mean
distances decreased across the project area: (i) to boreholes, from 6.4 to 4.3 km; (ii) to
shallow wells, from 5.2 to 2.9 km; and (iii) to pans and dams, from 3.8 to 3.0 km.
Although it was not possible to determine attribution, ALRMP II did make a significant
number of water investments between 2004 and 2008.

75.      Increase people’s participation in the project districts in local and national
development as demonstrated by the reflection of arid lands concerns in the
economic recovery strategy and other relevant national policies (KPI-5: Partially
Achieved). KPI 5 addresses the vulnerability dimensions of the PDO.
Participation/community empowerment: using social network measures, the ILRI IE
found measurable improvements in empowerment, with general increases greater in arid
compared to semi-arid districts (possibly because arid districts had been part of both
ALRMP and ALRMP II, and the CDD component did not operate in the semi-arid
districts). Influence on national policies: ALRMP II also had a significant impact on
formulation of relevant national policies, both through advocacy activities and as a source
of reliable data and advisory support. The project was involved in the formulation of nine
(9) draft policies of direct relevance to the ASALs. The Economic Recovery Strategy for
Wealth and Employment Creation (Kenya’s PRSP, 2004) includes a full chapter
influenced by the ALRMP II PCU and project beneficiary communities at the national
and local levels. Among other policies and sessional papers to which ALRMP II provided
important inputs are the National Policy for Sustainable Development of Arid and
Semiarid Lands of Kenya, National Land Policy, National Disaster Policy, Policy
Framework for Nomadic Education in Kenya, National Policy on Land Reclamation,
National Policy on Peace Building and Conflict Management, National Food Security
and Nutrition Policy, National Livestock Policy, and National Irrigation and Drainage
Policy. However, some of these policies were still in draft (had not yet been formally
adopted) at the time of the IL-ICR team’s visit. Kenya’s Vision 2030 (successor to the
Economic Recovery Strategy) also reflects an emphasis on the ASALs. ALRMP II



                                            23
advocacy also led to the creation of a new Ministry of State for the Development of
Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands (April 2008), and more recently to the
establishment of a National Drought Management Authority (November 2011). Finally,
the experience and knowledge generated by ALRMP II contributed to the formulation of
Kenya’s official thinking on climate change adaptation.

76.    As described above, 4 KPIs have been fully achieved and 1 KPI partially. Each
KPI addresses at least one of the three dimensions of the PDO, i.e., reduced vulnerability,
improved food security, and better access to basic services. Thirteen out of 16
Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs) have been achieved. Annex 2 describes in details
how the IOIs and KPIs are linked to the achievements of the three different components.
While these achievements would usually justify a satisfactory rating for efficacy, a
conservative approach is taken and the rating is downgraded to moderately satisfactory,
mainly since uncertainties remain with respect to the extent of possible fiduciary issues.

3.3    Efficiency

77.     Micro-project investments. The PAD did not provide an ex-ante overall Net
Present Value of Economic Rate of Return for ALRMP II, on the grounds that the micro-
projects and similar small investments under the three components have heterogeneous
impacts that do not lend themselves to such analysis. Instead, the PAD assessed the
viability of several individual activities (irrigation, rain-fed agriculture, petty trade,
livestock trade and bee keeping) and found them all to be financially viable.

78.     Since the ALRMP II results framework as revised in the AF amendment does not
include indicators on returns to micro-project investments, the ILRI-IE did not cover this
subject. The IL-ICR team therefore conducted a Cost-Benefit Analysis, which quantifies
the benefits that result from two sets of mechanisms that can be attributed to the project.
First, the project financed various types of micro-project investments. Secondly, the
project invested resources in the water and livestock sectors (e.g., livestock restocking,
veterinary services and improved access to animal water sources). These investments
resulted in (counterfactual) gains in (indigenous) livestock wealth. With respect to the
micro-projects, four were randomly selected that were representative of the most
common types of project investments (see Annex 3). The micro-projects were selected
from a comprehensive roster of geo-referenced project investments, and the analysis was
carried out during field visits in connection with the stakeholder workshops. They include
investments in sand dams, irrigation, goat dairy breeding and fishponds. In the aggregate,
these activities account for 65.5 percent of the total number of micro-projects supported
by ALRMP II and 43.4 percent of the total value of investment in all micro-projects. The
benefit-cost ratios ranged from 1.1 to 2.1, and the ERRs from 24 percent to 78.5 percent.
Weighting these returns in proportion to overall project expenditures yields an overall
ERR on micro-project investments of 37 percent. In addition, the IL-ICR team calculated
decreases in livestock after each of three previous droughts and estimated counterfactual
changes in livestock without project interventions. The gains from investments in the
water and livestock sectors can, in part, be quantified by the (counterfactual) increases in
livestock wealth and these gains were estimated to be consistent with an ERR of 28.2
percent (see Annex 3 for details). Further, because of the still open issue of questionable


                                            24
expenditures from INT’s findings, sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact
of potential misuse of funds on the project’s economic viability. Assuming no funds were
misused results in an ERR of 40.4 percent. Under an assumption that 20 percent of funds
were misused, the project would yield an ERR of 31.1 percent. Misuse at the level of 50
percent (considerably above INT’s finding of 29 percent questionable expenditures and
no confirmed misuse) would result in an ERR of 15.9 percent. These results lead to the
conclusion that under a range of assumptions about the extent of possible diversion of
funds from 0 percent to 50 percent the project was economically viable and the costs
incurred were justified.

79.     Cost-effectiveness and efficacy. Regarding cost effectiveness relative to normal
GoK investments for similar activities (e.g., schools, health dispensaries), ALRMP II did
not capture comparative data. However, the IL-ICR team does not anticipate that there
would be major differences because line agencies were so heavily engaged through the
DSGs and METs that standards probably did not differ greatly (the 30 percent
community contribution under the CDD component would have made those micro-
projects less expensive for the government, but this would not alter overall cost-
effectiveness, taking into account all sources of finance). Regarding efficacy, the fact that
the micro-projects resulted from a consultative planning process in which beneficiary
communities and the range of DSG technical members were able to participate suggests
that they responded to perceived needs from the standpoint of these various actors. In
2010, the firm Batch Associates Ltd. conducted a technical audit of ALRMP II
community-level infrastructure investments covering 27 randomly selected micro-
projects in 4 districts (out of a total universe of 2400 microprojects). The audit found 82
percent of communities ‘very satisfied’ and 11 percent ‘satisfied’ with the micro-projects;
7 percent (2 communities) had issues. The same review rated the technical quality of
construction for most micro-projects visited where this was relevant (in a few cases, such
as purchase of pumps, construction quality was not relevant). The study team assessed
construction quality as ‘satisfactory’ for 87.5 percent of micro-projects; 12.5 percent (3
micro-projects) had issues. They also noted that for a number of micro-projects,
operations and maintenance (O&M) arrangements were not clear or needed improvement.
Rigorous data comparing costs of micro-projects under the ALRMP II and which similar
micro-projects financed by other donors or NGOs were not available to the ICR team.

80.    Other efficiency considerations: The IL-ICR team noted that the PCU structure
(Nairobi and field) is lean, with no obvious excess staffing (indeed, perhaps too thin in a
few areas; see Section 5.2(b)).

81.    Finally, the team was unable to judge the cost-effectiveness of the ALRMP II
EWS vis-à-vis those of other countries, because each is quite different in terms of needs,
coverage, technological features, and other factors. However, to the extent that this
information is being widely used (the IE found that 78 percent of survey respondents use
the EWS Bulletin as their primary source of early warning data on droughts, up from 32
percent at the start of ALRMP II), and that ALRMP II institutional arrangements appear
to have greatly increased inter-agency cooperation and specialization of function, the




                                            25
project has very likely contributed to greater efficiency in the delivery of relief activities,
investments and services, by a wide array of actors.

82.     Overall, the efficiency is rated moderately satisfactory. In general, the analyses
conducted indicate high efficiency of project investments and would justify a satisfactory
rating. However, due to FM issues identified, remaining uncertainties of the INT forensic
audit, and some limitations with respect to the ERR calculations and data availability, the
ICR team rates the efficiency conservatively as moderately satisfactory.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.     ALRMP II has fully achieved 4 of the 5 PDO outcome indicators and partially
achieved the fifth indicator. It also achieved 13 of 16 intermediate outcome indicators,
and partially achieved two. In light of the rating of satisfactory or substantial for
relevance, moderately satisfactory for efficacy, moderately satisfactory for efficiency,
and the remaining uncertainties with respect to the fiduciary issues, the overall outcome
is rated moderately satisfactory.

84.     ALRMP II is also a good practice example of real cooperation amongst all actors
– international partners, NGOs, government officials from different line ministries,
especially at district level. The high degree of coordination complicated comparisons
between treatment and control areas for some indicators. The IL-ICR has taken a fairly
conservative approach to direct project outcomes, confining the analysis to those that
could be linked to relevant ALRMP II investments. However, the project’s advocacy,
policy and donor coordination activities at the national level also benefited control areas,
by drawing greater GoK and development partner attention and resources to the ASALs.
Because of the very successful inter-agency coordination, other actors report having
prioritized control areas due to the presence of ALRMP II in treatment areas. The IL-ICR
does not consider these indirect impacts and, in that regard may well understate the full
benefits of ALRMP II.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Conflict Resolution, Gender, Inclusion and Empowerment

85.      Project design drew on both the Social Assessment done as part of preparation for
ALRMP II, and on the Beneficiary Assessment that had just been completed to assess the
impact of the first phase of ALRMP. The project placed strong emphasis on community
participation, conflict resolution, inclusion of marginalized groups, gender mainstreaming,
and enhancing the voice of pastoralists and poor farm households from the ASALs at
district and national levels.

86.     Evaluations and focus group discussions facilitated by the project, IDA, the IL-
ICR team and external evaluators repeatedly document community and donor perceptions
that ALRMP II made substantial progress in empowering communities, putting in place
conflict resolution mechanisms that worked, enhancing awareness of inequalities and
opportunities for women and marginalized groups to participate in development activities.


                                              26
At the same time, social development objectives articulated in project documents were
not as fully implemented or consistently supervised as initially planned, and weaknesses
in monitoring indicators make it difficult to rigorously determine some of these outcomes.

87.      Conflict resolution. The Beneficiary Assessment for the first phase of ALRMP
noted that although not part of the original work plan, conflict resolution had been so
important on the ground in the arid districts (e.g., unresolved land tenure issues among
neighboring pastoralist communities and between pastoralist and farming groups; the
general state of insecurity and influx of small arms from neighboring countries) that it
had become a de facto fourth project component.13 The design of ALRMP II therefore
highlighted the linkages between conflicts and natural resource management, and built on
a combination of customary and formal institutions. Peace building and conflict
management was one of six activities funded under the Component 1 of the project,
which included a wide variety of NRM training activities and investments that responded
well to local priorities and need. Conflict management was also mainstreamed into the
CDD manual, which includes multiple exercises devoted to identifying past, current and
potential sources of conflict, and to developing conflict-sensitive, and cross-ethnic/clan
activities in the participatory integrated community development (PICD) process.

88.      Drawing on lessons from the ALRMP II mid-term review, the project increased
the emphasis mechanisms that would be proactive in identifying sources of conflict and
conflict resolution strategies, rather than simply reacting to conflicts that had already
broken out. The results framework in the PAD had as an output indicator that “conflict
management mechanisms for NRM established at potential flashpoints?. The revised
results framework adopted in connection with the AF in 2006 strengthened the indicator:
“Key potential conflict flashpoints identified in each district and conflict management
initiatives strengthened.? Following the post-election violence in 2008, the PCU hired a
conflict officer who focused on capacity building and on establishing and empowering
District Peace Committees (DPCs). The DPCs sought to link traditional and formal
mechanisms for conflict prevention, resolution and management by bringing together
stakeholders who work on peace and security issues in their districts. Unlike traditional
conflict management that typically targets higher-level authorities, ALRMP II focused
assistance on local level conflict management, including using the CDC to provide a link
between local community leaders and district level authorities.

89.     At project closure, an assessment of potential conflict flashpoints had been carried
out for all 28 districts, and DPCs had been established in many locations in the ASALs.
The Borrower’s ICR states that 423 conflict management activities had been carried out
at normal/alert and drought situations. The IL-ICR team received consistently positive


13
   “ALRMP upon realizing that development could not proceed until some of the local emergency
problems were resolved, undertook the lead in conflict resolution and assisting victims with emergency
measures these issues became an important entry point for ALRMP, meeting with unprecedented success.
The credible manner in which ALRMP handled these emergency situations and the transparent response
determined the future relationship between ALRMP and the communities.? ADCL, 2002.

feedback from donors, beneficiaries and other stakeholders on the effectiveness of
ALRMP II’s conflict resolution efforts. The mission does not infer from this that there
has been a net decrease in the level of tension and violence in the ASALs, because there
is not sufficient long-term data to make such an assessment. However, it is comfortable
in concluding that ALRMP II has had a significant impact on addressing the incidence of
natural resource-related conflict in the project area.

90.    Gender mainstreaming and inclusion. The project also successfully strengthened
its emphasis on gender mainstreaming. The Borrower’s ICR, other evaluations and
feedback from beneficiaries and stakeholders note a substantial positive impact on
women and girls in the arid and semi-arid districts where ALRMP II operates. Increased
access to water, education, and health care is credited with having benefited girls and
women disproportionately, as they are traditionally disadvantaged in access to these
services, and bear the burden of providing water for the family. The participatory
methodology for the development of community priorities for the CDD component
mandated women’s participation, as did the formation of CDCs. Gender focal points
comprising eight members were created in every district to ensure that gender issues and
needs were incorporated in all development projects at the district level. Unfortunately,
the revised project results framework did not include gender indicators, however the
Borrower’s ICR reports that in most districts over 40 percent of the CDC members are
women (i.e., exceeding the one-third requirement) and almost the same number are
members of the procurement sub-committee, and women accounted for slightly more
than half (52 percent) of all CDD trainees. During the IL-ICR team visits to field sites
and in stakeholder workshops, it was noticeable that women were active participants in
the meetings, were part of the CDCs, and themselves pointed out that in the past they
would have not thought of standing up and talking in such meetings in the presence of
male community members. Development partners reported similar findings to the team.

91.    ALRMP II was also actively involved (through the Support to Local Development
component) in policy formulation and advocacy work, and it used this platform to
promote the incorporation of gender concerns into a range of relevant policy papers (e.g.,
draft National Land Policy, draft Peace Building and Conflict Policy, and draft Disaster
Management Policy).

92.      Inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups and people. The Borrower’s
ICR notes that all districts provided some evidence of communities making special
provisions for the neediest groups in society, and describes specific examples of these
initiatives. The PICD process placed special attention on integrating women and
marginalized groups into the planning process in ALRMP II. Communities used a
wealth-ranking tool to identify the neediest people amongst themselves. The ICR also
notes that strategies to integrate the needs of marginalized groups varied from one
community to another, e.g., in some cases, efforts were made to incorporate
representatives of marginalized groups into existing CDC structures while in others,
attempts were made to establish separate CDCs where the marginalized were in the
majority. Safety net micro-projects were aimed at vulnerable people and the Borrower’s
ICR documents multiple investments aimed at supporting the most vulnerable, primarily



                                           28
through restocking, shelter improvement, and support to income generation activities for
vulnerable groups. These interventions are credited with giving vulnerable groups greater
voice, priority in restocking programs and, for some, enhancing livelihoods, nutritional
status, and enabling education of children. Unfortunately, the lack of relevant monitoring
indicators and reporting during supervision limits the degree to which these impacts can
be quantified.

93.     Empowerment. Although the theme of increasing voice and empowerment of the
ASAL population was central to ALRMP II, the results framework did not have specific
indicators to monitor change over time. Nonetheless, the ILRI Impact Evaluation
employed social network analysis techniques to measure changes in community
empowerment in two ways. The first was the extent to which communities sought
services from providers rather than simply waiting for the services to be received. The
second was a measure of ‘node betweenness centrality’, which indicates the extent to
which an actor (in this case the ALRMP II) is an intermediary between other pairs of
actors in the network who are not directly linked. On the first measure, the IE found an
increase of 54.2 percent across all sites between 2004 and 2009. On the second measure,
the community betweenness centrality value increased from 50 before the project to 160
afterwards, which indicates that ALRMP II has played an important linking function. In
both cases, changes were greater in arid versus semi-arid communities, possibly having to
do with the fact that all project components operated in the arid districts, whereas only
Component 1 operated in the semi-arid communities (and some only after the AF). In a
survey conducted by ILRI for the IE, DSG members were asked to identify the most
significant changes that they had observed at community level as a result of ALRMP II
community development and policy advocacy activities: 35 of 40 respondents cited
empowerment as the most significant impact of community development, and 12 of 18
respondents cited it as the most significant change resulting from policy advocacy. The
IL-ICR team received similar feedback in its consultations with stakeholders and
beneficiaries.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

94.     ALRMP II had a positive direct impact on the well-being of beneficiaries due
largely to the effectiveness of the institutional arrangements that it put in place, or
strengthened. These arrangements also helped other actors to be more effective in the
delivery of their drought management and vulnerability reduction efforts in the ASALs.

95.    The EWS and its relationship with the Kenya Food Security Meeting (KFSM) and
KFSSG, the DSGs and Drought Contingency Fund were in place at the close of the first
phase project, but were strengthened considerably and their geographic coverage was
extended from 11 to 28 districts under ALRMP II. DPCs were created for the first time
under ALRMP II.

          Regarding the Drought Early Warning System, reliance of all parties
           (including participants in the KFSM and KFSSG and others active in the
           ASALs) increased significantly during implementation of ALRMP II (Section



                                           29
           3.2 (iii)). Technical improvements under ALRMP II included the following:
           (i) while collection had been ongoing since the first phase, poor data storage
           protocols and unclear data collection methodology had resulted in the waste
           and, in some cases, loss of data. Under ALRMP II, the survey instruments
           were streamlined, focusing the questionnaire on the most pertinent questions
           and re-designing it to be equally relevant to the semi-arid districts that became
           part of the project at the start of ALRMP II (and the others that joined after the
           AF); (ii) new data storage and analysis software (REWAS III) was adopted;
           (iii) this in turn enabled more systematic analysis and inclusion of a broader
           set of non-food indicators that offer a more holistic view of the situation on
           the ground; (iv) the data are now stored electronically and updated monthly as
           information comes in from each site; and (v) EWS bulletins are disseminated
           immediately on the project and KFSSG websites.

          New District Steering Groups were created for the17 semi-arid Districts that
           came into ALRMP II, and considerable capacity building investments were
           made to upgrade planning and investment screening capabilities. In every
           single individual and focus group meeting that the IL-ICR team held,
           participants (other donors, GoK officials at Nairobi and field level, key NGOs
           active in the ASALs) pointed to the DSGs as having enabled them to be more
           effective. The DSGs are well regarded because of their inclusiveness,
           efficiency in ensuring good coordination among participants, transparency and
           knowledge sharing, and technical skills. The plans developed by the DSGs
           are used as reference points for all actors and have reportedly helped to avoid
           wastage and duplication of efforts (not to mention reducing the burden on
           communities of having to explain their priorities to multiple parties).

          Procedures and operational guidelines for the Drought Contingency Fund
           were strengthened under ALRMP II, and the EU also began channeling part of
           its Disaster Management Initiative financing through the Fund.

          District Peace Committees. Although the first phase project had undertaken
           many conflict resolution activities, there was no structured arrangement for
           handling these and most interventions were reactive. ALRMP II created
           District Peace Committees in most ASAL districts, and initiated proactive
           work to pre-identify conflict flash points with a view to mitigating risks rather
           than only responding to conflicts that had already broken out.

96.     The areas where ALRMP II was less successful included: (i) legal formalization
of the DSG, Contingency Fund and DPC structures (the first two were legal covenants
under the Credit Agreement that had not been fulfilled by project completion); and (ii)
establishment of NDMA before project completion (although this has since taken place in
November 2011). Delays appear to be largely the result of ministerial reorganization (the
shift of the PCU from a Ministry in the Office of the President to a newly created
Ministry coordinated by the Prime Minister), on the one hand, and the constitutional
reform process on the other, rather than lack of GoK commitment to the objectives.


                                            30
Formalizing district-based institutions in particular would have been difficult since
constitutional reforms were moving towards replacement of districts by counties. The
constitution was ratified in August 2010, and details on county arrangements are still
being worked out. Meanwhile the IL-ICR team observed that the DSGs and DPCs are
still functioning actively.

97.     Failure to institutionalize the Drought Contingency Fund was very unfortunate
because it meant that donors, who would otherwise have been willing to add resources
during the 2010 drought year, could not do so because IDA had informally suspended the
project and the DCF did not have a legal identity apart from the project. However, the
Borrower has advised in its comments on the draft IL-ICR that since the contingency
fund is expected to be one of the main operational instruments of the recently established
NDMA, it anticipates Cabinet approval in the near future. Finally, as GoK is considering
further changes in central government structures, including streamlining of ministries, it
will be important to ensure that (i) units dealing with food aid assessments and delivery,
currently in separate ministries reporting to the Offices of the President and Prime
Minister, are brought together, as was the case when ALRMP II was designed; and (ii)
existing and proposed institutions for drought management, disaster management and
climate change adaptation are clearly delineated so that the resulting arrangements are
synergistic and avoid overlapping mandates and fragmentation of effort.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

98.     Early Warning System Model. Kenya’s EWS has attracted attention and is
helping to inform thinking on early warning systems in other countries. In recent years,
ALRMP II has been visited by, inter alia, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Syria, and is
presently helping Uganda to establish a drought EWS in the Karamoja region. Features
of the ALRMP II EWS that have been of particular interest include: (i) the incorporation
of data and indicators relevant to pastoralist communities; (ii) its community-based
nature with communities providing real-time information that can be acted on; (iii) its
multi-sectoral nature, since the EWS looks at a broad set of inter-related food security
indicators, rather than narrowly at, for example, precipitation or vegetation (coverage
includes water, agriculture, livestock, changes in household nutrition and other coping
strategies); and (iv) the EWS has a clear link to decision-making so that actions needed at
each drought stage can be taken to prevent further deterioration.

99.      Kenya’s Dialogue and Positioning on Climate Change Adaptation. Both the first
phase project and ALRMP II have generated considerable knowledge about the impact of
accelerating drought conditions on pastoralist and small farmer communities in the
ASALs, including their coping strategies, resilience, willingness and capacity to adapt to
climate change. This is quite important, considering that the ASALs include some 75
percent of Kenya’s total land area. Because ALRMP II focused not only on development
work on the ground, but also on improving the policy and legal environment at national
level, it has had an impact on understanding and policy formulation in a number of areas
(Section 3.2(v)). In the aftermath of the 2006 Stern report on the Economics of Climate
Change and the 2007 Fourth Report of the IPCC, the international community has



                                            31
stepped up attention to adaptive needs of developing countries. ALRMP II made very
useful contributions to GoK’s understanding, global dialogue and strategic positioning on
the issues. Preparation of the KACCAL GEF project (Sections 2.2 and 4) by the ALRMP
II team was also useful, and its implementation would contribute to the knowledge base
on climate change adaptation in the ASALs.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

100. The IL-ICR team conducted two separate rounds of stakeholder consultations to
obtain feedback and validate the team’s preliminary findings. The first round involved a
wide range of development partners at the national level: (i) UN agencies (WFP, UNDP,
UNICEF, FAO, OCHA); (ii) bi-lateral donors and NGOs (EU, ECHO, DANIDA,
USAID/FEWSNET, OXFAM); and (iii) officials, and authorities in the Ministry for the
Development of Northern Kenya & Other Arid Lands, and the Ministry of State for
Special Programs (Office of the President). The second round involved stakeholder
workshops in the field in three project districts with 148 participants, of which slightly
more than half were from beneficiary communities, and the balance from local and
international agencies working with food aid and drought issues, local officials and
line/sector agencies, and local ALRMP II officials. The team also met with the
beneficiaries of several randomly selected micro-projects on site in their communities.
The key feedback obtained is summarized below and detailed in Annex 6.

        (i)    UN agencies, international donors and NGOs - Nairobi. There was
               unanimity on the relevance of ALRMP II, and the high level of confidence
               in the project EWS and institutional set-up. Before the creation of DSGs,
               each agency had conducted drought management activities in an
               uncoordinated manner, often with duplication. Instead, the DSGs have
               provided a forum for joint discussion of local needs and harmonized and
               coordinated action on the ground. The Drought Contingency Fund has
               facilitated quicker response to emergencies. The project was considered a
               best practice case that should be replicated. The main concerns related to:
               (i) IDA’s suspension of disbursements in the midst of a serious drought,
               which also affected the work of others; (ii) uncertainty about a possible
               follow-up project to consolidate and ensure sustainability of ALRMP II
               gains; and (iii) the need to create a National Drought Management
               Authority14 and to institutionalize National Drought Contingency Fund.

        (ii)   ALRMP II Staff and Management – Nairobi and Field. There was a high
               level of frustration among project staff and Ministry officials about the
               protracted forensic audit, IDA’s suspension of disbursements in the midst of
               a severe drought, and its abrupt halting of work on a new project without
               ever formally communicating this to counterparts. These factors have

   NDMA was subsequently established after the IL-ICR mission and Stakeholder Workshops. See Section
3.5 above, on Institutional Change and Strengthening.



                                                32
            negatively affected GoK’s ability to deal with the 2010/11 drought. GoK
            has maintained key structures and staff, but activities are more limited, and
            this is affecting people and livestock.

       (iii) Communities and Other Civil Society Organizations - Field. There was
             consistent feedback that project structures (especially the DSGs) were
             beneficial, performed proactively in response to drought emergencies, and
             provided access to other organizations for assistance and investments that
             had previously been lacking. There was better focus and transparency in
             food aid. Training, capacity building and project investments have improved
             access to services, incomes, resilience and drought preparedness. Impacts on
             empowerment (and participation of women) and conflict resolution have
             been very important. Concerns included: (i) the increasing frequency of
             droughts; (ii) inadequate resources during the 2010/11 drought; (iii) the need
             for IDA to continue its support; and (iv) the need for additional focus on
             IGA activities, health, education and women’s groups.

       (iv) Line/sector Agencies and Partner Organizations - Field. These agencies
            echoed views on the importance of ALRMP II institutional structures. By
            including all key ministries, NGOs and international agencies, the DSGs
            have improved coordination and access to communities, with clearer
            identification of investment priorities. Capacity building; investments in
            water, agriculture (better farming practices), livestock; women’s
            empowerment; the Drought Contingency Fund and rapid response to
            emergencies were the most commonly cited interventions of importance.
            Creation of DPCs and cross border peace committees, training and
            facilitated meetings among communities had reduced conflicts over access
            to water and pastures. Concerns included: (i) limited resources; (ii) the need
            to sustain project institutional arrangements; (iii) deploy more line agency
            staff to supervise projects on the ground; and (iv) expand training to ensure
            maintenance and sustainability of micro-projects.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome: Moderate

101. The IL-ICR team considered risks to sustainability of ALRMP II achievements in
three categories: (i) the EWS, institutional arrangements and inter-agency cooperation;
(ii) reduction in vulnerability to drought in the ASALs; and (iii) empowerment and other
social development gains. The severe drought of 2011/12 demonstrated the importance
of the agenda supported by the project, and the institutions and activities established
continued without IDA financing, albeit at lower levels of funding. The institutions
established and supported under the project performed well for the resident population,
although they were not sufficient to handle the influx of refugees from across the Somali
border. IDA and other development partners remain engaged in the arid and semi-arid
areas and have pledged to increase their commitment to the challenges that pastoral
communities face, including the transboundary ones. The Regional Pastoral Livelihoods
Recovery and Resilience Project and the Kenya Drought Recovery Project will receive


                                           33
IDA resources. The Hunger Safety Net Program, supported by Department for
International Development (DfID) and IDA, is exploring ways to channel resources for
cash transfer through the NDCF. The EU and IDA have agreed to disburse EU resources
through active Bank projects for the NDCF. Finally, KACCAL, originally designed as a
companion to the ALRMP II project, will be restructured to link to the Kenya Agriculture
Productivity and Agribusiness Project. Although the modalities will change with the end
of support through ALRMP II and the changes effected under the new constitution, the
commitment of support by the GOK and development partners remains high. The risk to
sustainability is thus rated moderate.

102. EWS, institutional arrangements and inter-agency cooperation.                  Kenya’s
community-based EWS, with its unique adaptation to the needs of pastoralist
communities, is likely to continue. Despite the fact that ALRMP II had closed in
December 2010, the IL-ICR team observed that the EWS system of data collection and
preparation of the regular monthly bulletins was still taking place and playing a critically
useful role in supporting the response by the KFSSG and partners to the severe drought in
2010/11. Systems depend on people, in this case the dedicated ALRMP staff at national
and district levels who have gained experience in applying the 10,000 or so monthly
household questionnaires, and on the confidence of communities who provide the
information. The GoK retained staff during 2011, although there were several months
with no salary payments. Similarly, the IL-ICR observed continuing close inter-agency
cooperation during the 2010/11 drought, the result of several years of ‘practice’ during
ALRMP II implementation. The GoK is still in the process of mainstreaming some
critical institutional features (the Drought Contingency Fund, and others may require
modification to accommodate the new constitution. The lack of resolution of questions
raised during the forensic audit has had reputational implications for the personnel and
institutions involved in implementation of ALRMP II, and initially raised questions about
sustainability. With better understanding of the limitations of the INT findings, however,
and desire of the GoK to internalize design features to reduce identified risks, the risks to
sustainability that appeared high at the project’s closing subsequently attenuated.

103. Reduction in livelihoods vulnerability to droughts in the ASALs. Achievements in
vulnerability reduction have been impressive, considering the frequency, intensity and
duration of droughts in the ASALs since the start of ALRMP II. The share of people
needing food aid in the arid districts, where the full set of project components has been
operating, has been reduced and the change is statistically significant. Although gains are
also noted in the semi-arid districts, where only one component has operated (and, for six
districts, only since late 2006/early 2007), statistical significance could not be detected
yet. But these gains are tenuous and will require continued, scaled up investment support
to ensure their sustainability. A number of the CDD micro-projects also require
immediate attention to define O&M responsibilities and funding. Similarly, while some
income generating activity (IGA) micro-projects are sufficiently profitable to self-finance
future operating costs and investment needs, others will likely be constrained by the
continuing lack of micro-finance services in the ASALs. Finally, as climate change and
climate variability processes make life increasingly difficult for inhabitants of Kenya’s
ASALs and similar areas in neighboring countries, there is potential for increasing



                                             34
conflict related to natural resource scarcity. ALRMP II has been effective in averting and
resolving a number of conflicts by bringing together key actors at the local level and
serving as a bridge to other GoK structures. As mentioned above, the DPCs need to be
institutionalized, and their activities scaled up, in order to address proactively conflict
risks on the scale likely to develop. Design work on all four fronts (scaled up
investments, O&M, financial services, and conflict resolution) has been undertaken and is
available for incorporation into new operations financed by IDA and/or other partners.

104. Empowerment and other social development gains. Some ALRMP II
achievements noted in the ILRI-IE’s social networking analysis, and reported in
numerous documents and during the IL-ICR team’s own consultations, are likely to be
enduring. Women who are now standing up to speak in local meetings, especially those
whose own income opportunities have been improved through micro-project investments,
are not likely to sit down again. Communities that have developed the confidence and
skills to seek out service providers rather than wait to be attended, if at all, will not lose
these capacities. However, as in the case of vulnerability reduction to droughts, the gains
are measurably stronger in the arid districts that have benefited from all three project
components, although they do not yet reach all areas in these districts. The semi-arid
communities are newer to the program, in some cases with only 2-3 years of experience.
Sustaining and building on achievements to date will require not only scaled up
implementation of ALRMP II’s participatory investment activities, but – equally
important -- a continuing strong voice at the national policy-making level on behalf of the
ASALs, supported by a sound knowledge base drawn from real-time work on the ground
and informed by active local participation, increasingly robust data and good analytical
capacity.


5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Moderately Satisfactory

105. IDA’s performance at design stage had many strong aspects: (i) the objectives
had high strategic relevance for Kenya; (ii) a good effort was made to learn from the
experience of the first phase project (a Beneficiary Assessment and the ICR were
prepared in time to feed into the process) and from experience in the Africa Region on
CDD issues; (iii) the range of skills that the design team mobilized (from IDA and FAO,
and other consultants) was impressive overall; (iv) the peer reviewers were suitable; and
(v) technical, safeguards and fiduciary aspects were well prepared. Country and Sector
Management paid adequate attention, bearing in mind that all concerned considered that
ALRMP II was building on a successful first phase operation, and therefore the task at
hand was more one of refining particular features of the program, than of starting anew.




                                             35
106. Preparation time and costs were reasonable, although the extensive FAO inputs
were not captured in SAP and therefore figures in the system under-state the intensity of
effort that went into the preparation and appraisal process.

107. The shortcomings of project design were: (i) the weaknesses in the original
project results framework (the PDO made sense, but some PDO indicators would be
difficult to measure or duplicative; 25 Intermediate Outcome Indicators were excessive;
and it is perplexing why no preliminary baseline estimates were included given the
knowledge the team had after implementing the first phase project); (ii) the missed
opportunity to draw on relevant best practice CDD experience from outside the Africa
Region which could have strengthened that component, in particular social accountability
arrangements; (iii) the underestimated risk of accountability of local expenditures; and
(iv) the poorly prepared financial services sub-component.

(b)    Quality of Supervision: Moderately Unsatisfactory

108. In assessing Quality of Supervision by IDA, the IL-ICR team took into account
not only performance by the task team, but also IDA management, and other parts of the
Bank Group that had an impact on IDA’s overall oversight of ALRMP II.

109. Supervision by the task team was satisfactory in many respects. (i) The skill
range of the team was quite strong, considering not only the core members, but also IDA
consultants and FAO staff; (ii) There was a good mix of Headquarters and Country
Office-based staff, and considerable continuity of team members; (iii) Supervision
missions took place regularly at roughly six-month intervals. ISRs and aide memoires
were timely and informative; (iv) Environmental audits and fiduciary post-reviews took
place on schedule and were followed up; (v) FM supervision identified weaknesses in the
project FM arrangements and lowered the FM rating to Moderately Satisfactory in 2007
and 2008. FM also leveraged the Borrower’s country system by partnering with the
Internal Audit Department (IAD) to undertake a risk-based portfolio review in January-
March 2009, which included physical verification of outputs of ALRMP II on a sample
basis. Internal control weaknesses were identified by this joint World Bank-IAD review,
as a result of which the project was selected for further in-depth review. Due to the
subsequent start of the INT forensic audit, however, this particular in-depth review was
not pursued; (vi) The baseline survey was completed within one year of project approval,
and the mid-term review took place almost to the day it had been scheduled in the PAD;
(vii) A thorough Impact Evaluation was commissioned sufficiently well in advance of
closing to permit a good quality product with lessons that could feed into a follow-up
operation; (viii) Working relations with other donors and NGOs active in the ASALs
were excellent; (ix) The team worked hard to strengthen M&E arrangements and used the
occasion of the AF amendment to introduce a somewhat stronger set of KPIs; (x) Country
and Sector management commented on most ISRs; and (xi) Most DO and IP ratings
seemed appropriate to the IL-ICR team, considering the knowledge the task team and
management had at the time.




                                           36
110. There were also weaknesses. (i) ALRMP II included a very important set of
activities aimed at improving the national policy and legislative framework relevant to
the ASALs, but this work did not appear to receive much support through other
instruments in IDA’s country program (e.g., country economic work, other ESW, policy-
based lending). Although IDA did not extend policy-based lending to Kenya during the
early years of the project, there were plans for an adjustment credit in support of the ERS,
which was dropped, but a review of project files indicates that it would not have reflected
any of the ASAL-related policy agenda; (ii) The task team and IDA management should
have pressed more strongly for formalization of ALRMP II’s institutional features, in
particular the Drought Management Authority (which was not formally established until
November 2011, almost a year after the project closed), Drought Contingency Fund,
DSGs and DPCs. The IL-ICR team understands that this might not have been successful
given the turmoil surrounding the 2007 elections and the constitutional reform process,
but the record does not establish that these issues received the attention that they
required; (iii) The team should have provided closer supervision of the CDD component,
in particular social accountability aspects; (iv) The team and management appear to have
under-estimated the supervision challenges of extending ALRMP II into the semi-arid
districts, nearly doubling the geographic coverage of the project area and, a few years
later, also doubling the volume of financing and further expanding the project area (to
some 75 percent of Kenya’s total land area). Instead of largely continuing the
supervision arrangements that had worked for the first phase project, the team should
have built into the design of ALRMP II provision for contracting regular technical field
audits to support their own and the PCU’s oversight responsibilities; and (v) While the
Bank Team identified some weaknesses in project FM arrangements in 2007, 2008, and
2009, the team should have identified these weaknesses earlier, particularly with respect
to internal control systems and record keeping, and should have followed-up more
systematically. No conclusions can be drawn as to whether these shortcomings materially
affected the efficiency of the Bank’s operation or its ability to deliver results for
beneficiaries. As discussed below in more detail, it is also not clear whether these
weaknesses allowed fraud and corruption to occur, since the INT report does not prove
whether and to what extent there was fraud and corruption under the project.

111. Managing the project during the INT field work as well as following INT’s initial
verbal and written reports of its findings was challenging, given the long period over
which INT conducted its work (January 2009 through June 2011), the seriousness of
INT’s initially reported findings, and the Bank’s institutional difficulties in taking action
on the basis of informal (e.g., non-public, unofficial and unwritten) information. Based
on an INT verbal briefing in July 2010 that as much as 70 percent of the expenditures
reviewed in its ongoing audit work were ineligible, Bank management decided
immediately to suspend IDA disbursements to ALRMP II informally (as it did not have a
formal basis for suspension), effectively bringing project activities financed by the World
Bank to a halt. Because the suspension was informal, it was not processed through the
Legal Department as per OP/BP 13.40, although the Board received a verbal briefing of
the suspension the day after it was put into effect (in an informal briefing on Kenya that
had previously been scheduled). The project remained informally suspended through the
final six months of its life, and closed as scheduled in December 2010 in that status.



                                             37
Findings of the INT forensic audit were disclosed to the GoK for the first time in April
2011, about 10 months after INT had provided its preliminary verbal report to Bank
management and after management had taken its precautionary action of informal
suspension. By that time, a drought-related emergency was fully under way in the Horn
of Africa. Although ALRMP II was the single most important program directly related to
the drought management agenda in the ASALs, the findings from INT’s forensic audit
had not yet been confirmed by IAD or acted upon by the project, and Bank management
therefore considered that it was not yet able to resume financing of ALRMP II
institutions to respond to the emergency, as it could not provide adequate assurance that
project financing would be used for the purposes intended. While the GoK attempted to
shift some of its own resources to fill the ensuing financing gap, especially for the
Drought Contingency Fund, this involved months of delay. The Bank’s informal
suspension in effect reduced IDA financing to the project by about US$5.7 million at a
critical time in the project’s history, and it also reduced funding from other sources. The
informal suspension also precluded use of the ALRMP II as a vehicle for quick
conveyance of additional financing to the affected area during the peak of the drought. In
particular US$5.9 million of EU drought financing could not be transferred to Kenya as
the EU had been using the ALRMP II Drought Contingency Fund for disbursement15 and
was constrained by IDA’s decision to suspend ALRMP II informally; and a US$5.5
million IDA-managed GEF grant, which would have relied on ALRMP II institutions for
its implementation, was not made effective. Later in FY11, IDA management also
suspended work on a successor project (expected to be a SWAp) that the GoK and its
development partners had been assuming would be prepared, pending a final resolution
of the issues that the INT forensic audit had brought to light. Despite these developments,
a few other donors, such as WFP, remained engaged with ALRMP II institutions, in
recognition of the then ongoing drought crisis and they continue to express confidence in
the ALRMP institutional arrangements (see Section 3.6 on stakeholder feedback to the
IL-ICR team).

112. INT’s conduct in the course of the ALRMP II forensic audit involved
shortcomings that affected project implementation. In particular: (i) INT’s initial decision,
in early 2009, to make the audit an INT-led exercise, rather than a collaborative exercise
involving the GoK’s IAD, meant that INT findings when ultimately provided to the GoK
could not be immediately addressed by the GoK, as the GoK (through IAD) needed to
validate the findings, thus delaying the GoK’s response; (ii) INT’s report, while strongly
suggesting that fraud and corruption had in fact occurred, did not prove their occurrence


15
   The objective of the EU Drought Management Initiative Trust Fund (TF093909) was to contribute to the
improved effectiveness and efficiency of the drought management system in Kenya by strengthening the
capacity of all actors to intervene in an appropriate, effective and timely fashion during the drought cycle.
The activities supported risk prevention and livelihood improvement through drought mitigation, response
and recovery activities based on drought contingency plans and triggered by early warning systems. The
resources were disbursed through the ALRMP Drought Contingency Fund. The TF effectiveness date was
September 29, 2007 and it closed on December 31, 2010 when the IDA credit closed. The total amount of
the TF was US$11.56 million (Euros 8.5 million), of which US$5.68 million (Euros 4.16 million) was
disbursed. Disbursements were stopped in July 2010 when the IDA credit was informally suspended. The
EU had no alternative way to disburse the remaining Euros 4.84 million (US$5.9 million equivalent).


                                                    38
(it found indicators of possible fraud or corruption that needed to be verified through an
investigation); and (iii) INT’s initial verbal estimate of the extent of ineligible and
questionable expenditures, on which the decision to suspend was based, was
approximately twice the amount contained in the subsequent written report, which was
further revised thereafter, raising questions about the rigor of the methodology employed.

113. The INT forensic audit also involved another failure on the part of the Bank. OP
13.40 was not observed when Bank management informally suspended. Compliance
with OP 13.40 would have required review and clearance by the Legal Department that a
case for suspension was justified under the terms of the Credit Agreement; formal
notification to the Board; formal consultation and notice to any affected Cofinanciers (in
this case, the EU); and formal notification to the Borrower with opportunity to respond.
Because INT in July 2010 had provided a verbal rather than a written preview of its
findings, management was unable to provide the Legal Department with a documented
basis for formal suspension. But because management also felt that the INT findings
were alarming and that it could not fail to act on them, however preliminary, it decided to
implement an informal suspension, pending the availability of documentation to provide
the basis for a formal suspension. In addition, to ensure that OP 13.40 was observed in
spirit to the greatest extent possible, the Board was verbally notified of the informal
suspension one day after it was decided; and the GoK and affected Cofinanciers were
verbally informed of INT’s findings and the management decision to suspend the project
within a few weeks of the informal suspension. The lack of a documentary basis for the
decisions taken impeded the ability of management, the GoK and the Cofinanciers to
discuss the issues raised or indeed to respond to any of the INT findings, putting a serious
strain on all project-related discussions, decisions and activities.

114. Given the severity of the drought, the centrality of the project in addressing it, and
the paucity of other instruments, redoubled effort to complete the forensic audit and clear
up methodological questions would have been in order.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Moderately
Unsatisfactory

115. IDA performance has been strong in many respects, and this has contributed to
the successful achievement of most outcome indicators of ALRMP II. However, there
were some deficiencies in design, supervision and important shortcomings in the Bank
Group’s handling of the final phase of ALRMP II, including the forensic audit.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

116. Borrower commitment to ALRMP II was strong during project design and has
remained so throughout implementation. Counterpart funding has generally been
adequate and timely. There was good continuity of key PCU managers and staff,
including staff in the field who were well respected for their technical competence
(although turnover of METs due to salary and other issues has been more problematic).


                                            39
Inter-Ministerial coordination at district level has been very constructive. Despite the
unexpected suspension of IDA financing for ALRMP II and of work on a follow-up
project, GoK has attempted to keep most staff in place and to continue project activities,
especially those related to drought management, albeit on a lesser scale. The main
weakness in GoK performance was its failure to establish the proposed NDMA during
the life of the project (although this has since been achieved in November 2011), and to
formalize other important ALRMP II institutional structures (DSGs, DPCs and the
Drought Contingency Fund). Also, decisions made in the course of ministerial
reorganizations have resulted in a questionable separation of the units responsible for
estimating food aid needs from those carrying out food aid and drought management
activities (between Ministries assigned in the Office of the President and the Office of the
Prime Minister). This situation is working better than might otherwise be expected,
because of the good personal relationships and competence of the staff and managers of
both units, but it is not ideal.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

117. The PCU has a thin and efficient structure (Headquarters and field combined). It
has had good continuity in management and core staffing, and it has managed to attract
and retain some excellent staff at field level. The working culture is proactive and
problem-solving, and the PCU’s ability to encourage individuals from across agencies to
work together collaboratively has been impressive. When alerted by the World Bank in
early 2007 to reports of fraud and corruption in one of the districts, the PCU responded
quickly and appropriately to that specific instance, and made changes in handling of the
transactions found to be of highest risk. Staff implicated in wrong-doing were dismissed.
Thus the PCU established a record of rapid response to problems when information was
conveyed to them. Throughout the period of the forensic audit, the project had no
concrete information to which to respond, and the existence of the forensic audit thus
does not represent evidence of lack of responsiveness or proactivity. Despite the
difficulties related to suspension of IDA financing, the PCU prepared a thorough
Borrower’s ICR and cooperated with IDA’s efforts to prepare its own ICR. Areas where
PCU performance could have been stronger are similar to some of the points raised in
relation to IDA (Section 5.2(b)). In particular, the sizeable expansion of project area at
the start of ALRMP II, and again at the time of the AF, should have been occasions for
the PCU to rethink some organizational issues in order to oversee effectively the much
scaled up set of responsibilities. Apart from the possibility of contracting more frequent
technical field site reviews to obtain feedback on the many dispersed activities that
ALRMP II supports, the PCU might also have reinforced its M&E related staffing. Also,
while the PCU’s commitment to empowering communities is deep and this theme cuts
across all ALRMP II activities, not just the CDD component, the PCU could have
detected earlier the need to clarify decision-making responsibilities and accountabilities
at community and district level, and ensure adequate O&M arrangements. The Project
Paper of the AF for ALRMP II and a letter from the GoK dated June 26, 2006, list
specific disclosure requirement for the project. While the majority of the required
documents have been disclosed, some of the District Annual Progress Reports, District
Annual Work Plans, and Printed Estimate (at Headquarters Level) have not been
disclosed on the project’s website and through other media.


                                            40
(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Moderately
Satisfactory

118. The successful outcome of ALRMP II is largely a credit to the strong support the
project has received from GoK, and the dedication and technical competence of national
and district PCU management and staffing. Sustaining those gains will require, inter alia,
actions to address some issues that were not resolved during implementation, in particular
formalization of some core ALRMP II institutional structures.

6.     Lessons Learned

119. Adaptation to longer-term climate change can be pursued jointly with
management of short-term emergencies, but requires explicit attention. ALRMP II
experienced the same pattern of needing to refocus efforts on drought management,
recovery and protection of livelihoods versus longer-term adaptation, as had occurred
under the first phase project. In both cases this occurred because of prolonged, severe
drought in the Horn of Africa. Given advances in scientific knowledge on climate
change and climate variability, it appears that more frequent – though still unpredictable
– and severe droughts are likely to be a constant feature of life in that region. This
suggests that future projects in the ASALs need to include, from the start, very strong
drought early warning, management and recovery components. They need to be large
enough and with flexible design features to be able to respond quickly, and on a scale
commensurate with drought severity. However, the projects also need to include robust
components that facilitate sustainable asset creation/income improvements and long-term
out-migration from fragile areas, and these components should not become victim to
‘unanticipated’ severe droughts. That is, the pattern of shifting efforts from strengthening
the long-term adaptive response capabilities of the ASAL population, towards (under-
dimensioned) drought management/short-term coping/recovery activities, should be
avoided.

120. Conflict resolution should be integrated into natural resource management
projects in fragile areas experiencing climate change stress. The first phase of
ALRMP did not include conflict resolution, but it very quickly became necessary and the
project responded creatively. With this experience, ALRMP II designers planned to
integrate conflict management into the natural resource management component.
Beneficiaries and other stakeholders point to the resulting activities as having been
among the project’s most important contributions. Addressing conflicts over natural
resources needs to be an integral part of projects in fragile locations that are experiencing
in-migration and/or are over-populated (in relation to the resource base) and subject to
increasingly adverse climate change impacts.

121. Putting in place flexible institutional arrangements that development
partners can use to channel support quickly, before climate emergencies occur, can
help to improve coordination and efficiency. Climate-related emergencies require
good early warning systems, contingency planning in which the affected population has



                                             41
had a say, and contingency resources that can be accessed quickly and in a well
coordinated manner by stakeholders who can provide assistance. A mechanism like the
ALRMP II Drought Contingency Fund can be very useful and IDA should consider
including such arrangements in projects for countries that are highly vulnerable to climate
change and climate variability risks. In structuring the funds, advance thought should be
given to legal, financial and reporting features that will make it easy for other donors to
come in very quickly if needed, and avoid losing scarce time in bureaucratic negotiations.

122. Lessons from Kenya’s Drought Early Warning System may be useful for
other countries. The effectiveness of the ALRMP II Early Warning System provides
lessons for countries/regions, particularly in the Africa region, in designing or improving
their own EWS. These include: (a) its incorporation of data and indicators relevant to
pastoralist communities; (b) its community-based nature with communities providing
real-time information that can be acted on; (c) its multi-sectoral nature - looking at a
broad set of inter-related food security indicators; and (d) the institutional set up,
particularly at the field level, that integrates EWS and other relevant information
available and involves and coordinates with all relevant stakeholders engaged in
preparedness, emergency relief/management and recovery.

123. Climate change adaptation requires time, putting communities in the drivers’
seat, and sound risk minimization arrangements. Development programs in areas
subject to frequent droughts and that target highly vulnerable populations, as in the
ASALs, require long enough implementation periods (through one, or a sequence of,
projects) to have a meaningful impact in strengthening coping skills, creating resilience
and undertaking sustainable adaptive responses. Involvement of communities in the
process is essential. This implies decentralization of responsibilities for implementation,
recognizing the reality that the project will be operating in a fragile environment and
therefore creating systems conducive to reducing risks, with good management
information systems that early detection of problems and corrective measures.

124. CDD projects need strong social accountability arrangements to minimize
corruption risks and strengthen local governance. Community-driven development
projects, or components, through the emphasis on beneficiary participation and
empowerment, can be instruments for reducing the risks of corruption and poor
governance, especially at the local level, provided that social accountability arrangements
are properly designed and implemented by the Borrower and closely supervised. There is
a particular need to design workable disclosure and complaints handling mechanisms,
assign responsibilities for implementing them, and ensure that this takes place. Selected
measures (e.g., timely posting of updated micro-project implementation and financing on
signboards and on the web, report formats that enable easy comparisons of sub-projects
across communities and districts, etc.) need to be included in the MIS and then specific
project and community members tasked with implementation and monitoring. The
functioning of these measures should also be a key focus of the CDD training, third-party
monitoring, financial audits, and of IDA supervision. Finally, it may also be possible to
consider more holistic, portfolio-level social accountability mechanisms supported by




                                            42
reputable civil society organizations. Such an approach can help to enhance public
reporting and complaints handling of financial information.

125. The approach to fiduciary supervision should be strategic; technology can
play a role. On the basis of the Arid Lands experience, there is need to work
strategically, both at the country and project levels. This includes further strengthening
of country fiduciary agencies, particularly IAD Treasury and KENAO for audit of CDD
and decentralized projects. Consideration should also be made of utilizing fiduciary
agents to monitor CDD projects where the risk is deemed to be high. There is also scope
for integrating modern technology into oversight of CDD projects. Poor rural
communities will often not be able to maintain sophisticated documentation on micro-
projects they carry out, however a combination of simple records (i.e., receipts, notes on
decisions made on community meetings, quotations for purchases) and proper use of the
technology by the PCU (e.g., use of low cost portable scanners and cameras with Global
Positioning System (GPS) to record information in situ and upload to the project
management information system (MIS) during field visits) could go a long way towards
strengthening oversight without imposing excessive controls from above.

126. Implementation arrangements need to allow climate-stressed communities
‘time out’ to cope with emergencies. For projects targeting highly vulnerable, climate-
stressed populations, implementation plans need to be flexible and take account of the
fact that during peak emergency periods (e.g., severe drought) many households will
temporarily be unable to focus on community development, while they are dealing with
the day-to-day challenges of survival. This will require special consideration of how to
handle community financing, procurement and other implementation arrangements in a
manner that allows beneficiaries ‘time out’ to deal with emergencies for which there may
be little advance notice, not to lose work already started, and to be able to return to the
longer-term adaptation agenda (e.g., micro-projects) when crises subside.

127. Task teams need stronger M&E specialist support. Task teams and
counterparts often struggle with assessment of outcomes at completion because baselines,
results frameworks and/or impact evaluations were not well designed. In the case of
ALRMP II, a very large amount of data was recorded (more than 10,000 household
surveys/month for the EWS system; nutritional records for over 600,000 children). The
task team made several efforts to strengthen evaluation; and it has been possible for the
IL-ICR to make a final assessment of results that meets standards of significance and
attribution. However, it should have been less complicated, and it should also have been
possible to generate more knowledge. Given the importance of proper evaluation, the
region/Bank should consider developing a small group of M&E specialists with proven
practical experience in the design of simple, measurable results and risk frameworks and
indicators, who can advise teams at design, mid-term and impact evaluation stages. With
regard to monitoring, a strong MIS (i.e., one that links sub-project performance and
finances, provides meaningful reports on project investments across communities and
districts, and enables regular disclosure of project activities at community, district/county,
and national levels in user-friendly formats) is critical for effective project management,
and also for ensuring transparency and accountability downward to communities and



                                             43
citizens. The need for accessible information on all aspects of ALRMP II was
demonstrated during implementation when the project came under questioning, and
struggled to address the critics.

128. A methodological note on evaluating results where climate events need to be
normalized across years would be helpful. Monitoring trends in drought vulnerability
requires a clear methodology for normalizing the severity of these climate events across
years. The IL-ICR team found this a challenge, as the Impact Evaluation had used a
vegetation-based methodology (NDVI), while other specialists recommended
precipitation-based approaches. It may be that alternative methods are appropriate,
within the same project, for different kinds of interventions. Given the likelihood that
many task teams will face similar issues in the context of accelerating climate change, on
the one hand, and the importance of being able to evaluate results properly over time
within and across projects, on the other, it would be important for the Agriculture and
Rural Development Department (ARD) to develop clear guidance for all teams to use on
appropriate methods for normalizing drought severity for the most common interventions
supported by Bank projects. The same may well be true for other climate change
phenomena (e.g., floods, erosion).

129. Fraud and corruption investigations need to be conducted in a manner that
promotes Borrower ownership. When fraud and corruption is suspected or alleged,
there is no question that the Bank and Borrower need to act quickly and decisively to
investigate and take appropriate measures. The Bank has learned from long experience in
other areas (e.g., economic and sector work (ESW), program and project design) that
ownership is improved when clients participate. The experience of ALRMP II shows that
a closer working relationship between INT and Kenya’s IAD from the start – a model
that was followed in the forensic audits initiated in early 2009 for the Western Kenya
Community-Driven Development project (WKCDD) as well as the Kenya Education
Sector Support project (KESSP) – might have led to an agreement on approach as well as
much earlier findings and recommendations (the WKCDD and KESSP audits were
completed in 2009, and because IAD was involved in the process from the beginning, the
government was able to respond to the findings and recommendations immediately,
including by suspending staff involved in fraud and corruption). When the Bank decides
to undertake an investigation without involving the client, it needs to do so as
expeditiously as possible – particularly in the case of projects that are designed to address
emergencies, and when such emergencies are already occurring and human lives are at
stake. A protracted process in the case of a project that is designed to address emergency
conditions not only limits the ability of the Bank and other donors to provide timely
support; it also may undermine the credibility of those in the country who are working on
the program and reduce their ability to be effective. Finally, if the process is not
perceived as fair or transparent, and in accordance with the Bank’s own fiduciary
guidelines, accepted international standards and government legislation and regulations,
the result is unlikely to achieve its objectives of improving governance.

130. World Bank Group operational policy should be followed when invoking
suspension remedies, but some additional guidance may be needed. When cause for



                                             44
suspension is clear and documented, it is important that procedures be followed, i.e., OP
13.40. However, cases may arise in which continuation of disbursement is considered to
be unacceptably risky, and yet the documentary information required to adhere to OP
13.40 is not available. The experience of ALRMP II shows that additional guidance is
required to manage such situations. Special effort should be undertaken quickly to gather
the documentary information needed to allow either formal suspension under OP 13.40 or
full resumption of disbursement. In an emergency situation, limited continued
disbursement with special fiduciary oversight may be warranted. All effort should be
made by INT and the Regions to assure that projects do not go into an indeterminate
status of informal suspension for a prolonged period of time. Informal suspensions do
not allow for careful review by the Legal Department of evidence justifying the remedy;
there is no formal communication to a Borrower detailing the reasons for suspension and
what, if any, actions can be taken to correct the situation; the Board and co-financiers are
not formally advised; the Bank does not hold itself to any clear timetable for follow-up;
and the process generally lacks the transparency that should accompany such serious
actions.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partner

(a)    Borrower/implementing agencies

131. The Borrower’s Ministry of Finance submitted comments on the draft IL-ICR to
IDA on December 20, 2011 (see Annex 6). These largely concurred with the IL-ICR
findings, particularly those concerning achievement of ALRMP II development
objectives and most KPIs, difficulties posed by M&E issues, and the impact of the
forensic audit process in the final stages of ALRMP II and on the Government’s
relationship with IDA. GoK also identified a few differences of opinion on some of the
IL-ICR fiduciary findings, summarized steps it has taken to strengthen risk assessment
and governance arrangements over the life of ALRMP II, and provided an update on its
recent establishment of the long-proposed NDMA in November 2011 after the IL-ICR
team had visited Kenya. IDA has corrected factual points, one of which resulted in
upgrading of achievements for Intermediate Outcome Indicator (IOI) 11 and reflected the
status of the new NDMA in the final IL-ICR. GoK did not question other ratings, and the
change in IOI 11 does not affect the overall assessment of project results, risks, IDA and
Borrower performance.

(b)    Co-financier

132. The Delegation of the European Union to Kenya submitted comments on the draft
IL-ICR to IDA on December 15, 2011 (see Annex 7). EU comments largely concurred
with the draft IL-ICR findings. They emphasized the impacts of IDA’s suspension on
ALRMP II funding and interruption of support to sustain and scale up results jointly with
other development partners, at a time when Kenya faced a very severe drought. The EU
Delegation also updated information on its own continuing institutional support to the
Ministry for Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands and on the
establishment of the NDMA in November 2011, and indicated the Delegation’s openness



                                            45
to consider a renewed partnership with IDA on drought management activities in Kenya,
taking into account the final conclusions of the forensic audit.

                           Annex 2.        Outputs by Component


1.     Unless otherwise indicated, the information below draws on data from the ILRI-
IE of 2010, the Borrower’s ICR of September 2011, Project Files and IL-ICR team
findings.

Component 1: Natural Resource Management and Drought Management



Link to Output/Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs). The natural resource and
drought management component was linked to seven IOIs. (i) District staff and a minimum of
600 communities trained in participatory natural resource management (IOI-1: Achieved); (ii)
Key potential conflict flashpoints identified in each district and conflict management initiatives
strengthened (IOI-2: Achieved); (iii) Kenya Food Security Meeting (KFSM) and 28 District
Steering Groups institutionalized (although the structure has been established and was
functioning very well before the end of the project, because it has not been institutionalized and
this poses a threat to sustainability, the IL-ICR team considers this IOI-3: Partially
Achieved); (iv) Drought Early Warning System monthly bulletins produced and disseminated
in the project area and at national level on a regular and timely basis (IOI-4: Achieved); (v)
District Long Term Drought Preparedness and Annual Work Plans developed in each district in
the project area (IOI-5: Achieved); (vi) District Drought Contingency Plans developed in each
district in the project area and disseminated to stakeholders (IOI 6: Achieved); and (vii)
Drought Contingency Fund and associated funding mechanism established (IOI 7: Partially
Achieved).

Link to PDO Indicators. Component 1 activities were linked to achievement of three PDO
indicators: (i) decreasing the proportion of people in the ASAL districts assessed as needing
free food aid, normalized by severity of drought (KPI-1: Achieved); (ii) reducing time lapse
between reported drought stress and response (KPI-2: Achieved); and (iii) improving
nutritional status of children below 5 years of age over time normalized by severity of drought
(KPI 3: Achieved). The natural resource management sub-component activities also
contributed to increasing the number of people with access to basic services, including water,
human and animal health services, and education (KPI-4: Achieved).




2.       This component had two sub-components: (i) Natural Resource Management; and
(ii) Drought Preparedness and Management. It operated in both arid and semi-arid
districts, and was the largest ALRMP II component in terms of and resources allocated
and spent. Actual component expenditures were US$115.99 million.

Expected Outputs/Results

3.    Sub-component (i): The objective of the Natural Resource Management sub-
component was to establish and strengthen initiatives to reduce the livelihoods


                                                48
vulnerability of ASAL communities to the effects of drought through the sustainable use
and management of natural resources. The strategy was to promote a better understanding
of the natural resource base, thereby leading to improved planning and implementation of
coordinated activities that would make the most beneficial and sustainable long term use
of the natural assets found in the ASALs, in the context of low and erratic rainfall
compounded by other external uncertainties.

4.      Expected outputs included: (i) training of district staff and communities in
participatory NRM and Drought Preparedness; (ii) development of a Vision and Strategy
for ASAL NRM; (iii) generation and dissemination of better information and awareness
of NRM; (iv) preparation of discrete development area/livelihood zone NRM plans with
financial allocations for drought preparedness prioritized; (v) preparation of community
level NRM plans through a Participatory Rural Appraisal/Participatory Learning in
Action process; and (vi) peace building and conflict management activities.

5.       Actual outputs included: (i) 717 NRM/environmental awareness training sessions
at district and community levels and including all 28 district field offices and
development partners; (ii) Natural Resource Management Plans were prepared for all 28
districts and were used for identification, prioritization and implementation of NRM
micro-projects. The vision and strategies emerging from these plans provided the basic
framework for design of the ASAL Development Policy and the District and National
Environmental Action Plans; (iii) ALRMP II invested in 1,341 drought preparedness
micro-projects; (iv) Community level NRM plans constituted the major part of the 614
community development plans for the CDD component; and (v) 214 conflict
management meetings and workshops were held. This sub-component also financed
independent annual environmental audits with the recommendations shared among the
different project actors, and developed environmental screening tools for micro-projects
and inter-community projects.

6.       Improving conflict the management of conflicts that have their origin in the
increasingly fragile ASAL natural resource base (especially water, pasture and cattle) is
crucial for any development effort. ALRMP II therefore sought to integrate conflict
management into NRM, with some significant achievements. District Peace Committees
have been established and strengthened in all districts. Unlike other peace initiatives that
have been driven by higher-level actors, ALRMP II targeted assistance at the local level,
involving key community leaders, using a combination of customary and formal
institutions and through the CDCs provided a link with district level authorities. Inter-
community NRM planning has also helped to reduce conflict. The project brought
together communities to agree on how to use pasture and water resources, especially in
the case of drought. These created ties and relationships among the parties that make
cattle rustling less likely and created an environment in which reconciliation of former
hostile communities became possible.

7.     Nonetheless, while ALRMP II has piloted a number of catchment conservation,
rangeland management and other NRM/environmental conservation activities, achieving
an overall impact in the ASAL districts will require considerable scaling up. The



                                            49
National and District NRM visions and strategies have contributed to a more holistic
understanding of needs, but implementation is a challenge, and more focused and action-
oriented planning tools are needed. Similarly, ALRMP II has contributed greatly to the
understanding of issues related to climate change, and it has already enhanced the
capacity of major stakeholders in the ASALs to cope with climate variability and change.
However, a more comprehensive and explicit approach to climate risk management, and
adequate financing to apply the knowledge learned towards increasing climate resilience
and implementing climate-smart investments is now needed.

8.      Sub-component (ii): The objective of this sub-component was to create a more
effective drought management system that would minimize the need for emergency
operations, on the one hand, and enhance response mechanisms during acute drought
emergencies on the other. This required: (i) building institutional and technical capability
at district, regional and national level to respond effectively to drought; (ii) developing
and maintaining working relationships with target communities and district-based
agencies through the implementation of drought related activities during “normal?
periods, in order to create a readiness for quick response at the onset of emergencies; and
(iii) preventing drought from degenerating into famine by implementing appropriate
drought management interventions and initiating a rapid post-drought recovery and a
return to “normal life? as soon as possible. The main interventions supported by ALRMP
II towards this end are detailed below.

9.       The EWS that had been developed under the first phase of ALRMP was
enhanced (in terms of the data collected and analytical processes) and expanded (from 11
to 28 districts), and it played a central role in informing decisions during the main
drought operations of 2004/05 and 2008/09 (and intervening less severe years), including
forecasting drought severity, needs identification and targeting of relief interventions.
The IL-ICR team received feedback from all major national and international
development partners involved in drought preparedness and drought relief on the
reliability of the reports and how that has improved during ALRMP II implementation.
There were important increases in the frequency, timeliness and scope of the Drought
Monitoring Bulletins from all districts. The backbone of the ALRMP community based
EWS is the monthly collection of field data from local communities at specific sentinel
sites, which are sample locations within administrative sub-locations, representative of all
main types of livelihoods in the ASAL area. Each of the 28 ASAL districts obtains EWS
data from 360 to 450 households each month (about 10,000 to 12,600 households
surveyed monthly); the data is analyzed at district level and used at district and national
levels.

10.     Early warning information was provided to all stakeholders to ensure timely
response to drought stress. A total of 2,965 activities were undertaken, including
production of 2,336 EWS bulletins, as well as rapid food security assessments and
community feedback meetings in all 28 districts. The provision of timely and reliable
information enabled stakeholders to make appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate
the effects of drought and other disasters. According to ILRI-IE, about 78 percent of
national and international institutions involved with drought preparedness and drought



                                            50
relief in 2009 used the project EWS as their main source of information to plan their
activities/interventions in the area (up from 32 percent in 2001).

11.    The Kenyan Food Security Coordination Structure at the National and
District levels includes: (i) the KFSM as the main coordinating body that brings
together food security actors in a forum where information is exchanged, options debated
and decisions on activities formulated for referral to the Government of Kenya and
donors; (ii) the KFSSG, which as the technical “think tank? and advisory body to all
relevant stakeholders on issues of drought management and food security; holds monthly
meetings to discuss emerging issues, and produces monthly updates that summarize
pertinent issues from a series of sources (on weather, rainfall, crop and livestock
production, and food aid. The updates rely heavily on the 28 ALRMP bulletins. KFSSG
also produces bi-annual assessments on food security and drought status; and (iii) the
DSGs that are the equivalent of KFSM at the district level.

12.      Each of the 28 ALRMP districts has a DSG that performs food security and
drought management coordination work, among other activities. DSGs provide the
mechanism to channel information and decisions upwards to the appropriate government
bodies and donors, but are also critical for coordinating action at the district level. DSGs
play a central role in coordinating needs assessments, particularly during the biannual
rainfall assessments and other occasional food security assessments. Members of DSGs
include the relevant food security government ministries, local government
representatives, as well as UN, NGOs, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), faith
based organizations and local community leaders of each district. The technical arms of
the DSGs are made up of relevant line ministries and relevant agencies. The DSGs are
chaired by the District Commissioners, with the ALRMP Drought Management Officers
acting as secretariat to the DSG. While the project has provided support to the whole
Kenyan Food Security, it is at the field level (at the level of the DSGs) created by
ALRMP, that the project had its greatest impact. The ILRI-IE conducted a survey among
national and international agencies involved with drought preparedness, management and
relief, and concluded that it was a great appreciation for the role of the role of the DSGs
and the ALMRP II project in terms of coordination and helping to increase the efficiency
of the work of those agencies in the field. The IL-ICR team received similar feedback
from UN agencies, bi-lateral donors, NGOs and line agencies both during interviews in
Nairobi and in the three workshops it held in the field. This feedback singles out the role
of the DSGs and ALRMP II as the most important component for coordination of all
donors, NGOs and line agencies activities in the field resulting in avoiding duplications,
knowledge of where to direct their efforts once they got to the field in a way that best
fitted their own comparative advantages, and an improvement in overall response and
effectives to droughts.

13.     The ALRMP project financed the preparation of District long-term Drought
Preparedness and annual Work Plans, as well as District Contingency Plans for the 28
project districts. Numerous training activities were also undertaken to build the capacities
of all stakeholders to undertake drought preparedness and emergency interventions. The




                                            51
ALRMP II Contingency Fund was often the first respondent once drought emergencies
were declared.

14.      Drought preparedness investments. According to the Borrower’s ICR, 2,934
drought preparedness investments were made to improve water availability and access
for human and livestock use, including: excavation of water pans; pipeline development;
drilling, equipping and rehabilitation of boreholes; shallow well development and
equipping with hand and rotary pumps; provision of water tanks; construction of rock
catchments, masonry tanks, underground water tanks and ferro-cement tanks,
construction of pump houses, water kiosks and cattle troughs; water treatment works;
construction of sand dams, as well as rehabilitation of existing water structures,
hydrological surveys and solar panel kits. In agriculture, activities included mainly
irrigation; on farm storage structures; crop seed/planting materials; seed banks and seed
multiplication; and water and soil conservation structures. In the livestock sector,
ALRMP II financed some 4,000 activities to improve the availability and accessibility of
livestock feeds and water, livestock disease prevention, surveillance and control,
improvement of livestock breeds and livestock marketing. To improve access to health
care, four investments were made in the district of Tharaka (which lacks adequate health
facilities); three other projects investments supported nutritional surveys and information
system in Mandera to provide people with reliable health and nutrition information.
Main livestock activities included pasture production and fodder establishment helping to
maintain body condition of livestock left behind and making milk available to families
during drought periods; purchase of improved breeds of cattle, goats and chicken, to
improve genetic potential of pastoralist herd, improve productivity, maturity rate, milk
production and income from livestock sales; purchase of camels as drought tolerant
species, particularly to improve milk availability which is in low supply during droughts;
sale yards to facilitate marketing of livestock and hence increased income for pastoralist;
other livestock activities included vaccination campaigns; water trucking; purchase of
incubators. In order to introduce alternative income, modern bee-keeping micro-projects
were undertaken and honey processing equipment purchased, benefiting 100,768 persons.
Replacement of traditional hives increased honey production from 20 kgs per hive to over
80 kgs. Other alternative source of income introduced by the project included fish
farming in the districts of Kitui, Kajiado and Nyeri. The IL-ICR team visited one of these
fish-farming projects in Kitui, which was obtaining very good results.

15.      Drought emergency activities related to water, livestock, health and nutrition,
agriculture, and coordination. In order to improve water availability and access to
clean water during drought periods a total 2,069 water activities were undertaken in all
districts, except Nyeri, Tharaka and Transmara. This benefited a large number of
households by reducing distances to water points, and providing a constant supply of
water to humans and livestock during drought. Water related activities included support
to rapid response teams to sustain continuous functioning of boreholes during long
operation hours ensuring constant supply of clean water to communities during drought
thus preventing morbidity and mortality of humans and livestock; water trucking; drilling
and rehabilitation of boreholes; purchase of plastic and collapsible water tanks; purchase
of submersible pumps and hand pumps; provision of fuel subsidies, and rehabilitation of



                                            52
other water supply structures among others. In the livestock sector emergency livestock
response activities were undertaken during acute drought periods. A total of 7,454
emergency response interventions were undertaken, including emergency livestock off-
take which provided pastoralist with an avenue to sell off emaciated stock hence reducing
potential loss, selling at markup price higher that offered at local market level; livestock
disease control and surveillance and treatment, specially with vaccination campaigns for
notifiable diseases reducing morbidity and mortality and allow markets to operate
without closures and households to maintain flow of income during most needed periods;
livestock supplementary feed provision to maintain livestock body condition and reduce
livestock death, especially of the few milking stock left behind while main stock
migrates to areas with better pastures. A total of 223 health and nutrition emergency
responses included rapid response to disease outbreak such a malaria, cholera, Kalazaar,
diarrhea, measles and aflatoxicosis. Nutritional activities included purchase of
supplementary feeds for vulnerable groups (under five children and pregnant and
lactating women), and nutritional surveys/assessment support to Integrated Management
of Acute Malnutrition. Other activities in this sector including purchases of vaccines,
material for laboratories, hospital equipment, etc. Emergency health and nutrition
activities were funded using the Drought Contingency Fund. Some 107 agriculture
related emergency activities were undertaken in order to enhance food security and
increase food production. In terms of coordination, they entail the monthly meetings of
the District Steering Groups, but also monitoring and evaluation of project activities,
DSG tours and visit to the project areas, and activities allowing for effective project
planning and implementation activities through collaboration.

16.     Areas for improvement in the results framework. The framework relies on
changes in assessed food aid needs as a proxy for changes in livelihoods vulnerability.
The assumed relationship is reasonable, although other factors could influence food needs,
such as changes in remittances or other safety net support to beneficiaries. The IL-ICR
team is persuaded that ALRMP II was far and away the main program in the ASALs; and
there was little, if any, safety net support from other sources – i.e., such factors could not
have caused changes in food aid needs, which are more likely the result of changes in
vulnerability. However, the framework would be stronger if it attempted to measure
changes in economic activities and NRM practices on the ground (e.g., extent of
beneficiary adoption of more drought resistant crops/cultivation/animal management
techniques) as intermediate outcome indicators.

Component 2: Community Driven Development


Link to Output/IOIs. Component 2 was most directly related to four IOIs: (i)
Mobile Extension Teams and line ministries core staff in specified arid land districts
trained to conduct modified Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and to provide
backstopping to communities to participate in CDD (IOI-8: Achieved); (ii) effective
screening by specific DSGs routinely undertaken for community plans and project
proposals for technical, environmental and financial soundness (IOI-9: Achieved);
(iii) 600 Community Action Plans prepared and micro-projects implemented by
communities (IOI-10: Achieved); and (iv) at least 1,000 groups assisted in
developing savings capacity through top-up savings grants (IOI-11: Achieved).

Link to PDO Indicators: The CDD component has contributed most directly to
one PDO indicator: increased number of people with access to basic services –
PDO4: Achieved). However, it has also played an important role in helping to
achieve three other PDO indicators: (i) reduction in the number of people assessed
as needing food aid (PDO 1: Achieved); (ii) improved nutritional status of children
under 5 years of age (PDO 3: Achieved); and (iii) increased people’s participation in
the project districts (PDO 5: Partially Achieved). ILRI-IE findings on the statistical
significance of outcomes in the arid districts (where the CDD component operated)
and the semi-arid districts (where it did not) underscore the likely importance to
PDOs 1, 4 and 5 of employing a participatory CDD strategy.



17.    The component had three sub-components: (i) Support to CDD implementation;
(ii) Community Capacity Building; and (iii) Capacity Building for Backstopping Services.
Actual component expenditures were about US$24.9 million, including US$19.23 million
for micro-projects (of which US$5.96 million financed by communities and US$13.27
million by IDA), and capacity building and backstopping services of US$5.67 million.
The component was implemented only in the 11 arid districts. Several improvements
were introduced, in comparison with the CDD component of the first phase of ALRMP.
The main changes were to move to a two-stage CDD process, involving ‘basic CDD’ for
new communities and ‘extended CDD’ for those with CDD experience, shifting greater
responsibility for procurement to communities, and increasing the community
contribution for income generating projects, including a greater cash contribution.

18.      Expected outputs/results. ALRMP II worked with 614 communities (331 ‘basic’
and 283 ‘extended’ communities) in the 11 arid districts. It supported 2,477 training
activities for about 150,000 people (52 percent women), in Participatory Integrated
Community Development (PICD), PICD updates or retraining, Finance and Community
Procurement, training on Cross-cutting Issues (e.g., gender, proposal writing, resource
mobilization, HIV/Aids, environmental management, conflict resolution and subjects
identified during the needs assessment carried out by ALRMP II field officers).
According to the Borrower’s ICR and project files, the 614 communities have
implemented about 3,000 micro projects, benefiting a total of some 1.9 million people
(55 percent women). The most common community micro-projects included water,


                                                54
agriculture, education, health and sanitation sectors. Livestock, access roads and other
diverse income-generating activities were also financed.

19.     While these outputs relate to investments under Component 2, it is also the case
that some similar small investments took place under Components 1 and 3, for which
communities participated in the sense of identifying priorities but did not take the lead in
managing implementation, nor were they required to make local contributions as they did
for the CDD micro-projects. This occasionally created confusion at the local level, and in
any future project it would be preferable to have a clearer delineation of the kinds of
investments that require beneficiary contributions, whether contributions could vary
depending on the nature of the investment or relative poverty of the group. Although
communities did meet, and sometimes exceed, their share of counterpart funding for
Component 2 micro-projects (30 percent), this did pose hardship and/or delay the start of
investments in some poorer locations.

20.     ALRMP II design was largely consistent with good practice lessons drawn from
other CDD projects in the Africa region at the time of appraisal in the early 2000s.
Project design sought to respond to risks and issues identified in the evaluation of
ALRMP I including: (i) increased community participation and capacity through
sustained training; (ii) increased focus on conflict reduction; and (iii) increased focus on
inclusion of marginalized groups. However the design could also have benefited from a
broader look at lessons from outside the region (Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, and Brazil).
Nor did revisions at the time of the AF in 2006 fully take on board emerging good
practices at that stage. Some intended enhancements do not appear to have been fully
incorporated into project manuals, trainings, M&E framework, budgets and supervision.
Most importantly, although ALRMP II and the AF emphasized increasing community
participation, introducing social accountability, reducing conflict, and increasing
inclusion of marginalized groups, relevant indicators were either focused on direct project
outputs or were not included. The AF also eliminated some indicators related to
community participation and accountability that had been part of the original ALRMP II
log frame. This may have resulted in uneven attention to these issues in project
implementation, supervision and monitoring.

21.     There is evidence, based on stakeholder workshops and focus groups, that
communities improved their abilities to articulate needs, plan and manage local projects,
and to allocate limited resources and lobby for external support. Reviews carried out by
the project, Kinmetrica, Mpereeza, IDA, and during ICR preparation noted several
achievements: (i) increased capacity of men and women in remote areas, including
indigenous and marginalized communities, to engage in development discussions and
actions; (ii) CDD related structures played a central role in training credible leaders (civic
and Parliamentary leaders, provincial administration chiefs and sub-chiefs); (iii)
numerous CDCs succeeded in accessing and managing external resources under their
Community Action Plans; (iv) many PCU and district project staff demonstrated high
levels of motivation and commitment, and established strong relationships and trust with
the communities; and (v) DSGs formed under the project are perceived by government,
communities, and external partners to have played an important coordinating role.



                                             55
22.      These reviews also noted challenges in the implementation and supervision of the
CDD model, including: (i) limited clarity of project rules at community level; (ii) limited
resources for and focus on sustaining wider community involvement beyond the PICD;
(iii) lack of distinction between approaches for public and private goods; (iv) issues with
checks and controls and uneven implementation and supervision of social accountability
measures; (v) weak M&E and learning systems; and (vi) inadequate field facilitation and
implementation support to communities. Also, as noted in supervision reports, the
performance of METs, comprising officers from various line departments and NGOs,
was affected by high turnover, expenditures on fuel and per diem for METs, and limited
accountability of MET staff because they continued to report to their respective line
departments.

23.      The PAD, PIP, and CDD manual include recommendations on community
involvement and social accountability measures, including geo-referencing and mapping
of all ALRMP II investments, more systematic public disclosure of project activities and
financial information at district and community levels, and a revamped communications
strategy. However, while some measures were done for the whole project (e.g., geo-
referencing), it appears that others were not as systematically implemented. At an
aggregate level, project reports did not enable ready reconciliation of project activities
with financing. For example, until the geo-referencing was completed later in the project
period, reporting formats did not enable one to see a regularly updated and
comprehensive list or map of all CDD micro-projects, arranged by community and
district; a view of all of the different project activities (NRM, Drought Contingency Fund,
CDD, Support for Local Development) in a given community or district, and the
financing for each. It should be noted that the absence of comprehensive geo-referenced
data for all interventions has been a common problem not confined to Kenya, and project
teams in all countries have been working actively to correct this.

24.     With the benefit of hindsight and improvements in CDD methodology, the initial
design included several shortcomings that affected project implementation. These
included: (i) a strong emphasis on an initial participatory CDD identification and
prioritization exercise (the PICD), but limited guidelines and training to sustain broader
community participation beyond the PICD; (ii) lack of clarity on project rules, and
limited understanding of community members of project rules; (iii) lack of clarity on how
project resources were allocated for various sub-projects; and (iv) lack of robust
monitoring indicators to track progress on the CDD component. In retrospect, another
design shortcoming was that social accountability measures related to transparency and
community monitoring were not well reflected in the financial management, procurement,
and M&E guidelines of the project, and it does not appear that they were implemented
uniformly by GoK (see below) or supervised very closely by IDA.

25.    In response to IL-ICR team questions, a quick survey of Drought Management
Officers, detailed district-by-district social accountability practices for all local ALRMP
II investments (i.e., not only CDD micro-projects but also those financed under
Components 1 and 3) regarding branding (use of placards to identify the investment as



                                            56
having been financed under ALRMP) and public display of work plans and budgets.
Branding was fairly widespread, though not uniform: 6 districts have 100 percent of
projects branded; another 9 have 90-99 percent branded; 5 have 80-89 percent; 7 have 60-
79 percent; and only one has less than 60 percent. All but 1 district have public
disclosure notice boards, though usually at the ALRMP district office rather than at
community level.

26.     The Ministry of Finance has recently taken the initiative to develop a new policy
to ensure effective governance structures and good financial management and
procurement systems and guidelines for devolved funds at national, county, facility and
community levels. The policy would also define a framework for management of
community funds through NGOs, community-based organizations and other mechanisms,
and develop robust social accountability mechanisms including community participation
in governance, financial management and procurement of devolved CDD resources,
public reporting, complaints handling and recourse mechanisms. A joint government
task team has been established and IDA is cooperating closely, and will reflect results in
CDD manuals for ongoing projects and in arrangements for a follow up to ALRMP II.
IDA has also put together a multi-unit Task Team comprising of Africa Regional
specialists in social development, rural development, economic management, financial
management and procurement, to coordinate its work on this topic, and is exploring
possible south-south technical assistance that would draw on experiences from other
regions and countries where CDD social accountability arrangements are more developed
and working well.

27.     Areas for improvement in the results framework. The framework would have
benefited     from   some     indicators   that  would    measure      changes      in
participation/empowerment (along the lines employed by the ILRI-IE; other examples
could be drawn from good practice CDD operations elsewhere), with particular attention
to gender and marginalized groups.




                                           57
Component 3: Support to Local Development


Link with Output/IOIs. The five IOIs most directly influenced by Component 3
were: (i) National Pastoral Policy formulated through participatory process (IOI-12:
Achieved); (ii) mobile schools and nomadic education centers established in 3
project districts (IOI-13: Achieved); (iii) at least 600 communities reached with
awareness raising program on human health and HIV/AIDS (IOI-14: Achieved);
(iv) guidelines for emergency livestock off-take prepared and articulated in all
project districts (IOI-15: Achieved); and (v) options for improved financial services
delivery considered and implemented where possible within the project area (IOI-
16: Not Achieved).

Link with PDO and Indicators. Component 3 was most directly relevant to two PDO
Indicators: (i) increased number of people with access to basic services (PDO4:
Achieved); and (ii) increased people’s participation in the project districts in local
and national development as demonstrated by the reflection of arid lands concerns in
the economic recovery strategy and other relevant national policies (PDO5:
Partially Achieved). Together with other components, it also indirectly supported
two other PDO indicators: (i) reduction in the number of people assessed as needing
food aid (PDO 1: Achieved); and (ii) improved nutritional status of children under 5
years of age (PDO 3: Achieved).


28.     This component had three sub-components: (i) Policy, Advocacy and Research;
(ii) Local Services Development; and (ii) Piloting Financial Services. Actual component
expenditures were US$11.81 million. The component was implemented only in the 11
arid districts (except for the policy, advocacy and research activities, which were not area
specific).

29.    Expected outputs/results of the above three sub-components were to (i) establish
a policy framework for local level development; (ii) strengthen institutions and
organizations for local development; and enhance existing sector delivery capacity in
water, education, human & animal health, marketing, agricultural research & advisory
services; and (iii) pilot a viable approach to deliver rural financial services in the arid
lands and explore an expansion strategy.

30.     Sub-component (i): ALRMP II sought to increase the voice of the ASAL
population in decision-making on issues that affected their well-being and livelihoods.
The project was involved in the formulation of nine draft policies of direct relevance to
the ASALs. This was part of ALRMP II’s policy and advocacy strategy to influence
Government commitment by strengthening relevant parts of the national policy
framework. The Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation
(Kenya’s PRSP, 2004) includes a full chapter influenced by the ALRMP II PCU and
project beneficiary communities at the national and local levels. Among other policies
and sessional papers to which ALRMP II provided important inputs are the National
Policy for Sustainable Development of Arid and Semiarid Lands of Kenya, National
Land Policy, National Disaster Policy, Policy Framework for Nomadic Education in


                                               58
Kenya, National Policy on Land Reclamation, National Policy on Peace Building and
Conflict Management, National Food Security and Nutrition Policy, National Livestock
Policy, and National Irrigation and Drainage Policy. On the other hand, some of these
policies were still in draft form at the time of the IL-ICR team, which poses risks for
sustainability of the achievements if they are not formally adopted. On the other hand,
ALRMP II advocacy on behalf of ASAL needs led to the creation of the Ministry of State
for the Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands (April 2008) and to the
recent establishment of the new National Drought Management Authority (November
2011) after project completion. Kenya’s Vision 2030 (successor to the Economic
Recovery Strategy) also reflects ASAL concerns, and the experience and knowledge
generated by ALRMP II has contributed to the formulation of Kenya’s official thinking
on climate change adaptation.

31.     In the area of research, the project engaged several consultancies to study issues
that had been problematic under the ALRMP I and/or on which guidance needed to be
given to DSGs and DCUs during the second phase: gender, mobile education, livestock
survey, emergency livestock off-take, veterinary drugs delivery system, livestock
marketing, livestock disease free zones, agricultural services, and river water user
associations. ALRMP II also engaged a consultant to analyze the contribution of the
ASALs to the national economy in the areas of livestock and livestock products,
agriculture, tourism, energy, gums, resins, mineral extraction, bio-diversity and world
heritage sites, among others. Much of this research was of a practical nature (obtaining
information on the ground, exploring intervention models that could be adapted to the
ASALs, etc.). Quality varied but for the most part the consultancies contributed
positively to ALRMP’s own investment activities or to its policy advice and advocacy.

32.     Sub-component (ii): ALRMP II sought to increase the availability and quality of
services, by empowering ASAL communities to better articulate their needs to service
providers. To assess achievement of this community empowerment objective, the ILRI-
IE conducted a social network analysis and found that there had been a 54.2 percent
increase in the communities’ ability to seek services from service providers rather than
wait for them to be received. The change was greater in arid districts, where the increase
was 95.2 percent between 2004 and 2009.

33.     ILRI-IE also found that community interactions and bonds with service providers
are stronger now than in 2004. Overall, 44 percent of the arid districts recorded an
improvement in service provider closeness to the community. Communities also shared
their perceptions of the change in quality across all services by attributing scores to each,
rating the quality of health and education services to be the most improved.

34.     ALRMP II investments under this sub-component included water (which
supported livelihood and food security objectives, human and animal health, and reduced
time spent by families – particularly women – to seek water); education (including class
rooms, mobile schools, dormitories, kitchen and dining halls, and sanitary facilities in
primary schools, training and education stakeholders’ forums/meetings); human health
(infrastructure and training on public health, HIV/AIDS, traditional birth attendants,



                                             59
female genital mutilation, drug abuse); livestock (breed improvement, fodder production
and milk processing); fish farming, beekeeping and various disease control activities; and
Disease Control activities.

35.     The ILRI IE found that treatment (project) communities had better access to
quality water sources; primary, secondary and adult education; and to veterinary
medicines than at the start of ALRMP II. The percent of households consulting medical
professionals, using bed nets, and seeking veterinary extension services also increased,
and negative health-related outcomes (prevalence of child diarrhea and livestock
mortality) decreased significantly. The IE also noted that this may understate project
impact as improvements also occurred in control communities due to good inter-agency
coordination and use of DSG plans prepared for the project), and because ALRMP II
advocacy on behalf of the ASALS helped to improve service delivery in both
intervention and control communities. On distance to water, the IL-ICR team estimates
that distance to boreholes decreased from 6.4 to 4.3 kms, to pans and dams from 3.8 to
3.0 kms, and to shallow wells from 5.2 to 2.9 kms in the 28 arid and semi-arid districts,
but was not able to determine attribution, although the project did make a significant
number of water-related investments.

36.     Sub-component (iii): Activities in piloting financial services were very limited
during the project period. ALRMP II financed a micro-finance workshop and explored
the scope for supporting financial services associations and village banks in three districts.
However, village banks, although viable for limited savings, had a low capital base that
made them generally unable to engage in lending activities. Preparation of the sub-
component did not build on adequate knowledge of the micro-finance sector; objectives
were only vaguely stated; and attention during implementation was more limited, both by
GoK and IDA. While the lack of success in developing financial services during the
project period did not keep ALRMP II from achieving its overall PDO, this should be an
important agenda item for future projects directed towards the ASALs.

37.      Areas for improvement in the results framework: The fact that ALRMP II
institutional arrangements (DSGs, DPCs, Drought Contingency Fund) served a wide
array of donors, GoK line agencies, NGOs and other actors in the ASALs was
emphasized strongly in every single meeting the IL-ICR team held, both in Nairobi and
in the field. Given the strength of this qualitative feedback, the IL-ICR concludes that
this was a case of best practice inter-agency coordination, on one hand, and that because
of this achievement; on the other hand, ALRMP II’s indirect impacts have probably been
quite strong. It would have been useful if the results framework had included indicators
to: (i) assess the extent and effectiveness of this coordination; and (ii) measure the
incremental investments in the ASALs made by others because they were able to use
ALRMP II institutions and planning activities (e.g., PICDs).




                                             60
                   Annex 3.       Economic and Financial Analysis


1.      The PAD does not provide an Ex-ante Economic Analysis for the entire project.
The reason given is that the micro-projects have heterogeneous impacts that depend on
several factors that cannot be measured easily and therefore it is not possible to calculate
an overall Net Present Value (NPV) of Economic Rate of Return (ERR). However, the
PAD assesses the financial viability of several individual activities (irrigation, rain-fed
agriculture, petty trade, livestock trade and bee keeping) and finds that these were all
financially viable.

2.      This annex quantifies the benefits that result from two sets of mechanisms that
can be attributed to the project. First, the project financed micro-projects investments.
These investments led to increases in income as a result of new or increased sales of pure
and mixed-breed livestock and livestock products, milk, crops and fish. Second, the
project invested resources in the water and livestock sectors (e.g., livestock restocking,
veterinary services and improved access to animal water sources). These investments
resulted in (counterfactual) gains in livestock wealth. As a consequence of the fact that
livelihoods in the project areas depend on livestock - both as a source of milk that is a
valuable nutrient and an important source of income, and in addition, as an instrument
that aids in mitigating income shocks – the (counterfactual) gains in livestock wealth are
most closely related to the project’s development objective.

3.       The project results framework as revised in the AF amendment did not include
any indicators on returns to micro-project investments, and therefore the ILRI IE did not
cover this subject. The ICR mission therefore conducted Cost-Benefit Analyses for 4
randomly selected micro-projects during its visits to the field in connection with the
stakeholder workshops. The micro-projects were selected from a roster of geo-referenced
project investments provided by the implementing agency. They include dairy breeding,
fishponds, water investments in sand dams and irrigation. In the aggregate, these
activities account for 65.5 percent of the total number micro-projects and 43.4 percent of
the value of investment in all micro-projects supported by ALRMP II.

4.   The discounted net benefit streams of the four micro-projects analyzed are
summarized in Table 3.1.

                 Table 1: Benefit Cost Ratio, ERRs and Net Present Value

     Fish ponds                 1.1                24.0                20.296 m
     Sand dams                  1.2                38.0                 2.491 m
     Irrigation                1.24                55.5                14.800 m




                                            61
5.      To arrive at an ERR for all micro-projects, the above returns were weighted in
proportion to overall project expenditures, yielding an estimated overall ERR on micro-
project investments of 37 percent. The mission assumed a discount rate of 15 percent,
and that project overheads and administrative costs were equivalent to 30 percent of the
costs of micro-investments.

6.      To evaluate gains in livestock wealth the ICR had access to historical weather
station rainfall estimates in Garissa. Figure 1 describes historical changes in livestock as
well as cumulative rainfall in Garissa.

Rainfall estimates represent a weighted average of the current year and two lagged years with weights
given as (0.4, 0.4, and 0.2). Missing months of rainfall are interpolated using a regression with monthly
dummies and values of non-missing months. From 1985 through 2009, 19 monthly observations were
missing (8 observations for 1999).

         8.      The period after 2005 was characterized by the most severe drought, yet had
         increases in livestock. Therefore this ICR makes the conservative assumption that, absent
         project interventions, livestock in Garissa would have fallen by 18 percent in 2005 and
         2008. This corresponds to the smallest declines in livestock across previous droughts.
         Figure 2 describes the counterfactual declines in livestock as a result of project
         investments in the livestock and water sectors.

9.     To be able to extrapolate effects in Garissa across all districts it is worth checking
whether other districts also witnessed decreases in rainfall and increases in livestock
during the project period. Figure 3 shows that most districts that received large
investments in the water and livestock sectors also experienced declines in rainfall and
increases in livestock.

10.      The ICR did not have access to data for prior drought years across all project
districts. However, based on data available during the project years, it is likely that
Garissa is broadly representative of other project districts on metrics related to changes in
precipitation and livestock. Therefore in order to estimate gains in livestock wealth the
ICR assumes (conservatively) that there was a 10 percent (counterfactual) increase in
livestock due to project investments and includes the value of those gains in estimating
the economic benefits that can be attributed to project investments. 18 The gains from

investments in the livestock and water sectors were estimated to have an ERR of 28.2
percent.

11.     Based on the analysis above, the ICR estimates the project’s overall Economic
Rate of Return to be 31.1 percent. This assumes that 20 percent of the funds were
misused and as a consequence the randomly sampled projects overestimate the total
project benefits. It is also worth examining the project returns under alternative scenarios
related to the fraction of funds misused. Table 3 below summarized the results of this
exercise.

12.     Therefore, the ICR concludes that the project was economically viable and the
costs incurred are justified, even under conservative assumptions.

                                  Activity 3: Water Investments – Sand Dams

     3.1         Assumptions

                 (i)   The discount rate is 15 percent;
                 (ii)  The revenues without the project are calculated based on the prevailing daily
                       wage (150 KES) from subsistence activities;
                 (iii) The opportunity cost of labor used was valued for the activity was valued at
                       the same rate;
                 (iv) Village marketers (typically women) received about 10 percent of gross
                       revenues through sales of fruits and vegetables produced as a result of the
                       activity.

        3.3     The total costs from the activity included ALRMP II investments, land rental
        costs, costs of labor as well as the costs of agricultural inputs.

        3.4   This project was economically viable. The Net Present Value was 2.491 million
        KES. The Benefit Costs ratio was 1.2. The Financial Rate of Return was 33.2 percent.



                                                   69
This was less than the Economic rate of Return of 38 percent because of positive
spillovers in the village (to the marketing agents).


                        Activity 4: Agricultural Investments – Irrigation

4.1      Assumptions

         (i)   The discount rate was 15 percent;
         (ii)  The subsistence income from a pastoral livelihood was assumed to be 3,000
               (KES) annually. This is based on information from interviews with
               beneficiaries;
         (iii) Given the proximity to a major town (i.e., Garissa) and the fact that some
               households had houses there, the opportunity cost of labor was valued a
               higher wage rate (5,000 KES p.a.).

4.2      There were 3 main sources of revenue – sale of bananas, mangoes and vegetables.

3/        In the Africa Region, Safeguards staff charge project codes when they are members of a team, but
all review work is charged to a central Internal Order mapped to the Operations Services Department, and
therefore staff time and costs are not reflected in this table. Also, as of FY10, Procurement and FM also
have their own Work Program Agreements and do not charge individual project codes, so the staff time and

             Annex 5.       Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.      The IL-ICR team conducted two separate rounds of stakeholder consultations,
both to obtain feedback and to validate the team’s preliminary findings. The first round
involved individual and focus group meetings with a wide range of development partners
at the national level, mostly those using the EWS, drought management and district
coordination institutional arrangements created/supported by ALRMP II. These
included: (i) UN agencies (WFP, UNDP, UNICEF, FAO, OCHA); (ii) bi-lateral donors
and NGOs (EU, ECHO, DANIDA, USAID/FEWSNET, OXFAM); and (iii) officials and
authorities in the Ministry for the Development of Northern Kenya & Other Arid Lands,
and the Ministry of State for Special Programs (Office of the President).

2.     The second round of consultations involved three field-level stakeholder
workshops held on September 23, 26 and 28, 2011 in the following project districts: Kitui
(semi-arid), Garissa (arid), and Tana River (arid).

3.       Participants were divided into groups according to whether they were community
beneficiaries, representatives of line/sector agencies, partner organizations, or ALRMP II
district level staff. In total, 148 people participated, of which slightly more than half
were beneficiaries, 22 percent were line/sector agency staff based in the districts, 12
percent partner organizations, and 14 percent district level staff of ALRMP II.
Beneficiaries were divided into several groups in each workshop, both to keep numbers


                                           75
manageable and to be able to cross check beneficiary views across groups that had not
had the opportunity to listen to each other’s discussions. In two districts there was a
sufficient number of line/sector agency representatives to be able to divide them also into
separate groups. Line/sector agencies represented included: Agriculture; County
Council; Education; Health; Horticultural Crops Development Authority; Land
Reclamation; Livestock; Veterinary Services; Security; Social Services; Water and
Irrigation; and Planning, National Development and Vision 2030. Partner organizations
represented included CARE Kenya, Constituency Development Fund, District Food for
Assets, Kenya Red Cross, UNDP, UNICEF, World Food Program, Women Concern,
Womankind Kenya, and EU.

4.       After introductory discussions with all participants, the groups worked in separate
break-out sessions, and then reported back to the plenary. They were asked to focus on a
common set of questions covering (i) their perceptions on the extent to which food aid
needs; (ii) response times had changed over the period between the last major drought
before ALRMP II had started (2000/01 drought year) and the last major drought while the
project was under implementation (2008/09 drought year – although many participants
also commented on their more recent experience with the still ongoing drought of 2011);
(iii) the effectiveness of institutional arrangements; (iv) ALRMP II’s impact on women;
(v) ALRMP II conflict resolution activities; (vi) changes in access/quality of services and
the role ALRMP II had played; and (vii) comments on any other subject they consider
relevant and lessons learned.

5.      The team also held discussions in situ with community members involved with
several randomly selected micro-projects in water, agriculture, livestock, education, and
health.

6.   The key feedback obtained from the two rounds of stakeholder’s consultations is
summarized below:

       (i)   UN agencies, international donors and NGOs. There was unanimity on:
             (i) the relevance of ALRMP II; (ii) the high level of confidence/trust in the
             information provided by the project EWS, which all of them use in their
             decision-making process in relation to drought and food aid matters; and
             (iii) the ALRMP II institutional set-up, in particular the district-level DSG
             structure. Before the creation of DSGs, each institution had been
             conducting drought management and relief activities independently, in an
             uncoordinated manner and in many instances with duplication. The DSGs
             have provided for: (i) knowledge sharing and a forum for joint discussion on
             specific needs at the local level; (ii) identification and clarification of the
             comparative advantage of the respective development partners; and (iii)
             harmonized and coordinated action on the ground. There was also
             agreement on the importance of the project contingency fund, which
             allowed for quick response in case of emergencies. These institutional
             arrangements resulted in increased efficiency, reducing the response time in
             drought emergencies, and had a positive impact in reducing the proportion



                                            76
       of people needing food aid and improving to access to basic services. The
       project was considered a best practice case that should be replicated in other
       African countries, and some agencies have already brought other country
       delegations to visit ALRMP II. The main concerns expressed by these
       partners related to: (i) IDA’s suspension of disbursements in the midst of a
       serious drought (given the leading role ALRMP plays in the ASALs, this
       also affected the work of other agencies); (ii) the uncertainty about a
       possible follow-up project to consolidate gains and ensure sustainability;
       and (iii) the need to create a National Drought Management Authority and a
       National Drought Contingency Fund.

(ii)   ALRMP II Management. High level of frustration continues among project
       staff and Ministry officials about: (i) IDA’s suspension of disbursement; (ii)
       the halt to the preparation of a new project; and (iii) the protracted INT
       investigation into allegations of fraud and corruption. The IL-ICR team was
       informed, both in Nairobi and in the field, about the negative impact these
       factors had on the way GoK was able to deal with the ongoing drought
       emergency in 2011. While the EWS and structures created by the project
       have continued to function and GoK has tried to maintain the staff, activities
       are taking place in a more limited way and this is having an impact on the
       ground in terms of how the drought is affecting people and livestock.

(iii) Communities and Other Civil Society Organizations. There was consistent
      feedback that the structures created by the project (especially the DSGs)
      were beneficial to communities, performed proactively in responding to
      drought and related emergencies, and provided access to other organizations
      for assistance and investments to which they had either no or only limited
      access in the past. Time response to drought emergencies had decreased
      (project field monitors reported for example on time taken to respond to
      water and child malnutrition issues) and there was better focus and
      transparency in food aid needed. Training and capacity building, and
      project investments in water, agriculture, livestock, education and health
      have improved incomes, resilience (through asset creation) and drought
      preparedness, thereby reducing the share of people needing food. The
      project has improved access to basic services, including health and nutrition
      and access to education, particularly for girls. The impacts on empowerment
      (and participation of women) and conflict resolution and prevention of
      violence have been very important. Concerns included: (i) the increasing
      frequency of droughts; (ii) the lack of adequate resources during the ongoing
      2011 drought; (iii) the need for continuation of IDA support; and (iv) the
      need for additional focus on IGA activities, health, education and women’s
      groups.

(iv) Line agencies and partner organizations. These agencies echoed the view
     that one of the most important contributions of ALRMP II was the
     institutional structure (particularly the DSGs) and the positive impact in



                                      77
helping to coordinate activities on the ground (by including in its structure
all key ministries, NGOs, international organizations), avoiding repetition,
providing access to communities, with preparatory identification of
investment needs and priorities. Capacity building, investments in water,
agriculture (better farming practices), livestock, and rapid response to
emergencies were the most commonly cited interventions of importance.
They also emphasized the importance of the contingency fund as an agile
instrument that allowed very fast action at district level (e.g., for activities
like water trucking). Asset building and drought preparedness and
knowledge had helped to reduce the share of people requiring food aide
(comparing the last major drought during the project implementation period,
i.e. 2009, with the last major drought before ALRMP II started, which was
in 2001). Women’s empowerment through capacity building, IGAs, their
roles in CDCs, gross reduction of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)
practices, and girl’s education were mentioned. Line ministry participants
stated that vaccination campaigns, and other complementary investments in
health and education helped their work very much and had important impact
on local populations. Creation of DPCs and cross border peace committees,
together with training and facilitated meetings among communities had
important impacts in reducing conflicts, particularly those related to access
to water and pastures. ALRMP II had proved that food relief can be reduced,
and communities can increase their level of self-sufficiency. Concerns
expressed included: (i) limited resources; (ii) the need for sustainability of
present institutional arrangements; (iii) the need for additional staff in line
agencies to supervise projects on the ground; and (iv) the need to expand
training of communities to ensure maintenance and sustainability of micro-
projects.

                  Annex 6.       Borrower's Comments on Draft IL-ICR19

       [The following comments were submitted to IDA by the
       Borrower’s Ministry of Finance on December 20, 2011.]



Arid Lands Resource Management Project Phase Two

1.      After perusing the Draft Implementation Completion and Results Report on the
Arid Lands Resource Management Project Phase Two Credit 3795 – KE released on the
5th December 2011, the view of the Kenya Government is that the Intensive Learning
Implementation Completion Report (IL-ICR) Team made independent observations that
are factual situation on the ground. For a Project of this magnitude to disburse 95 percent
of the US$ 120.0Million for the period between September 2003 and June 2010, with the
numerous challenges notwithstanding, this would be considered commendable. The IL-
ICR Team also observed on the Section under “Financial Management - Flow of Funds?
page 10 that – (quote): - “…the disbursement rate of the Project was one of the highest
in the Kenya portfolio.? The fact that the International Development Association (IDA)
provided AF to the Borrower to deepen and widen the scope of the Project following the
mid-term review, was in itself a show of trust in the capacity of the Government to
implement the Project towards delivery on the intended objective. The Government
counterpart funding was adequate and timely throughout the life of the Project phase.
This fact is attested by the IL-ICR Team’s observation that the ALRMP II was able to
achieve fully on four of the five Key Performance Indicators of the Project Development
Objective (PDO) and partially on the fifth KPI where the ALRMP II Team did its best to
participate in Policy formulation but had no influence on the pace of fast tracking
finalization of appropriate policies that would have enabled institutionalization of the
Drought Management Institutions by the Policy Makers.

2.     The creation of the Ministry of State for the Development of Northern Kenya and
Other Arid Lands by the coalition Government would however be considered a
culmination of the advocacy activities of all stakeholders in the Arid and Semi Arid
Lands (ASAL) including the Project on the need for the GoK to address the plight of the
marginalized communities of the ASALs in a sustainable way. The World Bank
conducted periodic review missions and provided necessary technical back stopping to
the Project Team. The Missions encouraged interaction between the Project Coordinating


19




                                            79
Unit (PCU) and Mission Consultants laden with diverse skills at the times of the Review
Missions as they assessed the performance of this project during the entire life of the
Project. The informal suspension (i.e. not processed through the Legal Department as per
OP/BP 13.40 as shown on Page 32 of the Draft report) cut approximately $5.7 million of
IDA financing and some $5.9 million of EU drought financing and had a depressing
impact on the final six months of the ALRMP II especially at a time the country was
going through a severe drought period. Despite this, leading Development partners
continued to express confidence in the ALRMP II institutional arrangements and
continued to provide funds to mitigate the full impact of the drought.

3.      The first phase of ALRMP had been in the forefront in piloting Community
Driven Development (CDD) in Kenya, and ALRMP II would continue this effort. The
changes in the Government focus towards decentralization offered opportunities for
ALRMP II to scale up the agenda that had been initiated under the first project, i.e.,
building capacity and empowering pastoralist and small farmer communities in the
ASALs to participate more actively in identifying and advocating for their own
development priorities – centered very much around reducing risks and vulnerability to
droughts. With the promulgation of the new constitution for this Country, the main focus
of attention is devolution of governance to the County level where the communities are
expected to have a greater say in development at the grass root level. Communities in the
Arid Districts that have had contact with the CDD Component of the Project have an
upper hand and are better placed to internalize this new direction and hence champion
faster development of their region, thanks to the support of the Bank.

4.      The observations on the overall performance of the ALRMP II by the IL-ICR
Team were well captured and articulated in the Draft IL-ICR Report. The fact that the
original PDO and certain KPIs had to be changed in 2006 is a clear indication of a
problem in the design of the Project during formulation. The IL-ICR Team observed that
the strategy for obtaining data for some of the KPIs was never clearly clarified in the
Project documents, a fact that was in itself a challenge to the Implementer to achieve
satisfactorily on the KPIs. After the PDO, the KPIs and nearly all the Intermediate
Outcome Indicators were amended, there was no deliberate effort on the part of the Bank
and the Borrower to re-align the M&E framework to address data collection strategies for
the new indicators and this was left to the interpretation of the implementer to design own
strategies. The Project Appraisal Document for the Additional Finances was also not
clear on which areas of the original PAD that needed to be retained and which needed to
be discarded. But despite this, the Implementing Team still continued to adhere to the
original PAD and generated data for all concerns of this PAD. The IL-ICR Team on
Section 2.3: “Monitoring and Evaluation, Design, Implementation and Utilization? and
under the section on “Implementation? paragraph on pg 10 emphasized this same
observation- (Quote: The absence of a clear analytical structure to guide data collection,
entry and analysis means, however, that much of the information on hand may be difficult
to reconcile/compare in a statistically robust manner). This observation is further
strengthened on Section 5.1 on “IDA performance? on the subsection highlighting the
shortcomings of the Project design and Section 6 part (ix) under Lessons Leant where it
is stated that “the Task Teams need stronger M&E specialist support and the



                                            80
recommendations made where the regional Bank units should have small groups of M&E
specialists with proven practical experience in design of simple measurable results and
risk frameworks and indicators?. The Government also acknowledges the observation
made by the IL-ICR team on page 23 on Conflict resolution. The design of the ALRMP
II highlighted the linkages between conflict management and natural resource
management, and built on a combination of customary and formal institutions. Peace
building and conflict management continued to take centre stage during implementation
of the NR & DM components due to resource competition. The Project committed
substantial resources to minimize conflicts, the success of which attracted other partners
like Oxfam and the UNDP. UNDP availed resources for the establishment offices in six
out of 11 arid districts and one at the Project Headquarters to strengthen Conflict
management activities and also partner with the National Committee on Peace Building
domiciled in the Office of the President.

5.      The Government acknowledges the IL-ICR Teams observations on Intermediate
outcome Indicators 12 to 16 on Page ix of the draft ICR Report. However, it is
worthwhile to note that the Pastoral Policy referred to in the indicator number 12 was
expanded from the Pastoral Policy to the “National Policy for the Sustainable
Development of Arid and Semi-Arid Lands of Kenya? which was also formulated but has
yet to be officially adopted. The Intermediate Outcome Indicator number 15 on the
Guidelines for emergency livestock off-take prepared and articulated in all project
Districts was not only successfully prepared but the result also uploaded into the website:
www.aridland.go.ke/sld/emergency-livestock-offtake.pdf for use by other stakeholders.

6.      Under the Section on the INT Review on page 16, the Government concurs with
the views of the IL-ICR Team where they observed that despite the INT investigations
having commenced on 2009, a preliminary written report was given by the INT in April
2011 with the same being published on the INT website on July 15th despite a GoK
request to allow the GoK until 15th August 2011 to comment. The GoK, IDA and other
partners expected there would be a follow-up project phase and substantial preparatory
work had been completed. But with the release of the INT preliminary report, the IDA
Management stopped further preparation of the follow-up Project leaving the GoK and
other Development Partners in limbo. The IL-ICR Team requested the PCU to organize
for a national level stakeholders and partners meeting with the IL-ICR Team as recorded
on Section 3.6 of the draft ICR Report on Page 28. The same IL-ICR Team requested for
a visit to Project Districts and a chance to hold workshops with various stakeholders at
the District Level. Having accompanied the IL-ICR Team to the field and witnessing a
random selection of project sites to be visited, the Government confirms the observations
made by the IL-ICR Team (See Annex 6 on Page 65).

7.     The main concerns raised by the UN Agencies, international and local NGOs
during their meeting with the IL-ICR Team related to (i) IDA’s suspension of
disbursement in the midst of a serious drought which affected the work of other
stakeholders; (ii) Uncertainty about a possible follow-up project to consolidate and
ensure sustainability of ALRMP II gains, and (iii) the need to create a National Drought
Management Authority to institutionalize National Drought Contingency Fund. While all



                                            81
these concerns raised were legitimate, the GoK wishes to report that despite the
suspension of funding to the Drought Management Structure in the Country by the IDA,
the GoK continued to sustain the structure and also pursue the Establishment of the
National Drought Management Authority. The President did authorize through a decree
the establishment of this Authority as per Section 3 of the Legal Notice Number 171 of
24th November 2011 under the State Corporations Act Cap 446, Laws of Kenya. The
NDMA is hence established and in place. On the other hand, the Sessional Paper for the
establishment of the NDCF has received necessary approval from the relevant
stakeholder Ministers and is awaiting approval from the Cabinet and subsequent
operationalization by the Ministry of Finance. It is hoped that with the establishment of
the NDMA, the approval for the establishment of the NDCF will be fast tracked, as the
use of NDCF happens to be a major component of the NDMA’s operations.

8.      The Government faults the observation made by the IL-ICR Team on the status of
the Intermediate Outcome Indicator number 11 on Page viii of the Draft ICR Report and
Page 47 Component 2 “Link to output/Intermediate Outcome Indicators?. While the
Indicator required that the Project Team would assist at least 1000 groups in developing
savings capacity through top-up savings grant, by the closure of the ALRMP II, the
Project Team in the CDD component had through 1588 events/transactions managed to
support 57,095 males and 83,790 females to undertake Income Generating Activities
through the top-up savings grants (Matching Grants). The CDD Component team was
able to disburse a total of Kshs 186,203,452 as matching grants from the Project while
the community groups contributed Kshs 99,086,648. Considering that some of these
groups qualified for two tranches of support having graduated from the first level of
funding, on the average the Project supported more than the proposed 1000 groups with
matching grants for income generating activities. The Indicator number 11 in our view
was hence over achieved.

9.      The IL-ICR Team’s observation on the Section under “Financial Management -
Flow of Funds? page 13 that disbursement to some community groups was made without
requisite community contribution being made as specified in the PAD, and that the PCU
advanced reasons of some communities being too poor to make the contribution; was
inaccurate. The only explanation offered by either the DCU or the PCU at any one point
may have been that contributions from communities were at times delayed due to
prevailing drought conditions or conflicts but never were the communities exempt from
making the contribution. This condition is clearly stipulated on Section 4.5.1 of the
Project Implementation Plan (PIP) under the section on “Implementation Modalities for
basic CDD?, page 69 and also Section 4.8.3 under the section on Community
Contribution and Sustainability of the PIP.

10.    While on the same subject above, it should be noted that, under “Accounting and
Financial Reporting? on page 15, the fact that IFRs did not indicate status of
accountability of funds once disbursed was also not accurate as IFRs are meant to detail
disbursement of funds made within a particular quarter and are hence exhaustive as per
the IFR design as they contain both technical and financial details for each station of
disbursement. The detailed support documents for these IFR are filed at the national



                                           82
office, as they would make the same too bulky for dissemination to the World Bank. It
should be noted that the arrangement for CDD in the second phase compared to the first
phase was to empower community members to take full control of managing
implementation of their micro projects. The responsibility of the Project was to transfer
funds to the CDC Account in tranches and demand for accountability of the same before
the community could qualify for a second tranche. The METs were expected to verify
the records and documents filed and maintained at the community level for Audit
purposes. The Government Accounting System does not provide for community
accounting documents to be part of GoK finance documentation. Parallel files on
community bank transactions were also maintained at the Drought Management Offices.
Part of the Kshs 340 million quoted by the joint IAD and INT report on Page 16 actually
contains bulk of the funds transferred to the communities as provided for in the PAD.

11.      The observation by the IL-ICR Team on Section 5.2 (b) on the Implementing
Agency or Agencies Performance that “the PCU could have detected earlier the need to
clarify decision-making responsibilities and accountabilities at community and district
level and ensuring adequate O&M arrangements? on page 35 of the Draft IL-ICR needs
to be clarified. The CDC as a management structure at the community level is highly
respected and recognized. This committee makes key decisions for the community and
part of their key responsibilities is undertaking expenditure and accountability both of
which are closely monitored by the Mobile Extension Teams (METs). The O&M
arrangements were the responsibilities of the community as part of their contribution to
facilitate the CDC subcommittees undertake assigned functions like floating of quotations
and/or transacting banking (Refer to Section 2.3.6 of the Project Implementation Plan on
the functions of the CDDC on Page 31).

12.      The observation made by the IL-ICR Team on Page 49 of the Draft report that the
Project Reporting formats did not enable one to see a regularly updated and
comprehensive list of maps of all CDD micro-projects arranged by community and
districts and by components is incorrect. The ALRMP II MIS database is able to sort out
the data by sector, component, year and even by activity all of which are geo-referenced.
The development of maps is generated from a different platform not directly linked to the
MIS though each activity is geo-referenced.

Government relationship with the Bank

13.     The Arid Lands Resource Management Project Phase Two (ALRMP II), a
community-based drought management Project of Kenya Government was the latest
stage in a nearly two-decades‟ long partnership between IDA and the Government
(GoK) to strengthen drought management and reduce vulnerability of pastoralists and
small-scale farmers in Kenya’s very poor and fragile arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs).
The partnership evolved from: (i) emergency support after a severe drought in the early
1990s (Emergency Drought Recovery Project, EDRP); to (ii) the development under the
first phase of ALRMP of a community-based drought early warning system (EWS) for
the arid districts; contingency planning at the district level; institutional and financial
arrangements to reduce response times and improve drought management; small



                                            83
investments to reduce livelihoods vulnerability; and finally (iii) to ALRMP II, which
aimed to continue working in the arid districts while extending parts of the program to
the semi-arid districts, enhance and substantially scale up the EWS and other institutional,
financial and inter-agency coordination arrangements, expand investments to improve
livelihoods, and intensify advocacy for a much stronger policy focus on the ASALs. One
of its most important functions has been to operate the drought management and early
warning system, a system, which, thanks to the Bank’s investment has gained
international support. The Bank has over time stated its satisfaction with the operations of
phases of the ALRMP. The Bank has also accepted the financial management reports of
the Project and rated its financial accounting and reporting as either “Highly Satisfactory?
or “Satisfactory? and confirmed its high regard for the competence of the PCU Team,
repeatedly referring to its exemplary performance.

14.     The World Bank’s approach through ALRMP was widely recognised as the
embodiment of good development practice in pastoral and marginalised areas – for
example in its commitment to long-term engagement, its integration of drought
management within project design, its multi-sectoral scope, and its championing of
community empowerment. It was the Bank which promoted the use of the Community
Driven Development (CDD) approach and it was the same Bank which encouraged the
Government to adapt its financial management systems so that direct disbursements
could be made to communities. The World Bank’s approach through ALRMP was
widely recognised as the embodiment of good development practice in pastoral and
marginalised areas – for example in its commitment to long-term engagement, its
integration of drought management within project design, its multi-sectoral scope, and its
championing of community empowerment. It was the Bank that promoted the use of the
Community Driven Development (CDD) approach and it was the same Bank which
encouraged the Government to adapt its financial management systems so that direct
disbursements could be made to communities. In deciding to finance ALRMP, the Bank
was not blind to the challenges it would face. The Project Appraisal Document for
ALRMP II, prepared in 2003, acknowledged the risks of operating in the kind of
environment that characterises Kenya’s arid lands, but concluded (rightly) that the risks
of inaction were even greater.

15.     In assessing Quality of Supervision by IDA, the IL-ICR team took into account
not only performance by the task team, but also IDA management, and other parts of the
Bank Group that had an impact on IDA’s overall oversight of ALRMP II. The IL-ICR
team found that supervision by the task team was satisfactory in many respects. (i) The
skill range of the team was quite strong, considering not only the core members, but also
IDA consultants and FAO staff. (ii) There was a good mix of Headquarters and Country
Office-based staff, and considerable continuity of team members. (iii) Supervision
missions took place regularly at roughly six-month intervals. ISRs and aide memoires
were timely and informative. It therefore is extremely suspect to witness one out of 16
bank rating of the performance of the Project as “Moderately Unsatisfactory? while all
others were rated “Satisfactory?.




                                            84
16.     The Government convened a series of workshops for Permanent Secretaries that
culminated in the identification of various categories of risks in their day-to-day activities
and development of Risk Management Frameworks at the Ministry level. This was in
line with the Bank requirement on governance and accountability. The Project on the
other hand engaged a Consulting Firm to assist in the development of a risk framework as
well as a risk register. The AF PAD also stressed the need for transparency and
accountability that triggered the need for all micro projects being branded with the
establishment of notice boards at the Drought Management Offices on which the annual
work plans and budgets as well as progress reports were posted. The Government also
introduced the use of “Anti-corruption? boxes, “Suggestion? boxes as well as “Complaint?
boxes, which were checked periodically. Towards the end of the ALRMP II, the Project
team using key lessons from implementation of the Project phase developed a
comprehensive Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP), which they shared
with the Bank. These initiatives were all measures aimed at reducing the possibility of
fraud and corruption. There is no doubt that corruption remains a major development
challenge world over. However when fraud and corruption is suspected or alleged within
a Project/Programme, there is no question that the Bank and Borrower need to act quickly
and decisively to investigate and take appropriate measures in a professional manner.

17.     The forensic audit of ALRMP II started in April 2009. One of the guiding
principles of the World Bank is that of ‘working in partnership’ with the Borrower. In its
conduct and management of this audit, the Bank failed to live up to this principle of
partnership, on several counts. First, it failed to keep the Government of Kenya
adequately informed. Both the informal suspension of ALRMP II and the decision to
suspend planning for a new programme to replace it were taken unilaterally and
communicated verbally. Nothing was ever given in writing to substantiate the original
(and subsequently disproved) percentage of suspected fraudulent expenditure, which was
the trigger for the project’s suspension. Second, the Bank has shown a lack of
transparency. Between October 2009 and March 2011 (i.e. throughout the audit period)
officers from the Government and from three other development partners, as well as
representatives of stakeholders, participated in good faith in a series of six design
missions for a new joint arid lands programme. Even in February 2011, the Bank was
still expressing its support for the programme. This support was abruptly withdrawn in
May 2011. Third, the Bank reneged on an agreement with the Government of Kenya. On
13 June 2011 the Vice Presidents for Africa and for INT and the Prime Minister of Kenya
agreed on a process for establishing ineligible expenditure and for managing
communication of the same. The Bank failed to honour this by prematurely publishing
the INT report on its website without the benefit of a detailed response to the allegations
– a response which the Government was unable to provide because INT did not make key
documents available. Once allegations are in the public domain, it is hard to recover
from the reputational damage caused. Fourth, the Bank has abused the trust and goodwill
shown by the Government of Kenya. Its stated approach is ‘to constructively support
those in government who are making a good-faith effort to bring change to Kenya via the
fight against corruption’. The Ministry on the other hand repeatedly expressed its
willingness to cooperate with INT and to act on any evidence of corrupt practice. The
management of the original allegations and of the audit itself by the Bank has not only



                                             85
been damaging to the reputation of the World Bank but also to the reputation of the
Government of Kenya, and, above all, to poor people in a vulnerable part of Kenya. It
has contravened the Bank’s own values and principles. The most important of these
principles is essentially ‘don’t make the poor pay twice’. In this case the informal
suspension of the project and the immediate resultant effect on these poor communities.
In our opinion, the performance of INT throughout the audit has been very poor. At the
most basic level, the audit has taken far longer than the Bank’s target of one year for most
investigations and 18 months for complex cases. INT officers have demonstrated
significant shortcomings – for example, in failing to brief themselves about Government
procedures and about the Bank’s own disbursement procedures; in failing to verify
allegations which have been easily disproved by IAD; and in failing to ask for documents
which might have assisted them in their investigation. Had INT’s officers engaged
appropriately with project staff (or with IAD) rather than presuming their guilt and
keeping them at arms-length, many problems could have been avoided. There is
obviously huge pressure on INT (and on our own IAD) to demonstrate results in the fight
against corruption. Even so, it is still important that conduct is above-board and
professional at all times.

18.     In conclusion, all effort should be made by the Bank through INT and the
Regional Bank Offices to assure that Projects do not go into an indeterminate status of
informal suspension. Informal suspensions do not allow for careful review by the Legal
Department of evidence justifying the remedy; there is no formal communication to a
Borrower detailing the reasons for suspension and what, if any, actions can be taken to
correct the situation; the Board and co-financiers are not formally advised; the Bank does
not hold itself to any clear timetable for follow-up; and the process generally lacks the
transparency that should accompany such serious actions. Future designs of Projects
should factor among the possible risks that may stall project implementation, the “INT?
entity as has been witnessed by the ALRMP II.

       [The following comments were submitted to IDA by the
       Delegation of the European Union to Kenya on December 15, 2011.]



1.      The EU Delegation to Kenya agrees on the important leadership role that has been
provided by ALRMP in the development of the Kenya ASAL areas during the past
decade. We also note the impressive progress registered during its activity period, in
particular in the fields of drought preparedness and systems for early warning systems.

2.     The EU Delegation also share the findings on the strong negative impact that the
suspension of the IDA funding and the consequent interruption of support from IDA to
sustain and scale up the previous results in a new joint programme with several
development partners. That this happened at a time when the Kenya ASAL faced a very
severe drought compounded this negative outcome.

3.      The EU Delegation agrees that following this withdrawal, the implementation of
the EU assistance in ASAL was negatively affected, in particular the disbursement of the
EU contingency fund (under 9th EDF) delivered through the World Bank but also the
setting up of the contingency fund planned on the Kenya Rural Development Programme
(under 10th EDF). In addition, the foreseen jointly financed basket fund that was
supposed to improve the coordination between the main stakeholders in contingency
funding remains a key issue in the efficiency of the emergency response to droughts.

4.     The EU Delegation to Kenya would however like to highlight that the EU
continues its institutional support to the Ministry of Development of Northern Kenya and
other Arid Lands, although with a strong reduction in the scope of the activities funded
and focusing on absolute priorities. This reduction was decided in order to limit the
possible fiduciary risks related to the management at community level, pending the final
outcomes of the ongoing INT investigations. This continuity makes EU able to
accompany the current setting up of the National Drought Management Authority
(NDMA), following the signature on 17/11/2011 by the President of the Republic of
Kenya of the executive order to establish the NDMA. This is a major achievement in the
process of Government of Kenya co-ordination efforts and its ownership of the drought
response initiatives.

5.      The EU Delegation believes that this momentum is a very good opportunity to
strengthen the partnership between the Government and the development partners and to
improve the coordination between the development partners. In the light of this, the EU
Delegation will be open to a renewed partnership with the WB on the drought
management activities in Kenya. This renewed cooperation will of course have to take
into account the final conclusions taken by the World Bank on the basis of the INT report
as far as their part is concerned as well as taking into account the recommendations and
conclusions given.
