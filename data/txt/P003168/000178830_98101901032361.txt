PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAMBIA - THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ZAMBIA (DBZ)
(Loan 1210-ZA)
PREFACE
This report presents an evaluation of the achievements
under Loan 1210-ZA to the Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ), a develop-
ment bank owned by the Government, several public institutions, and
various foreign banks and international institutions, including IFC.
Loan 1210-ZA for US$15 million, was appraised in March 1975, approved
and signed in February 1976 and became effective in April 1976.
The Loan was closed as of October 14, 1982. A second loan (1923-
ZA) for US$15 million was appraised in November 1979, approved
in December 1980 and became effective in May 1981.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the
Bank's Eastern Africa Regional Office following a country visit in
September 1981, at the same time as the appraisal of DBZ for a third
line of credit. The PCR also draws on the staff Appraisal and
President's Reports, the loan documents and the project files.
The report presents a factual review of DBZ's use of the proceeds
of the loan and of its institutional development over the last six
years. Comments received from the Borrower were taken into account
in finalizing the report and are reproduced in Attachment 1.
The assistance and kind cooperation received from
Government, DBZ and other officials during the project completion
mission is greatly appreciated.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAMBIA - THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ZAMBIA (DBZ)
(Loan 1210-ZA)
HIGHLIGHTS
The main objectives of the World Bank assistance to DBZ were
to help establish the new institution as a viable and sound develop-
ment finance company and to provide loan and equity financing for
economically, financially and technically sound medium and large-scale
projects in industry, agricultural production and processing,
and tourism. After a slow and difficult start, due largely to the
economic situation that was prevailing in Zambia at the time it was
launched, DBZ succeeded in increasing its contribution to the develop-
ment of productive sectors in Zambia by providing term financing totalling
K93.2 million for projects with a total investment cost of K562.6 million
(para. 2.05). At the same time, DBZ has become a financially mature
institution. Furthermore, while at the beginning there was a large pro-
portion of expatriate staff in managerial positions, the situation has now
been changed and practically all managerial positions are held by Zambians;
DBZ has succeeded in hiring and training a cadre of Zambian professional
staff of good quality; it has also developed a sound and consistent set
of operating policies and procedures (para. 3.02). Overall, DBZ is now
a sound and well managed institution.
In some other respects, however, DBZ's performance has not been
as satisfactory. For instance, despite the seriousness of the unemployment
situation in Zambia, it did not place sufficient emphasis on the employment
creation aspect of projects it financed as illustrated by the fact that
since 1976, the total investment cost per job created has averaged
US$36,000 at 1981 prices and has increased over time (para. 2.08).
Similarly, DBZ could have been more active in supporting projects
that were based mainly on domestic resources or that were export-oriented.
In manufacturing, up to about 50% of DBZ's lending is estimated to have
been for projects using mainly imported inputs and this proportion has not
significantly varied through time (para. 2.06).
Other points of interest are:
- Failure of the Industrial Development Act to stimulate
investment (para. 2.03).
- Efforts by the World Bank to assist enterprises facing
shortage of imported inputs (para. 2.07).
- DBZ's ability to maintain a large degree of autonomy
in its investment decisions (para. 3.05).
- DBZ's effort and relative success in resource
mobilization (para. 4.06).












PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAMBIA: THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ZAMBIA (DBZ)
(Loan 1210-ZA)
I. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND HISTORY
1.01      Background. At the request of the Government, a Bank mission
visited Zambia in November 1971 to inquire into the possibility of
setting up a development bank in Zambia and to outline the basis on
which such a bank could be established. The mission concluded that
none of the existing financial institutions was able to make a careful
screening of new investment proposals by a proper assessment of their
technical, economic and financial merits and viability. Although in
the parastatal sector INDECO was playing a role in the promotion of
new projects by commissioning project studies, there was a need for an
institution distinct from INDECO to supplement its efforts and
objectively appraise and follow-up projects. The mission therefore
recommended the creation of a development bank to fulfil the main
functions of mobilisation of resources and promotion and financing of
viable projects. In November 1972, a second Bank mission visited
Zambia to advise the Government on the organization, staffing and
other matters relevant to the establishment of the proposed
development bank.
1.02      The development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) was established by an
Act of Parliament in December 1972, with 60% of its authorized capital
reserved for the Government and Government-controlled financial
institutions, and with the main objective to provide medium and
long-term loan and equity financing to projects in industry,
construction, transport, power, tourism, mining and large-scale
agriculture. DBZ -started operations in January 1974, and was granted
a Bank loan of US$15 million and' an IFC equity invesment of K350,000
in 1976, and a second Bank loan of US$15 million in 1980. A third
Bank loan was appraised in September 1981. Since 1976, IFC has held a
seat on DBZ's Board on rotation for one year in every two years, and
the Bank has sent full supervision or appraisal missions to DBZ at a
rate of one mission per year.
1.03      Loan 1210-ZA.   As quoted from the appraisal report
(860a-ZA), the major objectives of the first Bank loan and the IFC
investment were:"(i) to provide appropriate medium and long term
financing to medium to large scale industrial projects which meet
sound economic, financial, and technical standards. This is
particularly important in view of the country's growing scarcity of
funds for industrial investments and the fact that DBZ is essentially
the only financial institution in Zambia providing medium and long
term financing to private industry; and (ii) to assist in the
development of DBZ as an effective development institution by further
strengthening its appraisal capacity". The particular conditions of
the World Bank loan were as follows:    (i) DBZ would not charge
interest rates below 9% without consulting the Bank; (ii) DBZ would



- 2 -
calculate the economic rate of return for larger import-substitution
projects; and (iii) DBZ would adhere to an agreed Policy Statement
complementing its Act. The Policy Statement gave equal priority to
parastatal and private projects; emphasised operations in
manufacturing, tourism and large-scale commercial agriculture; and
required DBZ to observe various standard investment limits, and to
pass on foreign exchange risks to its subborrowers or the Government.
The first Bank loan was appraised in March 1975 (Report 860a-ZA),
approved and signed in February 1976, and became effective in April
1976. Although the loan was utilised very slowly until 1979, it
was 98% committed and 95% disbursed as of February 28, 1982.
1.04      Loan 1923-ZA.   The main objective of the second Bank loan
was to "assist in the development of the industrial, agro-industrial
and agricultural sectors" with emphasis on priority enterprises that
"contribute significantly to employment creation or use mostly local
raw materials and are likely to be foreign exchange savers" (Appraisal
Report 3202-ZA). Particular loan conditions were that: (i) DBZ
onlends Bank funds at a minimum interest rate of 12%, and reviews
annually its interest rate structure to keep it positive in real
terms;   (ii) DBZ calculates the economic rate of return for larger
projects; and (iii) DBZ implements an agreed project supervision
manual. Prior to Board presentation DBZ was also requested to adopt
an agreed medium-term strategy statement which placed priority on
projects based on local raw materials, export oriented or labour-
intensive projects, in agriculture, agro-industry, transport,
engineering and construction; and required DBZ to create a unit to
assist small-scale enterprises. The loan was appraised in November
1979, approved in October 1980, and became effective on May 1, 1981.
It was almost fully committed by the end July 1981 and 68% disbursed
on February 28, 1982.

II. DBZ's ROLE IN ITS ENVIRONMENT
2.01      Past Developments in Manufacturing.    Manufacturing industry
developed rapidly after independence. From a low base of only 7% of
GDP in 1964 it grew at an average rate of 10% p.a. until 1974, more
than four times the growth rate of the whole economy. It benefited
from a rapid increase in demand for industrial goods, a protected
market, and adequate supplies of imported inputs. From 1975 onwards
Zambia entered a long recession, caused by declining copper prices;
serious transport problems resulting from the closure of the Rhodesian
border in 1973; the energy crisis. Manufacturing activity, which is
heavily dependent on imported inputs, and absorbs 30-40% of total
visible imports, was severely affected by these constraints. Output
fell by 20% between 1974 and 1977 and, after a slight recovery in
1978, has stagnated since then. Capacity utilization has gradually
declined and by 1981 many firms were working well below 50% of their
capacity.
2.02      An important feature of the Zambian economy is the role of
the public sector. On the grounds that foreign control was excessive
and investment insufficient after independence, the Government
expanded its ownership and took a controlling interest in many large
manufacturing and commercial enterprises in 1968, in the two mining
companies in 1969, and in the major financial institutions except
three commercial banks in 1971. It is estimated that currently 50-60%
of manufacturing output is generated in the public sector.     The Third
National Development Plan (1979-83) retained most of the objectives of
the Second Plan (1972-76). With regard to manufacturing these
include: (i) the promotion of rural and small-scale enterprises;
(ii) the establishment of linkages with the agriculture and mining
sectors; (iii) the encouragement of exports; and (iv) increasing
capacity utilization. To ensure that these objectives are achieved,
the Third Plan in particular stressed the need for the Government to
undertake a large share of total manufacturing investment. However,
apart from providing a statement of the Governments's objectives and
intentions, the Third Plan has been of limited significance, since the
economic depression and in particular the foreign exchange shortage
necessitated a sharp curtailment of the investment plans.
2.03       Policies.  In October 1977, the Industrial Development Act
was published. It set out to: (a) encourage private investment in
manufacturing from foreign as well as local sources;      (b) promote
exports of manufactures; (c) control the establishment of new or
expansion of existing enterprises. The last objective, which has so
far been the most significant aspect of the Act, requires the
Government to review all applications for industrial licences in order
to prevent the creation of over capacity and to ensure that projects
are well conceived. The Act has had little impact on investment and



- 4 -
exports, mainly because the incentives have been insufficiently
attractive and the criteria for qualification too vague. Other ways
in which Government influences manufacturing operations is through
import licensing and price control. Import licences are issued every
six months to individual enterprises. They generally fall well short
of requirements which has been the immediate cause of serious
underutilization of capacity and delayed maintenance of plant and
equipment. Priority allocations are made to producers of (a)
essential commodities (e.g. food, soap, cooking oil); (b) inputs for
agriculture; (c) inputs for the mining industry; and (d) goods for
exports. However, even many of these industries have been forced to
reduce output levels. In view of the stringent direct controls over
imports, tariffs have played a minor role as a protective instrument.
Nevertheless, the tariff system, characterized by high duties on
luxury consumer goods and low or zero rates on intermediate and
capital goods, has tended to encourage activities that rely heavily on
imports, and may have contributed to the growing capital intensity of
manufacturing.
2.04      All parastatal enterprises experience a form of price
restraint as their prices require approval by INDECO and the Ministry
of Commerce and industry. Apart from that, some thirty commodities
are subject to formal price control, including twelve "essential"
commodities, the prices of which require cabinet approval.
Particularly in the case of parastatal producing the "essential"
goods, low prices, which fail to provide for an adequate return, have
contributed to the losses of these firms. The Government has recently
accepted the principle of economic pricing, and parastatals have in
some cases been allowed to set prices which better reflect costs.
2.05       DBZ's role.  DBZ has succeeded in rapidly increasing its
contribution to the development of the economy. Between 1976 and June
19.81, it provided term financing totalling K93.2 million for 200
projects with a total investment cost of K562.6 million (US$647
million). Of these 116 (58%) were for the expansion of existing
enterprises and 84 (42%) for financing the creation of new ventures.
These investments resulted in the creation of about 13,000 new jobs.

In line with the objective of the first Bank loan (para. 1.02), DBZ
has extended a major share of its financing to private Zambian-owned
enterprises which account for 70% of DBZ's total loan approvals since
inception. Officials in the Government and the financial and
industrial community widely acknowledge DBZ's growing and pooitive
role in the provision of term finance and in the dissemination of more
rigorous investment appraisal standards.
Selected Issues
2.06      The Foreign Exchange Shortage.    The decline in copper prices
started in 1970, and continued until 1980. Through 1971-80, Zambia's
balance of payments' deficit averaged K140 million per year or 19% of
exports and peaked at 85% of exports in 1975 and 38% in 1980.
Shortages of imported industrial inputs started in 1975 and have
become acute since early 1978. However, DBZ has been slow in placing
increased priority on investments in local resource-based or
export-oriented projects. During 1974-1980, DBZ has directed most of
its lending amount (68%) to manufacturing projects, and its relative
contribution to agriculture i15%) has not increased through time
(Annex 2).   In manufacturing_/ up to about 50% of DBZ's lending is
estimated to have been for projects using mainly imported inputs and
this proportion has not significantly varied through time. These
projects have been operating at 30-60% of production capacity because
of limited foreign exchange allocations. DBZ's staff could     report no
cases where DBZ rejected a project because of its dependency on
imported inputs and quoted only 3 approved projects for which DBZ
supported changes in design leading to minor savings in imported
inputs2/. This performance is disappointing considering that DBZ has
1/    Including farm-based agro-processing activities.
2/ a) DBZ tried to convince Twinkle Shoes to use local leather from
Bata but no commitment was obtained and the final outcome is
uncertain.
b) DBZ urged Mulungushi Lodges to increase its room capacity (as
against the restaurant's), but finally rejected the project for
other reasons.
c) DBZ convinced Sunquick Bottlers to make a minor increase in the
use of local citrus as against imported concentrate.

had constantly in 1978-81 a large pipeline of project applications from
which to choose 3/.
2.07      In addition, DBZ has not been very active in anticipating
shortages of imported inputs and in taking appropriate measures, although
it must be recognized that DBZ did not have the capability of influencing
the foreign exchange availability in Zambia. DBZ first requested the Bank
to finance the foreign exchange component of working capital requirements
in April 1977, and repeated its requests in 1978 when it specified that
the need was for total imported working capital for two years and not
initial working capital. In July 1978, the Bank agreed, on an emergency
basis, to provide such financing as needed to bring the capacity utilisation
of priority enterprises to 10% above cash break-even levels. Under this
agreement, DBZ later requested subloans totalling US$2.1 million for only
two enterprises manufacturing bed linen and plastic bags, which were autho-
rized under the first Bank loan in 1979 4/. The Bank appraisal mission in
November 1979 recognized the severity of imported input shortages and
prepared in detail a revolving fund for working capital financing as a
component of the proposed second loan. At negotiations in September 1980,
DBZ requested the Bank to cancel the component on the grounds that its
client enterprises importing raw materials were currently operating
profitably following an improvement in the 1979 balance of payments. In
1981, however, many enterprises in DBZ's portfolio were again suffering
from severe shortages of imported inputs.
2.08      Employment and Small Industries.   As compared to other African
countries, unemployment and underemployment are particularly acute in
Zambia, with only one quarter of the labor force in paid employment and
a persistent high rate of rural-urban migration averaging 125,000 people
per annum. However, the capital-intensity of industrial investments has
remained relatively high mainly due to high transport costs, biases
in the incentive system and the general preference of the parastatals
sector for large-scale "modern" production techniques 5/. In that context,
DBZ does not seem to have placed sufficient emphasis on the employment
3/  DBZ's management does not agree with the gist of the argument presented
in this paragraph that DBZ has not done sufficient effort to finance
projects that were mainly based on domestic inputs. It believes,
on the contrary that DBZ "has encouraged whenever possible the utiliza-
tion of local raw materials in import substitution projects" (see
Attachment 1, page 4).
4/  This financing probably helped the linen   manufacturer to avoid major
work stoppages and losses, but the other enterprise received increased
foreign exchange allocations from the Government in 1980 and seemed
to have considerable inventories in 1981.
5/  In 1979, fixed assets per employee in the public industrial sector
averaged as high as US$23,000, even though at historical costs and
net of depreciation.

creation aspect of projects it financed. Among the new 6/ projects
approved by DBZ since 1976 7/, the total investment cost per job created
has averaged US$36,000 at 1981 prices, and has increased through time.
2.09      IBZ might have achieved a higher employment contribution by
assisting the small-scale enterprises (SSE) sector despite the higher
risks and expenses involved. In its first appraisal in 1975, the Bank
recommended that DBZ should not engaged in this activity until it was
better established. In the second appraisal in 1979, Bank staff and
consultants noted a lack of financial assistance for SSEs in the
country, and prepared in detail a loan component for SSE financing
through DBZ and commercial banks. However, the Government was not
prepared to assume the related foreign exchange risk, presumably for
budgetary reasons, unless IBRD agreed to finance the component on IDA
terms; and the component was eventually cancelled. In 1981, DBZ was
successfully mobilising soft-term funding from bilateral donors to
launch an SSE financing programme.
2.10       Interest Rates.  DBZ has charged interest rates ranging from
9% to 10% in 1974-75, which were increased to 12% - 12.5% in
1980-818/. In addition DBZ's clients assumed the foreign exchange
risk. fn relation to the international inflation rate during that
period, which varied between 8% and 12%, DBZ's lending rate was
positive in real terms. However although consistent with the overall
interest rate structure in Zambia, DBZ's lending rates were
significantly below local inflation during the years 1976-78 when
local price increases9/ averaged about 18% per annum. In 1980, DBZ's
lending rates were again positive in real terms as compared to the
local price inflation estimated at 10-11%.

III.   INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PERFORMANCE
3.01      From the Bank appraisal in 1975 to 1981, DBZ has rapidly
developed its organisation from four to eight departments including a
new legal department and separate departments for industrial
appraisal, agriculture appraisal and project supervision.
Professional staff has increased by about 9% per year from 30 to 50,
with a roughly constant proportion of 30% of expatriates mostly funded
from bilateral grants. However, expatriates have been shifted to
advisory positions, and Zambians now man eight out of the ten top and
middle management positions, as compared to two out of six in 1975.
DBZ has been running an active staff development programme which
provided training abroad for more than 60% of its professional staff.
Although salary increases were constrained by Government directives
for parastatals and averaged only 7% per annum, voluntary staff
departures have remained limited at a rate of about 9% per year, and
DBZ has been able to build up a Zambian professional staff of good
quality.
3.02      DBZ has developed a sound and consistent set of operating
policies and procedures. In particular, it has repeatedly upgraded
its investment policies and project appraisal procedures in close
consultation with the Bank. With the building-up of its staff
capabilities, it has been able to correct earlier deficiencies in the
appraisal of project management, technical aspects and debt servicing
capacity. In reviewing subprojects submitted by DBZ, Bank staff
generally acknowledged the good quality of DBZ's appraisal reports,
and seldom raised questions before approving subprojectsl0/. In
1979, DBZ issued an improved appraisal manual providing comprehensive
guidance to its staff. Overall the objective of the first loan to
further strengthen DBZ's appraisal capacity (para. 1.03) thus appears
to have been substantially achieved. In addition, DBZ prepared in
1980 a comprehensive supervision plan and procedure manual which was
reviewed during the second loan negotiations and found to be
satisfactory. DBZ has sound and comprehensive accounting and
financial management systems and uses appropriate procurement and
disbursement procedures.
3.03      DBZ and the Bank Group have generally maintained a
constructive dialogue throughout this period of rapid development of
DBZ. DBZ and Government officials have expressed appreciation for the
technical assistance provided by Bank staff and the IFC Director,
particularly in the rigorous review of investment proposals and in the
development of DBZ's project appraisal and supervision procedures.

-9-
Selected Issues
3.04      Single Project Exposure Limit.   A provision of DBZ's Policy
Statement agreed in 1975 expressed the upper limit on DBZ's financing
for a single project as a proportion of 75% of the enterprise's fixed
assets. This has resulted in DBZ's financing up to 100% of total
project costs in the case of some 15 expansion projects sponsored by
existing enterprises with large fixed assets, and the provision had
significantly advantaged expansion projects as opposed to new
enterprises. The appraisal mission of the second loan, in 1979,
recommended that the clause be changed so that DBZ would not normally
finance more than 75% of any single project's total capital cost,
including permanent working capital. During negotiations in 1980, DBZ
agreed to revise its policy accordingly.
3.05      DBZ's Independence.   DBZ's 1972 Act empowers the Minister of
Finance to give policy directives to its Board, nominate six of the
ten Directors and approve the terms of employment of DBZ's staff.
During the first loan appraisal, although the Bank expressed concern
regarding these formal constraints on DBZ's autonomy, it recognized
that the "Government was keen to have DBZ operate independently and
had not interfered in DBZ's operations." DBZ has generally been free
from specific Government directives 11/, and has in particular
rejected several parastatal project proposals promoted by the
Government. In a few isolated cases, however, DBZ appears to have
been lenient in the approval of parastatal projects. Overall however
DBZ has been able to maintain a large degree of autonomy in its
investment decisions and the management of its operations. This is
reflected in the decreasing share of DBZ's total financing for
Government-controlled enterprises, from an average of 56% during
1974-1978 down to 18% during 1979-1981.
IV. FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      Operations. As of June 30, 1981, DBZ had approved 200 loans
totalling K93.2 million of which 45% had been disbursed, and 11 equity
investments totalling K1.3 million. DBZ's approvals have stagnated in
the first three years and thereafter accelerated sharply until 1981
(Annex 1 Page 1). On average, through FY1975-81, DBZ's approvals have
increased at a rate of 34% per year in current terms, which compares
well with the rate 6f 27% forecasted by the Bank in the first loan
appraisal. However, DBZ's disbursements have lagged considerably
11/ In 1976, however, the Finance Ministry instructed DBZ and other
financial institutions to make no loans to enterprises without
worker participation, but his instruction soon became obsolete.



- 10 -
behind approvals, and averaged only 42% of the optimistic Bank
forecasts during FY76-FY801/.   Aside from the general economic
uncertainties, these slow disbursements resulted largely from delays
in finalising collateral arrangements and obtaining clients'
contributions. During 1979-80, DBZ has set up its own legal
department for finalizing security arrangements before project
approvals and expediting pending legal matters, and has introduced
improved checks on clients' financial capabilities. In FY80-81,
disbursements had finally started to increase, at a rapid rate of 78%
per year. Overall DBZ has made a remarkable performance in achieving
a rather rapid growth in operations at times of economic
difficulties, while maintaining satisfactory project processing
capability.
4.02      Characteristics of DBZ's loans are summarised in Annex 2 and
a random sample of 20 projects is analyzed in more detail in Annex 3.
DBZ's loans have ranged from K27,000 to K4 million, averaged K470,000
per project and 17% of total costs of projects. The total costs of
the projects financed have ranged from K43,000 to K40 million and
averaged K2.8 million. Over three quarters of the loans approved
carried interest rates of 11.5% to 12.5% and maturities of 5-10
years. DBZ's lending has generally been consistent with the general
investment pattern in Zambia. Up to 68% of total lending was for
manufacturing projects mostly in the food, textiles, chemicals and
metal sectors prevalent in Zambia; 15% was for agriculture and the
remainder for transport, mining and tourism. Most of the 100
manufacturing projects were solely geared to import substitution, and
only five were reported to have some export potential (e.g.
cigarettes, sugar, batteries, poultry meat and lawn mowers). About
70% of loan amounts were concentrated in projects located in Lusaka
and Copperbelt Provinces.
4.03      Portfolio.   Overall, DBZ's portfolio is of acceptable
quality, although it contains many projects dependent on a continued
supply of imported inputs and a few large parastatal projects with
insufficient equity basis (para. 3.05). As of June 30, 1981, DBZ's
portfolio totalled K43 million with 98.2% in loans and 1.8% in equity
investments. Loan arrears of more than 3 months amounted to K409,000
and affected 27 loans accounting for 9% of total loans outstandings,
which is not excessive considering the economic situation. Losses on
loans are unlikely as DBZ has applied a prudent policy in requiring
securities equivalent to 125% of its loan amounts.
Financial Condition
4.04      Financial Position.   As shown in Annex 1 (Page 2), DBZ's
total asssets grew during FY1976-81 at a rapid rate of 26% per year,
although slower than forecasted by the Bank because of the lag in
disbursements (para. 4.01). Despite this rapid growth, DBZ has
constantly kept a strong financial position, mostly due to its large
12/ Based on the assumption that loans would be fully disbursed on
average within 15 months of approval dates.






- 11 -
equity funding and sound financial management. As of March 31, 1981,
DBZ had a low long-term debt to equity ratio of 1.0 and a high current
ratio of 2.3.
4.05       Profitability.  DBZ's profit is exempt from tax and has
increased by47%per year since FY76 to reach K1.6 million in FY81
(Annex 1, page 3). This profit represented about 6% of average total
assets in FY81 and 11% of average equity, and DBZ profitability thus
appeared acceptable, although still moderate when compared to local
inflation. Actually, DBZ's profitability has been consistently higher
than the appraisal forecasts, mostly because DBZ has gradually
increased its lending rates, and has made no provisions for losses
until 1981 (following its auditors' recommendations) in view of the
high security coverage on its loan portfolio (para. 4.03).
4.06      Resource Mobilisation.    In spite of a difficult economic
situation, DBZ has achieved an effective resource mobilisation to
support its growth, although it has occasionally been short of
resources for lack of planning. As of September 31, 1981, DBZ had
collected total foreign exchange resources of K38 million including
the two World Bank loans (61%) and loans from ADB, EIB and DEG. In
addition to its ordinary share capital and retained earnings, it had
raised total domestic resources of K23 million from local commercial
banks and financial institutions (77%) and from the Central Bank and
the Government, in the form of medium-term promissory notes, non
voting preference shares and long-term borrowings. DBZ's ordinary
share capital of K10 million has been widely subscribed by the
Government and local public financial institutions (60%), and by DEG
(15%), local commercial banks, EIB, IFC (3.5%), Yugoslav banks,
Japanese banks, ADB and other foreign commercial banks.
V. ALLOCATION OF BANK LOANS
5.01      Loan 1210-ZA.   As shown below, loan utilisation has been
minimal from effectiveness in April 1976 to end 1977. For financing
its investments, DBZ was then using its large paid-in capital given
the absence of foreign exchange restrictions, and its ADB and local
loans which carried lower interest rates than the Bank loan (7% versus

8.5Z). Thereafter, the utilisation of the Bank loan followed the
pattern of DBZ's overall operations (para. 4.01), with an acceleration
in commitments in 1978 and long lags in disbursements. The loan was
committed mostly within the years 1978-79 and disbursed mostly within
the years 1979-81. Overall, actual disbursements have been moch
slower than had been expected at the time of appraisal, but .ais is
largely a reflection of the Bank's optimistic assumption that DBZ's
subloans would be fully disbursed within 15 months of the approval
date.
5.02       Bank Loan 1210-ZA was used to finance the 47 subprojects
listed in Annex 4. Twenty-three subprojects representing 76% of the
Bank financing were above the Loan free-limits' / and subject to the
Bank's subproject review and approval procedure. In its subproject
reviews, the Bank made constructive comments on the quality of
projects resulting in changes in project design in a few cases14!,
and on DBZ's appraisal methodology, notably for the calculation-of
rates of return. DBZ's loans have carried interest rates of 10%-
12.5% and maturities of 4-12 years (Annex 4-A), consistent with DBZ's
normal terms. Two Bank subloans totalling US2.1 million were extended
for financing imported raw materials under an emergency scheme (para.
2.07).
5.03      The economic characteristics of the 47 subprojects, detailed
in Annex 4-B, generally match DBZ's overall investment pattern
discussed in para. 4.02. DBZ's total loan amount for these
subprojects is concentrated in manufacturing projects (69%), within
five subsectors: chemicals and plastics (16%), textiles (16%),
food 15/ (15%), paper (12%) and metal products (10%); with the
remainder in transport and storage (14%), agriculture (14%) and
tourism (3%). Except for a producer of car batteries, projected to
export some 40% of its production, all manufacturing subprojects are
geared to import substitution, and 55% of them are using mainly
imported raw materials. About 75% of the projects and 78% of DBZ's
loan amount are concentrated in the two urban provinces of Lusaka and
the Copperbelt. About 43% of loan amounts have been for setting up
new activities, while 57% are for expansion projects. Economic rates
of return of subprojects ranged from 10% to 44% and averaged 25%,
generally reflecting a strong potential for effective import
substitution.

14/ Adding a yarn dyeing unit; changing for cheaper cattle

15/ Including farm-based agro-processing.






- 13 -
5.04      Subproject operational performance is described in Annex
4-C. As compared to DBZ's appraisal schedule, 17 of the 47 projects
have incurred additional implementation delays of more than 6 months,
and up to 3 1/2 years. This slow implementation may be primarily
attributed to external economic factors (e.g. transport bottlenecKs,
building materials shortages) and delays in the finalization of
security arrangement (para. 4.01). In addition, some delays appear to
be due to poor management appraisal, or to technical design defects
overlooked at appraisal, particularly in the case of the earlier
projects. Twelve projects have incurred cost overruns of more than
10%, due primarily to the implementation delays, and to a few project
additions decided on and financed by the owners. As shown in Annex
4-D, three of the 47 sub-projects have significant arrears of more
than 6 months on DBZ's loans: (i) a tourist lodge in the Southern
Province making heavy losses due to a lack of functional transport
access, which is closely supervised by DBZ; (ii) a pig farm which is
now expected to clear its arrears as it finally became profitable in
1981 with the improved availability of imported stockfeeds; and (iii)
a beef and soya farm which hired a competent manager in 1980 after a
period of heavy losses and is now expected to clear its arrears.
5.05      Loan 1923-ZA.   With the recent acceleration in DBZ's
operations, this loan was virtually fully committed for 17 subprojects
within the three months following its effectiveness on May 1, 1981.
Most of these subprojects are still under implementation. A
description of the financial and economic characteristics of the
subprojects according to DBZ's appraisal estimates is presented in
Annex 5. DBZ's loans to these subprojects total K14 million or 13% of
total project costs, and carry interest rates of 12%-12.5% and
maturities of 4-10 years. DBZ's total loan amount is again
concentrated in projects in manufacturing (73%), and located in Lusaka
and Copperbelt Provinces (85%). Out of the 10 manufacturing
subprojects, three are based mainly on local raw materials, and two
are reported to have some export potential (textiles, cigarettes).
VI.   CONCLUSION
6.01      The general objectives of the Bank to help establish DBZ as a
sound and viable development finance institution capable of allocating
resources to worthwhile medium and large-scale project in productive
sectors, have largely been met. In just a few years, DBZ has become a
financially mature institution; it has also attracted and trained a
dedicated Zambian staff both at the professional and managerial levels.
Furthermore, through6ut a difficult economic period with no investment
in real terms in the country, DBZ has achieved a rapid growth of operations
supported by an effective resource mobilization, while maintaining a strong
financial position and increasing its profitability. It has also developed
comprehensive and well-formalized operating policy and procedures.



- 14 -
6.02      However, despite Bank's insistence, DBZ has not placed sufficient
emphasis on the employment aspects of projects it financed nor has it made
a significant contribution in assisting the country to counteract the long-
standing balance of payment disequilibrium.
6.03      Whiie the First Line of Credit had been designed to finance the
purchase of equipment and other fixed assets, the Bank agreed, on an
emergency basis, to finance imported working capital in order to raise the
capacity utilization of priority enterprises. In doing so, the Bank showed
a flexibility in responding to country needs which is worthwhile keeping in
mind for similar situations in other countries.

Dear Mr Kapur
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT: DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ZAMBIA (DBZ)
PROJECT 1210-ZA
I am in receipt of your letter dated 1st December 1982 together with
the Project Completion Report (the Report) on the above subject.
I have carefully reviewed the Report and have found it in general to
be a fair assessment of Project 1210-ZA. I am in agreement with the
overall conclusion of the Report, namely that the basic objectives
of the Project 1210-ZA were met in their entirety. The Bank was able
to provide long term loans to medium and large industrial projects
mainly for import substitution, and the Bank has developed and
effected a satisfactory manpower development programme as well as
comprehensive operations policies and procedures. Indeed the rapid
growth in operations, particularly profitability, is indicative of
the degree to which internal policy planning has been effective. In
fact DBZ prides itself in being one of the few development banks in
Africa in this unique position, with the ability for example to
declare dividends on a regular basis to its shareholders.
However, the Report has levelled some criticism at the Bank; in parti-
cular, regarding the Bank's alleged failure to counteract the long
standing balance of payment disequilibrium in the country. Three
specific criticisms are mentioned in the Report, viz:-
(a)     that DBZ's portfolio contains many projects dependent on
continued supply of imported inputs;

(b)     that DBZ has not rejected any project because of its
dependence on imported inputs and could suggest import
saving only in three cases; and
(c)     that DBZ has not been active in anticipating shortages
of inputs and taking appropriate measures.
The above criticisms in my view centre on the issue of foreign
exchange saving/earning ability of DBZ assisted projects. The
question is whether the Bank has lived up to its stated objectives
of supporting genuine import substitution and encouraging utilization
of domestic raw materials.
I wish to comment and clarify as follows on these criticisms to
enhance a more balanced view of the conclusions of the Report. As a
development bank and indeed a public institution, DBZ is committed to
economic development of Zambia. The Bank was set up to finance
development projects in conformity with priorities of the National
Development Plans, particularly with regard to:
(i)     achievement of such macro-economic policy objectives as
enhancing foreign exchange savings and export earnings
through import substitution and increased exports
respectively;
(ii)    utilization of local raw materials;
(iii)   employment generation;
(iv)    encouraging industrial diversification, etc.
The Bank's Strategy Statement a copy of which has been submitted to the
World Bank, endorses and reinforces this philosophy and indeed our
interpretation of these objectives as reflected in our investment
criteria has been strict.
It is ncessary to appreciate the role and place of the Bank in the
context of the Zambian economy. DBZ was born in an economic structure
whose dimensions were well defined.   Paradoxically, in an economy with
surplus labour, the industrial sector and in particular the manufactu-
ring sector still remains highly capital-intensive. The Zambian economy
is almost wholly dependent on imported inputs as basic raw materials
for industrial production namely iron, steel and chemicals etc, are
not available domestically. On the other hand, however, with a protected
market, an increasing demand for industrial goods and above all a healthy
foreign reserve position, it appeared as if import substitution even if
based on imported materials could succeed. Obviously, the situation
changed after 1975 when the energy crisis, decline in copper prices and
serious transport bottlenecks began to take their toll on the foreign
exchange position of the country. It will be appreciated that Structural

adjustment of the economy cannot be achieved overnight and, on the
other hand, there are strong indications that the Government is
determined to institute policy measures that could lead to restruc-
turing of the economy. The World Bank is familiar with these
initiatives already taken by the Government.
In the interim, DBZ is making all the necessary efforts to influence
the environment in which it operates. Its basic strategy has been
to support projects aimed at import substitution for priority
products. DBZ pipeline of projects lends support to this view. In
this regard, the basic assumption has been that the Bank of Zambia
would be required in any case to provide foreign exchange either
to import finished products or for the importation of raw materials
for the local manufacture of the same products.
Point         Furthermore, although it is not stated in the Report, the Bank has
reflected     in fact been rigorous in its project selection and has encouraged
in foot-      wherever possible the utilization of local raw materials in import
note 3,       substitution projects.   The Bank has also been rigor6us in the
page 6 of     application of investment criteria when analysing project proposals.
Completion    The Report itself endorses this view when it says in paragraph 5.03
Report.       that "Economic Rates of Return of subprojects ranged from 10% to
14% and averaged 25%, generally reflecting a strong potential for
effective import substitution".
I do realise and would indeed emphasise that the only impact that DBZ
assisted projects can have on balance of payments is through import
savings or export earnings. In view of the present stage of Zambia's
economic development, coupled with lack of domestic raw materials,
limited indegenous market for industrial products and an inadequately
developed entrepreneurial class, this impact is bound, however to be
of limited significance.
It would appear that it is relatively easy to promote import substitution
projects rather than those promoting exports as in case of the former
the local market is already established and what is required is only to
build production facilities. Furthermore, the scope for setting up
export industries in Zambia is limited because of high cost production
due to high labour cost, unavailability of intermediate raw materials
and high transport costs in view of the country's landlocked situation.
I would myself advocate for a study, financed by the World Bank, to
examine the whole question of export promotion in Zambia, with a view
to formulating concrete proposals on products and markets.
Point         On the broader question of balance of payments, it is quite clear that
reflected     the problem has been caused and is exercabated mainly by falling copper
in para.      prices and increased price of petroleum    products.  It will also be
2.07 of       noted that the management of the economy as a whole is the responsibility
Project       of Government and as such, a factor outside the scope of DBZ.

Nonetheless, the Bank is ready and willing to play a major role in the
quest for solutions to Zambia's economic problems. As you may know,
the DBZ Strategy Statement was revised in 1981 to emphasise, inter
alia, the very important objectives of export promotion, utilization
of local raw materials and indeed the financing of agriculture and
agro-industries on a priority status. Again, the extent of our
success in this effort, will be determined by effectiveness of on-
going Government policy measures to improve overall performance in
the sectors concerned. The Bank can only be a catalyst in the
development process.
Finally, I would add that the World Bank itself was instrumental in
establishing and developing the institutional framework and operations
policies of DBZ. The economic climate in which DBZ operates is well
known to the World Bank. I am, therefore, pleased with the overall
conclusion of the Report that the policy objectives of the Project
1210-ZA were met.
