1.    Proceeds for Error! Reference source not found., Persistent Organic
POLLUTANTS (POPS) STOCKPILES MANAGEMENT AND DESTRUCTION GEF PROJECT ,
[TF055875], P090037 will be reallocated as follows:

    Category of Expenditure                 Allocation (US$)             % of Financing
     Current         Revised              Current      Revised         Current    Revised
1) Goods                No changes         650,000      608,000
(2) Consultant          No changes       2,160,000    2,117,000              100      No changes

2.       The Project's overall implementation progress is satisfactory, thus providing a solid
platform for the achievement of its development objective. Activities under Components 1 and 2
were implemented in a timely and rigorous manner, often ahead of schedule. While there were
significant initial delays in the implementation of activities under Component 2 aimed at
strengthening the country's regulatory framework for POPs management, these were successfully
overcome in 2009. The Project disbursed US$6.12 million, or 96% of the funds as of May 1,
2010.

3.       The proposed reallocation is necessary to allow for the scaling up of a number of project
activities using existing project savings. More specifically, the Government of Moldova requested
the reallocation of proceeds for the following activities:

                  The clean-up of the 400 KW Vulcanesti transformer station site;
                  Expanding POPs communication and awareness raising activities under
                   Component 3;


                                                3
              Additional training for staff of the State Hydrometeo Service chemical lab for
               POPs testing and analysis;
              Additional IT equipment for the POPs sites database and PCB inventory;
              Incremental operating costs, including the project's 2010 audit.

4.      There will be no changes to the Project's environmental category. There are no
outstanding safeguard and fiduciary issues. There currently are no overdue audit reports and
previous reports have all been satisfactory.

                              Extension of Closing Date

1. The closing date for Error! Reference source not found., Persistent Organic
   POLLUTANTS (POPS) STOCKPILES MANAGEMENT AND DESTRUCTION GEF
   PROJECT, [TF No 055785], P090037 will be extended from May 31, 2010 until December
   31, 2010.

2.      The Project's overall implementation progress is satisfactory, thus providing a solid
platform for the achievement of its development objective. A majority of the project's results
indicators have been achieved and the remaining ones continue to be achievable.

3.       The proposed extension is necessary to complete the implementation of Activities 1 and 2
under Component 3 (POPs Information Management and Reporting System, and POPs
Monitoring Network, respectively). In addition, the Government has requested the
implementation of a number of scaling-up activities as described in Annex 2, using project
savings. The Project's Implementing Agency has prepared and submitted to the Bank an
implementation plan which includes both on-going and proposed activities. The task team is
satisfied as to the feasibility of the plan and considers it implementable under the proposed
extension.

4.        This will be the first extension of the project.
