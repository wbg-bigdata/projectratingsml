1
 The PDOs are taken from the PAD. The DCAs states the PDO slightly differently The objectives of the Project are to improve the
nutritional status of children under three, primary school children, and pregnant and lactating women, and ensure long-term
sustainability of nutrition outcomes by improving the quality and quantity of food intake by children at home; and, in so doing,
improve quality of life and productivity, decrease child morbidity and mortality rates, and support primary education.

                   The target for children was basically achieved. The target for nursing women was not achieved but it
                   was unrealistic (i.e. four times higher than the target of 110,000 women/year set by the Ministry of
                   Health which was in fact reached). These positive trends are broadly consistent with data from the

        This original indicator (Proportion of Vitamin A deficiency among children <3 years old and breastfeeding mothers) was too costly
      and impractical to measure. Given the direct causal link between Vitamin A supplementation and reduction in Vitamin A deficiency,
      the 2006 AF agreed to use this supplementation indicator.

       This original indicator (Proportion of deficiency anemia among enrolled primary school children) was too costly and impractical to
      measure. Given the direct causal link between administration of iron supplements and reductions in anemia, the 2006 AF agreed to
      only keep the supplementation indicator.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.    Country context. The 1996 Poverty Assessment argued that two decades of economic policies, which
had emphasized state control of the economy and favored urban consumers, had contributed significantly to
slower economic growth, political instability, and increased rural poverty. Though the assessment noted
recent progress in improving economic management, it concluded that Madagascar remained ―steeped in
poverty‖: (i) 77% of the country‘s predominantly rural population was considered poor 8; (ii) declines in
education, nutrition and life expectancy were evident, with health and education indicators at or below highly
unsatisfactory averages for sub-Saharan Africa; and (iii) ineffective political leadership and institutions
provided little promise for improving the delivery of essential social services.
2.     Bank operations sought to improve economic performance and to attenuate the potential negative
effects of economic mismanagement, particularly for the poorer segments of the population. Beginning in
1985, the Bank financed sectoral operations in education and health, as well as an Economic Management
and Social Action Project, which included pilot targeted programs to reduce food insecurity among the poor.
Experiences from these interventions were included in the initial IDA-supported nutrition project
(SECALINE/1993-98) to reduce food insecurity and malnutrition in two of the country‘s most food insecure
provinces (Toliary and Antananarivo) through income generating projects and targeted, community-based
nutrition interventions.
3.    Nutrition situation. Though SECALINE‘s contribution to the reduction of moderate malnutrition
among children under five was substantial (from 45% to 38% in Antananarivo province and from 28% to
18% in Toliary province), Madagascar continued to have some of the highest rates of chronic and severe
malnutrition in Africa. These rates were linked both to poverty and insufficient food production and to a
range of other factors, including: (i) inadequate knowledge of feeding, health and caring practices; and (ii)
the prevalence of infectious diseases (e.g. diarrhea, measles, and malaria).
4.     Micronutrient deficiencies were also an important issue; among the most important were: (i) iron
deficiency anemia (diagnosed in 80% of pregnant women and a large number of children as well); (ii)
vitamin A deficiency (confirmed among 11.5% of the SECALINE population with an additional 65%
considered at risk); and (iii) helminthes (estimated for ascaris infection at 56.5% among school-aged children
and at 47.4% among women of childbearing age in selected areas).
5.     Food insecurity was a major problem with: (i) low caloric consumption (i.e. an estimated 59% of the
total population consumed less than 2,100 calories per day; (ii) natural disasters, such as cyclones negatively
influencing agricultural production; and (iii) seasonality playing a significant role in the 2-3 month period
prior to the harvesting season for rice, the principal food crop. Despite Madagascar‘s potential for
diversifying food sources, the limited varieties and small quantities produced as well as the tendency to sell
rather than consume did not yield the desired results.
6.    Finally, there were concerns with: (i) the inadequate performance of the Ministry of Health,
particularly with respect to severely malnourished children; (ii) insufficient awareness of the multisectoral
nature of malnutrition with correspondingly little or no coordination among government ministries (Health,
Education, Agriculture, etc.)9; and (iii) poor community awareness of the determinants of malnutrition, as
well as its implications on maternal and child morbidity and on children's learning capacity promote
behavioral changes.
7.   Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. A key objective of the 1997
CAS (16249-MAG) was to support the Government‘s poverty reduction strategy through the development of



8
 CAS, Report No. 16249-MAG (January 1997). See especially Boxes 1 and 2, pp. 3 and 4.

 Only in 1997 did the National Plan of Action for Nutrition recommend a multisectoral approach to address the determinants of
malnutrition.

human capital, by improving primary education, basic health care, nutrition, and rural infrastructure. Given
the CAS‘s assumption that, over the ensuing five years, poverty might not decrease significantly (and might
even increase before the benefits of economic growth could reach the poor), the Bank concluded that cost
effective strategies to address the high prevalence of malnutrition would: (i) decrease maternal and child
morbidity and mortality rates in the short term; (ii) enhance learning among primary school children in the
medium-term; and (iii) impact positively on children's productivity and capacity in later life as a result of
interventions in early age.
8.    Furthermore, previous Bank interventions had been instrumental in helping the Government: (i) design
and successfully implement community-based interventions (SECALINE and FID); and (ii) develop national
policies on nutrition and food security. Specifically, SECALINE had piloted: (i) a food-for-work program in
Antananarivo's poorest areas, targeted mainly at female headed households; (ii) a social fund to finance
income generating activities10; and (iii) school feeding programs, particularly in the drought-prone southern
region of the country. SECALINE had also supported the Government‘s adoption of a National Food
Security Strategy in 1997. Given its experience in piloting and scaling up pro-poor interventions and its
potentially catalytic role in generating additional financial resources to fight malnutrition, the Bank’s
continuing involvement was considered essential.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
9.     With the overall objective of improving the quality of life and productivity, decreasing child morbidity
and mortality rates, and supporting primary education, the original project aimed to: (i) improve the
nutritional status of children under three, primary school children and pregnant and lactating women in the
project target areas; and (ii) ensure the long-term sustainability of nutrition outcomes by improving the
quality and quantity of food intake by children at home11.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
10. The project‘s geographic scope was expanded in 2002 to respond to a combination of natural and
political emergencies, and supplementary financing was made available in 2003. In 2006, the target
population was modified to include children under five, the PDO indicators were aligned with the revised
national nutrition policy, and additional financing was made available. The PDOs were not revised. Data on
the key outcome and intermediate outcome indicators are presented in Section F of the Data Sheet and
discussed in more detail in Section 3.2 and Annex 2.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries and Benefits
11. The project concentrated initially on two of the six provinces in Madagascar (Antananarivo and
Toliary), and was subsequently scaled up nationwide, targeting primarily the rural poor. Overall, the initial
direct beneficiary population was estimated at 4.1 million comprising: (i) 900,000 children under three
including 425,000 malnourished children; (ii) 363,000 pregnant and 363,000 lactating women; (iii) 1.0
million enrolled primary school children; and (iv) 1.5 million non-enrolled children aged 3-14 years. In
addition, an estimated 1.2 million households covered by the project were expected to benefit from the IEC
and community mobilization programs as well as the community activities that would be supported by the
project in villages and schools.
12. The project was expected to generate: (i) health benefits by improving the short-term nutritional status
of women and children and the longer-term learning and cognitive skills of children resulting from their
improved nutritional status; (ii) social benefits by increasing parents' participation in schools and
strengthening capabilities among households and for the community overall to prevent malnutrition; and (iii)

   This intervention was subsequently integrated in 1995 into the Social Fund II Project which covers the entire country.

  The PDO were not included in the initial Development Credit Agreement (DCA), which refers to the project‘s operational manual
for the official indicators.

13. Component 1: Community nutrition program (US$ 28.11 million). To be implemented in each of
the six provinces by the project coordination units in collaboration with local NGOs, this component
intended to reach 100% of the target populations in those districts with the highest malnutrition rates. By the
closing date, the project expected to cover 50% of the targeted groups nationwide. Nutrition centers
attending to a maximum of 226 children12 would be established in villages which agreed to provide a site and
elect a community nutrition agent (CNA) who would be directly responsible for all nutrition interventions.
The CNA would be assisted by social workers, recruited by local NGOs and responsible for promoting
community mobilization and developing community-based activities to improve nutrition, hygiene and
sanitation in the village. CNAs and social workers were expected to receive intensive training at the start of
the project and throughout the project to ensure a successful implementation of the program. In addition, the
project financed:
           Growth monitoring in weekly weighing sessions where mothers received counseling on the child‘s
            nutritional status (as indicated by the growth chart) and advice on the child's nutritional needs;
           Food supplementation for children not gaining weight (i.e. in the yellow or red area of the growth
            monitoring chart) and referral to public or private health centers or hospitals for severely
            malnourished children (W/H < 3 S.D. NCHS and/or edema) requiring rehabilitation13;
           Nutrition awareness and education sessions involving cooking demonstrations for which the CNA
            was allocated approximately US$1 to purchase ingredients and participating mothers brought
            additional food to complement the recipe;
           Vitamin A supplementation for: (i) lactating women within the first 6 weeks after delivery; (ii)
            annually for children under 12 months (100,000 IU) and aged 12-24 months (200,000 IU); and (iii)
            twice a year for children aged 24-36 months (200,000 IU); and
           Incentives, comprising: (i) small-scale (up to US$200 maximum) support for community-based and
            non-income generating activities to address nutrition-related issues and benefit the community or a
            group of at least two households; and (ii) awards (during years 3 and 5) to the most dynamic
            nutrition centers.
14. Component 2: School nutrition program (US$ 5.83 million). To be executed by the Directorate for
Primary Education of the Ministry of Secondary and Basic Education (MINESEB) with the support of the
project coordination units and involving 6,663 public and private primary schools (half of the total number of
schools in the country) and around 20,000 teachers by project closing. Teachers were to be trained on the
technical content of the program (distribution of micronutrients and anti-helminth treatment) and on
communications techniques. As with Component 1, this component was expected initially to cover 100% of
the target population in the priority districts and eventually reach 50% of the targeted groups nationwide (i.e.,
around 1,079,000 enrolled primary school children and 1,535,000 non enrolled children aged 3-14 years) by
project closing. In contrast with Component 1, such a school nutrition program had never been implemented
in Madagascar, and it was expected that the modalities would be defined in the first year. The project
financed:
           Weekly distribution of iron/folate tablets to enrolled primary school children and periodic (based on
            the prevalence) anti-helminth treatment (Mebendazole or Albendazol) to all children aged 3-14 years
            whether enrolled or not;




12
     The number of children is based on an estimate of a population of 2,000 inhabitants within 5 km from the center.
13
     Pregnant women also received supplementary feeding during the last trimester of their pregnancy.


                                                                    3
         Improved practices, comprising: (i) promotion of nutrition and hygiene with children during regular
          classes and with parents during formal and informal meetings; and (ii) monitoring of the iodization
          of salt consumed at home;
         Incentives, comprising: (i) small-scale (up to US$200 maximum) support for school-based and non-
          income generating activities to improve nutrition and hygiene in the school environment; and (ii)
          awards (during years 3 and 5) to the most dynamic schools.
15. Component 3: Intersectoral support (US$ 0.68 million). To be executed by the Ministry of Health
and the Food and Agriculture Organization (on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture), this component was
intended to finance: (i) training on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) to improve the
capacity of all health staff to provide quality care to children; and (ii) preparation of technical guidelines on
improved agriculture techniques and their dissemination in a few selected districts where the Ministry of
Agriculture is implementing a small scale food security project with the assistance of the FAO.
16. Component 4: IEC, Training and Project Management (US$ 7.26 million). To be implemented by
the central and provincial project management units, this component was intended to: (i) design and
implement an IEC and training strategy to strengthen IEC capabilities for key actors (e.g. community
nutrition workers, social workers, teachers and health staff); (ii) establish a management information system
to monitor project results and outcomes; and (iii) support both the essential project management functions
(procurement, financial management, auditing, reporting, etc.) and the institutional coordination with the
Prime Minister, the Advisory Committee and the co-financiers (IDA and WFP).
1.6 Revised Components
17. The restructuring of the project to provide supplemental funding (2003) did not alter the original four
project components. The approval of additional funding (2006) also retained the original components but
introduced some important changes to adapt the design to evolving needs and institutional capacities:
         Under Component 1, the age range for children eligible to benefit from the community nutrition
          program would change from under three to under five;
         Under Component 2, the responsibility for implementing the school nutrition program would
          progressively be handed over to the Ministry of Education; and
         Under Component 3, financing of intersectoral activities would be replaced by support for the
          institutionalization of the National Nutrition Policy (PNN) and would be used to: (i) strengthen the
          National Nutrition Council‘s ability to carry out its policy setting and strategy definition role; (ii)
          improve the capacity of the National Nutrition Office (ONN) to perform its intersectoral
          coordination, monitoring and evaluation, research, and resource mobilization mandates; (iii) help
          increase the capacity of selected executing agencies to define and manage nutrition prevention and
          mitigation activities; and (iv) develop and implement the national monitoring and evaluation system
          for nutrition activities, and the National Food and Nutrition surveillance system including the early
          malnutrition warning system.
1.7 Other significant changes
18. Three Development Credit Agreements (DCAs) guided project implementation, and each was
amended at various times to: (i) strengthen implementation procedures; (ii) revise project outcomes; (iii)
reallocate the proceeds of the project; and (iv) extend the closing date. The original credit (CR 3060 MAG)
was amended to include several new activities, and reallocate the proceeds of the credit.14 To assist the


14
   More specifically the original credit was amended to: (i) modify project activities (February 15, 2002); (ii) increase the authorized
allocation to be deposited in the special account (June 21, 2002); (iii) revise and update the disbursement table to provide for a
temporary increase in the disbursement percentages for certain categories of expenditures (March 5, 2003); and (iv) reallocate the
proceeds of the credit (June 3, 2003). A request to extend the closing date from January 31, 2004 to July 31, 2004 was approved in a
letter dated May 29, 2003 but then rejected in a letter dated June 3, 2003.


                                                                   4
government to cope with the devastating effects of cyclones as well as the political turmoil at the outset of
the decade the Bank prepared a supplementary credit (CR 3060-1 MAG) in the amount of US$10 million
                                             15
which was approved in December 2003.             The supplementary financing was modified to strengthen
fiduciary arrangements, support the scale up of nutrition interventions under the Poverty Reduction Support
                                                                                              16
Credit, and plan for a transition period which turned out to be more lengthy than anticipated. Subsequently,
additional financing (CR 3060-2 MAG) of US$10 million equivalent was approved in November 2006 to
further extend the project‘s geographic focus, expand coverage, and adapt the program to the government‘s
harmonized national community program. 17 The additional financing was also modified to further refine the
fiduciary, implementation and monitoring arrangements. 18 Following the change in Government, the Bank‘s
portfolio was subject to OP/BP 7.30 (as of March 17, 2009), and disbursements were put on hold until
November 2009, when they resumed for certain key projects (including the Community Nutrition Project) on
humanitarian grounds. A retroactive extension of the closing date was approved on an exceptional basis,
from December 31, 2009 to July 31, 2011.
2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
19. Project preparation. Project preparation was supported through PHRD grant financing which
allowed for key analytic work to be done and for implementation and fiduciary arrangements to be fleshed
out. 19 Though a first project identification mission (November-December 1995) discussed potential
components, possible implementation arrangements, and further preparation activities to be carried out with
grant funds 20 effective project preparation commenced during a second project identification mission in
December 1996. At that time, agreements were reached on: (i) tentative components of a combined
health/nutrition operation; (ii) establishment of a technical committee to prepare the project proposal; and
(iii) use of PHRD funds to finance preparation activities (technical assistance and studies).
20. The project preparation process initially went smoothly: by March 1997 the national technical
committee had prepared proposals for a combined health/nutrition intervention for review by the preparation




15
   Following the requirements of OP 13.20, the supplementary financing (SDR 7.3 million or US$l0 million equivalent) was
approved to cover the additional costs incurred during the emergency situations in: (i) the project and neighboring non-project areas
affected by the cyclones that struck Madagascar in 2000; and (ii) the six regional capitals affected by the political turbulence in 2002.
Overall, 16 rural districts were added to the already targeted 52 districts. Supplemental funds were also subsequently used for the
nutritional emergency that was declared after the country was severely affected by the cyclones in January and March 2004.

16
  The supplementary financing agreement was modified to: (i) revise procurement procedures (November 2, 2004); (ii) reallocate the
proceeds of the credit (December 14, 2005); and (iii) extend the closing date from October 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005
(November 2, 2004), then to December 31, 2006 (December 14, 2005), and finally to December 31, 2008.
17
  The third credit in the amount of SDR 6.8 million (US$l0 million equivalent) was approved to: (i) extend the Project‘s geographic
scope from 62 districts to all 110 districts; (ii) increase the project‘s coverage to 7.2 million beneficiaries (children under five,
pregnant and lactating women, and school-aged children) and from 50% to 70% of the child target population; and (iii) adapt the
program to the new harmonized national community program. The additional financing also extended the project closing date from
December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2008.
18
  The additional financing agreement was subsequently modified to: (i) increase the ceiling of the special account (October 27,
2008); (ii) to modify institutional and implementation arrangements following the creation of 22 regions (October 27, 2008); (iii)
revise and postpone by one year the achievement of the key performance indicators (October 27, 2008); and (iv) extend the closing
date to December 31, 2009 (October 27, 2008).
19
  Two PHRD grants contributed to project preparation: (i) TF 029249 in the amount of 42.5 million Japanese yen was approved on
September 20, 1995; and (ii) TF 025442 in the amount of US$400,000 was approved on November 10, 1997 for both nutrition and
health. The nutrition activities primarily involved monitoring and evaluation and are discussed in that section.
20 Japanese PHRD TF029249 signed December 20, 1995 in the amount of 42.5 million yen


                                                                   5
mission; in May, a first PCN review meeting was held at which the decision to split the health and nutrition
components was endorsed; and by June, the technical committee had prepared a full proposal for review by
the Bank.
21. Thereafter, project preparation became increasingly contentious: (i) within the country as a result of
the decision to split the combined operation into two separate operations and a prolonged dispute between
the Ministry of Health and the Bank over the ongoing IDA-financed health project21; and (ii) within the Bank
over the relative merits of various strategies to improve the nutritional status of children and adolescents. In
September 1997, a follow up PCN review meeting was held to examine the status of the project; and the
team was authorized to proceed to pre-appraisal. The decision meeting was held in early January 1998, and
the appraisal mission/negotiations were concluded in early February 1998. Even though the preparation
process was somewhat lengthy it led to an innovative design.
22. Project design. The initial decision to prepare a combined health/nutrition project to succeed the
separate, ongoing health and nutrition operations (expected to close in June 1999) was based on agreements
to: (i) integrate the package of activities and create synergy at the community level; (ii) promote
decentralization and especially local management of services; and (iii) emphasize capacity building and
sustainability (including local financing) of the activities. 22 Subsequently, it was decided that the multi-
sectoral and multi-partnership nature of the nutrition project would require different leadership and
implementation mechanisms than the health project23. Integration, decentralization, and local management
were maintained as key principles for the project; and agreements were reached to establish regional
coordination units and recruit local NGOs to support the communities.
23. The project design built on early lessons and successes of the ongoing nutrition operation
(SECALINE). As noted by early missions: (i) the first community nutrition project had achieved good
results in reducing malnutrition rates among projects' beneficiaries and fostering community mobilization;
but (ii) its coverage remained low and its overall impact on malnutrition was limited. Thus, while the
proposed project incorporated many lessons learned from SECALINE 24 , it proposed a multi-sectoral
approach and considerably more ambitious objectives to expand the geographic focus, broaden the range of
services, and refocus attention beyond short-term relief strategies by emphasizing food security and
behavioral change. Of the three proposed technical components, there was rapid agreement on the
interventions under the community nutrition and the school nutrition components but much less consensus on
the elements of the nutrition/agriculture component due to concerns about both the nature of the proposed
activities and the organization and credibility of the agricultural extension workers.
24. The final PAD reflects most of the concerns expressed during the preparation taking into account the
technical and strategic issues brought up during the PCN review. 25 At the January 1998 decision meeting the



21
   The seriousness of this conflict is indicated by the discussions at the level of the Prime Minister and the Country Director over the
feasibility and timing of the appraisal mission.
22
   Expansion of nutritional services was expected to proceed in tandem with the revitalization of district health services, that is, in
four phases over the period 1999-2005. This was dropped after the March mission.
23
   This decision was confirmed by the first PCD review meeting held on May 13, 1997. The community nutrition project was to be
placed under the leadership of the Prime Minister.
24
   See in particular the ICR for SECALINE, pp. vi-vii and pp. 14-15.
25
    The September PCN review meeting agreed on the proposed technical approach but expressed concerns about the capacity of the
ministries of education, health, and agriculture to implement some of the project activities. More importantly, the meeting insisted on
the need to balance several key elements: (i) an intersectoral approach with limiting project complexity; (ii) maximum impact with
reduced costs through improved targeting and cost effective interventions; and (iii) increased coverage with the quality of services
provided. To this end, the pre-appraisal mission: (i) reviewed costs, implementation capacity, and technical feasibility; (ii) agreed on
project targeting and coverage (to children under 3 in rural districts with the highest malnutrition rates), and phasing (gradual
extension to reach 50% of the targeted groups by 2003); and (iii) limited the proposed agriculture sector intervention to a few pilot
activities to be agreed on at a later date. Finally, agreements were reached on strategies for IEC, training, and management
information, and WFP renewed its commitment to co-finance the project by providing all the food supply.



                                                                   6
issues of targeting and coverage were again reviewed 26 as was the question of the added value of the
agriculture/health component. The meeting accepted the team‘s justification of the project design and
requested further explanations which were subsequently incorporated into the revised PAD and strengthened
                        27
the project design.        The PAD notes Government‘s commitment to the project as indicated by: (i) its
support for the previous project; (ii) its adoption of the poverty reduction strategy and the accompanying
National Plan of Action for Nutrition and Food Security Strategy (all prepared in a participatory manner);
(iii) its willingness to use independent and non-governmental project implementation modalities; and (iv) the
significant involvement of the Nutrition Technical Committee in preparing the project. The quality of the
PAD also reflects the close scrutiny with which the project was examined within the Bank.
25. Given the intensive internal review of the proposed strategies and components, the assessment of the
potential risks and the proposed risk mitigation measures seems very cursory. For instance, the PAD does
not mention the possibility/probability of a natural disaster and its potential impact on project
implementation. In addition, each of the four measures promoting long-term sustainability involves
assumptions and risks which are neither adequately analyzed nor sufficiently addressed by the proposed
mitigation measures.
26. Quality at Entry. The PAD notes that a Quality Assurance Group provided extended and useful
technical advice to the team throughout the preparation for the initial credit, but no record of their comments
was found in IRIS.
2.2 Implementation
27. Project disbursement. A detailed table of the project‘s annual sources of funds and expenditures by
credit for each category and component is presented in Annex 10. Disbursement lagged over the first
eighteen months of due, in large measure, to inexperience among the new regional directorates and NGOs
(table 2). Knowledge-sharing between long time project managers and new managers as well as intensive
training of NGOs resulted in rapid increases in disbursement.28, and the project consistently expended 90%
of available project financing during the initial phase and more than 95% of available project financing
through the suspension of financing in 2009.
28. Cumulative disbursements hide periodic severe cash flow problems encountered by the project as a
result of recurring issues related to the ratification of credit agreements, the authorized amount of the special
account, the timely payment of the Government‘s contribution, the flow of funds for replenishment of
regional accounts, the accumulation of payment arrears (particularly to the NGOs most responsible for
implementation of the community nutrition component), etc. These difficulties are described in more detail
below.
29.    Project implementation. Viewed in terms of implementation, it is worth analyzing the trajectory of


26
  The issue raised was whether or not the targeting should further be reduced to children under two, which constitute the most
vulnerable group. The team argued that targeting children under two would: (i) increase the cost of the program per child while
reducing the program impact on malnutrition nationwide, since the age group of 2 to 3 years (with malnutrition rates at 45%) would
be missed; and (ii) increasing the coverage of children under two from 50% to 65% or 75%, in order to increase the program impact,
would require a large increase in nutrition sites to cover a larger geographical area thereby significantly increasing implementation
difficulties.
27
  The team was requested to address in more detail: (i) current best practice and the lessons learned from the ICR of the first
community nutrition project; (ii) the flexibility of the project‘s response to seasonal food security; and (iii) the measures proposed for
accounting, auditing, and financial reporting. The team provided assurances that: (i) an implementation manual would be prepared in
a timely manner; and (ii) baseline indicators and targets as well as follow-up surveys would be defined in the PAD. Finally, it was
agreed that the Credit Agreement would refer to the National Plan of Action for Nutrition and the National Food Security Strategy,
since both would specify the Government's objectives, policies and program of actions with regard to nutrition and food security.
28
  Though expenditures increased, they were accompanied by internal audit reports noting problems with financial management: (i) in
Toamasine and Fianarantsoa Provinces; and (ii) among the local NGOs (especially timely replenishments requests and appropriate
justification of disbursements).


                                                                    7
events over the life of this project as follows:
30. May 1998-December 2001. During this period, it is noted that PDO achievement and implementation
progress were rated satisfactory with both the initial institutional arrangements and the agreed-on strategies
and technical approaches contributing to successful project implementation. There were some delays in
implementation due to: (i) the logistics of scaling-up the coverage of the community nutrition component
from two to six provinces29; and (ii) complex procurement issues which, according to ISR #3, ―were not
possible to anticipate at the project design stage or during initial project implementation‖. The procurement
complexities included the importation of food and micronutrients for communities, the dosage of specific
drugs for deworming and iron supplementation in schools, etc There were also several technical difficulties
related to: (i) the use of local production capacity rather than imported food for the community nutrition
component; (ii) the postponement of several important elements including: vitamin A distribution
(procurement and coordination problems), referral of severely malnourished children (delays in the Ministry
of Health‘s treatment efforts resulting from the delay in effectiveness of the Bank‘s health project, CRESAN
II), and funding of the micro projects (lack of sufficient financial accounting capabilities); and (iii) the design
and adoption of the IEC strategy.
31. While these implementation issues were being addressed, Madagascar suffered: (i) substantial cyclone-
related damage 30 in the east and northeast (January 2000), and (ii) persistent drought in the south (May
2000). Though not established to respond with emergency interventions, the project was reoriented to
expand the nutrition activities to the worst hit areas with the agreement that a supplemental credit would (in
due time31) make up for the reallocation of funds to these untargeted areas to ensure achievement of the
PDOs. The project also took responsibility for managing Food and Cash for Work activities and establishing
nutrition sites in the hardest hit urban areas to mitigate the effects of the crisis; the Food and Cash for Work
activities were however later postponed due to political profiling and risk for the NGOs safety.
32. At the mid-term review in September 2001, the PDO and IO were considered satisfactory with the
school nutrition component and project management deemed highly satisfactory. It was expected that the
remaining time would focus on: (i) ensuring the continued quality of the services; while (ii) addressing the
scope and sustainability of the interventions; and (iii) strengthening relations with the health sector.
33. January 2002-December 2003. Following the presidential elections of December 2001, Madagascar
endured six months of political crisis accompanied by serious economic and social consequences as the
country returned to previous poverty levels. During this period, PDO achievement and implementation
progress continued to be rated satisfactory, but financial performance was rated unsatisfactory. As a result,
Bank financing became highly conditioned 32 with intensive supervision and the imposition of fiduciary
management measures slowing disbursements. In July 2002, the Government presented a recovery program
(supported by IDA in the form of additional credits and portfolio restructuring) and an ambitious reform
program.
34. As part of the recovery program, the mid-term review‘s recommendation to refocus on quality was set
aside in favor of further expansion of the project‘s coverage: in addition to increasing the number of districts
covered by the project and the number of cyclone emergency sites, the project was called on to initiate a



29
   The logistical difficulties included recruiting regional staff (including UN volunteers to assist in the management of food),
identifying communities, recruiting and training community nutrition agents and local NGOs, etc.
30
   Three cyclones hit Madagascar between February and April 2000, with damage concentrated in 23 of the 111 districts in the
country.
31
   It was subsequently agreed that supplementary funding would be requested once 75% of the funds of the original credit were
disbursed.
32
   These included that (i) Madagascar continue to honor its obligations to IDA; (ii) both sides agree to maintain key project staff as
well as key staff of the Treasury and Finance who have signatory authority; (iii) both sides be kept informed of project activities; (d)
projects only work on the basis of existing agreements and programs, and no changes to those programs should be made; and (e) no
large contracts/procurements (defined as those requiring ministerial approval) be started/awarded even if they are already
programmed.


                                                                   8
more sustained approach, using HIPC funds for safety net activities. These activities included: (i) Food and
Cash for Work activities (sub-contracted to two international NGOs)33; and (ii) establishing nutrition sites
and food-aid assistance to urban social centers. Thus, in the space of two years, project activities expanded
significantly from those originally planned. In practice, this decision ultimately proved to create some
notable challenges during implementation. the consequent strains on project management; that were in turn
exacerbated by weak interim project leadership and rumors (ultimately unfounded) of a transfer of
implementation responsibilities from the Office of the Prime Minister to the President's Office.
35. In May 2003, the Bank determined that the project was back on track and had significantly improved
the quality of nutrition services and the intersectoral relations among the ministries of health, agriculture, and
education34.As noted35, this assessment was based on some key actions that had been implemented: i) the
project implemented some key quality improvement measures to refocus implementation on quality and
opposed to just quantity(i.e. opening more sites); 2) there was significant progress on intersectoral actions by
improving the working relationship with the health sector as well as collaborating with the Ministry of
Agriculture on training materials; and 3) ensuring that payments to NGOs were current and more
importantly, establishing a continuous feedback cycle between the project and implementing NGOs to
improve project performance. In light of these achievements, the upgrading of the ratings during that time
was justified.
36. In addition, there was increased interest in coordinating the three existing approaches to community-
based nutrition, namely Secaline (Bank), NAC (UNICEF), and community-based IMCI (USAID/Linkages)
to ensure complimentarity for the achievement of the nutrition MDG 36 . Supplementary financing was
prepared and approved by the Bank in October 2003 but only became effective in August 200437.Preparation
of the request for additional financing38 for the next phase commenced concurrently during this period, with
the design of this phase intended to integrate the nutrition activities into the PRSC.
37. January 2004-September 2007. The supplemental credit was intended to finance a transition period of
18 months needed to transfer the current project activities to a national program. Three elements of this
process fundamentally altered the original project: (i) the adoption of the national nutrition policy (PNN); (ii)
the revision of the institutional arrangements; and (iii) the introduction of program budget support in place
of project financing. While these initiatives were intended to establish the basis for a strengthened and
sustainable nutrition program, each was accompanied by challenges which considerably taxed project
management. The problems were eventually reflected in the PDO achievement and implementation progress
ratings which, though satisfactory throughout much of this period, ended MU for PDO achievement and U
for implementation progress.
38. Adoption of the national nutrition policy (PNN). Based on studies in Madagascar (and elsewhere)
showing that (except in famine situations), the main determinants of chronic malnutrition are complex and


33
   Food for Cash and Work activities were funded from May to August 2002, with discussions about ensuring their continuation for
an additional 6-9 months until a longer term social safety net program could be designed.
34
   Given that the credit was projected to be spent by September 2003, the Bank proposed to use US$ 3 million of HIPC funds to
cover the period September to December and suggested to include US$ 4 million for nutrition interventions under the upcoming
PRSC.

37
   The Bank blamed weak leadership for Parliament‘s delay (until August 1, 2004) in ratifying the credit agreement. (ISR 15)
38
   Work on the additional financing was supported by a PHRD grant (No. TF052829, approved January 19, 2004 in the amount of
US$431,200) and intended to: (i) build institutional and organizational capacity; (ii) carry out studies (including strategies to transfer
severely malnourished children back to the community, eliminate nutritional supplementation through food distribution, evaluate the
current communication strategy, assess micronutrient needs, and estimate the costs and sustainability of extending the school
nutrition and health interventions to national coverage, etc.); and (iii) to update implementation and procedures manuals



                                                                    9
diverse (including inadequate knowledge of feeding, health and caring practices; poor quality of food
production and consumption, etc.), a national nutrition policy was adopted in April 2004 that: (i) recognized
the need for a coherent institutional framework to ensure adequate policy guidance, coordination, monitoring
and evaluation, and the execution of nutrition activities in a sustainable manner; and (ii) identified the
community nutrition project (PNNC) as the key strategy for preventing malnutrition (and achieving the
nutrition MDG) by providing a package of services and delivery mechanisms to prevent, detect, and treat
malnutrition at community level.
39. As noted in the 2005 AM, contributors to nutrition interventions agreed to harmonize an initial
package of services in 2005 and to add other elements in a flexible manner to arrive at the overall package by
June 2006. Several new concepts were introduced over time, including: (i) enlarging the target groups to
include children 0-5 years (rather than 0-3 years but with a special emphasis on those less than 2) and
adolescents 13-20 years; (ii) complementing growth monitoring with a nutritional surveillance system
involving minimum weight gains, community evaluation, and referral to the basic health center; and (iii)
experimenting (and then adding) early childhood stimulation as a component of the minimum package of
services. As noted over this time period each of these technical changes turned out to be more complex than
initially thought and took considerably more time than estimated to implement.39
40. Revision of the institutional arrangements. Decrees were expected to establish (by November 15,
2004) the National Nutrition Office (ONN) to coordinate implementation of the policy with oversight
provided by the National Nutrition Council (CNN). In addition, supervision was devolved to the six
provinces (and then, beginning in 2006) to the 22 regions and 111 districts, and NGO interventions were
reorganized according to administrative criteria to link them more closely with the decentralized communes,
thereby increasing the responsibility of the communes for the monitoring of the nutritional situation.
41. However, nominations for CNN were not approved by the Council of Ministers until two years later
(in latter 2006), greatly impeding CNN‘s planned activities as well as its oversight responsibilities for
national strategies, program budgets, and national reporting. The political problems affecting the CNN also
affected the responsibilities for the ONN and project management; the post of national project coordinator
was filled by an interim manager, and the transfer of the project team to the ONN (expected to be finalized
by project closing on December 31, 2005) was delayed because of the pending nomination.
42. The Government also considered a wholesale revision of the community nutrition approach by
replacing the locally recruited NGOs with community-based organizations (CBOs). The Bank rightly
opposed this proposal, arguing that the existing approach had been evaluated with scientific rigor, presented
internationally by the Prime Minister, and recognized as a best practice by the Bank40. Eventually, it was
agreed to pilot the community-based approach in 94 sites, and the subsequent evaluation found that the CBO
could not match the technical and operational capabilities of the NGOs41.
43. Introduction of program financing. Beginning in July 2004, program interventions were to be financed
by the national budget with PRSC support while the credit would continue to finance management,
monitoring and evaluation, and capacity strengthening activities to ensure the smooth transition of the
community-based activities by. While this was an important step in the right direction, in practice, project
financing became an increasingly problematic issue42; delays in ratifying the supplemental credit and the
initial PRSC resulted in the project receiving virtually no financing during the period January-August 2004
and the Government allocated only US$ 2.0 million which were only received later, thus postponing the

   For instance, the June 2007 aide-mémoire notes that the minimum gain initiative, introduced in 2005, was still not being
systematically used by the Community Nutrition Agents because of a lack of understanding and calculating problems.

42
   In October 2005, the aide-mémoire noted that the integration of the project and the ONN as well as the transition to a program
 approach were ―probably premature‖.


                                                              10
projected expansion of sites until 2005. Community-level activities were particularly hard hit during this
period: some NGOs were not paid, and the school-based iron supplementation and deworming programs
were canceled for the 2004-05 academic year.
44. In subsequent years, as shown in the following table, there were often significant differences between
initial and revised budgets and between revised budgets and actual expenditures.
                              Table 3: ONN budget allocations/expenditures (billion MGA)

                              Initial budget               31.9        17.4       15.9            11.4
                              Revised budget               31.9        12.8       15.4            16.4
                              Expenditures                 16.8         4.4       13.3             9.3


45. Given the delays and difficulties in transitioning from a project to a program (i.e., Seecaline to ONN)
and in assuring adequate financing for the community interventions, it was decided to extend the project by a
year to better prepare the groundwork for this transition. Concomitantly, as discussed above, additional
financing was requested on the basis that: (i) the resources of the existing Supplemental Financing were
already fully committed; (ii) Government financial projections (in August 2006) showed that internal
revenues for the coming years would not be sufficient to cover the additional investment required to expand
activities and institutionalize the national Nutrition Policy; and (iii) the amount of additional financing
requested and the short implementation period would not justify the preparation of a new operation.43
46. September 2007-August 2011. As with the supplemental financing, significant delays (due to the
elections) preceded the effectiveness of the additional financing; though approved on October 26, 2006, the
additional financing was only declared effective on August 30, 200744. Not surprisingly, it is noted that PDO
and IP ratings declined precipitously and only intermittently showing some improvement until the last
months before project closing. In analyzing this period of the project, these ratings reflected prolonged
inaction on previously identified issues:
             Institutionally, both the National Nutrition Committee (CNN) and National Nutrition Office
              (ONN) were functional in 2007 and 2008, but operationally, the continuing lack of clarity in the
              roles and responsibilities (primarily over coordination and M&E) led the Bank to request an
              institutional assessment. In addition, project management suffered from the departure and/or
              firing of experienced high level staff (in early 2008) with resulting deficiencies in planning,
              budgeting, procurement, and financial management.
             Programmatically, there were concerns that new community nutrition strategies and initiatives
              were being introduced without adequate evaluation or development of operational modalities and
              to the detriment of existing proven strategies.
             Financially, there were concerns as to whether the Government would be able to finance the
              recurrent costs posed by ONN and its operational branch, ONN/SEECALINE, in the short and
              medium terms, particularly in view of the past evidence of overly ambitious objectives and
              insufficient financing and the future proposal (as reflected in the 2008 ONN operational plan) to
              reduce ONN funds allocated to community nutrition activities by 30% (May 2008 AM).
47.    Finally, civil unrest beginning in December 2008 reversed the gains made in the previous six months


43
   The Project Paper noted that regional management: (i) endorsed the Additional Financing while acknowledging the implications
for an unusually long project life; but (ii) stipulated that in the future, any additional financing that may be required would be
addressed through a new project.

                                                                  11
of technical discussions, with resulting downgrades across the board. As of March 17, 2009, following a
change in Government, the Bank's portfolio was subject to OP/BP 7.30 Dealing with De Facto Governments,
whereby applications for replenishment of special accounts were put on hold (ISR 25). During this period,
ONN pre-financed project staff and activities (ISR 25). On May 11, 2011, authorization was granted by the
Managing Director to resume the entire Madagascar portfolio (ISR 27); on the same day, the Government
urgently requested new lending for the community nutrition program to protect earlier gains and to prevent
Malagasy children under the age of three from slipping into acute malnutrition (ISR 27). It is important to
note that, after the period of retro-active extension from November 2010 to July 2011, changes in the central
team (Project Management Unit) contributed to an improvement in implementation of technical and financial
activities, which were not performing as well between 2007 and 2009.
48. In summary, although disbursements remained consistently high over the life of the project,
implementation performance varied significantly with: (i) periods of high performance, especially through
the Mid-Term Review; (ii) variable performance linked with a succession of natural disasters and periods of
political instability; and (iii) low performance associated with the transition from a project approach to a
program approach. Overall, the project was most successful where the arrangements described in the PAD
were followed; was reasonably successful in adapting them to a series of unplanned emergencies and
unanticipated situations; and was least successful in combining an ongoing project approach with new
modalities for development financing at the program level.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
49.    M&E design.
50. The key features of the M&E were expected to be: (i) surveys conducted at district level prior to
project implementation, at mid-term, and at completion; (ii) routine data monitoring at provincial level; and
(iii) standard quarterly, semi-annual and annual reviews combined with periodic supervision, a mid-term
review, and an ICR. Two PHRD grants contributed significantly to strengthening the analytic underpinnings
of the operation. The initial PHRD grant (TF 029249, approved on September 20, 1995) financed three
studies carried out by local institutions: (i) an anthropometric survey to assess the current rates of acute and
chronic malnutrition among children under five; (ii) a study on the prevalence of parasitic infections among
school-aged children; and (iii) a beneficiary assessment to assess communities' own perceptions of
malnutrition, its causes and desired solutions. 45 A second PHRD grant (TF 025442, approved on November
10, 1997) financed: (i) an assessment of the prevalence of anemia and vitamin A deficiency among children
and pregnant women; and (ii) a qualitative and quantitative analysis of food consumption habits.46
51. The baseline measures and the results of these studies could have been discussed in more detail in the
PAD. Also, given the previous project‘s experience with monitoring and evaluation and the PHRD grants
focusing in part on monitoring and evaluation, the PAD write up should have been stronger in its discussion
of the proposed M&E activities and arrangements, in its description of the KPIs in Annex 1, and on the
financing implications of the proposed features.
52. There were some weaknesses in the overall design for M&E as presented in the PAD. With the
exception of the mid-term review, the timing and financing of periodic project evaluation studies (e.g.,
prevalence of malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and helminth infections) was not explicitly
determined; as a result, some studies to determine indicator results were never carried out while other studies
on a variety of topics were carried out. Neither Annex 1 of the PAD nor the DCA presented the KPIs with
clear baselines and targets; rather the DCA deferred to the project implementation manual, which used


45
   The original objectives of the grant were to: (i) define a package of community nutrition services (through an analysis of existing
practices, the results of the DHS, and beneficiary opinions); (ii) develop a school health and nutrition program; (iii) suggest IEC and
training strategies; and (iv) propose an effective M&E system for project management. These were modified after the December
1996 identification mission.
46
   The grant also financed preparation of a project implementation manual defining the technical, financial and administrative
elements of the proposed project.


                                                                 12
absolute numbers in some of the indicators while the PAD had suggested proportions. There were additional
issues that resulted from the varying age groups, the particularities of periodicity for nutrition data collection
and reporting, and differing formats for presenting and collating information. The monitoring of the cost-
effectiveness of the interventions, discussed in detail in Annex 4 of the PAD, is not mentioned in the design.
53. Implementation. With respect to nationally representative surveys, two series were conducted during
the project by the National Statistical Institute (INSTAT): (i) the Demographic and Health Surveys published
in 1994, 1997, 2003-04, and 2008-09 (with support from Macro); and (ii) the anthropometric surveys,
initiated under the PHRD in 1998 and continued in 2004, 2007, and 2011 (with technical support from the
Bank). . The anthropometric surveys, in particular, provide: (i) a consistent and methodologically rigorous
approach over the entire project period; and (ii) a means for comparing results at different periods in time for
cohorts of children participating in varying degrees in the community nutrition program.
54. At the mid-term review, the follow-up studies identified in the PAD were conducted and contributed to
a very comprehensive and thorough MTR. Additional studies, surveys, and data collection instruments were
introduced, such as the sentinel site system for iron and vitamin A which was established by the Ministry of
Health to replace a planned national baseline micronutrient survey; and (as mentioned above) the use of the
anthropometric surveys both to evaluate the previous phases and to provide an ex-ante baseline for the
subsequent phases of the project.
55. With respect to routine data monitoring, the ISRs generally rated M&E as satisfactory through the mid-
term review. They noted) that: (i) the reporting systems were in place and functioning; and (ii) consultants
had been hired (in 2001) to assist in development of the new information system. Periodic project reports
show that systematic monitoring information was being collected, including monthly information on both
outcomes and outputs (weight-for-age, by age group) as well as inputs (e.g., Vitamin A and food
supplementation, percent of mothers participating in cooking demonstrations, number of home visits, etc.)
for each community nutrition site included in the project. In 2003, M&E was criticized for its confusing
reports on the project‘s activities. An effort to code all community registries from 1999-2003 resulted in the
creation of a ‗logiciel‘ to continue data collection at the central level; unfortunately, the program was never
implemented because of lack of funding from ONN to PNNC post-2004 for this specific purpose.
56. With the change from project to program implementation, it was recognized that measures would be
required to: (i) strengthen M&E for both the ONN and the community nutrition program; and (ii) ensure
adequate financing of the system would be required. There were two notable challenges with respect to
M&E: : 1) there were significant delays in establishing the M&E system at national level47; and 2) though
the credit financed M&E there was no provision for the operating costs at community level48. The M&E
system was, however, subsequently completed before the end of the project.
57. In 2007 and throughout 2009 and 2010 (as a result of the on-going political crisis), the reliability of the
monitoring data on implementation varied; and M&E was subsequently downgraded to moderately
unsatisfactory. A new technical unit, established from mid 2010, reiterated the importance of monitoring
data and revamped the data entry program. It must also be noted, that one of the key strengths of the




47
  Because recruitment of TA for the M&E system took longer than expected (ISR 21), the Bank provided interim M&E assistance in
2007; a year later, TA had been recruited and was providing support to the elaboration of an M&E manual and related tools and
preparation of training. (ISR 23). In the meantime, unable to acquire clear, unquestioned data on the progress of the indicators, the
Bank insisted on a technical audit to be completed by September 2008. (ISR 22) In May 2011, the ISR noted that finalization of the
M&E software and testing at the ONN level in progress and user training at central and regional levels

48
  Though the credit was expected to finance M&E, it did not finance the operating costs at the community level, including those
needed for sound supervision and M&E (e.g., scales, registers, etc.) which were fundamental for the previous success of the system.
(AM June 2006).



                                                                13
program was the data collection and recording system at the community level by the CNAs was very strong
with records generally being complete and timely. On the other hand, the transmission of this data to the
higher levels was challenging. To address this issue, the project implemented a pilot with data collection and
transmission through mobile phones to facilitate transmission of data.
58. Separate M&E data were collected from 2000 to 2005 on expenditures for comparison with the PAD‘s
estimate of the project‘s cost per intervention and per beneficiary. Unfortunately, some of the data are
incomplete and inconsistent with other data collected by the project, and the results were seldom referenced
during the supervision missions. This may be due in part to the fact that the quality of the information was
dependent on the local NGOs49, who were recruited to assist, supervise, and collect data from the community
nutrition agents, and declined when delayed financial payments constrained their activities in the field.
59. To complement project data, the results reported in Annex 2 are pulled together from reliable data
sources to ensure the quality of the information.
60. Utilization. Utilization of the data varied according with the implementation period. From 1998 to
2001 (and through the end of the first phase of the project in 2003), monitoring of project implementation
was detailed and consistent. The data were discussed regularly and contributed to a successful mid-term
review in 2001. Subsequently, through 2007, technical information was shared within the project (and
through technical sub-groups such as GAIN), but the institutional mechanisms for a broader dialogue on
nutrition were not sufficiently operational and the informational basis was subject to debate. There were also
expressed concerns about the less than rigorous studies used to identify new community nutrition sites (see
for example AM June 2006). From 2008 on technical and financial difficulties as well as the prevailing
political situation impeded the collection, analysis, and utilization of the information.
61. Overall, M&E is rated Substantial on the basis of the assessment of the M&E in the project and the
two large scale, nationally representative surveys carried out multiple times over the life of the project. In
particular, the high-quality anthropometric surveys that measured impact over time and the DHS which
provided overall population outcomes related to key indicators during project implementation.(High); and
(ii) the design, implementation, and utilization of M&E data over the life of the project (Substantial). While
there were some weaknesses during design and implementation, the two studies show the significant positive
impact of the project over the period of implementation. The most recent measures for strengthening
monitoring and evaluation is promising but financial sustainability may likely continue to be an issue,
particularly if the number of sites continues to increase.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
62. Environment. The environment category of the project at the time of appraisal was C, with the
overall assessment that the project would likely have a positive impact on the environment since it would
contribute to improve hygiene and sanitation in schools and villages.
63. Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management. With only minor exceptions, the ISRs
rated fiduciary performance as satisfactory during implementation: (i) procurement performance was
downgraded to MU towards the end of the project and then upgraded to MS; and (ii) financial management
was rated U in the year following the mid-term review and (briefly) MU during the political crisis of 2009-10
before being upgraded to MS. In each case, however, problems identified early in the project persisted
throughout implementation which indicates that there was inadequate resolution to these issues.
64. Procurement. There were recurring concerns about: (i) the organization and monitoring of the
procurement plan; (ii) the conformity of the bidding with the Bank‘s procedures; and (iii) the completeness
of the tendering and contracting documentation. In addition, after the establishment of the ONN, there were
discussions about its internal organization, and subsequently an internal auditor was recruited for the project.

65. Disbursement and financial management. FM missions identified a number of minor errors in the
DRFs (e.g., mislabeling of items purchased, lack of arithmetical verification of the invoices, etc.) and several
other more important issues (e.g., poor internal controls, insufficient justification of the expenditure, etc.).
66. There were two principal problems throughout the project: (i) the timely replenishment of accounts;
and (ii) the organizational arrangements for financial management. During the project phase, timely
replenishments were a problem: (i) at central level (due to insufficient amounts of working capital resulting
from low availability of funds in the special account); (ii) at provincial (and subsequently regional) level; and
(iii) at local level where NGOs were slow and not always accurate in their presentation of the financial
situation. To remedy the situation, the Bank increased the amount of the special account. During the
program phase, cash flow problems persisted: (i) where they were linked to slow ratification of the
supplemental and additional credits, the Bank agreed to advance funds and be reimbursed later, a measure
which adequately addressed this issue in regards to Bank funding. On the other hand, where Government
funds were systematically reduced and/or disbursed tardily, the Bank, unfortunately, could only express its
concern. (see AM, May 2008)
67. Institutionally, the change from the project to the program approach was marked initially by somewhat
parallel disbursement arrangements; for instance, it was agreed that allocations and disbursements under
Credit 30601 would involve a single category grouping all the former categories but that the Project Unit
would maintain its internal accounting systems unchanged. Subsequently, as funding for community
nutrition shifted to the Government, planning, budgeting, and disbursement procedures were adapted as
appropriate (e.g., financing of regions and NGOs based on their quarterly action plan); additional changes
were implemented, based on updated financial accounting manuals, modified accounting methods and tools,
and trained staff and recipients at the different levels.
68. Over the first eighteen months of project implementation, the financial system of the first project
remained in place and was used to monitor the financial data. Subsequently, several different accounting
systems were used: (i) for the different credits, the system in place was changed to TOMPRO in 2005; and
(ii) the accounting for the PRSC and the HIPC funds used one system (RHM Compta 2) while the accounting
for the different credits used one system (through 2005) and then TOMPRO thereafter. Not only were there
delays in producing the financial situation (particularly for the PRSC), but the accounting system did not
automatically produce consolidated financial statements reflecting activities from all funding sources (PRSC,
HIPC, the Counterpart Fund of government and the credit of I'IDA). As a result, the FMR, required
beginning in 2004 (with Credit 30601), were generally produced manually (using excel) and resulted in a
number of issues around the accuracy of the calculations, the presentation of the data, which could likely
have compromised data quality.
69. Annual audits were carried out on time, were without qualification, and were generally followed by
actions to implement the recommendations.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
70. In three respects, the task team and the government team have already addressed the post-completion
issue and have incorporated, not without significant difficulties 50 , several aspects of what might be
considered its next phase:
          Institutionally, while the transition from project to program had teething problems and some
           negative consequences for the project’s performance, it did contribute to the long-term issue of how
           to address malnutrition in the country. The roles and functions of the National Nutrition Committee,
           the National Nutrition Office, and the National Community Nutrition Program have been debated
           both generally (2004-07) and specifically (since 2007 when the decree was actually adopted); and

     These difficulties are succinctly summarized in the Bank‘s review of the PHN Sector portfolio (July 2008).

         been agreed on. While not entirely resolved, the key structures are functional.
        Programmatically, the National Nutrition Plan (2005-09) has been evaluated, and the future National
         Nutrition Plan is being prepared as a long-term basis for promoting an intersectoral approach to
         tackling malnutrition. Support for a package of integrated activities (involving the health sector) and
         for the community nutrition agents seem assured, thus creating local capacity to deal with
         malnutrition and to initiate changes in caring practices related to the preparation of food, hygiene,
         and feeding at the household level, especially for children and pregnant and lactating women. The
         potential intervention of other key actors at the community level (e.g., the NGOs) seems unlikely
         despite the evidence of their usefulness. Schools have integrated sustainable nutrition programs.
        Financially, the Government‘s proposed contribution has always exceeded its actual expenditures,
         with amounts varying substantially over the period 2004-09 (particularly in anticipation then of the
         end of the project). However, based on a comparison of expenditures for community nutrition from
         1999-2005 and from 2006-2009, annual expenditures are five times greater during the latter period;
         in other words, the Government has supported the community approach financially, which is a
         reflection of its political commitment.
3.   Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
71. The relevance of the project's development objectives, components, is Substantial taking into account:
(i) the project‘s initial objectives and design using a multi-sectoral approach to address malnutrition in
Madagascar; (ii) the synergy of the principles developed in the different PRSP and CAS with the strategic
orientations of the Madagascar Action Plan and the National Nutrition Policy; (iii) the project‘s capacity to
evolve and adapt as a national response to malnutrition (initially decentralized in the six provinces and then
in the 22 regions) and as an emergency response and social safety net (after the cyclones of 2000 and the
political crisis of 2002); and (iv) the potential for replacing a project approach with a program approach for
lending and implementation. The relevance rating is broken down in the following manner:
        PDO relevance (High): The PDO relevance was high throughout the project. The project‘s
         objectives represented a logical extension of the previous project.                Throughout project
         implementation, the objectives of the project corresponded closely to the orientations of key strategic
         documents51 and the country‘s strategic and programmatic actions to combat malnutrition.
        Design and Implementation (Substantial): Design and implementation was strong overall with
         some shortcomings that were addressed during implementation. The initial design allowed for
         adaptation of the project to expand the geographic scope, to promote a multi-sectoral approach, and
         to enhance support for community-based interventions. The implementation arrangements allowed
         for both significant progress during normal times and a flexibility in mitigating the impact of natural
         and political crises on the poor by restructuring the existing portfolio and providing emergency
         support (as described in the Interim CAS (2002). As the project evolved, (ii) the initial emphasis on
         quality was diluted in favor of a rapid nationwide expansion; and (iii) its implementation
         arrangements were intended both to streamline current administrative and financial management
         practices and to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions in the country. As a result of the
         move from a project to programmatic focus, the design features (technical approaches and

   For the supplementary financing the underlying documents were the PRSP (2003), the CAS (2003). The project was considered
one of the key operations of the 2003 CAS, which sought to impact rural poverty and to protect the most vulnerable against shocks.
In the case of the Additional Financing, the project‘s objectives corresponded to the 2007 CAS‘s view of nutrition as central to
achieving the objectives of reducing bottlenecks to investment and growth in rural areas and improving the scope and quality of
service delivery



                                                               16
        measurements issues) were the source of continuing and time-consuming debates during project
        implementation; and (iii) its implementation arrangements involved ongoing discussions between the
        Bank and the Borrower over the dual goals of creating an institutional ―home‖ for nutrition and
        identifying appropriate implementation and fiduciary arrangements for implementing a program
        approach for lending.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
72. The results of the Outcome and Intermediate indicators are summarized below. Project efficacy is
rated Substantial; most of the targets have been fully or partially achieved. In particular, the project
contributed to the following key results:
              Children’s nutrition status improved considerably, as measured by both the project monitoring
               system and by the series of anthropometric surveys.
              Households are more aware of nutritional issues and communities (with support from health
               facilities, local NGOs, and the elected CNAs) better understand how to combat the problem of
               malnutrition, as documented by the beneficiary assessments.
              The institutional and policy frameworks have been revamped, as shown by establishment of the
               ONN and adoption of the PNAN which augurs well for the sustainability of the programmatic
               achievements to which the project contributed.

74. The efficacy rating is based on the following main results (as discussed in Annex 2). To facilitate the
assessment of outcomes, the following discussion is linked both to the summary of ratings by PDO and to the
specific results presented in Section F of the Data Sheet.
75. Project Development Objective 1: Improve nutritional status of children and women in the
project target areas. With regard to the first key outcome indicator, (reduction in the rate of underweight
children), two sources provide information for evaluating results: (i) the monitoring and evaluation system
which collected data throughout the project period; and (ii) the anthropometric studies conducted in 1998,
2004, 2007, and 201152. The project monitoring and evaluation system measured the results of sites covered
by the project (and subsequently, the program) and provides annual data on the evolution of the nutritional
situation. As can be seen from the figure below, over the duration of the project, the proportion of
underweight children has progressively declined by approximately half in the under 3 age group (from 36.1%

importantly, for children under 2 with an almost ten percentage point decrease over five years for both age
groups.

76. The anthropometric studies were organized in collaboration with the Bank to track the impact of the
project in the project sites and in the control sites; the studies were conducted in 108 (of 111) districts in
1997 and in all districts in 2004, 2007, and 2010. The anthropometrics surveys were administered to the
same communities over time, allowing for tracking overall changes in the economic environment as well as
underlying trends in nutritional outcomes. The impact evaluation compares program and non-program
communities, before and (at different points) after the initiation of the program. With a credible
counterfactual analysis, the evaluation study provides an estimate of the change in malnutrition outcomes
that can be causally attributed to the project. With the exception of Senegal, this impact evaluation stands
out as one of the few large scale evaluations of community based nutrition programs within the Bank, and
one of the few studies that tracks impact over a long time period. The descriptive trends in Figure 2 below
show that malnutrition rates exhibited an important decline over time, and notably, important differentials
between the Seecaline and non-Seecaline sites. These trends were confirmed by a careful econometric
analysis.

   The rate among children under 3 years of age, has slowed in the last five years as expected This is consistent with data from other
countries where the rate of decline is expected to be higher when prevalence is high, and the rate of decline slows down when lower
prevalence rate are achieved.

77.       In addition, the studies found the following:
                                               The 2004 study focused essentially on the gains made in the Seecaline communities,
                                                noting that the prevalence of underweight children declined by more than 30% in
                                                Seecaline sites but by only 17% in non-Seecaline sites.54
                                               The 2007 study concluded that the program helped 0-5 year old children in the
                                                participating communities to bridge their gap in weight for age z-score and the
                                                incidence of underweight. That is, over the period of 1999 and 2004, the estimated
                                                effect of the availability of the program at the community level on the incidence of
                                                underweight ranges between 5.2 and 7.5 percentage points. Considering that the
                                                program was gradually phased out after operating on average for three years, the
                                                adjusted estimate was only 1.7-2.5% impact per year for participating areas. Further,
                                                considering that malnutrition could improve over time, independently of the program,
                                                as a result of general economic growth, the study concludes that the overall share of
                                                the observed change in malnutrition rates between 1997/98 and 2004 that can be
                                                attributed to the program using the estimates above ranges between 26-37% 55 .
                                                Finally, the study noted:
                                                       (i)        Gains were larger for households living in relatively less poor areas, in
                                                                  relatively less remote villages with relatively better infrastructure
                                                                  (communes with access to electricity, secondary schools, and hospitals);
                                                                  and

recent study design are worth noting:56
        Because the design involves revisiting the same communities over time across the country, it nets out
         any observable and unobservable characteristics at the community level that could confound
         program effects; and
        Because the design relies on the estimated gains or impact of having the program available at the
         village level (and thus to both participating and non-participating households in program villages), it
         constitutes a conservative estimate of the gains of the program.
        Further, because the nutrition program was rolled out in two phases (prior to and after 2005) and
         each phase was associated with significantly different institutional arrangements, the 2011 study
         estimates the nutritional gains separately for each phase.
79. The 2011 study found a significant improvement in anthropometric outcomes and in socio-economic
indicators compared to the 2004 surveys but also that: (i) impact was confined mainly to the communities
that had opened before 2004; and (ii) gains estimated in 2004 for the communities that had opened before
2004 were sustained in 2011, albeit with a lower magnitude except that weight for age remained significantly
improved in 2011. Two further findings are particularly important: (i) no significant long-term benefit was
found in 2011 for new communities opened after 2004 as compared with communities which never
participated; and (ii) gains in nutritional outcomes are significant only if communities continue their
involvement in the program: communities that ‗closed‘ after 2004 had a significant impact up to 2004, but
did not sustain the gains that were accrued through 2004.
80. These findings from the anthropometric surveys are consistent with other impact evaluations, as noted
by IEG in a recent analysis of such efforts57. What is particularly important about the Seecaline studies is
that they begin to suggest: (i) which parts; (ii) under what conditions; and (iii) for whom a large-scale
nutrition intervention can work.
81. With respect to the other development outcome indicators linked to this PDO58, as noted in the data
sheet, measuring these indicators as originally defined was too costly and impractical. Subsequently, as part
of the 2006 additional financing, these indicators were dropped in favor of only keeping indicators on
supplementation that have direct causal links to improvements in these outcomes. Data from two key
sources are available and can provide overall measures of improvement. First, the monitoring and evaluation
system indicates for selected years that there was an expansion in coverage at the project sites through 2005
and then of the national program through 2010 (see Table 5). In addition, results from the DHS conducted
over the period of project implementation (1997, 2004, and 2008) confirm these broad improvements in
coverage of key nutritional interventions. The results are presented in Table 6.

   IEG concluded that there was no clear pattern of impacts across interventions—in every intervention group there were examples of
programs that did and did not have an impact on a given indicator, and with varying magnitudes. See IEG, What can we learn from
nutrition impact evaluations? (2010), p. viii.

82. The DHS results show increases in Vitamin A utilization, decreases in the proportion of mothers and
children suffering from anemia, and a large proportion of children taking deworming medication. Progress
on iron supplementation during pregnancy was more limited and in some cases there were setbacks,
reflecting the enormous challenges which remain, particularly in light of the precarious political and
economic situation in the country. The long-term financing provided by the Bank over the past decade has
contributed to these improvements, particularly as it was one of the single most important sources of funding
for the national scale up of nutritional interventions. In addition to directly contributing to a decrease in
malnutrition the project contributed to an increase in Vitamin A coverage 59, both of which appear to have
reduced the risks associated with infant and child mortality, as reflected in steady declines over the life of the
project.60.

   Among micronutrient deficiencies, vitamin A and zinc are the greatest contributors to disease burden because of their direct
effects on child health. Deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc were estimated to be responsible for 600 000 and 500 000 deaths,
respectively, and combined, 9.8% of global childhood DALYs. The effects of iron and iodine deficiencies on child deaths are small,
and as a result, these conditions resulted in fewer DALYs lost, though their impacts on cognitive development, educability, and
future economic productivity potential are considerable. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for maternal mortality, and is estimated to be
responsible for 115 000 deaths per year and 0.4% of global total DALYs. Sub-optimal breastfeeding increases the risk of poor
nutrient intake and illness and was estimated to be responsible for 1.4 million child deaths and 44 million DALYs (10% of all
DALYs in children less than 5 years old). Together these risk factors were responsible for more than one-third—about 35%—of
under-five child deaths and 11% of the global total disease burden.

60
   Infant Mortality Rate (under-one mortality, probability of dying by age one per 1000 live births) significantly decreased from 84
2001 to 49 in 2009. The child mortality rate (under-five mortality, probability of dying by age five per 1,000 live births) steadily
decreased from 159 in 1997 to 72 in 2008.

83. The intermediate outcome indicators measured included: (i) improved coverage of growth monitoring
to enhance the impact of community nutrition services on malnutrition nationwide; and (ii) improved
management of nutrition services at the district level to strengthen capabilities for nutritional rehabilitation;
the results are presented in Annex 2 and summarized below.
84. As seen from the figures below, with respect to children enrolled in growth monitoring and women
involved in growth monitoring and promotion there has been an impressive increase in the number of
beneficiaries over the past decade. Coverage for children enrolled in growth monitoring fluctuated annually
but rose to over 90% by 2011 which reflects the scale and scope of these interventions reaching an increasing
proportion of the target population. The results must also be further appreciated given that in the higher
percentile coverage rates (80% and above) it takes more effort and resources to make significant
improvements as compared to starting out at a lower coverage rate. The absolute numbers of women reached
also increased but the proportion is not readily available.

85. Cumulatively, more than 10,000 CNAs were trained over the life of the project. The anthropometric
studies analyzed the technical skills of the community nutrition workers over the different impact studies.
The 2004 and 2007 studies collected comparable socio-economic and cultural information (age, marital
status, number of children, etc). What is notable is that the 2011 study found the selection process of CNAs
in the post-2005 (‗newly‘) participating communities resulted in a selection of lower ability community
workers which points out the issues that the program faced with regards to quality control in quality
implementation by these CNAs with respect to other characteristics. Specifically, combined with a more
theoretical training, the study notes that the later cohort of CNAs made less use of the IEC materials,
reported conveying fewer messages in their normal activities, and had more difficulties in conveying
messages about feeding infants and introducing complementary feeding. As a result, those mothers living in
the post-2005 sites reported significantly lower perceived benefits from having participated in the program
which in turn can be linked to results on outcome indicators during this same time period. 61 It should be
mentioned that in later years of project implementation, there were issues with the quality of the regional
trainers. Many of them did not master key concepts which contributed to the quality of the training provided
to the CNAs and in turn, reduced their competencies. A comprehensive exercise was undertaken in 2011 by
the regional teams which allowed the program to identify gaps in knowledge among the CNAs that were
subsequently addressed62 by qualified trainers.


86. With respect to (ii) improved management of nutrition by district health services, the project met its
objectives for training in IMCI (IO 5) at the time of the mid-term review, and partial data on the number of
severely malnourished children adequately rehabilitated at hospitals and health centers (IO 6) indicate that
the project likely met its target for this indicator, as discussed in Annex 2.
     87. Project Development Objective 2: Ensure long-term sustainability of nutrition outcomes by
         improving the quality and quantity of food intake by children at home. Two outcome indicators
         are linked to this PDO. As noted in the data sheet, the targets for both of these indicators were
         achieved:
                             Outcome Indicator 5 (Quality and quantity of food provided to children under 3
                             has improved). Progress under this indicator was assessed along 4 dimensions in the
                             anthropometric surveys (figure 5).
                            Outcome Indicator 6 (Number of communities implementing nutrition related
                             activities). Project monitoring data was used to assess progress under this outcome
                             indicator. As indicated in the data sheet, the project successfully introduced the
                             community nutrition model in the country and expanded to 1,337 communities across
                             the country (surpassing the target of 1,200).

88. The 2011 anthropometric study also provides encouraging results, especially for the ―early participant‖
(pre-2005) group who: (i) scored significantly higher than the ―never participant‖ group in terms of enhanced
knowledge; (ii) had a significantly higher proportion of mothers reporting exclusive breastfeeding (for first 6
months) as compared to the ―never participant‖ group; and (iii) had a higher knowledge of proper meal
preparation practice as compared to the ‗never participant‘ group63.
89. A broader discussion of these issues in the background report for the Country Status Review (CSR)
provides an enhanced perspective noting that while the overall level of knowledge about child nutrition and
care is ―dismally low‖ in Madagascar, mothers living in Seecaline villages exhibit a higher level of
knowledge (even controlling for maternal education). Further, estimates show significant signs of behavioral
change in hygiene practices, with more appropriate disposal of garbage, toilet use, and improved methods of
water purification. 64
90. The intermediate outcome indicators seek to measure the ability of communities and schools to address
nutrition in general and the nutrition of school-age children in particular. The table below summarizes
existing data by year for the number of communities implementing nutrition activities, number of school
teachers training in nutrition, and number of school based activities. 65

   On the other hand, the ‗new participant‘ group had significantly lower proportions of women reporting good hygiene practices for

During the life of the project there was good progress on this group of indicators, which aim to capture the
capacity of communities and schools to address nutrition-related issues. In 2005-2006 these activities were
subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Education in an effort to mainstream these interventions.
Three Intermediate Outcome Objectives aim to capture the development of national capacity which is critical
to sustain a scaled-up nutrition program. As indicated in the Data Sheet, IO 10 (development of materials
related to food security), IO 11 (establishment of an operational CNN and ONN); and IO 12 (installation of
an operational monitoring and evaluation system) address efforts to enhance the capacity of the nutrition
program. All three were achieved.
91. Overall achievement result. In summary, the project‘s achievements particularly during the period
1999-2005 were high and significant in at least three key aspects:
           There was an important contribution to the reduction in the incidence of underweight children.
           There were proven effects of keeping vulnerable children (particularly 0-6 months) in the program
            for an additional year66.
           (iii) There was a strong positive correlation of the anthropometric measures in the first three years
            of life (2004) with the verbal and non-verbal outcomes at ages three to six years (2007).67

As result of these improvements, PDO 1 is rated substantial. The project contributed to significant declines
in malnutrition rates in the country from 1998 to 2011 in spite of the difficult country context stemming from
the protracted political crises and recurrent natural disasters.
92. With respect to PDO 2, the capacity enhancements made during the initial phase of the project
(involving skilled and motivated CNAs capable of communicating important messages and involving
communities and schools in the effort to reduce malnutrition) were substantial and continue to give
credibility and visibility to the national nutrition effort, even though there was some decline in the quality of
the services provided. As previously discussed, while there were implementation challenges in moving from
a project to a program approach, this institutional shift was essential in establishing nutrition as a national
priority, which is in turn, has been and remains critical for improved and sustained outcomes over the longer
term. As a result, PDO 2 is rated Substantial.
3.3 Efficiency
93. Annex 4 of the PAD argued for public financing of nutrition interventions, citing the dual need to
tackle poverty and redress inequities. The annex also analyzes two types of efficiencies for consideration:
allocative efficiency and technical efficiency.
94.       Allocative efficiencies address issues related to the project providing: (i) immediate health outcomes

Program,‖ Journal of African Economies‖ (January 2011), 3.

                                                                 25
where malnutrition is linked with greater risks of dying among pregnant women and children; and (ii) longer
term effects of nutrition and health status on cognitive development and school performance. The Bank‘s
1997 CAS clearly articulated the case for the allocative efficiency of nutrition in Madagascar, arguing that
where poverty may not decrease significantly in the near future, cost effective strategies to address the high
prevalence of malnutrition would: (i) decrease maternal and child morbidity and mortality rates in the short
term; (ii) support primary education for children in the medium-term; and (iii) impact positively on children's
productivity and capacity in later life as a result of interventions in early age.
95. Even more importantly, the most recent anthropometric survey, which followed a cohort of children
(who were 0-3 in 2004, 3-6 in 2007, and 7-10 in 2011) with the same battery of cognitive tests, reported that:
       in 2007, children 0-3 who were stunted had non-verbal test scores that were approximately 0.2 to 0.3
        standard deviations lower than children who were not stunted; and
     in 2011, the socio-economic differences in child development outcomes when 3-6 are not caught up
        when children are 7-10. The socio-economic gradients cumulated during early childhood either
        diverge or get crystallized at older ages.
In other words, the benefits of the financial and technical resources allocated for nutrition in 1998 are
becoming ever more apparent in 2011.
96. Technical efficiencies involved using preventive nutrition interventions to reach specific target groups,
with the maximum possible impact being achieved at the lowest possible cost by focusing on proven cost
effective interventions: (i)micronutrient supplementation programs (at less than US$ 50 per DALY gained);
(ii) treatment of helminth infections among children 3-14 years of age (at US$ 8 to US$ 30 per DALY) to
reduce infection rates among the most heavily infected group and transmission rates to the rest of the
population; and (iii) food supplementation targeted to children under three and pregnant women to yield
higher benefits at lesser cost.
97. Technical efficiencies were of two types: those linked to the nutrition interventions and those linked to
the efficiency of the programmatic arrangements. In addition to the initial selection of targeted populations
and selected interventions, the project introduced innovative elements to increase efficiency in delivering
interventions. These included: (i) the organization of nutrition sites by commune to avoid overlapping NGO
presences; (ii) the application of the weight gain concept (GMMPA) which was found to be much more
effective in making mothers understand the progress in growth of their children; (iii) the use of spot-mapping
to help communities visualize their community and increase their participation and involvement in the
development of them (ISR 15); and (iv) the introduction of phones to provide CNAs with continual access to
answers to nutritional questions. Other initiatives, including: (i) CBOs to replace the NGOs; and (ii)
additional activities to the minimum package (e.g., early childhood development activities), were considered
promising, tested, and ultimately abandoned.
98. It was also expected that the adoption of specific institutional arrangements would contribute to
efficiency. Four types of institutional measures were expected to contribute to increased efficiency: (i) the
institutionalization of a program approach to replace a project approach; (ii) the multi-sectoral approach with
the distribution of responsibilities to different sectors based on their technical competencies; (iii) the
decentralization of project management to provincial (and subsequently regional and communal) level; and
(iv) the use of non-governmental actors (NGOs and Community Nutrition Agents) to organize interventions
and ensure adequate results at the community level. Though a couple of these were the source of some
disagreements and delays, they all probably contributed to improved efficiency.
99. In light of the sound rationale and evidence on both allocative and technical efficiency, efficiency is
rated substantial for the project as a whole.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
100. Based on considerations of the achievement of the indicators and the performance of the project
through different phases, the overall outcome rating for the project is moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
101. Poverty. The project was initially intended to address the rural poor, but political crises eventually led
authorities to expand it to the urban poor as well, where differences in adapting the community nutrition
strategy for the rural (and particularly remote) poor to the urban poor were observed, with respect to the
identification of children, the use of food supplements and weaning foods, etc. In addition, one study found
that nutritional gains were larger for households in relatively less poor and remote areas with relatively better
infrastructure (access to electricity, secondary schools, and hospitals), which raised the important policy
trade-off between targeting areas with higher needs or areas with the highest expected impact68.
102. Gender. Though pregnant and lactating women were the obvious beneficiaries of the project, it should
be noted that the Community Nutrition Agents were also beneficiaries. As stated in the project operations
manual, the CNA was expected to be a woman, elected by the community, with the requisite technical,
organizational, and social skills to run the site, which in practice meant that she should be able to read and
write, have experiences with taking care of children and be good at listening and giving advice to women.
As related in a number of studies, the relationship between mothers and CNAs was characterized by mutual
respect, with CNAs sometimes referred to as ―Madame Secaline.‖
103. In addition, the eventual inclusion of female adolescents (13-20 years old) in the nutritional monitoring
groups represented a response to the need to establish surveillance methods for future mothers of potentially
malnourished infants.
104. Social development. The community nutrition approach proved to be a useful collaborative model for
other interventions at the community level in two key respects: (i) during the initial implementation when the
community was required to establish a community site and select a CNA in order to participate; and during
implementation when obtaining food for the cooking demonstrations and other financial obligations rely on
the community. That very few communities involved in the community nutrition program chose to stop
participating during the five years of the project suggests both their satisfaction with the collaboration and
the feasibility of the arrangements for sustainability.

105. There have also been ancillary social developments. First, the Bank-supported HIV-AIDS project has
sought to use the Seecaline sites and nutrition agents as channels for delivering HIV/AIDS preventive
messages. Second, the introduction of mother-support groups after the mid-term review has created another
channel to reach the targeted women, and there has been interest in approaching members of these support
groups to become suppliers of basic health products such as bed nets, water purification, deworming tablets,
anti-malaria tablets, anti-conceptive, etc. (ISR 13)
106. Further, collaboration with local authorities proved important throughout the entire project period. The
balance of leverage between the project management and the local authorities tended to shift, with the project
management appearing to experience a stronger need for involvement by local authorities as the challenges
of sustaining the project became more apparent.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
107. A number of measures strengthened institutions intervening in nutrition-related activities at national,
regional, and local levels.
108. Central level. In promoting the multi sectoral nature of the nutrition program, the project contributed
to: (i) the overall understanding and strengthening of the roles and responsibilities of the National Nutrition
Council and the National Nutrition Office which provided an institutional ―home‖ for coordinating and
monitoring the multi sectoral program; and (ii) the adoption of signed memorandums of understanding
(MOU) with the participating ministries of health, education, and agriculture, which strengthened
accountability and focused attention on results. These MOU were important in mobilizing the 3600 nutrition
workers and over 28,000 volunteers to provide an effective outreach channel for these key sectors and for
population and decentralization which were also envisioned (ISR 15). They were particularly important in:
(i) organizing the identification and referral of severely malnourished children to the nutritional rehabilitation
centers (CRENI) located in the health facilities and counter referral back to the communities; and (ii)
disseminating guidelines and techniques for increasing agricultural production and conservation.
109. Project stakeholders also participated in inter-agency group for nutrition action (Groupe d'Action Inter-
agenciale pour la Nutrition or GAIN) to ensure informal discussion and collaboration on nutrition policy
among stakeholders in Madagascar.
110. Decentralized levels. At the provincial level, six provincial directorates were operational by the time
of the mid-term review. With the administrative reorganization, 22 regional directorates were subsequently
established and rendered operational.
111. Following the objectives of the National Nutrition Policy, the National Community Nutrition Program
(PNNC) integrated the commune level into the supervision chain as the Regional Nutrition Office supervised
the NGO‘s which relied on the animateurs to supervise the community nutrition agents. Particularly
important among these linkages were those between: (i) the NGO‘s (and their animateurs) and the CNAs as
the NGOs passed along the training received in managing project activities, nutrition, and social mobilization
and financial management; and (ii) the CNAs and the communities as the communal authorities noted their
usefulness in passing along messages on a variety of nutrition and non nutrition topics.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
112. The development of capacity among the local NGOs was an important by-product of the project. Bank
missions were impressed by the commitment of local implementing NGOs, which continued to implement
the project during the various crises even though they were reimbursed only afterwards when project
resources became available. Other agencies were also impressed, and NGOs that have worked (and were
trained) by the project are now bidding for new contracts with other projects, including Bank financed ones
such as the HIV/AIDS project. The NGOs also initiated certain interventions (producing local "artisanal"
weaning food with the help of local women's groups) and promoted others (such as the ―spot map‖ which
was quickly adopted by other community-level interventions).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
4.   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
113. Three types of risks are worth noting. First, given the diverse determinants (direct and indirect) of
malnutrition and the problems in achieving consensus and in implementing a coordinated response, there will
almost certainly be periodic institutional conflicts involving: (i) leadership among the different actors; and
(ii) choice of operational strategies. Second, linked to the debates over operational strategies were continual
methodological quarrels over the most effective and efficient program approaches (preventive or curative),
targeting groups of people (age, pregnant women and/or nursing children), choice of indicators used (P/T,
P/A, T/A, MUAC), vulnerability of geographical areas, etc. Though there is room for healthy debate,
previous discussions have often taken a significant toll in time and resources. Third, the Government‘s
inability to finance the program on the same scale in a timely manner remains another potential risk. Linked
to this is the broader, continued political and economic situation in Madagascar which may impede progress.
5.   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
114. Building on the previous community nutrition project, the Bank team took advantage of knowledge,
expertise and experience in preparing the project and built on the sound relationship with the government
counterpart team. Three points are worth noting: (i) project build on the diagnosis of the main sector issues
and the Government‘s strategy; (ii) Bank team had long standing strong relationships with the other principal
agencies and actors involved with nutrition; and (iii) Bank team was well placed to anticipate and respond to
conceptual and operational issues posed at different stages of the review process in Washington. All of these
elements contributed to a coherent design 69 and a well articulated appraisal document. In the field, the
availability of PHRD resources, an experienced and competent project preparation team, and agreement to
rely on NGOs to implement the bulk of the community nutrition program greatly facilitated the formulation
of the Government‘s project document, which was prepared quickly.
115. The Bank also made a number of other useful contributions. First, its contribution to the decisions
reached during the preparation process facilitated later implementation; some did so immediately (by
separating the health and nutrition operations, though this decision delayed project approval) while others did
so later (by relying on decentralized program management and the recruitment of local NGOs). Second, its
analysis of the costs of the various nutrition interventions could have been extremely useful if it had been
followed up on throughout project implementation.
116. Project preparation was less adequate in: (i) addressing the diversity of existing nutrition interventions
in Madagascar (particularly the NAC financed by UNICEF and the Linkage project financed by USAID) and
their comparative advantages; (ii) detailing the institutional arrangements for managing the project (and
pursuing the timely preparation of the project implementation manual which eventually delayed
effectiveness); and (iii) proposing risk minimization measures which were not at the same level of analysis as
the sector diagnosis. Project preparation was also not adequate in its proposal of key performance indicators;
both the selection of indicators and (particularly in view of the resources available from the PHRD) the
establishment of baselines and measurement modalities were relatively weak.



69
  The disparity in the amounts allocated to the four project components probably should have attracted more attention during
preparation.


                                                            29
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
117. Over the project‘s thirteen year duration, Bank supervision was characterized by: (i) the regularity of
supervision with at least two supervision missions a year (usually involving some visits to the field) and a
number of video conferences as well; and (ii) the quality and timeliness of the aides-mémoires. Though the
documentation demonstrates the Bank‘s commitment to ensuring the success of the project and to finding
solutions for a series of seemingly intractable problems, there were differences in style over the life of the
project: (i) through mid-2006, the aides-mémoires reflect a collegial style with essentially technical
discussions that summarize progress and identify issues, but usually without specific recommendations or
dated actions; thereafter, the aides-mémoires reflect a more adversarial style with a greater focus on
institutional issues and detailed lists of specific recommendations and actions.
118. The Mid-Term Review was extremely well organized, and ten years on remains a valuable source of
information. The overall quality of the ISRs varied, due in part to the breadth of issues under consideration
and the limitations of the ISR format. But the precipitous downgrading of the PDO and IP at the end of 2007
suggests that matters were probably not entirely satisfactory earlier and that the project may have benefited
from its past reputation in the years preceding the downgrade. Supervision missions often reminded country
officials of the reputational risk of an internationally recognized program sliding backwards and not
achieving the Millennium Objective for nutrition (see eg. ISR 22, AM May 2008).
119. In June 2008, a QER was conducted to review implementation progress, specifically with respect to
the shift from project to program funding. The QER panel concluded that ―the Bank‘s attempt to shift the
project and others in the portfolio, from project to program funding, threatens to undermine what has been
achieved‖ and encouraged the task team to making ―an all-out effort to assist GOM to achieve the milestones
laid out in the Action Plan‖. Specifically, the QER panel recommended a proactive approach to: (i) seek
political support at the highest possible level for the institutionalization of SECALINE; (ii) assemble a donor
coalition supportive of the project‘s aims; and (iii) disseminate the technical lessons of SECALINE
nationally and internationally.
120. Subsequently, the Bank: (i) developed a series of clear, time-bound critical action plans; (ii) initiated
audio conferences to augment the regular supervision missions, and used them with increasing frequency in
2008; and (iii) recruited a consultant in the country office to help move the program forward. (ISR 23) The
Bank also indicated that either the ten critical actions would be implemented or there would be no extension
and the likelihood of losing USD 6-8 million (ISR 22). By October 2008, satisfactory progress had been
made on the critical actions, which resulted in an upgrade in the PDO rating and the possibility for requesting
an extension of the project closing date, which was quickly granted (ISR 23). The political developments of
2009 and since limited means for the team to influence the situation.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
121. Overall, the Government made significant progress in reducing malnutrition through: (i) its political
commitment to addressing the poverty-nutrition nexus; (ii) the establishment of an enabling environment
comprising a national nutrition policy and strategy and institutional arrangements to address the multi-
sectoral nature of nutrition; (iii) strengthening the coordinating and implementing bodies which were
established at central, provincial/regional, and local levels; and (iv) a willingness to rely on the
implementation capabilities of non-governmental and community-level organizations.
122. The Government made somewhat less progress in: (i) adopting in a timely manner the legislative


                                                      30
framework which would have permitted the proposed institutions to function effectively; (ii) establishing a
sustainable basis for financing the overall nutrition program, though it did succeed in demonstrating that
important progress could be made without financing food; and (iii) encouraging dialogue among and
promoting the technical innovations of agencies involved in nutrition.
123. The Government‘s performance could have been better with regards to: (i) managing the transition
arrangements from project to program, especially the management of the additional financing; and (ii)
inserting politics into the project implementation process through its actions in managing central level human
resources.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
124. Implementation responsibilities were shared among national nutrition institutions, government
ministries, and the locally recruited NGOs.
125. National nutrition institutions (ONN-PNNC/Seecaline). The distribution of responsibilities at the
national level passed through three phases: (i) from effectiveness through 2004, the project was managed by
the implementation unit of Seecaline; (ii) from 2004 through 2007 Seecaline was nominally under the control
of the ONN though the lack of an operational structure for ONN left the project relatively intact; and (iii)
from 2007 on, Seecaline became the operational arm of the ONN with responsibility for the national
community nutrition program (PNNC).
126. During the first and second phases, the ISRs systematically rated Seecaline‘s performance as
satisfactory, with the only exception being a brief period after the MTR when financial performance was
questioned. Seecaline was particularly successful in adapting project implementation to changed
circumstances and in safeguarding priorities when funding was delayed. During the third phase, project
performance and the related management elements were frequently rated moderately unsatisfactory. The
reasons are related to the uncertainties and ambiguities in the respective roles of the ONN and the PNNC,
which seem over the past couple of years to have been somewhat clarified. Among other things, the
difficulties since 2007 have contributed to an inability to monitor and evaluate the nutrition situation in
Madagascar with precision.
127. Overall, despite the early successes of Seecaline, the negative effects of the long institutional debate on
the program were considerable, and the performance of the national nutrition institutions is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.
128. Government ministries. Ministry performance is rated satisfactory, based on: (i) the Ministry of
Agriculture‘s satisfactory completion of its activities prior to the mid-term review; (ii) the Ministry of
Education‘s successful implementation and subsequent takeover of the school nutrition program; and (iii) the
Ministry of Health‘s strengthening of the specialized services for treating malnourished children at the health
center and hospital levels.
129. Non-Governmental Organizations. For reasons mentioned previously, NGO performance is rated
satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
6.      Lessons Learned
130. The lessons learned were documented at various points during implementation; the initial principles
summarized in the PAD70 were updated at the mid-term review71 as summarized below:

     See the PAD, p. citing Eileen Kennedy

        Community participation as the foundation for identifying appropriate community-based nutrition
         activities and mobilizing the community‘s willingness to contribute to the implementation of the
         agreed on nutrition activities. The MTR found that initial mobilization of communities and schools
         was a relatively quick process, but the development and gradual improvement of services faced
         many constraints. Put somewhat differently, changing the focus from quantitative expansion of
         services to qualitative development of them was a challenge.
        A multi-faceted and flexible approach was critical in order respond to the communities' diverse
         needs and readiness to take appropriate action. The MTR concurred that multifaceted program
         activities reaching beneficiaries through different channels (e.g., communities, schools, and the
         media) are essential for demonstrating the linkages between, for instance, nutrition and hygiene. But
         the potential synergy between the community and school nutrition programs turned out to be
         somewhat limited and more difficult to develop than anticipated.
        Significant investment must be made in training community nutrition workers, social workers, school
         teachers and health staff. The MTR found that training of community nutrition workers and teachers
         was appreciated, though needs were higher than initially anticipated.
131. At the mid-term review, several complementary lessons were added to the revised lessons, including:
        Distance and inaccessibility to certain sites proved to be important limiting factors without obvious
         solutions. Even with decentralized institutions and contracted NGOs providing efficient and flexible
         services, frequent supervision visits to the sites from both (shown to be a success factor) have been a
         major constraint on performance.
        Linking child malnutrition to problems of development and poverty and not just to food insecurity
         may provide a needed framework for policy makers, but changing the perceptions of the causes of
         malnutrition to include non-food factors (such as disease, correct case management, and
         micronutrients) is a very gradual process at the community level.
        Seemingly straightforward strategies can often have far reaching consequences. For example, the
         fact that women received something to bring home (food, Vitamin A tablets, etc.) was both a legacy
         of the first project and a signal that the second project (and the CNAs) would support the
         communities. But food supplementation turned out to be not only logistically challenging but
         socially and ethically difficult for decision-making at the community and household levels72.
132. In 2005, a presentation within the Bank also addressed lessons learned from the rich experience of this
project73, reiterating the importance of community participation to ensure ownership and commitment to
decisions and emphasizing the need to enhance: (i) implementation capacity by improving technical skills,
being realistic about what can be done and when, and clarifying leadership roles to establish the credibility of
the implementing agency; and (ii) political and financial support by involving local and national authorities
(both for and against nutrition interventions) in visits and discussions, using the media to publicize
achievements, and understanding the budgeting process by being ready at the right time with the right
information.
133. The QER (2008) panel also noted a number of key lessons: (i) unrealistic shifts away from sector
investments toward program and budget support can jeopardize the effectiveness (and credibility) of human
development sector operations; and (ii) the project’s success in achieving a substantial and affordable
impact on child malnutrition (without food and with major community support) should be used to stimulate

   WFP noted that no ―dependency‖ on food aid was observed: when the food aid was disrupted or came to an end, attendance rates
did not diminish substantially or declined only temporarily and then stabilized again. WFP attributed this to the strong motivating
role of the community nutrition agents, who managed to mobilize the mothers to continue attending the activities on the sites. WFP,

other Bank operations, particularly in view of under nutrition as a risk factor for infant, child and maternal
morbidity and mortality.
134. In 2011, a number of these lessons are still worth emphasizing. First, improving nutritional status is a
long-term process and, as the IEG review points out, with no clear pattern of impacts across interventions
and no measures for monitoring the changing perceptions of decision makers on the causes of malnutrition.
While there is a tendency to establish ambitious objectives, political commitment, discipline, rigor, and
humility are called for, in addition to well-formulated indicators for tracking progress.
135. Second, while interventions would appear to have a variable impact, certain organizing principles
appear to be fundamental; these include: (i) initial and sustained community involvement is critical for the
success of nutrition interventions; communities, local staff, and local authorities have important roles to play
in the tackling malnutrition; (ii) project implementation must not yield to the temptation to expand
geographically at the expense of programmatic quality, since this quality has a profound long-term effect on
the project‘s impact; (iii) multi-sectoral (or at least multi-faceted) contributions are critical to the
improvement of nutritional status, organized from the bottom-up and not imposed top-down; and (iv) clear
and strong organizational and implementation arrangements are fundamental for ensuring the short-term
coherence and long-term sustainability of the program.
136. . The impact analysis showed that results were more pronounced in more accessible communities,
with better infrastructure, and more literate mothers. In this context, if the objective is quick wins in the
context of a nutrition program, then the focus should be on groups that are easiest to access. On the other
hand, if the objective is broader, (potentially more equitable) impact, the focus also would need to be on the
most poor and vulnerable who are often times very hard to reach with the recognition that this may take more
financial and technical resources.         Associated with this lesson is the conclusion that impact
evaluations/operational research, done properly, are not a luxury but an essential piece of a long term project.
7.       Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
137. The task team and the Borrower reviewed and agreed on the results of the indicators reported in the
Data Sheet74. The Borrower has prepared a comprehensive final evaluation report in French, which did not
contain a summary. A summary of the Borrower‘s final report is presented in Annex 7 in English. The
Borrower‘s final evaluation report is available from the Project Files.

                                     Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

Background
     The PAD provided an extensive analysis of: (i) the economic rationale for public financing of nutrition
interventions in Madagascar as well as for the specific interventions to be financed by the project; and (ii) the
financial affordability and sustainability of the interventions in the medium and long-term.
     Rationale for public financing. First, public financing targeted to the malnourished constitutes a direct
investment in the well-being and in the health status of the poorest, since malnutrition is essentially confined
to the poorest segments of the population and to its more vulnerable groups (children under five, pregnant
and lactating women). In addition, well targeted nutrition interventions are more likely to reach all the
intended beneficiaries than investment in basic social services such as health and education, since the latter
also benefits the non-poor (as the result of the demand factor). Finally, because the malnourished are often
unaware of the consequences of their condition on their health status (and well-being in general) and unable
to articulate demand for services, public investment is justified for nutrition education, IEC, research and
monitoring, etc.
      Second, public investment in nutrition interventions have multiple public health benefits, which include:
(i) health benefits by improving the short-term nutritional status of women and children and the longer-term
learning and cognitive skills of children resulting from their improved nutritional status; (ii) social benefits
by increasing parents' participation in schools and strengthening capabilities among households and for the
community overall to prevent malnutrition; and (iii) economic benefits by reducing health care expenditures
resulting from malnutrition in the short-term and increasing the productivity of women and children in the
long-term. In addition, the project was expected to reduce poverty through improved food security at the
household level and improved access to water and sanitation facilities75.
     Though the PAD notes that increasing the incomes of the poor is the most cost effective means of
reducing malnutrition, it argues that governments can play an effective direct role by: (i) strengthening
nutrition education; (ii) increasing the consumption of micronutrients and reducing parasitic infections
among children; and (iii) improving food supply, such as food fortification, food supplementation and food
subsidization.
     Selection of the interventions and target groups. The PAD notes that cost-effectiveness
considerations played an important role in the selection of the proposed interventions and their target groups.
The selection of interventions was based on: (i) the 1993 World Development Report, which noted that
nutrition education, micronutrient supplementation, and mass treatment of helminth infections among
children fall in the ten least expensive child health interventions. Costs per DALY gained were estimated at:
(i) US$9 for Vitamin A supplementation of children under five; (ii) US$8-30 for school-based interventions
focused on deworming and provision of micronutrient supplements; and (iii) US$19-37 for iron
supplementation for all people under 60. Food supplementation was found to be more costly and to work
best when used to: (i) target pregnant women (the cost per DALY saved is estimated at US$24); and (ii)
motivate and educate mothers to care for their children's health. As noted in Section D1 of the PAD, other
interventions were considered but rejected.
     Similarly, Section D1 of the PAD explains the considerations in deciding to focus on targeting all
children less than three years of age rather than all children less than two years of age or all children less than
five years of age. Annex 4 of the PAD then made a ―rough cost and impact analysis‖ to select the targeting
for the community nutrition program: six alternatives were considered based on three age groups of children
and two different coverage areas for each nutrition center. In the end, the Nutrition Technical Committee

status of women and children in Madagascar for a similar analysis.


                                                              38
decided to target all children under three within 5 km of the center to increase coverage, since (i) 45% of
children under three are malnourished) and (ii) coverage would be diminished if women had to travel longer
distances (7 km) to the center.
     Financing of the project’s interventions. Annex 4 of the PAD includes: (i) a detailed study, conducted
before appraisal, of the total cost (including project management cost) per intervention and per beneficiary,
which was estimated at US$6.99; (ii) an estimate of the Government‘s and the communities‘ ability to
contribute to project financing; and (iii) an assessment of the program‘s recurrent costs and the capacity of
the Government and the communities to maintain the program‘s benefits after completion of the project.
Results
     Data on both nutrition expenditures and project results are available. Expenditure data for the project
was collected and tabulated over the period 2000-05; in addition some detailed expenditure data are available
for the period 2006-2011, but were not systematically analyzed by the project. As part of the Public
Expenditure Review (PER) in 2007, a specific volume on nutrition reviewed financial information over the
period. Project impact data are available from a series of impact evaluations, carried out by INSTAT and the
World Bank in 1998, 2004, 2007, and 2011; these sought to determine the effects of the community nutrition
program interventions.
     Project expenditure data for nutrition. From 2000-05, the project monitored the costs of selected
interventions per site/school and per beneficiary: (i) weighing, supplementation and vitamin A for the
nutrition sites; and (ii) deworming and iron supplementation in schools. The elements of the cost analysis are
not entirely clear from the M&E system, but the results are presented below:

In both sources of data over the period 1999-2005, early high costs associated with program investment and
set-up costs declined to the PAD‘s estimated level of roughly US$6.99 per capita. This analysis was not
continued after 2005.
     Public expenditure data for nutrition. The PER estimated total expenditures from all sources on
nutrition over the period 2000-2005 as shown in the following table:77
                                        Total nutrition expenditures (million Ariary)

The PER concluded that achievement of the Nutrition MDG was feasible, but that inadequate information on
nutrition financing made it difficult to determine the Government‘s contribution to past and future
improvements. In particular, the PER recommended that: (i) amounts allocated for nutrition be effectively
disbursed; and (ii) controls and transparency for tracing nutrition expenditures be strengthened.
     The PER anticipated that financing for nutrition would constitute a significant constraint over the period
2007-2011.78 Though data on total expenditures for nutrition for this period are not available, Bank missions
have attempted to monitor Government allocations and actual expenditures. These are shown in the
following table:
      Project benefits. The project initially targeted the most malnourished and most vulnerable districts of
the country. Selection of the district was based on a nationally representative anthropometric survey (EA)
collected in 1997/98, and all districts (46 out of 108) with an average malnutrition rate (moderate
underweight) above the national average were selected for the intervention (43%). In addition, ten rural
districts affected by droughts and cyclones in the year 2000 were added to the program. The first phase of
program expansion stopped at the end of 2001/beginning of 2002 to reach about 3,600 project sites, covering
about half of the communes in half of the districts in the country. Phase-in was gradual with program
expansion initially planned to reach a coverage rate of 50% of all children below three years of age in the
intervention areas over four years; in practice, about 1/3 of the sites were opened between 1999/2000,
another 1/3 between 2000/2001 and the remainder between 2001/2002.
     Subsequently, the coverage was extended to more than 5000 sites as the project was integrated into the
national nutrition program. Data on the evolving coverage of PNNC/Seecaline may be found in Annex 2.
Starting from the year 2005, a single common package of activities, harmonized across different nutrition
actors, was adopted (PNNC). A series of impact evaluations was carried out in 1998 (which served as a
baseline), 2004, 2007, and 2011; these are commented on in the main ICR.
     Benefit-Cost analysis. Determining the contribution of nutrition interventions to the reduction of
malnutrition is very difficult 79 : As Galasso and others note: (i) malnutrition can improve over time,
independently of the program, as a result of short-term seasonal factors or longer-term general economic
growth; and (ii) better targeting or coverage of the program in more malnourished communities may not
necessarily translate into larger reductions in malnutrition rates. Estimating program impact between 1999
and 2004, Galasso concludes that:
        In the absence of the program, the country would have experienced an improvement in underweight
         incidence;
        In the participating communities, the program helped children 0-5 years old to bridge their gap in
         weight for age z-score and the incidence of underweight. The program‘s estimated effect on the
         incidence of underweight at the community level ranged between 5.2 and 7.5 percentage points, or

          an estimated impact of 1-1.5% reduction per year. Further, considering the program was gradually
          phased out with an average duration of program operation of three years, the adjusted estimate
          amounts to 1.7-2.5% impact per year for participating areas.
         Using the estimates, the overall share of the observed change in malnutrition rates between 1997/98
          and 2004 that can be attributed to the program above ranges between 26-37%.
However, though the program explicitly targeted the poorest and more malnourished areas of the country, the
gains were larger for households living in relatively less poor and less remote areas, with relatively better
infrastructure (e.g., access to electricity, secondary schools, and hospitals). In other words, results: (i) were
better (i.e., had greater protective effects against underlying negative trend in stunting) in villages that were
better placed to translate gains in the behavioral indicators into gains in children‘s nutritional outcomes; and
(ii) suggest the importance of complementary inputs to child health such as better quality of nutrients and
access to safe water that enhance the important provision of knowledge and behavioral change.
     In 2007, the Bank compared the benefits from the impact evaluation with the costs of delivering the
program over the period 1999-2004.80 Based on estimates of the present discounted values (PDV) of seven
major classes of benefits associated with shifting a low birth weight infant to a non-low birth weight status81,
the analysis established a realistic estimate of the net present value of reduced cost illness and productivity
gains of reduced stunting and increased ability at: $377 (at discount rate 5%) or $653 (at discount rate 3%).
The impact evaluation (2004) found that the availability of the community nutrition program had improved
the incidence of stunting (0-5 years old) by 3.2% relative to non-program communities. The benefit-cost
ratio was estimated at 1.7 for children 0-5 years old and 2.7 for children less than a year old. 82

   At a unit cost of $219 ($7 annual cost per beneficiary / 3.2% x 100), the analysis estimates a benefit to cost ratio of 1.7 ($377 /

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
(NB. The Borrower‘s ICR was prepared in December 2009 and was not subsequently updated.)

      The Borrower‘s report: (i) provides the background for the project, (ii) summarizes the project
objectives and components and assesses the overall design; (iii) presents the main results and discusses the
impact of project implementation on the national policy on poverty alleviation and social protection; and (iv)
critically analyzes the roles of the Bank, the Government, and technical assistance in implementing the
results.
                                                 Background
      Technical elements. The Borrower summarizes the elements of the first Community Nutrition Project,
which served as the basis for the second project to expand coverage to include all six provinces nationally.
    Community Nutrition 1. Beginning in 1992, Madagascar included the reduction of food insecurity and
malnutrition as part of the fight against poverty and financed food security and nutrition actions in the two
most vulnerable provinces, Antananarivo and Toliara, as part of the first Community Nutrition Project
(SECALINE). This project comprised three components:
       the community nutrition program, implemented by the Community Nutrition Agent (CNA) and
        supervised by a local Non-Governmental Organization (or NGO), assisted 535 community sites by
        (i) monitoring children's growth; (ii) helping households to make more efficient use of locally
        available food resources; and (iii) providing food supplements to malnourished children or referring
        severely malnourished children to one of nine therapeutic feeding centers (or CRT- Centers for
        Rehabilitation Therapy);
       the national iodine deficiency program has been completed, which: (i) provided iodine capsules to
        children under five and women of childbearing age; and (ii) established the universal iodization of
        household salt;
       the IEC (Information, Education, Communication) component to support all these activities and
        ensure complimentarity.
During the first project, a national strategy for food safety was adopted in support of a long-term plan (PNN-
National Nutrition Policy) and program (PNAN-National Plan of Action for Nutrition).
     Community Nutrition 2. In 1998, the second Community Nutrition Project (SEECALINE) was
established to promote and strengthen the gains of the two initial provinces in all six provinces in order to
have a substantial impact on: (i) improving the nutritional status of children under three years, primary
school children, pregnant and lactating women; (ii) ensuring the sustainability of the quantitative and
qualitative results achieved in improving nutrition, the diet of children at home; and (iii) in so doing, improve
quality of life and productivity, reduce morbidity and mortality, and to support primary education. The
project comprised four components:
       the Community Nutrition Program to: (i) identify children under three years living in the sites; (ii)
        organize the monthly weighing of these children along with nutritional advice and cooking
        demonstrations for mothers; and (iii) provide nutritional supplementation for malnourished children
        and pregnant mothers;
       the School Nutrition Program to: (i) distribute deworming drugs for school children 3 to 14 years of
        age and iron folate tablets (FAF) for children in primary schools; and organize information
        campaigns and awareness on hygiene and nutrition (including the promotion of iodized salt) for
        teachers, parents and students;
       cross-cutting activities to assist: (i) the Ministry of Health to undertake training on IMCI (Integrated
        Management of Childhood Illness); and (ii) the Ministry of Agriculture in developing technical
        guidelines on improved agricultural techniques to increase and diversify agricultural and food
        preservation; and


                                                       45
       transversal activities (IEC, Training, Management and Evaluation), which has initiated the design,
        implementation and monitoring of an IEC strategy for stakeholders in community nutrition and
        school and especially at central and provincial its components, design, setting up an information
        system and management for coordinating and managing all activities within the Project.
     Institutional arrangements. The determining factor guiding the institutional arrangements has been
the adoption of the National Nutrition Policy which established both the program components and the
implementation and coordination responsibilities.
      National Nutrition Policy. The adoption of the National Nutrition Policy (Decree of April 20, 2004) and
the National Plan of Action for Nutrition Policy in Madagascar (2005) established the framework for the
fight against malnutrition within the overall Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of poverty reduction.
Fourteen operational strategies, based on previously positive experiences and good practices at the global
level have been adopted within the framework of this policy. These strategies aimed to prevent malnutrition
at all critical stages of the cycle of life and to expand and strengthen actions to help increase the impact at the
national level.
     Institutional arrangements. From 1998-2004, the Project Coordination Unit (or PCU) was attached to
the Prime Minister‘s Office and was responsible for coordinating the implementation of various components
of the project at national and provincial (through the six Provincial Directorates) levels. With the adoption of
the National Nutrition Policy (PNAN) in 2004, responsibilities were divided between: (i) implementation
using the existing agencies (AMIO); and (ii) coordination through the National Nutrition Council and the
National Nutrition Office (ONN) under the Prime Minister‘s Office. Implementation of the Community
Nutrition Program was complicated by: (i) the functional relationships between the National Director (ONN)
and National Coordinator (PNNC-Seecaline); and (ii) the introduction of the decentralization policy which
established 22 regional nutrition offices (ORN), which have in turn contracted the services of NGOs for the
supervision and monitoring of the community nutrition program.
     Following the letter of agreement signed in September 1999, the School Nutrition Program (PNS) was
implemented by the Ministry of Education with assistance from the national and regional coordinating units;
in 2006, the Ministry of Education became autonomous agency (AMIO) for PNS. The intersectoral
components were implemented respectively by: (i) the Ministry of Health for IMCI; and (ii) the Ministry of
Agriculture (in collaboration with the FAO) for GRAAM. More informal relationships have also been
established with representatives of various ministries and international technical partners to form the
Intersectoral Action Group in Nutrition or GAIN.
     The lessons learned include: (i) the need to ensure better collaboration between the National Director
(ONN) and the National Coordinator (PNCC-Seecaline), the functions assigned to each should have been
made more clear from the start; and (ii) the need to ease the burdens of project management and ensure the
quality of the interventions by using a system of partnerships with specialized entities in their respective
areas (Ministry of Education for the PNS, the Ministry of Health for PCIMEC, Ministry of Agriculture and
FAO for GRAAM and NGOs for the PNC) should be pursued. In particular, the system of partnership with
NGOs was one of the lessons learned from the SECALINE was very appropriate for a provision to reach the
most vulnerable and the most inaccessible areas. It was logical to continue and ramp up the system during the
three project phases.
     Financing modalities. The nutrition interventions benefitted from both project funding (Seecaline) and
program funding (through the PRSC). However, there were problems with the timely availability of
financial resources resulting from delays in releasing funds. But the program has frequently solved them
with the assistance of the different partners and stakeholders who have accepted delayed payments (during
the political events of 2002 and 2009 or during the implementation of PRSC in 2004).
                                   Assessment of the overall project design
    The four components of the original project (3060 GAM) have remained broadly unchanged for the
supplemental and additional financing. These are: (i) Community Nutrition; (ii) School Nutrition; (iii) inter-


                                                        46
sectoral activities; and (iv) IEC-Formation-Evaluation/Coordination-Management.
     Because malnutrition results from a number of interrelated causes, including overall poverty as well as
inadequate knowledge, poor nutrition and sanitation practices, and insufficient food production and
consumption, multi-sectoral interventions are required.
         The community nutrition component built on the achievements of the previous SECALINE Project
          (Credit 2474 MAG) by: (i) continuing the community outreach while emphasizing prevention,
          increasing knowledge (through nutrition education and IEC) to improve the nutritional status of
          vulnerable groups (children under three, pregnant and lactating women). Unlike the distribution of
          food that would make beneficiaries dependent, the choice of prevention should increase the long-
          term sustainability of the results on nutritional status.
         The school nutrition component focused on 9720 primary schools in the 4040 targeted communities
          in order to create a synergy between the schools and the communities with a combination of message
          channels (students to parents and ACN to mothers) to accelerate the process of behavior change in
          nutrition.
         The inter-sectoral component was consistent with the other two components: WFP-distributed flour
          would be used only in the initial phase (credit MAG 3060) to: (i) recover malnourished children for a
          limited time (3 months, renewable once); (ii) prevent low birth weight in pregnant women (3 months
          as well); and (iii) teach mothers to produce enriched flour from local foods. The other agricultural
          component was expected to increase production by increasing knowledge on the techniques of
          production, conservation, transformation with fact sheets (GRAAM guides:(guides repositories)
          developed by FAO-Madagascar.
      An attempt was made to pilot a PNNC model relying heavily on the involvement of mayors, councils,
presidents of fokontany in the management of PNNC so as to facilitate use of the model and its sustainability.
But a 2008 model of the approach recommended its abandonment because of the complexity of the system,
its low efficiency (cost per beneficiary too high), and the failure of the majority of mayors in supervision
(most did not have the time to devote to PNNC) and of integrity having altogether diverted supervisory
allowances for personal needs.
     The project subsequently returned to the classical model of partnership with NGOs, which has been
proven over time SECALINE in 1993/98 to the current phase 2 MAG 3060 was called showing the merits of
this option that has continued to gain momentum because there are currently 350 against only 50 operational
NGOs is the seventh in 1998. While flaws were detected against some non-performing NGOs, they were not
as many did not represent 10%) have been eliminated after annual assessment of their supervision and
monitoring of sites by teams of PNNC SEECALINE or INSTAT in 2004 / 5.
Results
    Community nutrition. The quantitative results have been generally positive, and have been included
in Annex 2 of this ICR. They are summarized below:
      Coverage has increased from 969 sites located in 41 districts for 182 000 children under three years in
1998 to 3608 sites located in 62 districts and 625 000 children 2003, and to 5550 sites covering all 111
districts and 690 000 children and 116 districts and 720 523 children in 2006 and 2008, respectively. Current
data for 2009 show 703,016 (of 970 000 or 72.5%) at the sites though national coverage of all children under
three years old and under five across the country are still relatively low, at 26% and 32% respectively.
     Coverage of mothers of children under three receiving nutritional, hygiene or health education (during
regular sessions, occasional home visits or messaging campaigns by the ACN) increased from 145 600 in
1998, to 483 000 in 2006, and a targeted 679 700 in 2009.
     The proportion of underweight children under 3 years has declined between 1998 and 2003: from 42%
March 1999 (when the program started in Toliara with a particularly high rate) to 35.7% in Seecaline sites in
late 2003. The subsequent results were excellent except in 2007. Projections made in 2004 showed more


                                                       47
rapid declines in the sites in the non sites; these results were confirmed in 2004 by: (i) two sets of
anthropometric surveys; and (ii) the first and second EDS. Current 2009 results of 16.09% show that the
objectives of the MDG nutrition for the whole country in 2015 could be achieved if investment for nutrition
continued, though an increase of 50% would be required to increase the coverage rate.
     Vitamin A distribution to children and lactating mothers were augmented by semi-annual mass
campaigns organized by the Ministry of Health and its partners. The project has not collected specific data
on vitamin A since 2006, but in 2009, 1,014,941 children under three years (against a target of 670,000)
received Vitamin A.
     During the period of food supplementation 678 410 malnourished children and 102 750 pregnant
women were beneficiaries of the distribution of 15 272 (18 000) tons of WFP- provided flour, which
certainly reduced the incidence of low birth weight (<2500 g) children in the sites (the latter being 11% in
the whole country in 2004).
     A total of 1337 small projects were implemented by communities: (i) to eliminate one or more causes of
malnutrition through construction of wells, latrines, rubbish pits, vegetable gardens or small animals; or (ii)
to view the nutritional status of the site by making a Spot Mapping, on a pilot basis in each of 22 regions.
     School nutrition. Begun in 2000, the program struggled to integrate the pedagogical approach of
Education on Nutrition, Hygiene, Health and Environment, but the number of teachers increased quickly
thereafter (8,849 in 2000 and 19,948 in 2002). The program experienced some early successes (1 889 491
school-age children dewormed and 1,217,953 students supplemented with iron or folate FAF in 2002) and
periods of uncertainty (with only 714 657 school children dewormed and 401 053 primary school children
supplemented with FAF in 2003) a decline respectively 62.8% and 67.1% mainly due to the lack of
mebendazole tablets and FAF available due to the delayed release of the CARP. A significant improvement
was recorded in 2004 with 2,403,261 children dewormed and 1,450,536 students supplemented with FAF.
Beginning in 2005, the program was gradually transferred to the Ministry of Education.
     Intersectoral activities and project management. Seecaline supported implementation of: (i)
Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) through training of 130 doctors trainers and more than
1000 health workers; (ii) care of severely malnourished children (PCESM) through purchase of equipment
and utensils which strengthened 36 CRENIs in the first phase and 8 in the second; and (iii) initiating the
establishment of reference centers CRENAs as intermediary for children under hungry and those without
associated pathology of CRENIs returned after recovery but still unable to return to the PNC. Seecaline also
supported the Ministry of Agriculture, through the Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS), a
partnership with FAO focusing primarily on the development, validation, editing and multiplication
GRAAM advice sheets and testing land efficiency in the pilot sites. In addition to these two departments
prioritized by the IPA, SEECALINE expanded its collaboration with:
       Ministry of Population to raise awareness and encourage NGOs to turn into genuine NGOs;
       Ministry of Decentralization to empower local authorities in the development of Spots Map and their
        involvement in the implementation of the pilot sites PNNC;
       Ministry of Communications to disseminate nutrition messages through local radio and television;
        and
       SE/CNLS and PMPS to educate community sites on AIDS through talks with topics of nutrition
        education in December.
     The IEC strategy, to induce good nutritional practices, has been a participatory process, based on the
results of a survey to collect data on knowledge and eating habits. Initiated in 1999 (with support from CAC
International), the strategy was validated in 2000 and updated in 2004 (with support from KONE) to develop
key messages and build support to improve communication for behavior change. Three types of
communication were identified: institutional communication, social communication and inter personal
communication; and the combination of these last two types the basis for the training of the key actors:


                                                      48
       Social campaigns to Broadcast Messages (CDM) have been held regularly (2 to 3 per year) in each
        Provincial Department to expand the coverage of target audiences, and they have: (i) raised
        awareness about the need to improve nutritional practices; and (ii) mobilized action to improve their
        nutritional status. Various topics such as growth or adequate LAMISAIBO, infant diarrhea, hand
        washing with soap, exclusive breastfeeding, and clean water have also been developed.
       Inter personal communication with local authorities was at the basis of the revised PNNC model, but
        the evaluation (in 2008) found that: (i) it was too complex and inefficient (cost per beneficiary too
        high); and (ii) the local authorities (i.e., the mayors) lacked the time for supervision or (in some
        cases) diverted supervisory allowances for other uses. The project subsequently reverted to the NGO
        partnership model used from 1993-2004.
     Project management was the responsibility of a small unit comprising the project coordinator, a
financial management team (with a financial officer, an internal auditor, and an accountant), and a technical
team (with three experts in nutrition, communication, and education). This unit was assisted at provincial
(and subsequently regional) level by staff, who had the responsibility for implementation and coordination.
Project implementation and the impact of national policy on poverty alleviation and social protection
     Though prior policy documents (Document Framework for Poverty Reduction or DCRP in 2000 and
Strategy Paper Poverty Reduction and PRSP in 2003) considered malnutrition as a as a health problem rather
than a multi sectoral development issue, efforts under the PRSC have contributed to the recognition of the
positive correlation between malnutrition and poverty (ANC in 2004, 2005 PNAN, Madagascar Action Plan
or MAP 2007) and the need to address both simultaneously.
      Though investigation has not specifically determined change by type of beneficiary and age. PNNC-
Seecaline‘s Community Nutrition Agents have found behavior change in vulnerable rural communities,
where the quality and quantity of food rations for families (dietary survey in 2001) have significantly
improved the diets of young children and the family and decreased the frequency of diarrheal diseases in the
sites. By applying the knowledge gained during the cooking demonstrations, households now prepare meals
enhanced with local produce available (seasonal produce and products stored for the lean season) while
maintaining hygiene.
      A survey of recipients would have certainly confirmed the impact of PNNC on rural poverty alleviation
as the 5550 and 9270 sites operating schools, over 80% are located in rural areas. Thanks to the benefits they
received monthly, some 6000 participants (ACN, host, RDP, presidents of NGOs), have directly contributed
to economic growth. As they were female-dominated, they have also contributed indirectly, with the help of
at least 45 000 women members of support groups and 25 000 school teachers in promoting the welfare of
their families and environment
Critical analysis of the Bank and the Government
     World Bank. Bank performance during project identification in 1997 was generally satisfactory. The
multi disciplinary team wisely advised and persuaded their Malagasy partner to prepare a multi sectoral
project, building on the components and personnel of the former project, separate nutrition from the health
project (CRESAN II), and attach the project to the Prime Minister as institutional anchor. Agreements on the
choice of four components were reached during the preparation, confirmed during project appraisal, and seen
to be complementary for achieving the objective of improving the nutritional situation of the country.
      Among the other decisions and actions that advanced the project were: (i) the continuation and
extension of the CPN community component; (ii) the continued partnership with NGOs; (iii) the renewal of
the former project interventions (ACN leaders, GVC, RDP and NGOs); (iv) the organization of study tours
for local authorities to exchange experiences with other countries; (v) the use of Spots Map; (vi) the
advocacy of Malagasy authorities to integrate nutrition into policy, strategy; (vii) the development of
strategies and plans (DCRP, PRSP, MAP) and institutionalization (PNN, PNAN); and (viii) the approval of
additional funds and the prolongation of project closing dates have contributed to the project‘s success.

     Project supervision by the Bank was not just confined to discussions in Antananarivo with technical and
financial partners but involved field visits in the six provinces to see firsthand the progress of the project on
ground. Among the limiting factors, hurricanes, procedural bottlenecks resulting in delays in implementation,
and inadequate local financing have been important. But most important have been the politicization of
technical appointments (particularly at the national coordinator level in 2002 and again in 2007), the
insufficiently long transitional period provided to institutionalize nutrition, and the changes in the project‘s
target population (from children under three to children under 5) without providing a while al events.
     The key lessons learned include: (i) where projects involve several government departments, they
should be developed under the aegis of the Prime Minister to facilitate coordination; (ii) when innovative
ideas, such as the institutionalization of Nutrition and the use of budget support, are proposed, they should
ensure that Government capacity and commitment exist; (iii) when potential implementation risks are
considered, Government appointment and dismissal procedures must be included and risk management steps
identified; and (iv) balance joint discussions to support and sustain core teams with field visits during
supervision missions.
     Borrower. Government performance was helped by the creation of the Technical Committee which
contributed to the necessary discussions during preparation (to formulate project objectives and strategies,
identification and selection of activities and components to implement), and continued to provide relevant
technical advice and guidance for the Project through 2004 (as the GAIN).
      Several of activities carried out during implementation were particularly appreciated: (i) procurement of
essential equipment (scales, bicycles, motorcycles, tools, books, books) and goods; (ii) the distribution of
fortified flour via WFP; (iii) IEC campaigns; and (iv) training. In addition, the Government undertook
broader actions to: (i) extend the project to all districts; (ii) include (since 2004) expenditures in the national
budget since 2004; (iii) institutionalize the biannual SSME based on the collaboration of all partners in
health and nutrition; and (iv) delegate responsibilities to the regions, districts, communes, and communities.
     Project activities were hampered by: (i) government political interference (particularly in 2002 and
2007); (ii) delayed/irregular/inadequate payments with the resulting lack of motivation and poor performance,
decreased quality (fictitious data), delay or lack of reporting; and (iii) premature disengagement from
important actions (IEC, PNS, etc.).
     The key lessons learned include: (i) the need to respect financial commitments (to avoid subsequent
implementation problems) and administrative commitments and procedures to avoid personnel issues; (ii)
establish participatory and consensual decision-making among all stakeholders to provide credibility for the
measures taken; (iii) continue to strengthen the capacity of and use partnerships with NGOs to effectively
supervise and monitor sites; (iv) systematically pre-test proposed innovations before scaling-up to avoid
serious implementation difficulties; (v) use mass communication campaigns to complement interpersonal
communication to have a broader impact behavior change among the recipients, while continuing to use
locally tested methods (e.g., contests for the best sites and schools); and (vi) ensure quality control and
reliability of field data by internal agents such as Project Monitoring Staff.
Economic and Financial Assessment of the Project / Outlook for Future Sustainability
     The Borrower‘s ICR provided comments on: (i) past and future project costs; and (ii) the future
sustainability of the institutions established by the project. The Borrower‘s observations have been
incorporated into the main ICR text.

Annex 8: Comments of Co-financing partners and Other Partners/Stakeholders / WFP

      WFP Madagascar -through its 1999-2004 Country Programme- supported one of the main SEECALINE
components, the Community Nutrition Project, allocating US$ 12.2 million for provision of 18,820 MT of
fortified blended food for distribution to 410,000 underweight children (WFA<-2SD) from 6-36 months and
to 363,000 pregnant and lactating women attending community nutrition sites in districts with a prevalence
of underweight higher than 43% (as per INSTAT survey 1997-98).
     In 2003, the fight against malnutrition became one of the priorities of the PRSP. A National Nutrition
Policy was developed and a National Nutrition Office created. A National Community Nutrition Programme
(PNNC) was launched that incorporated the different approaches to community nutrition that have evolved in
Madagascar (SEECALINE, UNICEF and LINKAGES/USAID).
     In the PNNC, the World Bank and the Government preferred not to use food aid anymore in the
preventative community-based activities. So WFP Madagascar shifted its approach from preventative to a
curative approach to moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). WFP Madagascar – through its 2005-2009
Country Programme- shifted then from a preventative (via the SEECALINE) to a curative approach to
malnutrition: a budget plan of US$ 5.4 million for direct operational costs for 9,600 MT of food aid for a
maximum of 33,700 6-59 mo children and pregnant and lactating women affected by moderate acute
malnutrition (MAM) in NGO-run ambulatory nutritional rehabilitation centers (CRENAM).
     In line with International recommendations, corporate priorities and the Landscape Analysis carried out
in April 2008 in Madagascar, the revised 2005-2011 Country Programme shifted again -for 2010 and 2011-
to a preventative approach to malnutrition, via the provision of appropriate fortified food to all children under
2 and pregnant and lactating mothers in the municipalities defined as in ―food difficulty‖ (Difficulte‘
Alimentaire) by the EU-supported Early Warning System (SAP) in the most chronically food-insecure parts
of the Country (the Southern Regions of Anosy, Androy and Atsimo Andrefana). The food distribution is
carried out only during the lean season (Oct-Dec) in line with food security prognosis bulletins by SAP.
     The objective of this intervention is to stabilize prevalence of underweight during the lean season in the
most vulnerable population groups, thus preventing the risk of wasting in the short run, and reducing stunting
in the long run. For the lean season 2009/10, all 45 municipalities detected to be in ―food difficulty‖
(Difficulte Alimentaire) by the SAP could be covered for a caseload of 72,000 beneficiaries for 4 months. In
15 municipalities, food distribution is coupled with the strengthening of the reproductive health services by
UNFPA.
      Collaboration has been sought with the PNNC and the other main stakeholders in Nutrition (ONN, MoH
and UNICEF) to discuss whether food assistance could have played again an important role for the PNNC
sites sited in food insecure areas. Due to the political turmoil affecting the Country since the end of 2008, no
clear decision has been taken so far. Nevertheless, since 2009 collaboration between PNNC and WFP in
terms of monitoring and evaluation of results of the WFP intervention has been put in place in the Southern
Regions where WFP works. Routine data on underweight for children under 2 from PNNC sites has been
used by WFP as proxy results for underweight prevalence in municipalities where WFP operates.
     It is worth noticing that a large USAID-funded Multi Year Assistant Project (MYAP) in South East,
East, South and Centre Madagascar implements the same approach: the four NGOs of the MYAP 5 year
programme support PNNC activities and distribute fortified blended food and vit A enriched oil to under 2s
and PLW during the lean season.
Lessons learnt from the WFP collaboration to the PNNC/SEECALINE
    The PNNC/SEECALINE represented a community-based, BCC and preventative approach to
malnutrition with a clear role for food assistance.




                                                       51
      The PNNC/SEECALINE represented an integrated approach in contributing to the fight against
       malnutrition in Madagascar. It represented best-practice partnership between the Govt and major
       stakeholders in nutrition (WB and WFP), that should be pursued again.
      The Community Nutrition Project under SEECALINE used a community-based, preventative
       approach. Thus, the project design ensured sustainability by making communities more responsible
       for infant and young child feeding and encouraging positive changes in feeding practices. It
       promoted consumption of good quality diets with adequate micronutrients through an appropriate
       food basket and the use of food aid as a vehicle for those micronutrients.
      One of the great successes of the SEECALINE Community Nutrition project was the transition from
       the distribution of blended food to the promotion of use of local appropriate weaning food at home.
       WFP food assistance fully played its nutrition educational role facilitated by sound and strong
       follow-up by the community agents. Food distribution was used to demonstrate to mothers that a
       proper diet adapted to a child‘s needs can promote optimal growth and protect the child against
       malnutrition.
    Locally produced fortified blended foods was used as a nutritional safety net-conditional transfer
      Via the SEECALINE, supplementary feeding had the double impact: nutritional rehabilitation and as
       an incentive for mothers to visit the nutrition sites and attend the nutrition education sessions (safety
       net- conditional transfer).
      Supplementary feeding activities provided a mean for educating mothers. Mothers learned the
       importance of appropriate feeding in the most crucial period of their children life.
      No ―dependency‖ on food aid was observed: interestingly, when the food aid was disrupted or came
       to an end, attendance rates did not diminish substantially or declined only temporarily and then
       stabilized again. The ―dependency‖ on food aid among the target group apparently was minimal.
       This can be attributed to the strong motivating role of the community agents, who managed to
       mobilize the mothers to continue attending the activities on the sites.
      Continuation of the supplementary feeding was appreciated by mothers: as per WFP evaluations,
       mothers pointed out that food aid would be still welcome, especially during the lean season.
      One of the great innovations of the WFP project was to use a fortified blended food (FBF) produced
       by two local companies, which were equipped by WFP. In the years 2002-2003, 2,150 MT of such
       blended food was produced. This increased local capacity and sustainability of the programme .
Shortcomings/Challenges in the WFP collaboration to the PNNC/Seecaline
    Food distribution could have been aligned with a more accurate analysis of the causes of malnutrition
(when malnutrition is linked mainly to food insecurity).
      In the SEECALINE, geographic targeting was done on the basis of the prevalence of malnutrition at
       village level, with individual targeting to underweight children. This was lacking a conceptual
       analysis of the causes of malnutrition at individual, household and/or village level (food insecurity,
       lack of care, or poor health conditions and services) as to ―caliber‖ different packages of response to
       different problems.
      Through its Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) local and regional unit, WFP could have
       played a more prominent role in targeting those geographical areas where the problem of
       malnutrition is closely linked to lack of access to a sufficient quantity and quality of food (i.e. food
       insecurity).
      It could have been interesting to evaluate the impact of the PNNC/SEECALINE considering the food
       security conditions of the different sites : whether, after the end of food assistance via WFP, the sites
       in food secure zones had better outcomes of those in food insecure zone, meaning that BCC only
       might be less successful when food security is at stake.

                                                     52
      Under WFP current activities in prevention of malnutrition (since 2009), food distribution is
       concentrated in place and time where and when food insecurity is the main cause of the deteriorating
       nutrition status of the most vulnerable groups: municipalities declared as food insecure in the most
       chronic food insecure parts of the Country, during the lean season only.
    The quantity of the ration given should have been as to cover 1000-1200 kcal per day
      The weekly take-home rations given in the SEECALINE amounted to 1.5 kg per beneficiary
       (providing 750 kcal/day). This amount is considerably lower than the recommendation for a take-
       home ration in supplementary feeding (1000-1200 kcal) to account for sharing at home. The same
       value is respected in the National Protocol for the treatment of MAM. All current WFP intervention
       respects this value.
    Targeting children was based on underweight, not on the ―window of opportunity‖ period (-9 to 24
months)
      During WFP collaboration to the SEECALINE, the anthropometric index used to target children for
       supplementary feeding was weight-for-age (WFA) < -2 SD , which combines the effects of chronic
       and acute malnutrition. The exit criterion was a resumption of weight gain at two consecutive
       weightings.
      Current recommendations (cfr Lancet Series, 2008) for prevention of malnutrition focus more on
       linear growth than weight gain. International literature also recommends the provision of appropriate
       food assistance in food insecure areas to ALL children and PLW in the ―window of opportunities‖
       period (-9 +24), not based in the underweight status.
    WFP‘s potential as a valuable partner in food assistance strategic thinking, food distribution,
management and capacity building could have been better exploited
      Under the WB/WFP collaboration in the SEECALINE, WFP was not involved in the selection of the
       local NGO´s implementing the community nutrition project, and WFP had no role in food
       management and monitoring once the food had be delivered to at the SEECALINE warehouses. This
       arrangement did not take into consideration the comparative advantages of WFP as a field-based
       agency in monitoring food distributions and stock movements, as well as on performing capacity
       building on local NGO and Govt in food management.
      As per WFP mandate to fight hunger worldwide and its current corporate priority to fight chronic
       malnutrition, WFP could definitely play a key role in terms of food assistance, strategic thinking,
       food aid management and capacity building.
    Better collaboration with UNICEF could have been sought for health and WASH activities to
complement the SEECALINE activities.
