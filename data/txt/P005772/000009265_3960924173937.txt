PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 915-YAR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third
Education Project in Yemen Arab Republic (YAR), for which Credit 915-YAR in
the amount of US$10.0 million was approved on May 22, 1979. The credit was
closed on July 31, 1988,  two years behind schedule.   A balance of
US$13,827.40 was cancelled on June 15, 1989 when the accounts were closed.
The PCR was prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Operations Division (EM3PH) of the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office, based on discussions with the Borrower in the field in
April, 1989. IDA sent the Borrower the draft report on May 20, 1989 with
the request to send comments by June 8, 1989, but no written reply was
received.
Preparation of this PCR was started during IDA's final supervision
mission in the field in October 1988, and is based inter alia on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreements, supervision reports, correspon-
dences between IDA and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies for comment on
August 14, 1989.  A letter stating agreement with the conclusions of the
PCR is reproduced as Attachment I.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(Credit 915-YAR)
PROJECT CONPLETION REPORQ
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    This was the third IDA-assisted project for the improvement of education
and training in YAR. The first two IDA credits focussed on secondary
education and primary teacher training while introducing vocational training,
agricultural education and an innovative basic training scheme that gave
opportunities in the rural areas for adults to acquire rudimentary craft
skills and a basic education . The first two IDA projects, completed in FY80
and FY82 respectively, were successful in instituting improvements in
administration, planning and curriculum development, and had a positive impact
on utilization of the Primary Teacher Training Institutes for females and on
rural development through the establishment of a Basic Training Fund.
2.   Because the country's education and manpower development needs were so
extensive, IDA's strategy was to expand the scope of its educational lending
so as to provide continued advice anid guidance in this sector. Except for the
renewed financing of agricultural education, the third IDA project was to
break new ground by financing: (i) measures to improve the Ministry of
Edu'.ation's (MOE's) management capability and to strengthen its School
Building Unit; (ii) in-service training for the civil service and for public
sector administration; and (iii) studies expected to lead to IDA financing of
post-secondary education and public health training.
Obiectives and Project Content
3.    The project was designed to assist in:  (i) the diversification of
secondary schooling through the provision of agricultural and livestock
training in response to these specific manpower demands; (ii) extension of
public administration training to regional centers; (iii) pre-investment
studies for regional basic health care and associated training; (iv)
identification of optimal development paths for post-secondary education; and
(v) improvement of the administrative capability of the MOE and its School
Building Unit. The project included the construction, furnishing and
equipping of and technical assistance (TA) for the agricultural secondary
school (ASS) at Surdud, a livestock secondarv school at Sana'a, and two
regional branches of the National Institute of Public Administration (NIPA) at
Taiz and Hodeidah. It also included technical assistance for project
implementation, for the pre-investment studies, and for strengthening the
administrative capability of the MOE.

1=p6Aawtation
4.    All the covenants in the Agreement were met by the Borrower (para.
6.01). The construction of the ASS was completed some five months ahead of
appraisal schedule, while the completion of the LSS lagged by eight months and
that of the NIPA branches by 12-14 months (para. 2.04). The procurement of
equipment and furniture was coordinated with the completion of construc.tion.
The major variance betwean planned and actual project implementation was in
the delay of the TA for the MOE staff, and in the 24 month extension of expert
teacher services for the MOE project schools to allow Yemeni teachers to
complete their studies abroad. There were no problems in financing of local
or recurrent costs except in the maintenance of buildings and equipment (para.
2.13). The "savings" in project costs due to the strong showing of the Yemeni
rial during 1979-1984 were reallocated in December 1985 to undertake
construction of extensions to student boarding and to-acher apartments at ASS
and also to procure additional equipment and vehicles for MOE project schools
(para. 2.08). With the decline in the value of the YR1 during 1985-88, the
costs of imported building materials rose so sharply that the contractors
stopped work on the building extensions (para. 2.08). The resolution of this
problem required two extensions of the credit's Closing Date.
Pr-oect Results
5.    The quantitative enrollment goals were attained at three out of the four
project institutions, the exception being the LSS ;Annex 4). There was less
than expected use of fellowships under the Credit, as the Government sought
grants under bilateral agreements, through, for example, a USAID program
(para. 2.07). The specialist services utilized, on the other hand, were 32%
more than planned, although there was no commensurate increase in costs. since
cost effective Arabic speaking specialists were used in greater proportions
than anticipated (para. 2.07).
6.    As a result of the project, more students are now choosing a career in
agriculture, and all of the graduates of ASS and LSS are employed. The
quality of these graduates, especially of the LSS, has been favorably
commented upon by the officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Tihama
Development Authority (para. 3.03). The regional governorates and the state
economic enterprises at Taiz and Hodeidah acknowledge their reliance on the
NIPA branches to provide in-service training in development administration,
office management, and secretarial and accounting skills. The initiation of
the pre-investment study for regional basic health care and associated
training set the stage for YAR's First Health Project, the first health
project undertaken by IDA anywhere in the world. The post-secondary education
programming study also stimulated feasibility studies in the disciplines of
agriculture, engineering and medicine.
Project Sustainability
7.    The project is likely to maintain an acceptable level of net benefits if
the following concerns are addressed by the implementing agencies: (i)
continued attention to changing market needs by (a) improving linkages with
MOA and TDA, e.g. by appointing their experts as external examiners at LSS and
ASS, and (b) NIPA Centers at Taiz and Hodeidah responding to emerging needs of



- viii -
the private sector; (ii) continued attention to upgrading of instructor
skills; and (iii) control of unit recurrent expenditures by introducing fees
at NIPA for employees from state economic enterprises and the private sector,
and by supporting income generating activities in the farm and dairy at LSS
and ASS.
Lessons Learned
8.      The principal lessons learned are:
(a) an early agreement should be reached with the Borrower on the
objectives, timing, scope and sources of Technical Assistance
(paras. 2.05 and 4.06);
(b) costs and disbursement should be closely monitored and
reallocation of funds involving additional civil works should be
made well before the Closing Date (para. 2.09); and
(c) specific funds should be earmarked for maintenance of school
buildings and equipment, and organizational agreements for
maintenance should be well defined (para 2.13).



YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(Credit 915-YAR)
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Project Backgtround
Sector Development Obiectives at Time of Project Appraisal
1.01      The long-term objectives for YAR's educational sector were to:
(a) provide primary education to all children and non-formal
(particularly literacy) training to unschooled adults;
(b) improve the supply of qualified Yemeni teachers and of
locally-oriented teaching materials;
(c) develop an adequate pool of trained and educated manpower to
serve the needs of all productive sectors, especially
agriculture;
(d) plan for the construction of needed school buildings; and
(e) raise the educational and administrative efficiency of the system
and augment the output of graduates in science and technology.
Policy Context
1.02      During the loan period, the Ministry of Education (MOE) established
a Planning Unit and a Directorate and National Board of Technical and
Vocational Education to improve planning and coordination of educational
programs. The Government also planned to expand and improve the National
Institute of Public Administration (NIPA) in pursuit of its policy to raise
the quality of management in the public sector and local development
associations. Because the country's education and manpower development needs
were so extensive and much external advice on how best to develop suitable
means to meet these needs was required, IDA's strategy was to expand the scope
of its educational lending while utilizing previous financing as a basis for
providing continued advice and guidance on the sub-sectors already financed.

Linkages Between Project. Sector and Macro-Policy Oblectives
1.03    At the time of loan approval, the persistent constraint on the
country's social and economic development had been the shortage of manpower at
all skill levels. The specific priority the Government had placed on
modernizing the agricultural sector required, intgr alia, an intensified
program of training agricultural manpower. Additional trained personnel were
also needed to carry out a strategy of preventive health care to enhance the
limited supply of modern health services. The shortage of personnel trained
in planning, administration and office management in the public and
semi-public sectors inhibited the effective execution of development programs.
B. Proiect Objectives and Description
Proiect Objectives
1.04    The project was designed to assist in:  (i) the diversification of
Secondary schooling through the provision of agricultural and livestock
training in response to these specific manpower demands; (ii) extension of
public administration training to regional centers; (iii) pre-investment
studies for regional basic health care and associated training; (iv)
identification of optimal development paths for post-secondary education; and
(v) improvement of the administrative capability of the MOE and its School
Building Unit (SBU).
Proiect Components
1.05         The project included:
(a)  the construction, furnishing and equipping of and technical
assistance for:
(i) agricultural secondary school (ASS) at Surdud;
(ii) a livestock secondary school (LSS) at Sana'a; and
(iii) regional branches of NIPA at Taiz and Hodeidah;
(b) additional technical assistance for:
(i) project implementation;
(ii) pre-investment studies for regional health care and
associated training, and for the development of a
post-secondary education system suited to manpower
needs; and
(iii) strengthening the MOE.



- 3 -
C. Prosect Design and Organization
1.06    The project concept had been developed by several institutions/
ministries over a two-year period with inputs from Bank staff and multilateral
and governmental aid agencies. The project design was well conceived and
focussed on two critical priorities for manpower development. The first
extended agricultural secondary education in order to prepare extension agents
in agriculture and livestock services. The second provided in-service
training in secretarial practices, occounting and development administration
at the important regional governorates of Taiz and Hodeidah outside the
capital of Sana'a. The project design was innovative for the education sector
at that time, since it incorporated training activities at NIPA and
pre-investment studies for regional health care and associated training within
the Ministry of Health (MOH).
1.07    The curriculum of the Surdud ASS was based on the tested curriculum of
the Ibb Agricultural Training Center (ATC), and considerable USAID technical
assistance was devoted to the adaptation. The curriculum of the Sana'a LSS
was developed largely through the effort of the Directorate of Veterinary
Services in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) based on its experience with the
one-year course at the Veterinary Assistants Training Center.
1.08    All project authorities and institutions took up the responsibility
for the implemeatation of their respective project components. The PIU
collaborated with MOE, NIPA and Sana'a University in the development of
architectural designs, and performed admirably during project preparation and
implementation.
1.09    In considering TA for the Surdud ASS, it was expected at appraisal
that 14 man-years of expert services at a cost of US$1 million would be
provided by USAID TA. USAID at that time had indicated its interest in
supporting Surdud ASS, when formulating an extension of the TA arrangements
for the Ibb ATC. The curtailment of USAID funds in YAR in the late 1970s led
to a withdrawal of direct USAID TA to Surdud. This necessitated a
rearrangement of TA provisions in the IDA credit to meet the subsequent need
for teaching experts, as the Surdud ASS was scheduled to begin classes in
January 1982.
1.10    If the borrower perceived any weakness in project design or
implementation, they would consist of the provision of TA for (i)
strengthening MOE in education management, monitoring and evaluation, and the
maintenance of appropriate educational statistics; and (ii) improving the SBU
in planning and programming management. Early in the project, MOE expected
continuance of UNDP institutional support by a UNESCO team, although signs at
the time of appraisal did po:nt to a long term depletion of UNDP funds for YAR
education. Only when MOE was convinced in the early-1980s that no further
UNDP funds would become available, did it begin to take recourse to the TA
provisior.s of the IDA credit, especially for fellowship training of its staff.

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Important Successes in Project Implementation
2.01    The architectural designs of the buildings and the supervision of
building construction used more local materials and were completed more timely
than under the First and Second Education Projects (Credits 421 & 611-YAR),
issues which were subjects of concern in the respective completion reports.
The design of the ASS, Surdud, is functional and the quality of construction a
great improvement over that of the project vocational training centers
completed under the First and Second IDA Education Projects. The concrete
structures of the LSS, Sana'a and the NIPA branches at Taiz and Hodeidah have
worked well. Although these buildings have not been regularly maintained over
the seven years siace their completion, they are nevertheless in good
condition, exce,c for the lavatories. Some attention will, however, need to
be given to repainting, repolishing floors and replacement of weathered
stonework.
B. Procurement Issues
2.02    Coordinating procurement with building completion resulted in delays
in commissioning and installation. The furniture and equipment in most of the
shops and laboratories is, however, of appropriate quantity and quality. The
exception is the machinery purchased for the agricultural machinery shop at
ASS, Surdud, where some of the "intermediate technology" harvesting machines
are not appropriate to the needs of the Tihama region, and where some of the
tractor attachments are inappropriate for the tractors. Agricultural
machinery was purchased simultaneously for the ASS, Surdud, LSS, Sana'a, and
the Ibb ATC . A competent agricultural machinery expert should be able to
match missing components at the three schools, and explore uses for the
"intermediate technology" components.
2.03    A major drawback in project implementation at NIPA, Hodeidah was the
failure of the central air conditioning system after only one year of
operation. Attempts to repair the system were abandoned because of disputes
over who would bear the costs of the repair, and in particular because of
NIPA, Hodeidah's lack of funds for repair and maintenance of equipment. In
the past four years, the dismantled equipment has suffered a great deal of
corrosion due to rain and salt air. The absence of air conditioning in the
classrooms at NIPA, Hodeidah, where classes begin at 4:00 p.m., has
contributed to a decline in classroom attendance, especially in the 9-month
certificate courses and the 12-month courses in office management/secretarial
skills.
C. Critical Variances in Proiect Implementation
2.04    There were no major variances between the planned and actual project
implementation schedules with respect to the completion of civil works and the
provision of furniture and equipment (Annex 5). The construction of Surdud
ASS was completed some five months ahead of appraisal estimates. Sana'a LSS
was eight months behind. The building of the two branches at Taiz and
Hodeidah was completed some 12-14 months behind appraisal estimates. The



procurement of equipment and furniture was coordinated with building
completion, and commissioning and installation was consequently delayed by
12-26 months for the MOE project schools and by 18 months for the NIPA
branches.
2.05    In the early years of the project, MOE showed a reluctance to use the
technical assistance provisions in the IDA credit, in the expectation that
grants would be available from other sources. It was only in mid-1982, when
it was realized that grants were becoming scarce, that MOE mounted a strong
effort to send its st:aff on fellowship training under the IDA Third Education
Project. The initial hesitation resulted in substantial delays in the
completion of TA (Annex 5).
2.06    By June 1984, one year before the estimated project completion, the
project was 83X disbursed (Basic Data Sheet, p. iv) with all project schools
equipped and in use, and uncommitted funds of about US$ 1.2 million were
recorded. These funds were unutilized due to the strong showing of the Yemeni
rial during the period of construction of civil works (1979-83), which
dampened the escalation of the local cost of site development and materials.
This, along with an increase in IDA disbursement against works from 24 to
28.5%, resulted in a substantial reduction of Government financing of project
costs (Annex 2).
2.07    The renumeration of the specialists also cost less than the appraised
US$5,000 per man-month, since both the MOE and NIPA recruited well qualified
specialists from Arab countries to provide instruction in Arabic. This
remuneration averaged US$1,950 per man-month for the specialist teachers at
the MOE schools and US$2,950 per man-month for specialist services at the NIPA
branches. The project used 32X more man-months of specialized services than
planned, in order to compensate for the time taken by Yemeni counterpart
fellows to complete their training abroad (Annex 5).  This increase in
services did not result in a commensurate increase in the costs of TA, because
of the lower renumeration of the Arabic specialists.  The project also used
36% less fellowship training man-months than planned, since the Government
gave high priority to the use of grants from bilateral agreements, and used,
for example, 58 fellowships for BS and MS degrees in agriculture under a USAID
program with New Mexico State University.
2.08    The project description was unfortunately too rigid, and did not allow
for much reallocation of the uncommitted funds. The Government in December
1985 requested a reallocation of the funds under the Credit to (i) undertake
construction of extensions to the student boarding and teacher apartments at
Surdud ASS and additional animal sheds at Sana'a LSS and (ii) procure
additional equipment, books and vehicles for the MOE project schools and
MOE/PIU. The request was acceded to by IDA in February 1986 with two
extensions of the closing date to July 31, 1988. The fixed cost tenders for
civil works, common in all education projects at that time, caused disputes
with the contractor due to the weakening of the Yemeni rial in 1985 and again
in 1986. The Government was nevertheless averse to IDA's proposal to include
a price adjustment clause, instead directly purchasing building materials and
making these available to contractors. The subsequent decision taken by IDA
to enforce henceforth the inclusion of a price adjustment clause when
contracts are of more than two years duration is a judicious decision seen in
context of the delays experienced in this case. The cancelled balance of the
credit was US$13,827.40.



D. Anticipated Risks
2.09    The project risks were correctly identified at the time of appraisal.
The first risk related to timely recruitment of qualified expatriate and
Yemeni staff for the project institutions. The close cooperation between the
MOE, MOA, USAID team and IDA supervision missions brought about a resolution
of this matter. Both the MOA and USAID agreed to allow Yemeni trainees in
their programs to be made available to the MOE upon completion of their
studies abroad, for appointment to the ASS and LSS as teachers. Through
bilateral arrangements with neighboring Arab countries and using IDA funds
available under the Credit, teaching experts for ASS and LSS were recruited in
a timely fashion.
2.10    The second of the project risks consisted of the possible
under-enrollment of the agricultural and livestock secondary schools. The MOE
and MOA worked together to avoid this contingency. MOE provided stipends and
free boarding and lodging for all students attending the agricultural and
livestock secondary schools, while MOA agreed to employ the graduates of these
schools to meet an ever increasing demand for qualified extension
agents/veterinary assistants. Applications for admissions are now running
nearly 50% more than available places. The enrollment at ASS in the 1988/89
session was 85% of the target, and the output is expected to exceed the target
by 18%. On the other hand, the corresponding enrollment and output from the
LSS are 56% and 67% of the respective targets, principally because of the LSS
Director's predominant concern to maintain a high quality of LSS graduates, a
feature that is highly appreciated by the Directorate of Veterinary Services
of the MOA (Annex 4).
E. UnanticiRated Factors Affecting Proiect Imolementation
2.11    The withdrawal of direct USAID TA to Surdud ASS due to the curtailment
of available USAID funds in YAR for agricultural education has already been
discussed (para. 1.09).
2.12    Another unforeseen factor was the considerable weakening of the Yemeni
rial against the US dollar during the project's later years, a development
which ultimately led to construction delays (Basic Data Sheet, p. vii).
2.13    The project institutions ultimately lacked sufficient funds for
maintenance of the new buildings. Maintenance funds are allocated from a
central budget, and new institutions seldom get enough funds
for even routine maintenance. The responsibility for maintenance has only
been assigned to the Ministry of Public works since late 1988, and the
organizational. arrangements are still weak. These maintenance problems have
resulted in, for example, urgently needed repairs left undone in school
buildings and air conditioning left unrepaired in NIPA, Hodeidah.



III. PROJECT OUTCOMES
A.  Malor Results of the Project
Realization of Project Obiectives
3.01    The project objectives were met, with enrollment goals attained at
three out of the four project institutions, i.e. all except the Sana'a LSS
(Annex 4). In the 1988/89 session, admissions at the LSS were increased from
30 to 45 and consideration is being given to permitting successful trainees
from the one-year course at MOA's Veterinary Assistant Training Center to be
admitted to grade 11 of the LSS, thus possibly further augmenting admissions.
In the past two years, trainees from the one-year course at the different
Development Authorities' Agricultural Extension Agent Training Centers have
been allowed entry to grade 11 at Ibb ATC and Surdud ASS. The only problem
created by such an admissions policy has been a shortage of boarding
facilities for students entering grade 10, necessitating construction of the
extensions to student boarding and teacher apartments at Surdud (para. 2.08).
Impact of the Proiect
3.02    Sectoral Policies.  The diversification of secondary schooling through
the provision of agricultural education had a slow and difficult start with
the first ATC at Ibb, but has taken root with the comparatively successful
operation of the ASS and LSS. Increasing numbers of students are choosing
their careers in this branch of vocational education. The pre-investment
studies for regional basic health care and associated training undertaken with
TA funds under the Credit, set the stage for the YAR First Health Project
(Credit 1294-YAR), the first health project ever undertaken by the World Bank.
3.03    Human Resource DeveloDment.  The quality of the graduates of LSS and
ASS has been favorably received by the principal employers, namely MOA and the
Tihama Development Autbority. Increasingly, these employers are reassessing
the operations of their own training centers and encouraging their trainees to
complete their studies at either the ATC at Ibb or the Surdud ASS, while the
Directorate of Veterinary Services looks to the LSS to provide the better
trained veterinary assistants. The state economic enterprises and regional
governorates at Taiz and Hodeidah acknowledge their reliance on NIPA branches
to provide in-service training in office management, secretarial and
accounting skills, and development administration. These employers offer
grade promotions and associated pay increases to those successful at NIPAs
diploma examinations. Close cooperation between NIPA and Bank missions during
the course of this project has led to the creation of a separate project to
enhance the development of public administration in YAR. This project was
approved by the Board on May 12, 1989, and involves both NIPA and the Ministry
of Civil Service and Administrative Reform.
3.04    Local Institutions.  The Sanasa LSS is distinctive in the secondary
schooling system for: (i) the high quality of its graduates as recognized by
the Directorate of Veterinary Services; (ii) its Yemeni teaching staff; and
(iii) the efficient utilization of the equipment and audio-visual aids
supplied under the Credit. NIPA at Taiz has a director and vice-director
keenly responsive to the needs of local employers, and has thus become a



community college to the people of Taiz. Of the nearly 500 students in the
1989 session, 50% were from the local government, 30X from the public sector
and banks, and 20% from the private sector. Furthermore, nearly 40% of
enrollees were women.
B. Proiect Sustainability
3.05    The project is likely to maintain an acceptable level of net benefits
if the implementing agencies continue to address the following concerns:
(a) Communication of Future Demands for Vocational Skills.
(i)  The early collaboration between MOA, TDA and MOE contributed
to the development of the curriculum at LSS and ASS and to
the successful employment of their graduates, but has not
continued as vigorously since the dissolution of the
Agricultural Education Council of MOE in 1985.  MOE could
appoint specialists from IMNOA and TDA as external examiners
of the oral and practical examinations at LSS and ASS, which
would again contribute to collaboratory benefits without
requiring new regulations.
(ii) For the most part, the NIPA branches have trained local
government and public sector employees, although some
training needs to be provided to the emerging private sector
in such areas as cost accounting, word and data processing,
and English language training commensurate with the
standards of commercial correspondence. Such a need has
already been articulated by the Hodeidah Chamber of Commerce
and Industry.
(b)  Availability and Upgrading of Instructors.
MOE is fortunate in having access to long-term fellowships for
its teachers, although some arrangements should be available for
short-term specialized training for Yemeni teachers after some
years of employment at LSS and ASS. Only 2 out of the 7 fellows
sent on training under the project returned to the NIPA branches,
the others being posted to NIPA, Sana'a (Annex 11). NIPA's
recent policy of recruiting junior teaching staff for each NIPA
branch from those who have residence in the regional governorate
should, however, ensure steady upgrading of instructors retained.
(c) Control of Unit Recurrent Expenditure.
One means of controlling unit current expenditures is to control
the number of non-Yemeni teachers recruited. The unit
expenditure at the LSS, for example, declined from YR1 41,200 to
YR1 19,600 from 1983-84 to 1987-88, at the end of which time all
teaching staff were Yemeni (Annex 12). NIPA could also
reconsider its policy of waiving tuition for employees nominated
by income-generating public sector organizations (Water and
Sewerage Authority, and the like) and for private sector firms.



- 9 -
The Hodeidah Chamber of Commerce and Industry is willing to fund
certain training courses (e.g., cost accounting) that meet with
their standards, another potential means of controlling
expenditures. There is also scope for MOE to permit the LSS and
ASS to set up a revolving fund from the sale of agricultural
produce (some YRI 225,000 per year at each center) for the
maintenance of buildings and equipment.
IV. IDA - BORROWER PERFORMUNCE
A. IDA Performance During the Prolect Cycle
Strengths and Weaknesses from IDA's Persgective
4.01    IDA pe-formed reasonably well in all the early stages of the project
cycle right through to negotiations and Board approval on May 22, 1979. There
were no delays between planned and actual dates. The supervision mission of
July 1979 ensured that MOE was taking adequate steps to meet the condition for
credit effectiveness, namely the appointment of all specialists required for
the operation of all schools, institutes and centers established under the
previous Development Credit Agreements (Credits 421 and 611-YAR) by the
beginning of the 1979/80 academic year. This condition was met and the Credit
became effective on December 21, 1979, with less than a two month delay.
4.02    IDA supervision staff contributed to the success of the project
through constant monitoring and professional advice to the implementing
agencies between 1978 and 1988, and appeared to bp adequate in both timing and
staffing. This monitoring allowed all project institutions to begin the
academic year on the dates planned, even though three out of the four schools
were completed behind schedule.
Streneths and Weaknesses from Borrover's PersRective
4.03    Both the PIU and the project institutions found the IDA supervision
mission members qualified in providing assistance at the different stages of
the project cycle, commencing with the preparation of the project. In
particular, the criticism of the quality of construction of IDA-supported
institutions in Education I and II (Credits 421 and 611-YAR) was overcome in
this project by the willingness of IDA missions to support designs based on
greater use of indigenous building materials. As a consequence, the design of
the buildings and the quality of construction were a great improvement over
previous ones (para. 2.01). Furthermore, the IDA missions and the PIU
together established building and furniture standards.
4.04    Savings were generated in the local as well as the foreign-exchange
components of the project funds, as a result of this favorable implementation
performance. The Government as well as IDA were, however, slow in making
decisions on the use of uncommitted funds. The additional construction of
extensions to the apartments at ASS Surdud resulted in two extensions to the
Closing Date as already mentioned, and the civil works will now be completed
in December 1989. It is this small component of civil works (IDA's share of
disbursement US$ 300,000) which gives the appearance of slow performance.



- 10 -
Lessons Learned
4.05    The principal lessons learned are:
(a) an early agreement should be reached with the Borrower on the
objectives, timing, scope and sources of TA (para. 2.05 and
4.06);
(b) project description and design should be broad enough to provide
flexibility in implementation (para. 2.08);
(c) actual and projected disbursements should be closely monitored,
and decisions on utilization of savings should be made in
recognition of closing dates (para. 2.06 and 4.04);
(d) organizational arrangements and local cost estimates should
include provisions for repair/maintenance of buildings and
equipment (para. 2.06 and 2.13);and
(e) early recruitment of specialists and training of Yemeni
counterparts is needed if project schools are to commence
operations in a timely fashion (para. 2.07).
B. Borrower Performance during Project Cycle
Strengths and Weaknesses from IDA's PersRective
4.06    The PIU performed effectively during project preparation and
implementation. As stated in para. 2.01, PIU was able to achieve considerable
improvements in the design and construction of buildings over those completed
under the previous two IDA education projects. MOE, for its part, took a
forceful lead in securing the appointment of all specialists required, not
only for the operation of project schools for the earlier two IDA projects,
but also before LSS and ASS opened their classes in the first planned academic
session. NIPA's management was also active in the recruitment of specialist
teachers from Arab countries and in arranging for fellowship training. There
were, however, weaknesses in some aspects of TA implementation, notably in the
limited coordination with USAID and UNDP on TA programs in subject fields
covered by the project, and consequent delays in the MOE fellowship training
in educational management. In addition to these delays in award of
fellowships, the trainees have not been able to undertake a complete program
of study because of a lack of adequate library resources and small group
teaching in their respective universities (Annex 11).
Strengths and Weaknesses from Borrower's PersRective
4.07    During this project, the PIU, mainly staffed by expatriates, merged
with the School Building Unit (SBU) of the MOE. On-the-job training provided
by SBU staff, together with the fellowship training provided to the PIU staff
under the project have resulted in five departments now being headed by Yemeni
nationals. The expatriate Director is also assisted by a Yemeni Assistant
Director. A similar performance in education management within the MOE could
not be achieved under this Credit but continues to be a focus of attention in



- 11 -
subsequent projects, e.g., research and evaluation functions at Education
Research and Development Center.
4.08    The MOE recognizes that agricultural education was not attractive to
Yemeni parents or to students. Only through concerted action taken by both
the MOE and the MOA in offering incentives and employment opportunities has
this prejudice been overcome. The Borrower agrees with IDA's recommendations
that: (i) collaboration between HOE and MOA could be improved by appr ri
of external examiners from MOA (para. 3.05(a)); and (ii) NIPA should
reconsider its policy of not charging ttition for employees nominated by
income generating public sector organizations as well as for employees of the
private sector.
Lessons Learned
4.09    The major lessons learned are:
(a) The Borrower should verify quality of training in the selected
university before award of long-term fellowships (para. 4.06);
(b) the administrative skills of the Yemeni director of the school or
institute have a profound influence on the quality of the
education/training program and on the cooperation with employer
agencies (para. 3.04).
C. Proiect Relationships
IDA-Borrower Performance
4.10    The relationship between IDA and the MOE has been a frank one.  The
MOE understands why IDA is reluctant to amend credits for the use of
unutilized funds when closing dates are affected. The MOE is, however,
concerned with the existence of unutilized funds, since access to foreign
exchange is not readily available to ministries such as MOE. It is for this
reason that MOE would like IDA projects to be broad enough to provide
flexibility for the use of unutilized funds.  The MOE agrees, however, that
such decisions should be made well before the closing date.
4.11    An effective result of IDA - Borrower collaboration was the merger of
the PIU and the SBU of MOE, through a program of on-the-job training and
fellowships for SBU's technical staff. The PIU, which was wholly expatriate
(9 specialists) in 1981, had by 1985 only 3 expatriate specialists.
4.12    One weakness of IDA-Borrower performance was in the extension of the
credit Closing Date to take advantage of unutilized funds by devoting them to
additional construction of extensions at the ASS which were essential for
meeting the overall project objectives (para. 2.08).
Borrower's Relationshios With Other Relevant Parties
4.13    MOE's relationships with MOA and TDA and NIPA's relationship with the
regional governorates and public sector agencies have been effective (paras.
3.05, 4.08, and 4.10).



- 12 -
V.  Consulting Services
Role and Performance of Consultants
5.01    Thc quality -and performance of projcct consultants was satisfactory.
The role of the specialists recruited for MOE's ASS and LSS and the NIPA
branches was one of expert teacher/instructor and their contracts were so
structured. The timely presence of these specialists ensured start-up of
classes as planned, as well as the availability of mimeographed notes in
Arabic to students/trainees. The teaching load did not leave most of the
specialists much time to introduce innovation in teaching methods, which
awaited the return of qualified Yemeni fellows from abroad.
5.02    NIPA and the University of Sana'a arranged their fellowship training
programs through a consulting firm, which produced satisfactory results in
placement, preparatory language training, performance monitoring and
successful study completion of fellows. The direct placement of students by
the MOE in identified institutions resulted in delays (Annex 11).
VI. Proiect Documentation and Data
A.  Letal Aareements
6.01    All the covenants in the loan agreement were met by the Borrower
(Annex 7), except for the covenant relating to tracer studies - a boiler plate
c=lause of those times.
6.02    The staff appraisal report and the associated working papers provided
a useful framework for the different agencies responsible for project
implementation. This framework was used by the PIU for monitoring and
preparation of quarterly progress reports, and as an indication of the
availability of funds. As later supervision missions developed reporting
formats suitable for the IDA's Implementation Summary and the project
completion report, these formats were also used by PIU in their quarterly
progress reporting and internal monitoring.
B. Sources of Information
6.03    The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) provided all the factual
information concerning planned and actual completion dates for the project
(Annex 5) project costs (Annex 3), project studies (Annex 6) and civil works
and equipment procurement schedules (Annexes 9 and 10), including the planned
and actual utilization of the credit funds (Basic Data Sheet, p. vii). The
project institutions provided all data on the planned and actual enrollments
and recurrent expenditures (Annexes 4, 13 and 14).

/a Minor construction of animal sheds for the LSS at Sana'a and construction
of extensions of student boarding and teacher apartments at ASS, Surdud,
were added to the original civil works schedule in 1986 with the
expectation that these constructions would be completed by the end of
1987. While the new construction at LSS, Sanaa, was completed in
September 1986, that at Surdud stopped in October 1987 because of the
rising costs of the building materials and the rapid decline in the value
of the Yemeni rial from 1986.
