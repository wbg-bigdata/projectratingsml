INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMNT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A JATILUHUR
IRRIGATION EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the
equivalent of US$30 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a
Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       The latest economic report on Indonesia (The Indonesian
Economy: RecentDevelopments and Prospects for 1974/75, November 26, 1973,
R73-273) described and analysed the substantial changes which have taken
place in the Indonesian economy in 1973. Since then there have been
important further developments, especially in oil prices. A Basic
Economic Mission is planned for September/October 1974 to reassess
Indonesia's longer term development prospects and policies. Country
data are shown in Annex I.
3.        The Indonesian economy, which was dualistic and export-
oriented in the colonial period, was severely affected by the great
depression in the 'thirties, and the war, followed by the struggle for
independence, in the 'forties. After a relatively brief period of
recovery in the early 'fifties, the economy stagnated again in the decade
1957-1967 largely as a result of adverse economic policies. Thus, after
a long period of economic difficulties, in which the population nearly
doubledj Indonesia has become one of the poorest large countries in the
world (1970 population about 115 million, per capita income about $80).
4.        After the Suharto Government introduced an effective stabiliza-
tion program to combat the economic disruption and spiralling inflation
of the mid-1960s, there has been a period of recovery and rehabilitation
under the First Five-Year P]ai. Real annual economic growth was
close to 7% in the period 1968-1972. Domestic savings and investments
increased considerably, thus providing the basis for continued economic
expansion after the rehabilitation phase. By 1972, investments, exclud-
ing those in the oil sector, had grown to an estimated 17% of the GNP,
of which more than two-thirds were financed from domestic sources.
In agriculture, sustained efforts were made to increase food production,
with emphasis on rice. Although a drought in the second half of 1972
led to a setback in food production and a steep increase in prices,
production has recovered since then. Efforts to expand food production
continue to receive high priority and in this connection the Government
plans a large increase in fertilizer imports in 1974, international
supplies permitting. Expansion of domestic fertilizer capacity is being
actively pursued.



- 2 -
5.        Even before the world energy shortage came to a head in the
latter part of 1973, the money economy was booming, and real growth
was probably accelerating under the influence of steep increases in
Indonesia's export prices, a significant physical expansion of produc-
tion in the oil and forestry sectors, a rapid growth in direct foreign
investment (initially in mining, but increasingly in manufacturing),
and a large inflow of short-term credit. The same factors, however,
also caused significant inflation, reaching a rate of 40% per annum in
the beginning of 1974. The Government has taken a number of measures
to combat the inflation, most recently in April 1974.
6.        The contribution of the oil sector to the economy, which was
already increasing rapidly, has taken a quantum jump since September
1973. The Indonesian oil price, which was still $3.73 per barrel in
that month, reached $11.70 per barrel on April 1, 1974. In addition,
Indonesia has renegotiated the contracts with the foreign oil companies
to receive a larger share of the total oil proceeds. Thus, while the
net oil contributions to the balance of payments and tbe Government's
oil revenues were below $0.5 billion in 1972/731/ (less than 5% of the
GNP), they are expected to reach well over $3 billion in 1974/75, an
increase of $20 per capita. Given also the external and domestic in-
flation, total exports as well as budgetary receipts will probably
exceed $5 billion in 1974/75; a rough quadrupling in two years.
7.         The inflation is, however, also affecting the expenditure side
of the balance of payments and the budget. Average Indonesian import prices
are expected to increase by 80 percent between 1972 and 1974, with the
largest increases occurring in foodstuffs and agricultural inputs (rice,
wheat, sugar, fertilizer). To shield the domestic consumer against the
effect of high external prices, the Government is subsidizing these imports
at an annual cost of nearly $L billion. In addition, the Government has to
pay more for domestic goods and services (including Government salaries).
Thus, about one-half of the additional budgetary receipts will be eroded
by the different effects of inflation. Of the other half, a significant
part will be spent on real increases in Government outlays, including
much-needed gradual salary increases. development expenditures, routine
material expenditures, and subsidies to regions. Nevertheless, there will
probably remain a budgetary surplus of $0.5 - $1.0 billion in 1974-75.
The expected overall surplus on the balance of payments is somewhat larger,
and foreign exchange reserves may increase from $0.9 billion on March 31,
1974 to about $2 billion (about five months of imports at the then expected
rate) a year later.
8.        These surpluses are not large in relation to Indonesia's needs
for additional current and capital expenditures in nearly every field,
as specified in the Second Five Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79). Moreover,
/ Fiscal year starting April 1l



-3-
earlier problems of absorptive capacity are gradually being overcome.
Thus, even though some of the expenditures budgeted for 1974/75
(consumers' subsidies) should only be temporary, it will probably not
be long before the new resources are fully absorbed.
9.        The Second Five Year Plan also provides significant new
directions in emphasizing the social, regional and equity aspects of
development. It is recognized that, while the Government's initial
economic stabilization and rehabilitation programs, as well as a
number of specific activities, have benefitted large segments of the
population, the benefits of investments in the modern sector - much
of it in or around Jakarta - have not been widely spread. Also, the
continued high level of agricultural prices after the 1972 crop failure
has ultimately benefitted the rural areas, but is severely reducing
the real income of the urban poor. The Government's policy to keep the
prices of basic ccomodities in check through subsidization of imports
is providing relief, but it is the intention to gradually work out and
implement a number of more basic socially oriented policies in the
fields of employment, education, housing, etc.
10.       In the short and medium run, Indonesia therefore faces the
problems of efficient utilization of additional resources, and of the
implementation of more socially-oriented policies. In this context,
there will be a need for continued international technical assistance
for project implementation and institution building. After the new
resources have been absorbed, Indonesia will also still need financial
assistance to finance further programs to alleviate its poverty. There
is therefore a strong case for continued international assistance to
Indonesia, even though the country may generate relatively modest
budgetary and balance of payments surpluses for a limited period. In
all probability, these surpluses will have been absorbed by the time
disbursements from new projects become significant.
11.       The soft average terms of foreign assistance provided in the
context of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI), and the
rescheduling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970 Paris
Club Agreement with the Western countries and Japan, and parallel
arrangements with several Eastern European countries) have kept Indonesia's
public debt service ratio relatively low. Service payments on re-
scheduled and subsequently incurred public debt are estimated at $320
million in 1974, will reach a peak of $380 million in 1975, and are pro-
jected to decrease gradually thereafter. Comparing these amounts with
the projected export level of over $5 billion in 1974/75, and given the
fact that Indonesia's external terms of trade will probably remain
favorable, it appears that Indonesia now has the capacity to service
significant additional debt.
12.       The changes in Indonesian economic circumstances discussed
above had become apparent by the time of the IGGI pledging meeting in
May 1974. As a result, it was generally agreed that program aid was
no longer necessary on economic grounds, although some donors will



- 4 -
continue such aid, at least for some time, for reasons of convenience.
At the same time, the meeting endorsed the view that a considerable
expansion in project aid was warranted to assist Indonesia in carrying
out a more ambitious development strategy. Although some members were
not in a position to make pledges, it seems likely that total aid
commitments (including IBRD loans) in 1974/75 will exceed the aid request
of $850 million.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
13.     For the reasons  indicated in Part I, Indonesia will continue
to need substantial external financial and technical assistance to re-
habilitate and improve infrastructure and expand production capabilities
in agriculture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing. With the continued
growth of the economy, the Government will also be able to devote increas-
ing attention to development of effective programs designed to ensure that
the benefits of development are distributed widely. Agricultural programs
to increase the productivity of smallholder farmers, regional development
in the outer islands, family planning and other social programs will there-
fore have an important place in the development strategy during the period
of the Second Plan.
14.     The work of both the headquarters and Resident Staff has bean
oriented toward these development objectives. The basic economic mission,
scheduled for early this fall, will concentrate on questions of employment
and income distribution.
15.     All Bank Group lending so far has been   on IDA terms. As a result
of Indonesia's rapidly improving balance of payments and'resource position,
described in Part I of this report, Indonesia is now able to borrow on
less concessional terms. The Bank has therefore informed the Government that
all lending after FY74 will be provided on Bank terms.    Following the two
credits presented to the Executive Directors on June 4, 1974, the proposed
credit will constitute the last IDA credit to Indonesia.
16.     The Bank Group has in the past financed local currency costs under
its projects in Indonesia. Such financing will continue to be necessary
if the Bank Group is to increase assistance to the agriculture and social
sectors, where projects frequently have a low foreign exchange component.
In such cases, the Bank Group will therefore continue to provide limited
amounts of local cost financing.
17.     As of April 30, 1974, Indonesia has received 34 IDA credits amounting
to US$509.3 million. On June 4 the Executive Directors approved two IDA
credits amounting to US$22.5 million and one Bank loan of US$48 million. The
Bank Group accounts for less than 4% of Indonesia's total outstanding public
debt. By 1978 itis expected to account for less than 11% of total outstanding
debt and less than 5% of Indonesia's annual debt service obligations. Annex II
contains a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC investments as of
April 30, 1974, and notes on the execution of on-going IDA projects.



18.        In accordance with the priorities of Indonesia's Five-Year Plans,
over 35% of IDA lending to date has been for agriculture. The Association
has extended four credits to help rehabilitate and develop plantations in
the Goverrment estates sector. Other credits for agriculture include four
to assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems and one each for a fisheries
project, a seeds multiplication program, beef cattle development, small-
holder rubber development, sugar industry rehabilitation and smallholder
tea development. Industry is of growing importance to the Indonesian
economnv and the Association has assisted in four projects in this sector.
It organized a consortium of lenders to finance a major expansion of the
PUSRI Fertilizer plant, assisted in the reorganization and financing of the
major state development bank (BAPINDO), provided financial assistance for
Indonesia's first industrial estate project, and assisted in the establish-
ment and financing of the Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI)0 Other priority sectors to which credits have been extended are
power, transportation, telecommunications, education and population. In
addition, four technical assistance credits have been made to assist the
Government in preparing projects and formulating appropriate development
policies. Projects in rural works, telecommunications, water supply, urban
development, agriculture research and a second loan to BAPINDO are being
prepared and may be presented to the Executive Directors in the next several
months.
19.         The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in 1968, and about
half of all credits have been made since June 1971. The program has
increased rapidly from a relatively small base, and consequently the
undisbursed portion of IDA credits is relatively large. Virtually every
credit has been associated with extensive institutional reforns involving,
inter alia, the creation of new project authorities, drafting of new
charters and the enactment of new legislation, all of which has taken
much time. A number of projects have experienced delays, particularly
in the initial stages of implementation. However, project execution has
improved sharply during the last year as organizatianal improvements
have begun to take effect and Indonesian staff have become more fam-liar
with Bank Group procedures. Given the status of projects at the beginning
of calendar 1973, disbursements under Indonesian projects during 1973
were about the same as would have been expected on an IDA-wide basis for
a progran of the same size and composition. There are, nevertheless, still
several projects, including the first agricultural estate project and the
smallholder rubber project, which continue to suffer from management weak-
ness and to require continued close attention from the Bank's Resident Staff.

PART III - THE SECTOR
The Agriculture Sector
20.       The Indonesian economy is predominantly rural; agriculture
accounts for over half of GNP, almost all of non-oil exports and two-
thirds of total employment.  The Goverament's First Five-Year
Development Plan (1969-73) placed priority on increasing agricultural
production, particularly rice, the staple food, through rehabilita-
tion of irrigation systems, price support and supply of modern inputs.
As a result of these efforts and favorable weather conditions, both
total agricultural and foodgrain production increased at an annual
rate of about 4% between 1968 and 1972. However, the 1972 rice crop
was seriously affected by drought, production fell 4-5% below the
trend level and the Government had to import about 1.1 million tons
of rice. Although the 1973 rice crop was satisfactory, more then a
million tons of rice were imported.
21.       The Bank Group estimiates that Indonesia will not achieve
self-sufficiency in rice within this or next decade. In order to
attain self-sufficiency, the Government will need to improve and
expand irrigation facilities, produce and distribute greater quanti-
ties of fertilizer and improved seeds and upgrade agricultural research
and extension servicese. In Java production increases would be achieved
mainly by providing improved irrigation and modern inputs, particularly
to smallholders; on the outer islands by developing effective trans-
migration and nucleus estate projects; and on the national level by
strengthening institutions for nationwide programs in the fields of
agricultural research, credits and training.
22.       Productioncf other food crops such as maize, vegetables,
groundnuts, cassava, sugar and soybeans has not increased significantly
in recent years. Production of traditional export crops has however
responded well to Government programs and to favorable trends in inter-
national prices.  Traditional exports such as rubber, tea, pepper,
coffee, copra and tobacco, together with timber, represented about 70%
of non-oil export earnings in 1973. For many of these crops, there is
scope for further increases in production both from estates and small-
holders.
The Existing Irrigation System
23.      Lrigation by canal systems began in Indonesia in the mid-
eighteenth century and by 1937 the irrigated rice area had reached
about 2.9 million ha primarily in Java. However, as a result of
neglected maintenance of the last 30 years or so, systems covering
about 1.9 million ha ir. Java required rehabilitation by the mid-1960s.
The Government gave high priority to this task in the First Five-Year
Plan and about 60% of the agricultural development budget was allocated
to irrigation. During this period, the Association made four irriga-
tion credits to Indonesia amounting to US$50.5 million to assist in



-7-
rehabilitating 820,000 ha mainly in Java, but including about 80,000
ha in South Sumatra and Sulawesi. The Asian Development Bank, FAO,
UNDP and bilateral sources have also provided funds to help the
Government implement irrigation rehabilitation projects. At present,
there are four million ha under irrigation, which represents about
50% of the country's rice land. However, only about 1.5 million ha
have permanent control structures. The remaining 2.5 million ha have
only temporary structures which makes water distribution unreliable.
24.       Except for the Jatiluhur area, most of the irrigation
systems in Java can irrigate only 15-25% of the project area during
the dry season because of the small flows in the rivers and the lack
of storage reservoirs. Rehabilitation of the main and secondary
canals is thus only the first essential step in developing Indonesia's
irrigation systems. Increasing water storage capacity and providing
more effective irrigation and drainage networks at farm level are also
important requirements to which Government will need to give more
attention in the future. Accordingly, the Association has assisted
in financing feasibility studies of storage reservoirs in the Pemali-
Comal Irrigation Project through Credit 275-IND and the Cimanuk
Project through Credit 289-IND while pilot on-farm development schemes
are a prominent feature of the prcposed project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The Jatiluhur rice producing area in the province of West
Java, covers an area of 300,000 ha of which 237,000 ha are potentially
irrigable. The irrigation system is a combination of old river diver-
sion schemes which have been linked together and more recently ex-
tended by storage works, including the Jatiluhur Dam, with an effective
storage capacity of 2,600 Mn3. The reservoir is designed to store
sufficient water to allow double cropping of rice throughout the
command area. With the assistance of Credit 195-IND (Second Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project), the Government is rehabilitating main canals
and major structures serving about 186,000 ha in the Jatiluhur area.
Progress thus far has been generally satisfactory and the project is
expected to be completed in 1976.
Project Area
26.       The area to be irrigated under the proposed project covers
the rema-iing 51,000 ha of irrigable land under the command of the
Jatiluhur reservoir. About 36,000 farm families with an average
6.8 members per family live in the project area. The project will
thus benefit directly 245,000 people. The average farm size is small,
only 1.4 ha of cultivable land. Median farm sizes are even smaller
ranging between 1.3 ha in the north and 0.8 ha in the south. About
50% of the project area is cultivated by 20% of the farmers on land
parcels between 2 ha and 5 ha; 43% of the land by 50% of the farmers



-8-
on parcels between 0.5 ha and 2 ha; and the remaining 5% by 30% of
the farmers on parcels under 0.5 he. Land fragmentation in the area
is not a serious problem. However, only about 25% of the farmers,
farming about 43% of the land, are owner-operators; another 10% are
tenants renting their land from the Forestry Department or from the
village administrations; and the balance are sharecroppers cultivating
about half of the area, mainly in the less productive regions. Under
sharecropping arrangements, crops are shared on a 50-50 basis and
expenses on a variable basis.
27.       Rice, the main crop, is grown throughout the project area
in the wet season and wherever there is sufficient water during the
dry season. The overall annual cropping intensity is about 130%,
with a small area (6% of the total) under field crops in the dry
season. These include maize, cassava, legumes and vegetables and
are grown on high ground with light soil, generally along the river
banks, with a combined production of less than 7,000 tons per year..
Background of the Project
28.       The feasibility study for the proposed project was prepared
by consultants financed under Credit 195-IND. The project was
appraised by a Bank Group teem composed of Messrs. Pranich, Kim,
Mbnning, Morton and Okabe in April-May 1973. Negotiations were de-
layed pending the designation of a new President Director of the
Jatiluhur Authority and.held in Washington on May 10-17, 1974. The
Government's negotiating team was led by Yr. Saleh Afiff, Deputy
Chairman of BAPPENAS, the National Planning Agency. The Appraisal
Report dated May 31, 1974 is being circulated to the Executive
Directors separately and the principal features of the proposed pro-
ject and credit are summarized in Annex III.
Project Description
29.       The project provides funds for rehabilitating 115 km of
existing flood embankments on the Citarum River; constructing a major
flood diversion channel (26km), secondary irrigation canals (270 km)
and drains (300 kmi), tertiary irrigation canals (500 km) and drains
(500 km), neu feeder roads (170 kIn), and office buildings, stores and
houses for project staff; and reclamation of about h,000 ha of un-
inhabited swamp land. Funds are 31so included to procure vehicles
and equipment,for supervision of construction and agricultural ex-
tension services, to engage a consulting firm to carry out planning,
design and detailed engineering and also to employ an agricultural
extension specialist and an irrigation operation and maintenance
engineer. The project would upgrade and expand agricultural extension
services in the project area and in the area under Credit 195-IND; and
develop a training program for project staff, agriculturists, agri-
cultural extension officers and selected farmers. In addition, funds
are provided to assist the Government in designing and constructing
a number of pilot on-farm development areas covering about 4,000 ha
in the four on-going irrigation rehabilitation project areas assisted
by IDA under Credits 127, 195, 220 and 289-IND, and about 1,000 ha in
the present project area.



-9-
Project Cost and Financing
30.       Total project costs are estimated at US$68 million equivalent
of which US$22 million (32% of the total costs) would be in foreign ex-
change, excluding duties and taxes.  The proposed credit of US$30 million
equivalent would finance about 44% of the total project costs and would
cover the foreign exchange costs and some of the local costs. The re-
maining 56% of total project costs would be provided by the Government
through annual budget appropriations to the Jatiluhur Authority. Cost
estimates have been based on acceptable preliminary designs and similar
works in West Java adjusted to end 1973 price levels. They include pro-
visions for expected cost increases due to inflation and physical contin-
gencies. The project costs are summarized below:

Tertiary Networks and On-Farm Development
31.       Tertiary irrigation canals and structures in Indonesia have
traditionally been constructed and maintained by farmers while drainage
has usually followed natural channels, rivers and streams, Since this
has been a slow prooess in the past and drainage canals in this project
are beyond the farmers' capability to oonstruot, tertiary irrigation
and drainage networks would be constructed by the Authority. In
addition, the proposed project would provide for design and construc-
tion of a number of pilot schemes for on-farm development on fully
rehabilitated tertiary units in the project areas rehabilitated under
the first four IDA irrigation credits as well as in this project area.
The main objeotives of the pilot schemes would be to develop a



- 10 -
suitable long-term approach to on-farm development in Indonesia,
consisting of works for tertiary and quaternary irrigation and drain-
age canals with related control structures, land levelling where
necessary, farm roads and to the extent possible, land consolidation.
After studying the results of the schemes, the Government would
discuss its findings with the Association before the end of 1977 and
would implement the agreed on-farm development programs throughout
the area of the proposed project.
Agricultural Supporting Services
32.       Agricultural support activities also need to be strengthened
substantially if potential production increases are to be achieved.
The project would therefore provide assistance for strengthening and
expanding agricultural extension services for the entire Jatiluhur
area. The proposed IDA credit would help finance supporting vehicles
and equipment, training centers and overseas training of agricultural
extension officers. In addition, the credit would finance the services
of an internationally recruited extension specialist. To the extent
possible the Government will expand existing credit programs in the
project area and ensure that adequate supplies of fertilizer and
pesticides are made available to farkers. A program is being prepared
by the Authority for the long-term agricultural development of the
Jatilahur area which would provide for an integrated program of de-
velopment and coordination of the efforts of the various agencies
concerned. The Government will submit this program to the Assooiation
not later than September 30, 1975 and iiplement the agreed program
thereafter. Furthermorej, the propo.ed project would provide for a
detailed survey and evaluation of the present and projected financial
situation of the sharecroppers, mall farmers and landlords in the
project area which would recomend suitable incentives to ensure full
participation of small farmers and sharecroppers in the project.
Organization
33.        The project would be carried out by the Jatiluhur Authority
which was established in 1970 as a seni-autonomous public agency to
manage the Jatiluhur Dam and the development of the Jatiluhur region
and to implement the Second Irrigation Rehabilitation Project financed
under Credit 195-ID.   abile the performance of the Authority has been
generally satisfactory, experience since 1970 has pointed to a number
of desirable ahanges in the Authority'as organization and operating
procedures. The Government has prepared a plan to make suitable
changes and after consultation with the Association agreed to imple-
ment it by Jne 30, 1975. Under this plan coordination among the
Departments of the Authority - Irrig4tion, Administration and
ELectric Pbwer - would be izproved. The activities and funactions
of each Department of the Authority and the relationsbip between
them would be specified in a new Administrative Order which would
also outline duties, responsibilities and authorities of all key
staff of the Authority. Uhder the now organization, the Authority
would assume a larger role than it has at present in planning and
assisting in the implementation of agricultural development in the
Jatiluhur area.



Operation and Maintenance and Recovery of Capital Cost
34.       Under a law promulgated in 1959, Indonesian farmers pay to
provincial governments a tax called IPEDA. The tax amounts to 5% of
the net value of production (NVP) of the farmers' land. Revenues
accruing from this tax are used by provinces to finance operation
and maintenance for the irrigation systems and various investment
programs, including irrigation projects. At present the IPEDA re-
venues are not sufficient to cover the total requirements for opera-
tion and maintenance. Part of the needed funds are therefore pro-
vided from the central government budget. However, the increase in
farmers' income resulting from the project would generate sufficient
increase in the IPEDA tax collection to provide enough revenues to
meet the full operation and maintenance expenditures of the Authority
and recover the projebt cost, without interest, approximately over 40 years.
Procurement and Disbursement
35.       Vehicles and equipment for the project (about US$400,000)
would be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Group Guide'lines. For purposes of bid comparison,
a margin of preference of 15% or the level of customs duties, which-
ever is less, would be granted to qualified local manufacturers.
Small off-the-shelf items of less than US$5,o0o each, up to an
aggregate limit of US$50,000 would be purchased through competitive
procedures, including but not limited to obtaining not less than three
price quotations. Civil works would be grouped into about four con-
tracts, ranging from us$5 million to US$15 million each, and tendered
in accordance with the Bank Group's normal procedures for international
competitive bidding. All civil works contractors invited to bid would
be required to pre-qualify. In order to promote and upgrade the capa-
bilitiesof local firms, foreign contracting firms interested in sub-
mitting tenders would be encouraged to associate themselves with
Indonesian firms and local contractors would also receive a preference
of 7-1/2% of the bid amount in bid comparisons.
36.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed against
100% cf foreign expenditures of consultants; 100% of the c.i.f. cost
of directly imported vehicles and equipment, 95% of the ex-factory
price of equipment manufactured locally; and 65% of the off-the-shelf
price of the goods imported but procured locally. Disbursements for
civil works would be made for 55% of such expenditures.
Benefits and Justification
37.       At full development in 1988 paddy production from the project
area is expected to increase to about 363,000 tons annually from
93,000 tons at present. This means that project production would re-
present a net annual foreign exchange saving of about US$33 million
from 1988 onwards.

38.       Farm models indicate that depending on the size and type of
holding, present net farm incomes of between Rp 46,o0o and Rp 151,000
(US$110-390) would increase to between Rp 150,000 and Rp 680,000
(US$360-1,640). The project would also generate considerable employ-
ment opportunities for farmers who are now chronically under-employed.
Emigration to urban areas would be reduced as a large number of small
farmers and sharecroppers would be provided with an additional source
of farm income.
39.       In evaluating project benefits, an estimated future farm-
gate price of US$225 for paddy was used. This was derived from the
Bank Group's forecast for the world market price of milled rice in
1985 in terms of 1974 constant prices. Farm labor was costed on the
basis of future supply and demand of farm labor and alternative employ-
ment opportunities. The economic rate of return over the 50-year
life of the project would be 42% when the projected world price of
rice was used.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Indonesia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
41.       The special features referred to in paragraphs 31, 33 and
34 of this Report are reflected in Sections 3.05(a), 4.07, 3.11 and
4004 respectively.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION V
Cr. No. 127 Irrigation Rehabilitation; US$5 Million Credit of
SeDtember 6, 1965; Closing Date:  December 31,, 1975
This project includes the supply of earth-moving equipment and
machinery to augment hand labor in rehabilitation work on three irrigation
systems (in Java) and the construction of a fourth (in South Sumatra).
All the equipment supplied under the credit is being well utilized and
disbursements are 98% of appraisal timetable, Final completion of the
project is expected to be delayed by about two years in order to complete
much additional needed drainage work, the financing of which was not pro-
vided for under the dredit. These additional costs will be met by the
Government. The revised economic rate of return on the project, which
was calculated at 50% at appraisal, is now expected to be about 25%. The
closing date has been postponed to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 154 Highways; US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 19714
The project is now progressing satisfactorily. The closing
date has been postponed by one year to December 31, 1974.
Cr, No. 155 Agricultural Estates; US$16 Million Credit of
June 20, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This credit is for the rehabilitation of two Government owned
estate groups in North Sumatra. The credit became effective six months
after signature, the delay resulting from unforeseen difficulties in the
appointment of management, advisors and visiting inspectors. Delays in
development occurred as oil palm planting material in Indonesia was found
to be genetically unsuited and, an unforeseen sharp fall in rubber prices
seriously restricted the availability of self-generated funds.  With recent
improvements in management and niuch higher international prices for rubber
the financial situation of the 2NP V is expected to improve.
Now that field and factory standards have been raised to a good
technical level the management has been advised to concentrate on cost
control in order to prepare for the time when produce prices are less
attractive than they are today. The combined efforts of the management,
consultants and IDA supervision missions are beginning to yield good
results.
Cr. No. 165 Electricity, Distribution; US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Closing Date:   June 30, 1975
This project is progressing satisfactorily. The closing date
has been postponed by 18 months to June 30, 1975.

Cr. No. 193  PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion; US$35 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970 (as amended May 1      Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
The project has progressed satisfactorily after a new time
schedule was agreed to allow for time required to meet all conditions of
effectiveness and the procurement requirements of all co-lenders. The
general contractor now is expected to complete the plant by early July 1974
about one-and-one-half months ahead of the revised schedule. The construc-
tion and installation of a natural gas gathering system and a 65 mile trans-
mission line has also been delayed but the plant is now receiving gas for
testing and the gathering system is expected to be completed two months
ahead of startup.
Cost for the fertilizer plant has increased by about 17% due
to currency revaluations and changes made as detailed design progressed
and the true composition of the gas became known. The gas system has
been enlarged to meet the increased need of the fertilizer canplex and
to supply a greatly increased usage by Pertamina's refineries and by
power plants.
Latest cost estimates show an increase of about 130% against a
system capacity increase of 104%. Current estimates indicate a foreign
exchange cost over-run of nearly $30 million compared to the appraisal
report estimates. AID, OEOF and IDA are contributing $4 million, $3.7
million and $5 million respectively to help finance the foreign exchange
cost over-run. The Government will cover the balance required to com-
plete the project.
Despite the capital cost increases the project has become more
remunerative. Given the substantially lower capital cost compared to
estimates for similar projects presently under consideration, and the
presently expected long-range international prices for UTrea, the eccnomic
rate of return, calculated at 1h% at the time of appraisal, should now
be in excess of 30%.
Cr. No. 194 Agicultural Estates; US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project was for the rehabilitation of two Government-owned
estate groups in North Sumatra. The credit became effective eight months
after signature, the delay resulting from unforeseen difficulties in the
appointment of management advisors and visiting inspectors. Delays in
development occurred as oil palm planting material in Indonesia was
found to be genetically unsuitable, and an unforeseen sharp fall in
rubber prices seriously restricted the availability of self-generated
funds. However, during 1973 a record 3,200 ha of oil palm were
planted on PNP VI and the program will be virtually on target. The 1973
rubber program was reduced following the advice of the last Supervision
Mission as PiNP IV was over-extended; if the high standards of replantIng
now being achieved can be maintained, it should be possible to increase
the size of future programs again.



ANNEX II
5 of 10 pages
M1nagement has improved in the field and factory and reasonable
standards are being maintained. More emphasis is required on cost control
and management has agreed to take the necessary action. Solid progress is
being achieved and PNP VI's financial situation has been greatly helped by
the present higher producer prices. PNP IV has also made marked progress
during 1973 and is in a satisfactory financial position.
Cr. No. 195 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$18.5 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date:  November 30, 1974
The project includes rehabilitation and drainage works over
186,000 ha. After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of
tender documents and difficulties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is
now proceeding somewhat better. Problems of quality and progress still
exist, but, the consultants are tackling these vigorously, and this
situation is improving. Estimated costs remain within the overall
appraisal estimate, but the project will be one year behind appraisal
schedule.
Cr. No. 210 Telecommunications; US$12.8 Million Credit of
July 13, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
After a slow start, due to procurement difficulties, orders for
all equipment except the tropospheric scatter system have now been placed.
The management consultants have completed their work but have been retained
to implement the recommendations being discussed between the Government
and the Association to work out appropriate measures. The Government is
requesting reallocation of the proceeds of the credit and postponement
of the closing date to complete disbursements.
Cr. No. 211 Fisheries; US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 197Q;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
After a slow start this project is now progressing satisfactorily.
Project management satisfactory to the Association has now been appointed;
contracts with engineering and management consultants have been concluded
and the consultants have begun work and the contract for the shore facilities
has been awarded.
Cr. No. 216 Technical Assistance II; US$4.0 Million Credit of
September 15, 1970; Closing Date:  December 31, 1974
This project is progressing satisfactorily, but it has been
necessary to postpone the closing date by one year to complete disburse-
ments for on-going studies.

Cr. No. 219  Education; US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1976
The project is about 12 months behind schedule due to delay in
the appointment of the architect but is now progressing satisfactorily.
Four out of five contracts for civil works have been approved by the
Government and the Association, as also have equipment lists. The leader
of the team of overseas specialists has arrived and is assisting the train-
ing of the first group of technical teachers for the centers. While dis-
bursements were initially slower than expected, it is likely that construc-
tion of the five centers will be completed in less time than originally
estimated and the final implementation would thus be on schedule.
Cr. No. 220  Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$14.5 Million Credit of
November 6, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and
re-introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two
in Java and one in South Sulawesi. Construction remains about two years
behind schedule. The problems with preparation of contract documents,
which have caused this delay, have been overcome and, while no further
delays are expected, it is unlikely that the time lost could be regained.
There has been some increase in overall project costs, and a review is
being carried out to determine the effect of the dollar devaluation on
civil works and equipment contracts yet to be awarded. Disbursements are
improving to about 52% of the level estimated at appraisal. Sensitivity
tests run at the time of appraisal showed that a two year delay and 15%
cost overrun would reduce the economic rate of return from 25% to 21%.
Cr. No. 246  Seeds; US$7.5 Million Credit of My 14, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
Project implementation is behind schedule due to initial delays
in organization, management and effective procurement. These problems are
being overcome but, because of procurement delays, inflation, currency re-
valuation and design changes in the seed processing plant, a 20% cost in-
crease for the original project proposal became likely. However, recent
studies indicate that the market size for rice seed may be only about half
the original production target. Therefore,the latest Supervision Mission
has recommended reduction of the seed production target from 22,000 tons
to 12,000 tons per annU in 1977, by which time the need for further
development of the seed industry would have been reviewed. The possibility
of such a reduction in project output was foreseen at the time of appraisal
and provided for in the Credit- Agreement.  Therefore, two subsidiary seed
processing centers will not be constructed and the funds now remaining in
the credit will be adequate to complete the project. The expected economic
benefits of the project remain substantial with a rate of return of 59%,
not including the research and seed certification components whose benefits
are not easily quantifiable.

Government-owned tea estates in West Java. Despite management weaknesses
in cost control and efficiency, progress to date is satisfactory and re-
lationships betveen management and consultants are good. Recently revised
cost estimates for factory rehabilitation and expansion are substantially
above appraisal estimates and project consultants have been asked to review
them.

going studies.
Cr..No. 288 Second Education; US$12.5 Million Credit of
March 9, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Project implementation has been slow due to delays in concluding
a contract with conaultant architects and in recruiting technical assistance.
However, the architectural contract has now been signed and the project unit
has decided to recruit technical assistance through a FAO Fund-in-Trust
arrangement. Project implementation is now progressing satisfactorily.

March 9, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project is located in East Java and consists of rehabilita-
tion of the irrigation system and the re-establishment of 0 & M in five
non-contiguous areas totalling 229,000 ha, known as Pekalen-Sampean. It
also provides for the enployment of consuLtants to assist in the execution
of Pekalen-Sampean and for feasibility st'idies of further irrigation re-
habilitation projects. Civil works and equipment purchase for the main
project, PNkalen-Sampean, are just beginning and are on schedule.
Consmltants for the various studies are at work with their counterparts.

has been monitoring the project closely and Government is considering
actions to overcome present problems and accelerate project implementation.
Cr. No. 387 Education III; US$13.5 Million Credit of
June 1,1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This credit was declared effective on August 30, 1973. Manu-
script preparation, testing and book production is well advanced. The
development of programs for book distribution and teacher training depend
largely on the timely recruitment of technical assistance. The Government
approached UNESCO for this technical assistance under a contract reimburs-
able under the terms of the credit and an agreement will be signed to this
effect between the Government and UNESCO.

Cr. No. 405 Sugar Project; US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Closing Date: Jnee 30, 1979
The effectiveness of this credit was delayed because it took
longer than expected for the Government to implement legal and institu-
tion changes to amalgamate existing PNPs into larger PT estate groups
and to establish a joint sugar projects unit to provide overall coordina-
tion. These changes have now been implemented and the credit was de-
clared effective in April 1974. However, the Government engaged the
necessary consultants' services prior to credit effectiveness and work
is proceeding on schedule.

Page 2 of 3 pages
Project Costs:     Total project costs are estimated at US$68 million
of which US$22 million would be in foreign exchange
(32% of the project cost). Due to steep inflation, price
contingencies amounting to US$23.7 million have been
allowed.
Financing Plan:    The proposed IDA Credit of US$30 million would finance
the full foreign exchange costs and some of the
estimated local costs of the project. Government would
provide 56% of the total costs from its own budgetary
resources to Jatiluhur Authority, and to PROSIDA for
pilot on-farm development works on the first, third
and fourth irrigation rehabilitation projects (Credits 127,
220 and 289-IND).

Procurement:       (a)  Vehicles and equipment (US$400,000) would be
procured after international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA guidelines. Qualified domestic
manufacturers of these goods would be accorded a
15% domestic preference or the actual taIiff duty,
whichever is less, in the comparison of bids. Small
off-the-shelf items, costing less than US$5,000 each,
would be purchased through competitive procedures.
Such purchases would be limited to a total of
US$50,000.
(b) All civil works except for office buildings, stores,
houses and rural extension centers, would be subject
to international competitive bidding. They would
be grouped into about four contracts to attract
interest from international contractors, but to ensure
that works would be carried out by capable contractors,
all bidders would be required to pre-qualify. Foreign
firms that would be interested in making bids would be
encouraged to associate themselves with Indonesian
firms in order to uplift and promote capabilities of
local contractors. In bid comparisons for civil works,
local contractors would be given a domestic preference
of 7-1/2% of the contract value.
