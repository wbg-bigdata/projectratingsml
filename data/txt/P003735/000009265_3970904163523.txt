JATILUHUR IRRIGATION EXTENSION PROJECT (CR. 514-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the project completion report (PCR) for the Jatiluhur
Irrigation Extension (Irrigation V) Project, for which Credit 514-IND was
approved on June 20, 1974 for US$30.0 million. The Credit was closed on
December 31, 1982 and fully disbursed on March 31, 1983.
This report was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional
Office following a mission to Indonesia in September 1983, and reflects
information made available by the project agencies, namely the Directorate-
General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD), which monitored the project,
and the Jatiluhur Authority, the agency responsible for implementation of the
project. A most useful document was the government's PCR for the project
prepared by the Directorate of Planning and Programming (DPP), DGWRD, in
August 1983. Other sources of information included the Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 307-IND) dated May 31, 1974, the Credit and Project Agreements dated
October 3, 1974, and subsequent amendments to the Credit Agreement. Super-
vision reports, correspondence with the Borrower, and internal IDA memoranda
as contained in relevant IDA files have also been consulted. The PCR was sub-
stantially completed and submitted to the Operations Evaluation Department
COED) in February 1984.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for Comments on
May 2, 1984 and the Borrower's comments appear at the end of the PCR (p. 47).
The valuable assistance provided in preparing this report by the
Government of Indonesia (GOI) and the Bank Resident Staff in Indonesia (RSI)
is gratefully acknowledged. Special mention must be made of the Director-
General of DGWRD, Directors of the Jatiluhur Authority, and their staff,
particularly the DPP team which prepared the government's PCR.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

JATILIHUR IRRIGATION EXTENSION PROJECT (CR. 514-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
The project, approved by the Board in June 1974, is located in the
fertile Jakarta plain, one of the most important rice producing areas of
Java. It was designed to provide flood control, irrigation and drainage
facilities, swamp reclanation, feeder roads, and improved agricultural
supporting services to farmers for increasing yields and double cropping of
food crops, mainly rice, in an area of about 51,000 ha. At appraisal, it was
envisaged that some 300,000 people, including indirect beneficiaries would
benefit from the project.
These project objectives were achieved and the appraisal targets
will be met. Implementation by the Jatiluhur Authority was satisfactory,
though considerable cost and time overruns occurred (because of cost escala-
tion, delays in land acquisition, time consuming procurement procedures,
changing project specifications, and additional works required). The project
completion period had to be extended by five years and the closing date by two
years. The project cost at completion was US$157.7 million with an overrun of
132%, of which about 70% was due to price increases, and 30% due to the
increase in work quantities resulting from lack of accurate topographical maps
and of detailed engineering designs at appraisal. Disbursements were very
slow in the first five years, but by March 1983, the Credit had been fully
disbursed. On the whole, the project was a successful undertaking and the IDA
was supportive and helpful. The recalculated economic rate of return is 28%
compared with the appraisal figure of 42%. When fully developed in 1990 and
onwards, the project will produce each year about 252,000 tons of incremental
paddy and provide about 27,000 additional jobs, in line with appraisal
expectations.
The major lessons learned, most of which have been taken into
account in the preparation and implementation of later projects, were as
follows:
(a) To avoid cost overruns, detailed design covering at least the first
year's construction should be completed before appraisal, (para.
2.04);
(b) To avoid construction delays, land acquisition should be planned in
N       greater depth, funded in the year prior to construction, and
completed before contracts are awarded (para. 2.13); in addition,
procurement and budgetary procedures should be improved, proper
-        price escalation formulae included in contracts and payments to
contractors accelerated (paras. 5.02 and 6.02);



- iv -
(c) Most of contractors did not perform well, and contract completion
took on average 30-50% longer than anticipated. To adddress this,
the local construction industry must be strengthened, prequalifica-
tion criteria improved, and major contracts should be awarded only
to contractors with adequate financial resources and equipment
(paras. 2.05 and 5.08);
(d) Operation and maintenance of the Jatiluhur irrigation system is
generally poor, and maintenance of the Main (West Tarum) Canal
extremely inadequate. This is mostly due to the lack of O&M
budgets, which are about one half only of the amount required.
Increased O&M funding must come from either GOI budgetary
allocations, or additional water charges from users, or both. The
Bank should consider more technical as well as financial assistance
for improving O&M activities (paras. 2.08 and 5.07);
(e) Water user associations (WIJAs) were established, but most did not
operate properly. Many farmers were unwilling to contribute funds
to WUA, and O&M of tertiary systems was inadequate. GOI has tried
to improve WUA effectiveness through guidance by community advisors,
and early participation of farmers in project works; however, the
problems have not been resolved. More studies of this problem
should be carried out, and regular training of key farmers should be
emphasized (paras. 3.08 and 5.05);
(f) IDA supervision activities were comprehensive in dealing with engi-
neering, less satisfactory with agricultural matters and were unsa-
tisfactory in socio-economic and institutional aspects. A project
benefit monitoring study was carried out but results were poor, and
the IDA did not properly supervise and guide it (para. 6.05). GOI
also pays inadequate attention to monitoring and evaluation, and
must increase its support; and
(g) The Jailuhur Authority has a large cumulative financial deficit.
The role of the Authority should be reviewed, especially since
similar multipurpose developments (such as Jatigede and Kedung Ombo
dams) are to be implemented (para. 5.03).



INDONESIA
JATILUHUR IRRIGATION EXTENSION PROJECT (CR. 514-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Since 1969, the Bank has supported Indonesia's irrigation
development program which is dedicated to achieving self-sufficiency of food
grain, and increasing rural employment and farmer incomes. At the end of
1983, a total of 18 credits/loans for irrigation development had been made.
The first four credits (127-IND, 195-IND, 220-IND, and 289-IND) were for
rehabilitating existing irrigation systems serving about 820,000 ha, mainly in
Java. These projects have been sati7factorily completed and project
completion reports (PCRs) prepared.-   The Fifth Irrigation Project (Cr. 514-
IND) for extension of the Jatiluhur irrigation system (the Project) was a
follow-up of the Second Irrigation Project (Cr. 195-IND) which rehabilitated
major facilities of the Jatiluhur irrigation system, including the West Tarum
Canal. Taking advantage of the existing storage of the Jatiluhur Dam, and the
newly rehabilitated West Tarum Canal, the Project was expected to serve an
area of about 51,000 ha in the Jatiluhur system. The Project which was in
line with GOI's Second Five-Year Development Plan (1974-78) was appraised in
April-May 1973 and approved by the IDA Board on June 20, 1974.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Project Preparation
2.01      Feasibility studies were completed by consultants in March 1973,
financed under Credit 195-IND. At appraisal, the Association found that the
preliminary engineering designs were based on inadequate and inaccurate
topographical maps, and recommended that the preparation of tender documents
should be delayed until maps at a scale of 1:5,000 with 0.5 m contour inter-
vals were available. These maps were completed in May 1974. During prepara-
tion and appraisal, other concerns addressed included:
(a)  improving organization and management of the Jatiluhur Authority 2/
the implementing agency;
1/   PCRs were prepared in June 1977 for Cr. 127-IND, in November 1979 for
Cr. 195-IND and Cr. 220-IND, and in October 1980 for Cr. 289-IND.
2/   A semi-autonomous public agency mainly for the multipurpose development
of the Jatiluhur region. The Authority's Irrigation Department has a
close relationship with DGWRD. See also para. 5.01.

(b) constructing tertiary works by contractors fully financed under the
project. Formerly, GOI required farmers to contribute labor through
a self help system (Gotong Royong);
(c) initiating a pilot on-farm development pilot scheme to determine an
appropriate level of water control and farmer participation;
(d)  formulating a comprehensive agricultural development program for the
Jatiluhur service area; and
(o)  collecting water charges to recover the full cost of operation and
maintenance (O&M) and a reasonable portion of capital costs of the
project.
2.02      The project consisted ofiV
Part A - Civil Works; including: (a) rehabilitation of about 115 km of
the existing flood embankments on both bank of the Citarum River; (b)
construction of a major flood diversion channel, about 26 km,, and related
control structures to evacuate flood waters from the Cikarang and Bekasi
Rivers to the Java Sea; (c) construction of about 270 km of secondary
irrigation canals and about 300 km of secondary drainage canals; (d)
construction of about 500 km each of tertiary irrigation and drainage
networks; (e) reclamation of about 4,000 ha of uninhabited swamp land for
agricultural purposes; (f) construction of about 170 km of new feeder
roads between farms and large marketing centers and (g) construction of
office buildings, stores, staff housing and rural agricultural extension
centers.
Part B - Equipment and vehicles: Purchase and utilisation of equipment
and vehicles for the supervision of construction and agricultural
extension services;
Part C - Pilot on-farm development:  On about 4,000 ha of the areas
rehiiitated under the prior Development Credit Agreements (Irrigation
I, II, III and IV) and about 1,000 ha of the Exteusion Area, design and
construction of pilot on-farm development works consisting of tertiary
and quaternary irrigation and drainage canals with related control
structures; land levelling, where necessary; farm roads; and to the
extent possible, land consolidation; and
Part D - Agricultural extension service, training and studies: which
included: (a) upgrading and expansion of agricultural services; (b) over-
seas and local training of Jatiluhur Authority staff, agriculturalists,
extension officers and local training of selected farmers from the
Extension Area; (c) survey and evaluation of the present and projected
financial situation of small farmers, landholders and sharecroppers;
3/   Credit Agreement (Cr. 514-IND) Schedule 2.

(d) studies based on Part C of the Project to determine tht degree of
on-farm development and farmer participation to be adopted; (e) prepa-
ration of a long-term agricultural development program for farms in the
Jatiluhur Area; and (f) cadastral mapping of the swamp lands to be
reclaimed under the Project.
Project Implementation
2.03      Changes in Scope and Designs.  Consultants were appointed in
December L974, and the Credit became effective on January 10, 1975. Detailed
designs for an area of about 20,000 ha were completed by May 1976 and led to a
significant increase in the quantity of project works . Major changes
included:
(a) increased length of the flood diversion canal for the Cikarang and
Bekasi Rivers from 26 km to 30 km, and in secondary drains from
300 km to 349 km;
(b) the number of secondary canals increased from 25 to 51, and their
length from 270 km to 404 km;
(c) increased tertiary canal construction from 500 km to 720 km;
(d) feeder roads increased from 170 km to 188 km, and 167 km of
inspection roads were added; and
Ce) a new drain, southwest of Bekasi, about 3 km long was introduced.
2.04      Cost Overruns.  An analysis of cost overruns at project completion
is shown in Table 2.1 and detailed in Annex 1. The project had an initial
cost overrun of about 100l in 1976. The final cost overrun is about 132% in
US dollar equivalent. In terms of civil works the overrun was 521Z (in local
currency equivalent), about 70Z of which was due to rapid price escalation
imediately following appraisal and, 30Z due to increases in work volumes. A
major lesson is the risk in appraising without detailed designs. As shown in
Table 2.1 the total cost overrun from revision (with detailed designs) to
completion is only 17X compared to 132Z from appraisal (without detailed
design) to completion. The difference of 115% (or 87% of cost overrun) could
have been avoided if detailed designs were available during appraisal.

2.05      Causes of Delay. There was a 5-year delay in completing the
project, due to:  (a) a delay o4 about 7 months in consultant selection and
hence in Credit Effectiveness>- (b) delay of 14 months in completing deslgns
and tender documents; Cc) delay of 11 months in prequalifying contractors and
awarding contracts; and (d) a ccnstruction delay of 28 months (see Chart I).
These delays had a cumulative effect on project implementation. There were
also: (a) delays in the right-of-way acquisitiou; (b) problems in negotiating
budgets resulting in untimely payments to the contractors; (C) following the
November 1978 devaluarion and the considerable fuel price increase in April
1979, construction materials became scarce on the market for about six months,
and contract price adjustments resulting from the devaluation were slow.
Adjustments were made in February/March 1980 about 18 months later; (d) con-
tracts IV-A and IV-3 were not awarded until August 1979, too late for dry
season construction and consequently one year was lost; and (e) limited fiman-
c-ia capabillty of contractors for contracts II-A, Ill-A and III-B, with
frequent equipment breakdowns, and a lack of experience in swampy areas.
2.06      Contracts and Work Completion. Most contract works were completed
by September 1983 (Annex 1, Table 5 and Chart 1). Works were divided into
seven contracts. Dredging of flood diversion canals was included in contract
II-B, while rehabilitation of the Citarum River embankment was included in
Contract III-B. Works for tertiary canals and structures were separated from
these main contracts and constructed by small local contractors. Some works
have not yet been completed. The major works outstanding and their expected
completion dates are:
(a) about 30Z of contract IV-B will be completed by September 1984;
4/   A condition of Credit Effectiveness was that consultants acceptable to
IDA had been appointed, see SAR, para. 8.02.



-(b) about 54Z (or 27,000 ha) of tertiary designs and about 60Z (or
-30,200 ha)-of tertiary construction vill now be built to higher
standards, and will be completed by mid-1985 under Irrigation
Project XII;
(c) repair work at the confluence of the Bekasi River and TSB drain;
bank protection for the TSB drain and repair of the Citarum
embaznkent; and
_(d)  further rehabilitation of the West Tarum Canal which has
deteriorated and cannot carry sufficient water for the project at
full development (para. 2.08).
2.0F      Quality of Works.  Works are technically sound, hydraulically
adequate and are generally of acceptable quality. There were some
deficiencies, however- Compaction of canal embankments, though adequate on
the inspection road side, was deficient on the other side. Deep borrow pits,
which were made close to canal and river banks to avoid haulage over longer
distances, were located close to villages, endangering their property and
creating a health hazard; remedial action is being taken. The required repair
works at the confluence of the Bekasi River and the newly constructed TSB
drain as well as embankment failures on the Citarum River (para- 2.06(c))
resulted partly from budgetary constraints and partly from inadequate quality
of work.
2.08      Operation and Maintenance (O&M). 0&  budgets and expenditures were
progressively increased from Rp 3,550 per ha in 1976/77 to Rp 10,164 per ha in
1983/84 (Annex 1  Table 3).   However, in real terms the increase has been
practically nil, and the expenditures in constant 1983 prices, remained around
Rp 10,500 per hectare, which has been insufficient for O&M of the Jatiluhur
system. As a result, works such as the West TaLUm canal which was rehabili-
tated in the mid-1970s under the Second Irrigation Project (Cr. 195-IND), have
deteriorated. Carrying capacity of this canal has dropped from 85 cu m./sec in
1976 to about 56 cu m/sec in 1983. Based on a Bank-assisted study, about
Rp 20,000 (or about5yS$20) per ha is required for adequate O&M of main
irrigation system .- In addition, a special repair fund should be placed at
the disposal of Jatiluhur or DGWRD, to meet emergency works. DGWRD plans to
allocate more funds for O&M by slowing down the irrigation development progran
in Repelita IV (FY84-88) and to carry out O&M for major schemes on behalf of
the responsible provincial services.
2.09      Tertiary Development.  At appraisal, the Association was not
satisfied with the construction of tertiary canals and structures by farmers
on lands they donated. The practice caused construction delays, and poor
quality. As a result, tertiary and on-farm development under the project
followed the principles below:
5/  O&  of main systems are the responsibility of Provincial Governments,
while O&M of tertiay systems are the responsibility of farmers through
Water Users' Associations.



6
(a) The Jatiluhur Authority constructed tertiary works using small local
contractorg7 but quaternary work was Left for farmers to
construct;-
(b) Lands acquired for tertiary/quaternary works were contributed at no
cost by farmers; and
(c) GOI established general norms for tertiary development, including:
tertiary and quaternary blocks were about 150 ha and 10-15 ha,
respectively; establishment of water users' associations (WUA) was a
prerequisite for tertiary construction; and tertiary O&M funds were
collected by WUAs from farmers as required.
2.10      WUAs have been established 7in all tertiary blocks in the project
area, but their performance is poor,  GOI hopes to improve the WUA's
effectiveness through more training, supervision, early participation of
farmers, collection of charges, community advisors, etc. (see also paras.
5.04-5.05). Irrigation Project VII (Ln. 1268-IND), which covers some 100,000
ha of tertiary construction in a number of locations, will be completed in
early 1984. The PCR for that project is expected to discuss tertiary
development issues more thoroughly than this PCR.
2.11      Swamp Reclamation. All 4,000 ha of swamp lands were drained and
reclaimed by October 1983. About 2,200 ha of public land was alloted to
deserving farmers at about one ha per family; about 720 ha of privately owned
land was occupied by original owners; and the remainder (about 1,100 ha of
public land) will be alloted to local farmers by the end 1985 when tertiary
systems have been completed.
2.12      Procurement.  Major civil works contracts were procured through
ICB. In the early years of project implementation, tendering for civil works
commenced only after budget approval, which resulted in contracts being
awarded late in the dry season, thereby losing the first year of construction.
This was later improved by GOI (para. 6.02).
2.13      Land Acquisition.  About 3,850 ha of land was acquired for right-of-
way. Initially, government policy was to allocate funds for land acquisition
and construction in the same fiscal year, which left little time prior to
construction.  Lands were acquired by Agraria through Committees which
consisted of as many as 20 officials representing the Ministries of Public
Works and Agriculture; the Jatiluhur Authority; Agraria; and Local
Government. These officials had other regular duties, and their active
participation and ability to reach a consensus on the market value of lands
were both difficult and time consuming. Difficulties also arose in locating
6/  DGFCA feels that farmers should be more directly involved in tertiary
construction also.

absentee landowners; establishing land ownership rights in the case of small
farmers who had no titles; and Agraria was sometimes short of personnel and
equipment to conduct surveys.  From 1978/79, the Government provided funds for
land acquisition one year ahead of construction. This change was effective in
accelerating construction.
2.14      Disbursements. Three reallocations of the credit were required,
mainly due to price increases for equipment and consulting services and
changes in disbursement percentages for civil works (Annex 2, Table 2). The
estimated and actual disbursement schedules are shown in Annex 2, Table 1.
Disbursements were slow in the first five years, because of delayed project
implementation (para. 2.05).
III. AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND II4PACT
3.01      It is too early to assess agricultural development and impact at
this stage, since 60% of the tertiary systems will not be completed until mid-
1985, and about 4,000 ha of swamp lands are still in the early stages of
development (para. 2.11). Projected yields and crop areas with and without
the project are based on crop prgluction records issued by the Authority, and
the findings of the PCR mission,v  The net irrigable area has been reduced
from 51,000 ha as estimated at appraisal, to 48,500 ha, mainly due to the
additional land required for a higher density of irrigation and drainage
canals and roads.
Paddy Production
3.02      Paddy is, and will continue to be, the major crop.  Yields, areas,
and production estimated at appraisal and projected at completion are
summarized in Table 3.1. Paddy yields were generally underestimated at
appraisal. Yields averaged 1.6 t/ha in 1973, and were assumed to rise to
1.9 t/ha in years thereafter without the project, rising to 4.0 tlha at full
development with the project. However, average paddy yields (wet and dry
crops) were already 1.9 t/ha in 1976, 2.2 t/ha in 1978, the last year before
the project started to have an impact, and 4.0 t/ha in 1982, when the
project's impact could scarcely have been felt (see Annex 4, Table 4). These
higher yields were mainly attributable to (a) rapid adoption of high yielding
varieties (HYV), (b) better extension and credit services, and Cc) improvement
of paddy cultivation. Farmers in the Jatiluhur service areas have already
produced about 5.0 t/ha/crop of paddy with assured water control and proper
input supplies. It is reasonable to expect paddy yields after 1990 to reach
5.0 and 2.9 t/hafcrop in the project area with and without the project
respectively.
8/   DGFCA has, however, provided slightly different crop areas and yields for
the Bekasi District (Kabupaten) in 1982. This may be mainly because of
the differences between the areas of the District and the Project, and
this would not affect significantly the economic evaluation (see Annex 4,
Table 4 and 5).

3.03      As shown in Table 3.1, th: estimated paddy area without the project
(after 1990), was 8,675 ha lower at appraisal than now estimated. The dry
season crop area was 11,600 ha in 1973 and at appraisal was expected to be
unchanged in future years without the project. Actual figures, however, were
11,600 ha in 1973, 39,412 ha in 1976, 32,547 ha in 1977 and 26,630 ha in 1978
(Annex 4, Table 6).-   On the other hand, the paddy area with the project will
be about 1,400 ha less at project comple fign than at appraisal because more
land has been acquired for right-of-way.-   The total increase in paddy area
after 1990 is estimated at 22,450 ha or about two thirds of the appraisal
estimate of 32,500 ha.
9/   Factors include better weather; farmers' willingness to take higher risks
and the installation by farmers of additional irrigaticn facilities, such
as pumps and small diversions.
10/ DGFCA considers that mistakes in detailed mapping may be another factor
in reducing the paddy area.



-9-
3.04      Secondary crops (palawija) such as corn, soybean, and vegetables are
grown during the dry season. Their areas fluctuated, but between 1974 and
1982, remained around 3,000 ha. At full development, the total palawija area
of 8,500 ha as projected at appraisal is still expected to be reached (Annex 4,
Table 5). Overall cropping intensities, which were estimated at appraisal at
118% without the project and 195Z with the project, are now expected to be
134% and 203%, respectively (Table 3.1).
3.05      At appraisal, paddy yields were underestimated, and crop areas over-
estimated, but these factors balance out and there will be no significant
difference between the appraisal and PCR estimates of total incremental paddy
production at full development (about 252,000 tons per year). Overall, the
appraisal targets for agricultural production will be met.
Agricultural Supporting Services
3.06      As agreed (para. 5.03, SAR) an Agricultural Development Subdirecto-
rate was created in April 1976, under the Directorate of Irrigation, to expand
the role of the Authority in agricultural development, extension, research and
water lynagement in cooperation with provincial and central Government agen-
cies.-   The Authority has prepared a long-term agricultural development
program Cpara. 8.01-d, SAR), and there has been a substantial increase in
agricultural support services in the project area. From 1974 to 1983, exten-
sion staff increased from 47 to 122; rural extension centers from 4 to 8;
rural ceoperatives (BUUDIKJUD and Kiosk) from 72 to 130; and rice milJa,hullers
from 557 to 662 (see Annex 4, Table 10). From 1980-82, BIMAS/INMAS UZ
coverage was about 84% of both wet and dry paddy crops, and the supporting
services provided to farmers were satisfactory.
Pilot On-farm DevelopmentL3/
3.07      Nine pilot tertiary demonstration plots (PTDP) of about 150-200 ha
each were established and their activities monitored (para. 2.02, Part C).
The PTDPs were successful in persuading farmers to raise HYV seedlings in
community nurseries and transplant seedlings of the same age at the same time
through community activities. This helped facilitate better water management
and reduced damage from insects, rats, and disease; the average yield of tt
nine PTDPs was 5.3 and 5.9 t/ha/crop in 1978/79 and 1979/80 respectively-
11/ DGDFCA comments that the Authority's Agricultural Development Subdirecto-
rate supports, but does not substitute, the function and role of
agricultural services of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in the area.

3.08      A total of 40 staff from the Authority's Directorates of Irrigation
and Administration received overseas training in extension, water management,
tertiary development and administrative fields (Annex 3, Table 3).  In
addition, the Authority also carried out a local training program for water
users aimed at achieving a common understanding of construction and OEM of
tertiary systems among local government officials a !,key farmers.  Unfor-
tunately, two of the target audiences, key farmers - and gate keepers (see
Table 3.2), were not trained because the program was discontinued in mid-1982
because of financial constraints. The generally poor performances of WUAs in
the project area, may be partly attributable to this (para. 5.05).

IV. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION AND BENEFITS
4.01      The project was justified by an expected four-fold increase in rice
production, leading to substantially increased small farmer incomes, foreign
exchange savings, and a high economic rate of return. Despite significant
cost and time overruns, these appraisal targets will be largely met. Table
5/  DGFCA highlights the needs for closer cooperation between their agricul-
tural services and the Jatilihur Authority in carrying out on-farm
development and training activities.
16/ Training of key farmers was expected at appraisal through existing and
newly established Rural Extension Centers (SAR, para. 5.11).

Basic Assumptions for Economic Re-evaluation
4.02      Both costs (Annex 1, Table 3) and benefits (Annex 4, Table 7) are
expressed in constant 1983 prices. Domestic and international price indices
(Annex 4, Table 1) were used to adjust prices over time. Projections of
future tradeable commodity prices have been based on the Bank's Commodity
Division projections adjusted for transportation, processing, and handling
costs (Annex 4, Table 3). The shadow wage rate is assumed to be 50% of the
market wage in the peak season (58% at appraisal). Costs for incremental



- 12 -
extension services and for tertiary works still to be completed have been
included. The project is evaluated over a period of 30 years (as at apprai-
sal).  No salvage value of the civil wor y  is considered, although a 33%
salvage value was included at appraisal-   The economic cost of land
acquisition for right-of-way is valued at the production foregone. The cost
of rehabilitating the West Tarum canal has been included, though this was not
expected to be needed at appraisal.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
4.03      The estimated ERR is about 28% (compared with 42% at appraisal).
The decrease is due mainly to cost and time overrunr, and the decline in the
projected rice prices. The project as re-evaluated is still highly viable,
and it would take a 60% decrease in the projected future agricultural produc-
tion to reduce the ERR to 10%, the opportunity cost of capital in the country.
The ERR of 28% infkydes relevant benefits and costs from enlargement of the
West Tarum canal.-   Excluding the canal costs and benefits and assuming that
its current capacity is maintained in the future, would indicate an ERR of
about 26%.
Foreign Exchange Savings
4.04      The re-estimated foreign exchange savings of the project are about
$63 million per annum at 1983 prices, as estimated at appraisal. These
savings are net of incremental costs of farm inputs (Annex 4, Table 8).
Employment Effects
4.05      Incremental employment from farming activities will be about 7.4
million man-days per year as compared with 12 million man-days estimated at
appraisal. This is mainly due to overestimation at appraisal of incremental
paddy areas by about 10,000 ha (Table 3.1). During the total construction
period (1976/77-1984/85), the project has provided about 15 million man-days
of employment (or about 57,000 jobs) of unskilled labor for civil works (Annex
4, Table 9). This incremental employment had a significant impact in easing
unemployment in rural Java, and urban migration to Jakarta, on the western
boundary of the project.
Impact of Project Roads
4.06      The project area suffered from a limited road network with many
villages surrounded by water and isolated from marketing centers during the
17/  The inclusion of a salvage value for civil works after 3, years has an
insignificant effect on the ERR.
18/ Enlargement of the West Tarum canal will have a substantial effect on
paddy production after 1988/89. This effect has only a minor influence
on the ERR of the project which started to generate benefits in 1978/79
(See Annex 4, Table 7).

rainy season. This has greatly improved with the construction of 188 km of
feeder roads and 167 km of inspection roads under the project. Quantified
data on road benefits are not available, but farmers' appreciation is
apparent. Questions may be raised, however, as to whether the project roads
were overbuilt. Although road construction was increased from the 170 km
foreseen at appraisal, the density constructed is about the same as the
average densities in the remainder of the Jatiluhur Region. Road densities in
the project area are 0.56 km per sq km and 0.63 km per 1,000 people as
compared with 0.49 and 0.71 respectively in the entire Jatiluhur Region
(Annex 3, Table 1).
Benefit Distribution
4.07      It was expected that more than 50% of the project benefits (mostly
from paddy production) at full development would accrue to small owner-
operators, about 25% to poor sharecroppers and the remaining 25% to landlords
who do not farm. Reliable data are lacking to assess whether this is likely
to be lghieved. A benefit monitoring study was carried out from 1979 to
1981, .  but results are less than satisfactory. The Bank Group's guidance and
supervision of this study was unsatisfactory.  However, sample surveys by20
Pajajaran State University (PSU) and Bogor Agricultural University (BAU)
give a reasonable understanding of the project benefit distribution.
4.08      A model village comprising 1,000 ha of land and 1,560 families - /
has been constructed by the PCR mission. The likely share of benefits within
the village families is indicated in Table 4.2. It can be seen that the pro-
ject will make all family groups in the village better off, and no one will be
worse off.  About 50% of project benefits will accrue to owner-operators who
are mainly farmers with an average farm size of 1.3 ha  About 17% of benefits
will go to sharecroppers and 12% to the landless laborers who are the most
needy groups in the project area as well as in the entire country. About 11%
will go to absentee landowners, 5% to traders and the remaining 5% to govern-
ment through land tax (IPEDA), water fees and village contributions. In terms
of benefit sharing per family, the owner operators have the highest ratio of
1.4, followed by sharecroppers (0.6), laborers (0.5), and traders (0.4). Such
a benefit sharing pattern mnay cause the income gap to widen between owner-ope-
rators and sharecroppers/laborers. The former will benefit from the project
almost three times more than the latter. The PSU study of 30 sample villages
in 1979 also arrived at the same conclusion, that family incomes of the irri-
gation-affected villages were much higher than those of the non-irrigation-

4.09      The distribution of irrigation benefits is highly related to land
ownership patterns. To correct income distribution through government poli-
cies such as taxation, subsidies and even land reform is, to some extent,
possible, but it involves many complicated issues and administrative costs.
The existing land distribution pattern in the project area and the likely
benefit distribution are considered satisfactory. In addition, the Javanese
practice of rice harvesting, which allows landless families to help and to
share about one sixth of the total production, achieves the wider distribution
of irrigation benefits.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Jatiluhur Authority
5.01      The Jatiluhur Authority (Perusahaan Umum Otorita Jatiluhur), a semi-
autonomous public agency, was established by the Government in 1970. The
Authority's main purpose was to manage the multipurpose development and
operation of the Jatiluhur Region, including the Jatiluhur multipurpose dam
and hydroelectric generating system; water supply to Jakarta City; and
irrigation systems serving about 305,000 ha in the North and South Jatiluhur
areas. The Authority's income comes only from power sales to PLN, the public
power corporation, and in recent years, operating revenues were about one
third of expenses, resulting in a loss of about Rp 4.5 billion in 1980 and
about Rp 5.8 biW .on in 1981. The outstanding deficit on March 31, 1981 was
Rp 23.4 billion--  (Annex 3, Table 4).
5.02      The performance of the Authority's Irrigation Directorate can be
judged as fairly satisfactory. The considerable time and cost overruns occur-
red mainly because of price escalation, land acquisition, procurement proce-
dures, budget and payment systems, changing project specifications, increasing
work quantities and the weak local construction industry. All of these areas
have been improved in recent years, and the Bank Group is assisting GOI in
further improvements (para. 6.02).
22/ See Report on Examination of Financial Statements, year ended March 31,
1981, for the Jatiluhur Authority; by Drs. J.S. Suworo.



- 16 -
5.03      At present, the Authority functions more as a Government. department
than a semi-autonomous public agency. The Authority has not been able to
generate sufficient funds, and has a large deficit each year. In addition,
the Authority has played little role 2iy a series of recent power development
projects above the Jatiluhur scheme 2    The function of the Authority is
weakening, and G0I should review the Authority's future role in the context of
government policy for similar multi-purpose dams (including Kedung Ombo and
Jatigede which are under consideration).
Water Users' Associations (WUA)
5.04      The Project was the first of a series of Bank-assisted projects to
support tertiary development by the Government and the formatioa of Water
Users' Associations (WUA) to operate and maintain the tertiary systems. WUAs
were established for all tertiary systems in the project area. However,
according to IDA supervision records and field observations, very few of them
are operating properly. Farmers maintain their on-farm canals only once or
twice a year, usually before irrigation, and appear unwilling to contribute
funds to WUAs, since they contribute about 200 kg of paddy per hectare to the
local government for overall village development. A dialogue between the
Authority, local government and farmers is attempting to find a solution. A
key issue is whether the farmers can be taxed further or whether the local
government can reallocate funds for 0&M of tertiaries.
5.05      Motivating farmers to better operate and maintain tertiary systems
has been an uphill task. The problems in the project area are compounded by
fragmentation of land holdings, which necessitates the cooperation of about
200-300 farmers for each tertiary block. A significant part of these farmers
are sharecroppers who have no fixed tenures and are uninterested in any
permanent improvement. Effective coordination is required among several
government agencies including village and district administrations, and the
Ministries of Home Affairs, Public Works, and Agriculture. A reluctance of
absentee landowners to contribute in cash, kind or labor also adds to this
problem.  As mentioned in para. 2.10, WUA will be one of the tertiary4.ssues
to be addressed in detail in the forthcoming PCR for Irrigation VII-'
IPEDA, Cost Recovery and 0&M Requirement
5.06      It was expected at appraisal that IPEDA (a productivity linked land
tax) would collect 5Z of the net value of production (NVP) and ,ould increase
from some Rp 2,000/ha in 1973 to Rp 15,000/ha in 1985. This 7.5-fold increase
of IPEDA at constant 1973 prices would be sufficient to recover 100% of O&H
needs of Rp 3200/ha, and a reasonable portion of capital costs of the
project. In practice the following has occurred:
23/ The Saguling and Cirata schemes implemented by PLN under Bank assistance
(Ln. 1950-IND and Ln. 2033-IND).
24/ DGFCA suggests that the tertiary issues should be deeply evaluated, and
that a farmer participation approach should be emphasized.



- 17 -
(a)  a small portion-  of IPEDA funds has been allocated for O&N of the
project;
(b)  O&M expenditures for main irrigation sytems have ofen met almost
entirely through GOI budgets which provided only about half of O&M
requirements (para. 2.05);
(c)  the current IPEDA rate A   the project area is about Rp 12,000/ha (or
80 kg paddy per year)' This is low compared to a norm of 5% of
net farm production which would amount to about Rp 40,000 or 260 kg
of paddy per year (Annex 4, Table 13);
(d) farmers pay about 200 kg (or Rp 30,000) per ha per year for a
village tax; and
(e) most farmers are unwilling to pay additional water charges to WUA
for O&M of tertiary works (para. 5.04).
5.07      A continuation of this trend will result in the gradual deteriora-
tion of project works, followed by a continuous reduction in crops, and an
early rehabilitation will be required which will be more costly and time
consuming than regular O&M. With Bank assistance (Ln. 1645-IND), the
University of Gadjah Mada (UGM) in May 1982 studied O&M requirements and the
farmers' capacity to pay. The study recommended that an O&M charge be imposed
through IPEDA to establish an independent funding for O&M of irrigation
systems. GOI has reviewed this recommendation, yet no progress has been
made.  Further discussion of this matte57etween the Bank and GOI will be
required, and as suggested by the USGAODLLZ the Bank is considering financing
the recurrent costs of irrigation projects because of the importance of proper
3&M, and slowing down new construction if necessary.
Consultants and Contractors
5.08      The role of consultants in project implementation has been
satisfactory. A delay of about 14 months in completing the designs and tender
documents was due to additional design work involved in the increased length
of secondary canals, drains and roads, with the associated structures. For
the seven main civil works contracts, four firms were engaged. All the firms
separately or jointly were prequalified for large civil works contracts.
Except for one contractor who completed the work within a reasonable period,
the other contractors did not perform well, and extensions in contract
completion ranged between 30-50% (see Chart 1).

VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND IDA
Performance of the Borrower
6.01      The Borrower was support:ve of the project and complied with most of
the --2dit covenants.
6.02-     Project Implementation.  During project implementation GOI made a
number 2f improvements to funding procedures after discussions with the Bank
Group,-   These included:  (a) giving final approval of the Project
Implementation Document (DIP) not later than April 1 of each fiscal year; (b)
allowing project implementing agencies to process tender documents before the
DIP was approved, Cc) allowing project implementing agencies more flexibility
in making cost adjustments within DIP allocations and providing for contin-
gencies; (d) providing funds for Land acquisition one year ahead of physical
onstruction; and (e) introducing modified procedures for payments to contrac-
tors. These changes had a significant impact on speeding up construction.
Changes such as (d) and (e), however, occurred too late to benefit this
project, though later projects stand to benefit.
6.03      Compliance with Covenants.  GOI has satisfactorily complied with the
Credit Covenants, except those listed in Annex 5 and summarized below:
(a) Employment of contractors was delayed by about 11 months (Section
3.03);
(b) Acquisition of land was delayed and was not in step with the
construction program (Section 3.09);
(c) Separate records and appropriate accounts were not fully
maintained. There were also delays in furnishing audit certificates
to the Bank (Section 4.01); and
Cd) Cost recovery and 0M funds for the project are generally inadequate
(Section 4.04).
Performance of IDA
6.04     Project Appraisal.  In general, IDA appraisal of the project was
thorough and comprehensive. Subjects such as on-farm development, drainage,
roads, agricultural production and supporting service, O&M, consulting
service, project organization, and cost recovery were treated in detail.
However, project work quantities, hence costs, were considerably under-
estimated during appraisal, which was based on newly-completed feasibility
studies with prelim'nary designs (para. 2.01). Other problem areas not
properly identified at appraisal were administrative difficulties and time-
consuming budgetary and procurement procedures. At appraisal, detailed
28/ See A Joint PCR for Credits 195-IND and 220-IND, Nov. 1979, pp 26-27.



- 19 -
designs were expected to start by July 1974, yet the Credit Agreement was not
signed until October 1974 and consultants were not engaged until December
1974.  Altogether the project had a five-year delay (para. 2.05).
6.05      Project Supervision.  IDA supervision of the project was the
responsibility of Washington-based staff until mid-1978, when this function
was transferred to the Resident Staff in Indonesia (RSI) in Jakarta.  In all
13 supervisions, IDA staff highlighted shortcomings, and suggested improve-
ments through "Action Letters" to the implementing agencies and other GOI
agencies. Overall, the supervisions were comprehensive in dealing with
engineering matters, less so with agricultural activities and were unsatis-
factory in socIo-economic and institutional aspects.  iljdequate supervision
and guidance was given to the Benefit Monitoring Study      (1979-81) (para.
4.07), and other institutional problems, including WUAs and cost recovery,
were not addressed properly. Overall, mutual understanding and cooperation
between IDA and project agencies (Jatiluhur Authority and DGWRD) were
excellent throughout, and particularly the function of RSI since 1978 in
facilitating closer contact, frequent consultation, faster approval, and
regular supervision is greatly appreciated by GOI.
29/ DGFCA recommends that a benefit monitoring study should try to separate
benefits from various development activities including irrigation, input
supply and agricultural supporting services.

Dear. Mr. 5apur.
Re. Comments on project compleltion
Report on Indonesia Fifth Irrigation
Project CLoan 514 - Ind)
the Directrate General of Food Crops Agriculture has received your PCR
on May 27, 1984. After we have evaluated thoroughly, I concluded that
(1) 7he PCR has shown a good data, a reasonable information and satis -
faction evaluation.
(2) EHowever, there are several remzarks and couents concerning the PMR,
particularly refer to tertiary developme-nt and agricultural develop
mkent and impact - Attached complete coamments I send to you.
I deeply appreciate for your PCR whi.ch has been given to zn, to evaluate for
related project in the contex of agricultural development in Repelita IV.

Comments on PCR fProm DOFlA.
1. There are several-difference5in the computation of food crops yield and
-harvested crop area issued by authority and issued together-by ministry of
agriculture-and Central Bureau. of Statistics (= CnS), i.e. th 1982  for
project area labupaten Bekasi
(top/ha)
PCR         MOA & CBS
Paddy  Aea.harvested (ha) w.s & d.s. 41,711 & 28,021  27,334%40,193
Ar; Yield (ton/ha) w.s & d.S..   4  &  3.9       4.03-4.02
Naize  Area harvested (ha)             1,098.0-        162.0
Ar. Yield (ton/ha)                1.2            1.4
Soya beans Harvested area (ha)           185.0           33.0
Av.Yield (t/ha)               10.0             9.6
Groundnuts Harvested iArea (ha)         287.0          431.0
,s. Yield ( t/ha )             1.1             0.9
Sucet Dotato  Harvested Area (ha)        345.0          559.0
Av. Yield (ton/ha)           6.9           7.5
These differences will affect the computation of economic cost and benefits.
Because the CBS is the only representative auihority to do the-job.
2. In the implementation of tertiary development in some cases there are some
problems of quality performance of construction, and in general there is a
problem in poor 0 & Y of the tertiary system done by WUA. These related
problems should be deeply evaluated. However, the application of farmers
participatory approach should be used as a basic strategy in the tertiary
development.
Instead of a slow performance done by them in the construction of tertiary
develoDment, the government theni takeSover their jolbs and their responsi -
bilities. They have to involve directly and indirectly in the tertiary
development.
The issue ir also valid for the functioning of WIJA in each  tertiary
system.
3. The increase of paddy area with the project (3.03) was less than expected}
not only because of increasing right-of-way, but also because mistaken in
detailed mapping.



- 50 -
4.-The establishment of agricultural development sub directorate in Jatiluhur
Authority in 1976, should not substitute the function and the role of agri-
gricultural service in ministry of agriculture in the Jatiluhur Area, but
it should strengthen the agriculture service. (3.06). This idea has been
applied for the integration of irrigation service ( wilayah and seksi pe -
ngairan in Jatilu2ur Authority !.
5. In order to ha.ve a smooth and a good result in the implementation of trai-
ning program and pilot on-farm development the integrated Program actiaO:-
and imlementation between seksi pengairan, food crops agriculture service
and Jatiluhur Authority should be used as a basic strategy to handle it
( 3.07 & 3.08 )
6. Is it reasonable to define a small farmer as a farmer who has an average
farm size of 1.3 ha ? ( 4.08 ).
7. It is much advisable if the project benefit monitoring evaluation should
include the computation of separablc benefits due to irrigation project,
Birmas project, a.:'ricultural development project, etc.
