                                Procurement
1.        Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of $5,000,000 or more each shall be awarded through international
competitive bidding in accordance with procedures consistent with those set
forth in Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines),
subject to the following modifications:
    (a)   Paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines is deleted and the following is
substituted therefor:
    "2.8 Notification and Advertising
          The international community should be notified in a timely manner
    of the opportunity to bid. This will be done by advertising invitations
    to apply for inclusion in a bidder's invitation list, to apply for
    prequalification, or to bid; such advertisements should be placed in at
    least one newspaper of general circulation in the Borrower's country
    and, in addition, in at least one of the following forms:
Page  9
          (i)   a notice in the United Nations publication, Development
                Forum, Business Edition; or
         (ii)   an advertisement in a newspaper, periodical or technical
                journal of wide international circulation; or
        (iii)   a notice to local representatives of countries and
                territories referred to in the Guidelines, that are
                potential suppliers of the goods required."
    (b)   The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21 of the
Guidelines:
          "As a further alternative, bidding documents may require the
    bidder to state the bid price in a single currency widely used in
    international trade and specified in the bidding documents."
    (c)   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are deleted.
    (d)   For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid referred to in
paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide that, when contract award is
delayed beyond the original bid validity period, the successful bidder's bid
price will be increased for each week of delay by two predisclosed
correction factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign
currency components and the other to the local currency component of the bid
price. Such an increase shall not be taken into account in the bid
evaluation.
    (e)   In the procurement of goods in accordance with this paragraph 1,
the Borrower shall use the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the
Bank, with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be
necessary for the purposes of the Project. Where no relevant standard
bidding documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use
bidding documents based on other internationally recognized standard forms
agreed with the Bank.
2.        Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of less than $5,000,000 shall be awarded:
    (a)   by purchasers required to follow the Borrower's public procurement
procedures for the importation of goods, on the basis of such procedures,
provided that such procedures shall have been found acceptable by the Bank;
and
    (b)   by other purchasers, in accordance with established commercial
practice, provided that such contracts shall be awarded on the basis of
evaluation comparison of quotations obtained from suppliers from at least
two countries, except that direct contracting procedures acceptable to the
Bank may be used where considered appropriate under paragraph 3.5 of the
Guidelines.
3.        With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph 1 of this
Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the submission
to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan
Account in respect of such contract, two conformed copies of such contract,
together with the analysis of the respective bids and recommendations for
award, a description of the advertising and tendering procedures followed
and such other information as the Bank shall reasonably request.
4.        With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph 2 of this
Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the submission
to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan
Account in respect thereof, such documentation and information as the Bank
may reasonably request to support withdrawal applications in respect of such
contract.
5.        The provisions of the preceding paragraph 4 of this Schedule shall
not apply to contracts on account of which withdrawals from the Loan Account
are to be made on the basis of statements of expenditure.
