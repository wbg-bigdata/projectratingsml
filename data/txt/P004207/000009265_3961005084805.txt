MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR A LUANG NAMTHA PROVINCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao
PDR) for SDR 7.1 million (US$9.67 million equivalent) to help finance a Luang
Namtha Provincial Development Project. The proposed credit would be on standarI
IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. Part of the proceeds of the credit will
be passed on to the Province of Luang Namtha as budget contribution from the
cantral Government. About US$490,00C will be on-lent to Narpapa Lao (NPL) for
a term of 25 years at an interest rate of 6% per annum.
2.        BackgrDud_.  Despite favorable overall economic growth in recent
years, large numbers of the rural population in Lao remain poor in absolute
terms. It is estimated that over half of all rural households are in absolute
poverty (defined as having annual per capita incomes of no more than US$75), with
many having had little or no improvement in real incomes since 1970. It is in
these areas where physical infrastructure is the least adequate, where
agricultural and social support services tend to be the weakest and where
opportunities for nonfarm employment are the least promising.
3.        There is growing concern in the Government over these issues of
regional disparity. Of the country's 17 provinces, only four --Vientiane, Louang
Prabang, Savannakhet, and Champasak-- have basic infrastructure. These four,
which account for 40W of the total population, have so far received 90% of all
foreign assistance; the northern region (the poorest in the country), where the
lack of bLasic infrastructure is compounded by the mountainous topography, has
been particularly disadvantaged. Against this background, the Government wishes
to reduce such disparities by ei.hancing regional competitiveness and attracting
future investment to this poor region. An important element of this initiative
is the provision of basic infrastructure to better integrate regional markets.
However, due to a lack of resources and weak institutions, it will be necessary
for authorities to concentrate scarce resources on selected provinces with high
economic potential. Following this strategy, Luang Namtha Province was selected
for the project.
4.        The Province of Luancr Namtha.  Luang Namtha, with a population of
122,000, is a typical poor isolated northern province.   Due to the lack of
convenient access, the people spend excessive amounts of time simply commuting
t tween their villages and fields, forest areas, other villages and markets. The
movement of goods and services is difficult and, in about 65% of the villages,
seasonally impossible except on foot. This partly explains why the village labor
is locked into subsistence levels of production.  The availability of basic
social services and market outlets is limited and bactering predominates.
5.        The province, however, has a natural locational advantage in that it
borders China and Myanmar, and connects with Thailand via Bokeo Province. It
therefore has the potential to become a center for border trading activities
between other interior provinces and neighboring countries. Its economy, in



I                                    - 2 -
general, has improved substantially since 1987 when border trade between Lao and
China formally opened. In 1991, the total value of legal exports (including re-
export between Thailand and China) amounted to Kip 820 million (US$I.2 million
e-uivalent).
6.        The town of Namtha lies some 600 km north of Vientiane.   It is
accessible b, road and river, both of which take about six days in the dry
season; in the wet season, river transport can be dange )us.  The_road_N2tok
in the province is very rudir.mentary. Of the 519 village, in the province, only
about 150-200 are within three hours travel from a district center. Only 138 km
of the 306 km of national and provincial roads are passable with other than 4-
wheel drive trucks, and even then, with difficulty.  Connections with China are
much easier.  Two nearly all-weather roads enter China, in Namtha district at
Boten, and in the Singh district. Both roads were built by the Chinese in the
early 1970s.  The links with Thailand, via Bokeo province, and with Myanmar are
possible only in the dry season.
7.        A rudimentary water supply network is currently available in New
Namtha, the provincial capital. The r.ew town has a limited water distribution
network serving half the town. Its water source is a spring located some 5 km
away which is fed directly, without prior treatment, to the township by gravity.
Its yield is insufficient during the three to four dry months. In Old Namtha,
about 6 km south of the new town, there is currently no water supply network and
no organized distribution scheme. In Singh township, the existing water supply
is fed by a spring located 10 km from the town center. The system --less than
two years old-- already needs major repair due to the lack of proper routine
maintenance. In all three townships the limited power supply cannot be used for
pumping water. Many households without wells draw their water supply from the
nearby river. Women spend about an hour or more a day fetching water. In the
rural areas, the water and health situation is quite precarious.  The rural
populace is essentially served by traditional sources like shallow dug wells,
springs and streams. Many villagers, especially those of minority tribes located
in the hills, need to walk substantial distances to fetch their daily provision
of water.
8.        Past IDA Ooerational Experience.  Although the project is IDA's first
experience in Lao that directly addresses poverty by emphasizing sustainable
development of basic rural infrastructure with parallel investment in resources
to enhance income-generating opportunities, experience in somewhat similar
projects has been extensively studied and lessons have been incorporated. These
include various aspects of two transport projects and the Upland Agriculture
Development Project (UADP).  In the transport projects, technical assistance
components were successful in helping to strengthen weak institutions. This has
had a significant impact on project implementation. However, in the UADP, there
have been long delays in implementation partly due to frequent changes in
Government policy, and partly due to complex project designs with too many
components involving too many agencies making overall coordination and management
difficult. The original reason- for the delays were external factors unrelated
to project design but later on the delays were directly related to project design
and can be avoided. For this reason, the proposed project has deliberately been
kept simple with selective geographical and sectoral coverage; and special
attention has been paid  to  institutional  strengthening.    Further,  many



- 3 -
experiences of other donors were extensively studied and improvements based on
these have been introduced.   The project has incorporated the labor-based
technology used to construct roads in a successful ILO/GTZ pilot project in two
other provinces in Lao PDR.   In addition,  rural water supply strategies
incorporate the lessons learned by UNICEF.
9.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The IDA Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for La: PDR presented to the Board in October 1992 highlighted the need to
support sustainable growth and alleviate poverty. It raised the importance of
addressing the needs of the poor rural population and of moving beyond the focus
oxI national roads to include rural infrastructure.  The proposed project is
designed to provide baaic infrastructure to the Province of Luang Namtha, and
thus help the poor population in remote areas realize their economic potential,
raise their incomes and become integrated in the national economy.   The
availability of rural infrastructure would in turn facilitate investments by
other donors in additional resource development and social sector activities.
The proposed project is designed to be a demonstration which would provide
lessons for other provincial and national initiatives for rural development.
10.       Prolect Obiectives   The project is part of a development program for
Luang Namtha province. IDA funds will be invested in rural infrastructure--roads
and water supply--and will support the institutiona) strengthening of provincial
planning and management; while the BC's Luang Namtha Area Development Project
(with ECU 8 million, or US$9.6 million equivalent) will finance community
development/income generating activities, concentrating on the geographical areas
along che IDA financed roads. The thrust of the program is to improve the
standard of living and raise the income potential of significant numbers of the
rural poor.   Specifically,  it will: (a) enhance  local income generating
activities; (b) better integrate the local population into the market economy,
and provide access to social services; (c) reduce the time spent seeking water
and provide the population with water that in quality and quantity will meet
basic needs for health and hygiene; and (d) strengthen the planning, management
and technical capabilities of implementing agencies at the ministerial and
provincial levels.
11.       Proiect Description.  The IDA project would include road, water and
institutional strengthening components. The road comoonent would: (i) improve
two roads totalling about 150 km to low-volume standards; (ii) survey and design
the Namtha-Nalae road; (iii) develop the provincial Department of Communication,
Transport, Post and Construction (DCTPC); and (iv) develop the local construction
industry. The water component would: (i) rehabilitate and expand the water
supply network, standpipes, and sanitation programs in the towns of New and Old
Namtha and Singh; (ii) provide equipment for rural water development in the
districts of Viengpuka and Long; and (iii) provide technical assistance and
training needed to develop, supervise and operate water and sanitation systems.
The institutional strenqthenina com=onent would: (i) set up a Planning,
Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU) under the provincial governor's office
to advise and train provincial counterparts in planning, budgeting and management
as well as to coordinate the technical assistance of other activities planned
under the program; (ii) introduce monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and
integrate relevant project procedures into regular provincial administrative



activities; and (iii) arrange for scholarships, short-term seminars, and domestic
and regional study tours, and a training program for r;ovincial staff.
12.       Project Imolementation. The provincial gcvernment will be responsible
for executing the project.   However,  the provincial government,  which is
relatively weak, will be assisted t-y the central government: The Ministry of
Finance (MOF) and the Committee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC) will
coordinate the aid, and Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and
Construction (MCTPC) will provide overall technical support. The PCMU would
supervise and coordinate all aspects of the project, and its responsibilities
will include overall development planning, support to the provincial government
in investment strategy and project management. Also, it will monitor project
progress and coordinate with IDA, which will involve processing the credit
withdrawal applications as well as managing and monitoring project finances.
Under the PCMU, two sub-units, Component Implementation Units (CIUs), will be
responsible for supervising and implementing the road and water aupply components
as well as reviewing procurement procedures. NPL will be responsible for the
implementation of the township water supply component.
13.       The total project cost is estimated to be about US$$10.18 inillion
equivalent, including physical and price contingencies. This includes a foreign
exchange component of US$7.42 million, or about 73* of the total cost. A summary
of costs by project component is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Lao PDR are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively.
Two maps showing the Province of Luang Namtha and the project areas are also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12364-LA, dated February 18, 1994, is
being distributed separately.
14.       Prolect Sustainabilitv.  The capacity to operate and maintain rural
infrastructure rests mainly on the provincial staff's technical knowledge and the
province's financial means, both of which are currently very weak. Thus, the
project addresses this problem by directing technical and financial support to
the province so as to strengthen its capacity for road and water supply
construction and maintenance. Specifically, the roads would be constructed by
local contractors, both small and medium sized, who would receive training under
the project. Supervisors from the provincial DCTPC would be trained, and the
labor recruited from villages along the route would also acquire some training
in rural road construction and maintenance. As a result, road maintenance would
be more sustainable at the provincial and district levels than in the past, when
outside  contractors  used  imported  labor.    In  addition,  the  financial
sustainability of township water supply will be ensured through the collection
of water tariffs sufficient to cover operation and maintenance costs.  To ensure
susta-inability after the project is completed, the technology chosen for
operation and maintenance will be low-cost and unsophisticated.
15.       Actions Aareed.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government and ;he Province of Luang Namtha that as a condition of effectiveness
the PCMU will be established and fully staffed. Agreements were reached with the
Government that: (a) part of the proceeds of the credit will be passed on to the
Province of Luang Namtha as budget contribution from the Government for the



-5-
purpose of carrying out the project; and 'b) about US$490,000 equivalent in local
currency Kips will be on-lent to Nampapa Lao for a term of 25 years at an
interest rate of 6% per annum. Agreements were also reached with the Province
of Luang Namtha that: (a) an implementation schedule will be maintained for all
components with personnel complements and schedules satisfactory to IDA; (b)
installation of water meters in New Namtha will be completed for the currently
existing household connections by December 30, 1994; (c) the new water tariff
structure of 70 Kip/m3 consumed for the system in New Namtha will be effective
no later than June 1, 1994; and (d) water supply and sanitation household charges
sufficient to cover the reasonable cost of managing and maintaining the water
supply and saritation services will be established in the district of Old Namtha
and Singh no later than January 1, 1995.
16.       Environmental  Aspects.    The  water  supply  component  is  not  of
sufficient size or scope to warrant environmental attention, and the
institutional and community development activities will benefit the socio-
economic environment.   The two proposed road sections involve rehabilitating
existing roads for which no major environmental impact is foreseen. No persons
will be resettled or displaced involuntarily under the project.
i7.       Proaram Obiective Cateaories.  The project will benefit the province
of Luang Namtha which is among the poorest provinces in the country with a per
capita income one-third of the country's average. In addition to the poverty
focus, easier access to clean water and markets will greatly benefit women, as
it is they who provide the main labor for agricultural activities and household
tasks. Women and girls have traditionally been obliged to obtain water for
household consumption and they spend more than an hour a day collecting,
transporting and storing it.  Thus, the time saved from these chores can be
shifted to productive or leisure activities; also, the availability of clean
water simplifies the task of preparing meals and ihelps improve the level of
health. As the main users of water facilities, women will receive necessary
training and support so they can perform the critical daily maJntenance of rural
wells and township standpipes. In addition, improvted access to towns, due to the
new roads, will benefit women's commercial activities substantially (they are
actively involved in small scale trading in local markets and can be seen
transporting products on foot and selling them along the road or in town).
18.       Prolect Benefits.  The major benefit of the project would be to raise
the very low standard of living in Luang Namtha, which is one of the poorest
provinces in the country. About 50,000 poor people are expected to benefit from
improved access to markets and schools, as well as from better quality water and
sanitation services which would significantly improve their health and life
expectancy. Because labor costs constitute about 32* of the total cost of civil
works for roads and water suprly, about 1 million work days, representing over
US$2.3 million in wage income, would be generated in addition to building
economically viable infrastructure.   The Economic Rate of Return for the road
component is estimated at 12%. For the water supply components, the per capita
investment cost is in an affordable range, and the operation and maintenance
costs will be fully recovered from the users. Technical assistance and training
would also provide important intangible social benefits, such as creating an
organizational base for the poor and upgrading their skill level, and improving
the social status of women, as more economically productive opportunities open



- 6 -
up to them. Through the project activities, indirect benefits will also include
a greater awareness, in general, of ways to address and alleviate poverty.
19.       Risks.  Since this operation is the first of its kind ia Lao and is
located in a remote area, there are institutional and technical risks. Project
implementation could :e delayed due to a lack of coordinntion between the service
ministries and the provincial authorities and to the latter's limited
implementation capacity. To address these risks, a substantial number of start-
up activities have already been launched. Also, to secure local commitment aind
a sense of ownership, the preparation involved extensive discussion with
provincial staff.  The local staff needed for project implementation will be
supplemented by the government; technical assistance (within the project) will
focus on their training to ensure sustainability.
20.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
