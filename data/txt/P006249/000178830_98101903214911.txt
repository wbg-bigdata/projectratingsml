BRAZILIAN STEEL EXPANSION PROGRAM
Part I
APPRAISAL OF THE EXPANSION PROGRAM - STAGE II
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Brazilian Government has asked the Bank to make three loans,
each of approximately the same size, which in total would amount to US$192
million, to the three principal flat-rolled steel producers in Brazil.
The three companies, which are all government-controlled, are (1) Companhia
Siderurgica Nacional (CSN); (2) Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais, S.A.
(USIMINAS); and (3) Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA). The loans
would help finance their expansion of capacity from 3.7 to about 7.2 million
tons of raw steel equivalent per year. The projects, which are expected to
require financing of about US$1.28 billion and to be completed in 1975-1977,
represent the so-called Stage II expansion, the intermediate part of a
program which by 1980 will bring total annual capacity of the three flat
product mills to about 11 million tons of raw steel equivalent. This ap-
praisal is divided into Part I, which discusses aspects common to all three
projects, and three separate appraisal reports.
ii.       Brazil's steel industry is of relatively recent origin; it has
grown from a raw steel capacity of less than half a million tons in 1950
to about 6.0 million tons in 1971, about equally divided between flat and
nonflat products. While flat-rolled steel is produced almost exclusively
by CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA, there are 41 companies, most of which are
privately owned, engaged in the production of nonflat steel, of which the
eight largest account for about two-thirds of capacity. Brazil is now the
largest steel producer in Latin America and the potential for further growth
is good. It has abundant resources of high quality iron ore, a rapidly
growing market for steel, and plants which - particularly for flat-rolled
steel - will be economically sized upon completion of the Stage II expansion
program and will be able to produce steel competitively by world standards.
By the end of the decade the Government plan calls for raw steel capacity
to reach about 20 million tons annually of which about 11 million tons would
be for flat products.
iii.      CSN, as the largest and second oldest steel producer in Brazil, has
a very sound financial position, while USIMINAS and COSIPA, which came into
full production only in the mid-sixties in the midst of a severe recession,
are only now beginning to recover from their financial difficulties, which
stemmed partly from the imbalance between their steel-making and rolling
facilities and partly from their heavy debt burden. Their financial position
will be strengthened in connection with the financial plan for the Stage II



- ii -
expansion. All companies are well managed and have been using technical
assistance from foreign steel producers and engineering firms such as Nippon
Steel of Japan and U.S. Steel and McKee of the United States. Nevertheless,
the companies' rapid expansion will require some further improvement in
management structure.
iv.       Flat products consumption in Brazil has grown at about 9% annually
over the past two decades and is expected to increase at about 10% during
the 1970's. While this growth rate, which is based on detailed sectoral
and macroeconomic projections, is realistic, it would nevertheless be a sub-
stantial achievement, attained by only a few countries in the 1960's. The
projects as proposed are expected to follow future demand for flat products
in Brazil rather closely, but if domestic demand were to grow more slowly
than now predicted, some excess capacity may be available for exports.
Whether Brazil would be able to sell abroad all of such quantity will depend
on the status of the export market at that time. However, even if the three
plants could not export more than the quantities they have been exporting
over the past few years, their capacity utilization would still be in excess
of 84%. Also any such underutilization of capacity would neither threaten
the financial viability of the projects nor last for more than a few years.
v.        All three companies have ongoing expansion projects.  The Bank fi-
nanced projects would raise raw steel capacity for each plant to between
2.3 and 2.5 million tons.  Each project envisages a substantial expansion of
basic iron and steel, rolling and finishing capacity, including the installa-
tion of a new blast furnace with sufficient hot metal capacity to meet the
requirements of the subsequent expansion (Stage III). The projects will in
part replace obsolete and inefficient iron and steel making facilities, di-
versify product mix and reduce manufacturing costs. Modern technology will
be employed through large blast furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, continuous
slab casting machines and wide plate mills. The Bank has satisfied itself
that the overall strategy for expanding Brazil's flat products capacity - for
which there are several possible combinations - is appropriate and that the
facilities of each plant are adequately coordinated.
vi.       The projects will be financed with US$620 million in foreign
loans, US$120 million equivalent in loans from Brazilian institutions and
US$540 million equivalent of internally generated cash and equity. The three
proposed Bank loans totalling US$192 million and Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) loans of US$128 million will be used to finance in a 60/40 propor-
tion internationally bid equipment and foreign engineering costs. It is
expected that about 50% of the IBRD/IDB loans will be for local currency
expenditures. An additional US$330 million worth of equipment is to be
financed (90%) by export credit institutions in Austria, Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, and (10%)
from cash generation. This equipment will be bid competitively among suppliers
in the eight capital exporting countries. 1/ Although the terms of
1/   With the exception of the equipment included in CSN's complementary
investments (PI-15adated January 7, 1972; para. 3.02), which has already
been ordered.



- iii -
the export    credits have not yet been finally settled, they are expected
to be available to the steel companies at an average interest rate of 7-1/2%
and for about 15 years. Cash generation, loans from Banco Nacional do
Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE) and equity financing will be used for
downpayments for bilaterally financed equipment, construction and erection,
working capital and interest during construction. The Brazilian Government
is prepared to finance any overrun in project costs or shortfall in cash
generation.
-vii.     All companies are currently implementing expansion projects and,
with the assistance that they will be receiving from outside steel, engineer-
ing and consultant firms, are capable of executing the projects efficiently.
Such assistance will also be contracted during the initial operating years.
This is particularly important, because the companies are not yet familiar
with the new equipment and technologies that will be incorporated in the
projects. Also the simultaneous implementation of the three steel projects
will require supervision and coordination of the highest order if delays
in completion and cost overruns associated with such delays are to be
minimized. To this end and to strengthen the Bank's own supervision efforts,
the Bank and IDB intend to employ a firm of engineering consultants and share
on a 60/40 basis estimated expenditures of some US$1.5 million between them.
All three companies have commenced engineering and two (CSN and USIMINAS)
have begun procurement action. The first orders for equipment to be financed
by the Bank are expected to be placed in April 1972.
viii.     The companies' selling prices, on which the financial projections
have been prepared, were in March 1971 generally competitive with European
domestic prices for similar products. CIF import prices, which tend to move
cyclically and are presently low due to substantial competition in export
markets, are only somewhat below domestic prices and it is expected that upon
completion of the projects, the companies could meet such import prices and
still earn an acceptable return. In view of the importance of steel prices
(which are controlled by the Brazilian Government) to both the steel industry
and the economy as a whole, the Bank has received assurances during negotations
that it is the Government's policy that such prices will remain sufficient
for the companies to meet their financial obligations and adequately con-
tribute to the financing of further expansion, but that once these conditions
have been met the benefit of further reductions in production cost would be
shared between the producers and consumers.
ix.       The projects are expected to provide satisfactory financial and
economic returns of between 12.6/14.0% and 13.0/13.4% respectively, and even
under rather adverse conditions these could still be expected to be adequate.
The projects would generate net annual foreign exchange savings of together
about US$235 million once operating at full capacity. Projects of this
magnitude necessarily carry substantial risks, such as delays in construction
with resultant additional costs, technical start up difficulties particularly
with some of the new technologies that will be employed, a slower than



- iv -
expected market growth and other circumstances mostly outside the companies'
control. While all these risks are undeniably present and could be aggravated
by the fact that all projects are proceeding more or less at the same time,
the detailed appraisals show that such risks are not unduly high and should
be acceptable to the Bank.
x.        The proposed loans would constitute the third to fifth direct Bank
loans to Brazil for industrial projects.  The first (US$22 million) was made
to Alcominas in January 1968 for a 25,000 tons per year aluminum smelter which
was completed about on time and slightly below cost estimates and is now
operating at capacity.  The second loan (US$50 million) was made to Mineracoes
Brasileiras Reunidas (MBR) in August 1971 for a 10 million tons per year iron
ore export project, on which construction has started. The proposed loans
to CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA would be the first direct industrial loans to
Latin America made Jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank. They
would make a significant contribution to the expansion of the Brazilian
steel industry in the current decade; help Brazil to convert one of its most
abundant resources --- iron ore --- into finished steel products at competi-
tive costs; and play a key role in a financing package in which all the
equipment would be bid competitively.
xi.       The projects are suitable for three Bank loans of US$64.5 million
to CSN; US$63 million to USIMINAS; and US$64.5 million to COSIPA for terms
of 15-1/2 years including a grace period of 4-1/2 years.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the so-called Stage II expansion projects of
the three Government-owned integrated flat steel works in Brazil for which
the Bank has been asked to lend US$192 million. Part I discusses those
aspects of the expansion program which are common to all three projects. In
particular, it gives a description and evaluation of the present status and
plans of the Brazilian steel industry, the market prospects for its products
and its competitive position in relation to international standards.
1.02      Part I is being presented to the Executive Directors for consider-
ation together with the appraisal report (PI-15a dated January 7, 1972) of
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN). It will be reissued with the third
appraisal report, that of Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA), by which
time the data to revise chapters XII, XIII and XIV will be available and the
effect of the recent currency realignments on equipment and local construc-
tion costs may be more apparent. The appraisal of the Usinas Siderurgicas
de Minas Gerais S.A.(USIMINAS)and COSIPA projects are, however, sufficiently
advanced to allow definition of their respective scope and place in Brazil's
overall steel expansion program.
1.03      The three projects that the Bank has been asked to help finance
will increase the capacity of the flat-rolled products 1/ mills from about
3.7 to 7.2 million tons of raw steel 2/ equivalent.  They are expected to
require total investments of about US$1.28 billion equivalent and to be
completed by 1975-1977. The Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) have been requested to finance US$320 million for internationally
procured equipment and foreign engineering in a 60/40 proportion, with the
Bank's share being US$192 million. Export credits from Austria, Belgium,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.A. will provide another
estimated US$300 million for imported equipment. The balance consisting of
local construction work, interest during construction, incremental working
capital and downpayments for the bilaterally financed equipment, is to be
financed out of the companies' cash generation and increased equity (US$540
million) and loans from Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE),
the financial institution designated by the Government for the steel industry,
(US$120 million).

a large part of their incremental steel production will bypass the ingot

1.04      This report (Part I) was prepared by Messrs. Jaffe, Nayar, Perram,
Thadani and Zaman of the Industrial Projects Department. It is based on
the findings of a joint mission of the Bank and IDB, which visited Brazil
in May/June 1971, and various subsequent discussions with representatives of
the companies and the Conselho Nacional da Industria Siderurgica (CONSIDER),
the Government entity responsible for planning and coordinating the devel-
opment of the Brazilian steel industry. The report also contains the re-
sults of investigations in Europe in August 1971 to complete the Bank's
assessment of the Brazilian steel industry's competitive position.
II. HISTORY
A.   Steel Industry
2.01      The steel industry in Brazil is of comparatively recent origin.
Of the major producers, Belgo-Mineira in the State of Minas Gerais was the
first to start up in the 1920's. Even after the Second World War, before
CSN began operations (1946), domestic steel production was less than 300,000
ingot tons equivalent, and contributed less than half of domestic consump-
tion at that time. Since then production has grown rapidly and today Brazil
is the largest steel producer in Latin America, producing over 40% of the
output of the region. Prospects for further rapid growth of the industry
are good.
2.02      The principal steel mills are located in the area bounded by the
cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Vitoria and Belo Horizonte, which
region also encompasses most of Brazil's steel-consuming industry and the
iron ore mines which supply it.
2.03      Present (1971) capacity of the Brazilian steel industry is rated
at 6.0 million raw steel tons divided almost equally between flat and non-
flat 1/ rolled products.
2.04      The three principal producers of flat products are CSN (1.6 2/
million tons); USIMINAS (1.0 million tons); and COSIPA (0.6 million tons).
In addition a small mill, primarily engaged in the manufacture of semi-
finished products, has an annual capacity of some 36,000 tons of special
steel sheets. Nonflat steel (excluding CSN's) is produced by 41 companies,
of which the eight largest account for 1.5 million tons, or about two-thirds
of total capacity. The remaining 33 units are small and work mostly on the
1/   Rounds, bars, shapes and sections, rails, etc.
2/   1971 effective capacity in raw steel tons per annum.  In the case of CSN
this figure includes 0.3 million tons for nonflat products -- rails and
structurals.

basis of scrap. Most plants have recently been operating at a high level
of capacity utilization. The Government plans to expand capacity to about
20 million raw steel tons per year by 1980 or shortly thereafter, of which
11 million tons would be for flat products and 9 million tons for nonflat
products.  This is an ambitious program, particularly when viewed in the
context of the growth of steel production and consumption in other countries.
If achieved, it would represent an average increase in steel-making capacity
of about 14% per year during the current decade - though somewhat less in
consumption.
2.05      Total world production 1/ of raw steel increased from 348 million
tons in 1961 to 578 million tons in 1970 (equivalent to an annual rate of
5.4%) and is expected by the Bank to grow to about 950 million tons by 1980,
at about 5% per year. If steel output in Brazil increases to 20 million tons
by 1980 (para 2.04), it would constitute about 2% of world output as against
0.8% at present. The apparent per capita steel consumption in Brazil rose
from 41 kg in 1960 to 61 kg in 1969, but has remained less than in many other
Latin American countries, e.g. Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela.
2.06      In Western Europe, the lowest level of per capita steel consumption
is found in Portugal (79 kg) and Greece (80 kg). Australia and Canada used
502 kg and 529 kg per capita respectively and the U.S.A. 682 kg. Absolute
and per capita steel consumption in 1960 and 1969 of some 40 countries
around the world is shown at the end of Annex 1, in Table 1.
B.   Past Steel Consumption
2.07      While consumption of steel in Brazil over the past two decades
has on average increased by about 9% annually, it has fluctuated substantially
from year to year, in step with the general economy. Since 1965 steel con-
sumption has risen as follows:

2.08      Consumption of flat and nonflat products has grown virtually in
step. Except for 1970 exports of nonflat products were negligible, while
those of flat products have been just about in balance with imports of
qualities which are either not produced in Brazil or not available in
sufficient quantities. While imports are licensed, there is no indication
that consumption of steel in recent years has been held back due to import
restrictions. Growth in apparent consumption is therefore judged to reflect
reasonably well the increase in demand for steel in Brazil.
C.   Earlier Bank Involvement
2.09      The Bank's association with the steel industry in Brazil began in
1965 when it made a US$420,000 technical assistance grant to the Government
for a study to assess the gap between the supply and demand of steel
products in Brazil in the period 1966 to 1972 and make recommendations on
the most economical expansion program of the industry. During the same
year IFC made an investment of US$4.9 million in Acos Villares, a producer
of special steel. The steel study was carried out by the U.S. consulting
firm of Booz, Allen & Hamilton International (BAHINT). The Bank partici-
pated in supervising the study and subsequently, during economic missions,
has kept the situation and prospects of the steel sector under regular
review. At present, IFC has under consideration investments in the expan-
sion of some nonflat product mills.
2.10      The BAHINT study concluded that the comparative advantage Brazil
has in producing steel (abundant high grade iron ore which can be mined at
low cost and relatively inexpensive labor) and the prospective growth of
domestic demand justified a substantial expansion of steel-making capacity.
It also concluded that new investments should first bring the three large
integrated mills (CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA) to a balanced annual capacity
of about 3.5-4.0 million raw steel tons each rather than establish a new
integrated plant.
2.11      Soon after completion of the study in 1966, the Government ap-
proached the Bank to finance the expansions of COSIPA and USIMINAS by to-
gether about 1 million tons per year. The Bank at that time suggested that
the Government seek bilateral financing. While negotiations for such fi-
nancing took some time, Brazil was able to obtain credits (for the purchase
of imported equipment) aggregating US$126 million, including US$62 million
for USIMINAS from Japan, US$34 million for CSN from the U.S., and US$30
million for COSIPA mainly from France and Italy. With these credits Brazil
is adding 0.9 million ingot tons equivalent of annual flat products capacity
to meet the expected demand in the early 1970's.
D.   The Expansion Program (Stage II)
2.12      In the meantime, the Government asked the three companies to
elaborate a second expansion program (Stage II) to meet demand in the mid-
to late-seventies. Stage II envisages an increase in annual flat products
capacity of 3.5 million tons of raw steel equivalent. The blast furnace



-5-
capacity to be added will, however, be able to provide sufficient hot metal
for the subsequent expansion (Stage III), which the Government expects to be
completed b3 1980 or shortly thereafter. At that time the combined annual
raw steel capacity of the three flat products mills would reach 11 million
tons as shown below:

0.8 million raw steel tons equivalent (see Table on page 12).
E.   The Role of the Bank
2.13      In the fall of 1970, the Government requested the Bank and IDB to
organize a consortium to finance the Stage II expansion program on a joint
basis, similar to that applied by the Bank to the Marimbondo hydroelectric
project in Brazil and to power projects in Mexico and Colombia. The Bank
was sympathetic with the objectives of the program and felt that it could
make a valuable contribution in assisting Brazil to implement a well-con-
ceived program at an economic cost and one that required financing on a
scale well above earlier requirements of the steel industry. The Bank,
therefore, indicated that it was prepared to proceed with arrangements for
joint financing if IDB and the bilateral lenders were agreeable. On this
basis a preappraisal mission went to Brazil in November 1970.
2.14      In early 1971, however, the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Eximbank)
indicated that it would not participate in a consortium for the "joint
financing" of the steel expansion program. Several alternatives were
considered and eventually the Brazilian proposal for "parallel financing"
was accepted by the Bank, IDB and all the bilateral agencies. This proposal
calls for a division of the equipment for each of the three steel companies



into two separate lists. One would be financed jointly by the Bank and IDB
in a 60/40 proportion with procurement on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Brazilian suppliers could
participate in the bidding and would receive a 15% margin of preference, in
lieu of import duties. The other list, which would contain equipment largely
outside the capability of the Brazilian capital goods industry, would be
financed bilaterally with bidding restricted to suppliers in the countries
providing the credits. Financial terms of competing offers in this category
would be taken into account in the evaluation of bids.
2.15      In their extensive joint appraisal the Bank and IDB satisfied
themselves that first, the prospects for market growth justified the expan--
sion; second, the steel companies were competently run and could reasonably
be expected, with such outside assistance as they are now contracting, to
execute the projects within their budget forecasts and time schedules; and
third, the Government was taking measures with respect to prices, management
and financing of the plants and coordination of the projects, which would
ensure their economic, technical and financial viability.
F.   Government Policy Towards the Iron and Steel Industry
2.16      Of particular significance in this respect was the establishment
of CONSIDER in June 1970. Its principal role has been, first, to cause CSN,
USIMINAS and COSIPA to prepare 10-year expansion plans; second, to coordinate
these plans with each other and the market forecast prepared by Tecnometal,
a Brazilian consulting firm; and third, to consolidate them into a National
Steel Plan. Following approval of this Plan by the Government, CONSIDER has
been responsible for arranging finance and getting the Stage II program
(1971-1977) underway. At the same time it is shaping the expansion programs
of the nonflat producers. During its short existence CONSIDER has taken effec-
tive control over the development of the Brazilian iron and steel industry and
no major decisions affecting the sector are now taken without its knowledge
and consent.
2.17      CONSIDER's Board is composed of the Ministers of Industry and
Commerce (Chairman): Finance; Planning; and Mines and Energy; and the
Presidents of BNDE, the Bank of Brazil and the Brazilian Iron and Steel
Institute. CONSIDER's day-to-day operations are handled by the Executive
Secretariat with a staff of seme 20 engineers, financial analysts and
economists, most of whom have been seconded by public and private steel
and iron ore companies. It is headed by Dr. L.F. Sarcinelli Garcia, an
energetic and capable engineer in his thirties. CONSIDER also consults
closely with the Interministerial Price Council (CIP), the entity respon-
sible for setting domestic prices including steel prices.
2.18      Historically, the Government has played an important role in the
development of the steel industry. It provided the bulk of CSN's local financ-
ing and helped organize the financing of USIMINAS and COSIPA. It also has
been exercising continuous influence on steel prices, initially through



- 7 -
CSN which, in flat products, dominated the market until USIMINAS (1962) and
COSIPA (1965) began operations. Particularly during periods of rapid infla-
tion, it kept steel prices in line with those of other industrial products.
There followed years of recession, in which steel companies experienced
considerable financial difficulties under pressure of decreasing demand and
the associated decline in real prices.
2.19      In November 1966 steel prices were linked to the Monetary Correc-
tion Index and, in 1968, CIP was created. All firms whose yearly billing
exceeds a predetermined minimum (equal to about US$280,000 for the metallurgi-
cal industry) are required to seek CIP's approval for price increases. The
steel companies now submit twice yearly cost data to CIP, which sanctions
price increases to cover increases in costs outside of the companies' control.
In 1970 CIP explicitly recognized the need for flat products producers to fix
prices at a level which would permit them to meet the financial burdens aris-
ing out of the expansion program; and price revisions approved in 1970 re-
flected an increase in real terms of 5% (See Annex 2, page 4).
2.20      Domestic pricing policy for steel products is reinforced by a
tariff structure, which provides an adequate measure of protection, and by
export encouragements. These are discussed in Chapters IV and V. The Govern-
ment's current policy toward the steel industry is set out in two recent
documents (Annex 2). Inter alia they state that (1) the expansion of flat
products capacity is accorded priority; (2) the basic steel making capacity
of CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA forecast for 1980 totals approximately 11
million tons; (3) BNDE will be the chief financial institution for the
steel sector; and (4) CIP's pricing policy will assure the steel industry
an adequate rate of return.
G.   Financial History of CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA
2.21      Some recent financial indicators of the three flat products pro-
ducers are given in the following page. In view of Brazil's high rates of
inflation, the companies' financial statements were converted to dollars
for consistency of comparisons. More details are given in Annex 3.
2.22      CSN has had a sound financial history with the exception of the
recession years of 1965-1967. USIMINAS and COSIPA, which came into full
production in 1966, i.e. during the recession, have suffered losses partly
on account of the imbalance between their steel-making and rolling capacities
and partly on account of their heavy debt burden. They were able to service
their debt only with the help of BNDE, their major shareholder, which paid
the companies' foreign debt and converted the debt due itself into equity
to the extent necessary. The capital structure of both companies is being
strengthened in connection with the financing of Stage II. All companies
operated at their rated capacities in 1971, with CSN expecting a slighter
lower profit, USIMINAS a higher profit and COSIPA a smaller loss compared
with the previous year.

III. THE MARKET
A.   Demand
3.01      Several market forecasts have been made over the past few years.
Two of these were conducted in particular detail; one was the BAHINT study
(para 2.09) of 1965 and the other study was made in 1970 by Tecnometal at
the request of CONSIDER and the Brazilian Iron and Steel Institute. BAHINT
estimated that steel consumption would rise to 5 million tons in 1970 and
exceed 7.3 million tons by 1975, the last year of the forecast. Actual con-
sumption in 1970 exceeded the BAHINT forecast by about 5%.
3.02      The Tecnometal study which took 1969 as base year and which was
completed in April 1971 covers demand projections for the period 1970-1980
and gives particular emphasis to and detail of analysis for the period 1970-
75. The Bank has used this study as the principal basis for its own assess-
ment of the Brazilian steel market during the current decade.
3.03      The methodology on which the Tecnometal and Bank forecasts were
prepared is described in greater detail in Annex 1. Fundamentally, the
Tecnometal projections are based on a sector by sector analysis of the 10
major steel consuming industries in Brazil. In addition, in order to check
the sectoral forecasts, both Tecnometal and the Bank independently prepared
a number of macroeconomic projections. In its most likely forecast Teenometal
has assumed a 7% annual growth of GDP during the 1970's and has regressed per
capita steel consumption on (i) real per capita GDP, and (ii) real per capita
national income and Brazil's "degree of industrialization." The Bank's
macroeconomic projections, on the other hand, assume that GDP will grow by
7.5% per year during the decade and are based on a correlation between GDP
and steel consumption, which is statistically closer, and appears better
suited to the circumstances of Brazil's industrial structure. The latest
Bank Economic Mission to Brazil reported (Report No. WH-210a of November 30,
1971) that there are reasonable prospects for Brazil's economy to sustain
throughout the 1970's an average growth rate of 8-9% p.a. The Government is,
nevertheless, aware that such a rapid growth could increase inflationary
pressures and strain the balance of payments. In such an event, the Govern-
ment would be prepared to take adequate measures such as dampening aggregate
demand with a consequent reduction in the economy's growth to a somewhat
lower rate, say, 7-8% p.a. In this context, the Bank has conservatively
adopted a 7.5% p.a. average GDP growth rate in projecting the demand for
steel up to 1980.
(a) Flat Products
3.04      A comparison of what Tecnometal and the Bank consider the most
realistic projections for the growth in demand for flat products in Brazil
is shown below:

for Flat-Rolled Products: 1972-1980
(in million tons of finished products)
Sectoral Analysis        Macroeconomic Analysis
Year        TECNOMETAL   BANK           TECNOMETAL    BANK
1970 (actual)   ------2.1-------------
1972            2.5       2.5               2.9        2.4
1975            3.5       3.3               3.9        3.3
1980             5.8      5.1               6.2        5.4
It can be seen that the results of the sectoral and macroeconomic analysis
are fairly close.  CONSIDER intends to commission additional studies sometime
in 1972-73 to obtain more reliable data for the period 1975-80, to help decide
on the further expansion of flat products capacity which is expected to be
needed at the turn of the decade.
3.05      At this stage, it appears realistic to assume that the domestic
demand for flat products will rise to somewhere between 3.3 and 3.5 million
tons in 1975, and to a level of 5.1 to 5.4 million tons by 1980, equivalent
to a growth rate of 10% per year. The probability of achieving Tecnometal's
forecast of consumption of between 5.8 and 6.2 million tons by 1980, on the
other hand, appears somewhat less at this time.
(b) Nonflat Products
3.06      It is expected that the share of nonflat products in the total
demand for steel will decline from 51.5% in 1970 to 48% in 1980. The slower
rate of growth in the demand for nonflat steel is a reflection of the relative
importance given in Brazil's development plans to industries which consume
flat products most, e.g. automobiles and ancillaries, shipbuilding, commercial
and domestic appliances, and packings. This trend is in line with experience
in comparable countries.
3.07      At some later time, the balance may shift towards a higher growth
in nonflat products, as it has in the more developed countries of Europe and
North America. In this context it is likely that if by 1980 the demand for
flat products reaches between 5.1 and 5.4 million tons as expected by the Bank
(para 3.04), instead of the 5.8 to 6.2 million tons forecast by Tecnometal,
then the demand for nonflat products is also likely to be lower than the
5.5-6.0 million tons projected by Tecnometal. The Government target for 1980
for nonflat products is over 7 million tons (equivalent to 9 million raw
steel tons). While there would appear to be need for reconciliation of the
capacity targets, there is adequate time for any adjustment in the actual ex-
pansion of capacity, since current proposals envision the expansion of nonflat
products capacity to about 4e6 million tons only.



- 11 -
3.08      Even if total steel demand in Brazil in the seventies were to grow
only at the low expectation of the Bank (i.e. to 5.1 million tons of flat pro-
ducts in 1980) or a rate of about 9.5% annually, it must be realized that this
would nevertheless be a substantial achievement. During the past decade such
a rate was reached by only relatively few countries. Japan achieved 13.4%
average annual growth of steel consumption. Taiwan, Spain and the Philippines
attained even higher growth rates, but had a very small base of consump-
tion for a start. In almost all other countries, the rate of growth of
steel consumption has been less than 10% per year in the decade of the six-
ties.
B.   Supply and Demand Comparisons for Flat Products
3.09      The table on the following page shows the expected build-up of
supply of flat rolled products upon completion of Stages I (1973) and II
(1975-1977) of the expansion program, and compares it with the estimated
demand for these products as arrived at in the preceding paragraphs.
3.10      The table indicates that even after completion of Stage I in 1973
domestic supply will fall short of demand, and imports will have to be in-
creased. It is only after completion of Stage II (the Bank-financed projects)
that available capacity is expected to exceed domestic demand for three or
four years. Depending on whether the conservative Bank projections of market
growth for flat products or the more optimistic projections of Tecnometal are
realized, flat products capacity in 1976 will be utilized at between 84 and
91%. This assumes that import and export tonnages of flat products are equal.
If on the other hand, Brazil's exports of flat products in 1976 were to reach
10% of capacity, which is the target set for steel exports in the Government's
plan, and imports were to stay at 0.1 million tons, then capacity utilization
would rise to between 93 and 100%.
3.11      Any capacity underutilization, however, is expected to be short-
lived. Less than two years later (in 1978) exports would have to be reduced
under pressure from domestic demand; and in 1979 domestic demand would
either have reached domestic supply or possibly have surpassed it. The
question was considered whether the expansion program should be staggered by
one or two years to obtain higher levels of capacity utilization in 1976 and
1977. However, a deliberate delay at this stage was not thought to be advis-
*           able in view of the possibility that market growth may be somewhat better and
the technical build-up of production to full capacity somewhat slower than
assumed in the above table.

IV. EXPORT PERFORMANCE AND POLICY
A.  General
4.01      It is apparent from the above supply/demand projections (para.
3.09) that upon completion of Stage II Brazil will have capacity to export
flat steel products and that such export potential may for a few years be
in excess of the 10% of capacity that the Government's plan envisages. While
the companies will try to build up their capabilities for exporting, their
financial projections have been tested on the basis of export prices being
equal to the marginal cost of production and the results indicate that they
would be viable in such adverse circumstances.
4.02      Also in the context of the current volume of international trade
in steel - some 48 million tons in 1970 - and the likely pattern of its
growth, export targets appear achievable. Nevertheless, the extent to which
they will actually be attained, will of course depend on the competitive
position of Brazilian suppliers vis-a-vis Japanese, European and U.S. exporters
as well as the worldwide supply and demand position at that time, and it is
not practicable to forecast with much degree of confidence the price level
that may prevail some five years hence in a situation in which prices of
internationally traded steel have fluctuated substantially (Annex 1,
Table 2).
4.03      Export forecasts have therefore been made with the knowledge that
actual profitability will depend on conditions largely beyond the control
of the Brazilian steel producers. At relatively high export prices such as
in 1969 and 1970, exports would be expected to yield profits comparable with
those on domestic sales; but under unfavorable conditions, it may be necessary
to accept prices only slightly above marginal cost - such as has been the case
from time to time for other steel exporting countries - as an alternative to
unutilized capacity. Steel prices in international trade are examined in fur-
ther detail below.
4.04      In the past the bulk of Brazil's exports have been directed to
Latin American countries - Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, and small
quantities have gone to the USA and to Western European countries. Although
these countries are known to have their own steel expansion plans, no major
changes are foreseen in the pattern of trade.
B.   Export Incentives
4.05      Exports of steel from Brazil are encouraged by the Government.
Apart from allowing full exemption from the IPI (Federal Excise Tax levied
at 4-5% of invoiced price) and ICM (State Excise Tax of 14.5-17%), the



- 14 -
Federal Government grants incentives in the form of credits against the
exporters' IPI and ICM tax payments for domestic sales and exemption from
income tax on export profits. The current rates of tax credit applicable
to CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA are 10% each of the sale price against IPI and
ICM 1/ tax payments. In addition to these tax credits, exporters benefit
from the Bank of Brazil's export credit policy; they can borrow up to 80%
of the CIF export value of orders for a period of four months at a prefer-
ential interest rate of 8% per annum. Comparing these terms with those of
short-term credit for domestIc sales, the advantage of the export credit
facility amounts to about 3.6% of the export price.
4.06      Tax credits and concessional export financing arrangements are
not limited to steel, but - though rates vary - are allowed for the export
of all manufactures from Brazil. In interpreting the extent of the incentives
granted to steel exports, it has to be recognized that export incentives and
special credit facilities are given by many other countries and a part of
the Brazilian export incentives package is intended to equalize such advant-
ages. It has not been possible to quantify with any degree of accuracy the
extent, if any, to which these incentives may be deemed a subsidy. However,
the structure of export incentives in Brazil extends to many commodities
besides steel.
V. COMPETITIVE POSITION OF BRAZILIAN FLAT STEEL
A.   Imports and Import Tariffs
5.01      As domestic output of flat rolled products in Brazil has been
insufficient to meet demand in recent years, substantial quantities have been
imported. Import licenses are issued, fairly liberally at present, directly
to consumers and to the three main producers. CONSIDER is responsible for
monitoring demand and supply and advising the Government to authorize imports
to ensure that legitimate demands are met. In 1970, imports of flat products
exceeded 300,000 tons; in 1971 licenses for over 400,000 tons were issued
during the first six months and actual imports during the year are estimated
in excess of 500,000 tons. Imports of steel products similar to those made
in Brazil are subject to tariffs which range from 20% ad valorem on common
steel, e.g. plate, coil and sheet, to 45% on high carbon steel, galvanized
sheet and welded pipe, and 55% on angles, shapes and sections, steel sleepers,
etc. Import duties for various steel products are shown in Annex 1, Table 14.
The weighted average tariff duty on imports, which correspond to the products
of CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA, is slightly above 20%.
1/   Except for USIMINAS for which the ICM tax credit is only 5%. This lower
rate is connected with the location of the company in Minas Gerais, but
is expected to be raised to 10% shortly.



- 15 -
5.02      The considerably higher rates of 45% and 55% on such items as
galvanized sheet and welded pipe are explained as being necessary in the
context of small size and/or inefficient structure of domestic production
in these lines. There should be scope for some downward revision in these
rates as the industry expands. The impact of the existing tariff rates on
the economy is somewhat softened by the duty-free import of steel products
which are either not produced in Brazil or produced in insufficient quantities.
B.   Comparison of Domestic Steel Prices
in Brazil and the European Common Market
5.03      International price comparisons for industrial goods are difficult;
and this is equally true for steel products. What appear superficially to be
rather standardized product categories are in fact greatly diversified, with
substantial differences in metallurgical and chemical composition, physical
characteristics and dimensions. These differences demand a wide range of
"price extras."  The relationship between "base prices" and "extras" varies
considerably from one country to another; and the structure of "extras" in
domestic trade is frequently different from that in external trade. Annex 1,
Tables 3 to 8, draws attention to some other important features of the price
structures studied in various countries.
5.04      To compare domestic prices of steel in Brazil and the European
Conmon Market, identical qualities and dimensions were selected from the
three major product groups - plate and hot and cold rolled coil/sheet, which
account for the bulk of the flat products consumed in Brazil. Brazilian
prices were calculated CIF Sao Paulo (in which general area about 70% of
consumption occurs), and excluding State and Federal Taxes (ICM and IPI).
This price basis was also chosen because CIP's price control applies to CIF
delivery Sao Paulo.
5.05      Common Market prices which are published monthly by the Market's
Secretariat in Brussels are established FOB "Basis Points" 1/, net of turnover
taxes 2/. Main producers and distributors practice "price alignment" to the
extent of 3-5% below those published prices to meet competition from both
within the Common Market and outside. At present, however, producers appear
determined to avoid indiscriminate price reductions as had been practiced
in the years prior to 1968. All prices - both Brazilian and European -
relate to March 1971. 3/
5.06      Details of the price comparison for three product groups are given
*           in Annex 1, Tables 3-8.  A summary is given in the following table:

It can be noted that prices for plate in Brazil are fairly competitive with
European prices. Price extras for size variations and special surface finish
are higher in Brazil, but differences are small, and are related to the still
rather limited range of equipment in the Brazilian steel mills. Average
prices for hot-rolled sheet seem also competitive with those in Europe,
although prices for some individual qualities are higher in Brazil. Deep-
drawing qualities of hot-rolled products are lower-priced in Brazil, but this
is understood to be because of somewhat inferior surface finish. Size
extras in Brazil are about double what they are in Europe (US$7.70 versus
US$3.50/ton).
5.07      Average prices of cold-rolled products are higher in Brazil than
in Europe, and prices for some individual qualities are markedly so. The
quality of extra-deep drawing varieties is reported to be somewhat inferior
to that of corresponding European products. In this case size extras in
Europe are higher than in Brazil (US$12.50 as compared with US$10.00/ton).
It can be concluded that, while not all qualities are comparable, average
price differences in the three major product groups are relatively small.
Furtliermore the new facilities to be installed as part of the projects are
expected to result in improvements in product quality and, more important,
in reductions in operating costs.
C.   Import Prices and Competitiveness Against Imports
5.08      The following table compares for some selected steel qualities
of flat-rolled products the Brazilian domestic prices with import prices
(without import duty), CIF Sao Paulo, as of March 1971 and the apparent

/2   Average cost of shipping and handling between European North Sea Port
and Sao Paulo of US$33/ton, as reported by CONSIDER on basis of importers'
records.
5.09      A number of conclusions can be drawn from the above.  First, at
the level of export prices that prevailed in March 1971, which as shown in
Annex 1. Table 2 were relatively low in their historical evolution over the
past twelve years, there is no import duty requirement for plate originating
in Europe. On the other hand, hot-rolled sheet and cold-rolled coil appear
to demand protection of up to 23% for the highest priced material of very
thin gauges. Secondly, European export prices are only between 70% and 80%
of the quoted domestic list prices in the European Common Market and would
still be only 75-85% of such prices, if the maximum margin of the "price
alignment", currently 5% (para 5.05), were deducted from the domestic list
prices. Thirdly, taking into account the rather strained financial position
of the European steel industry as a whole, it is highly unlikely that, except
for a few plants, it could afford to sell a major portion of its output at
1971 export prices. Fourthly, at these prices experience indicates that
it is not possible to obtain long-term contracts for the supply of flat prod-
ucts, and this would seem to indicate that exporters do not consider these
prices satisfactory in the long-run. Although this does not exclude even
further declines in export prices from time to time, Brazil could not rely on
obtaining supplies at present prices regularly, particularly not for the
sizable tonnages it would have to import were it not to go forward with the
present expansion. Finally while the full effect of the recent currency re-
alignments on European export prices cannot be fully determined at this writing,
they can be expected to increase in dollar terms.



- 18 -
D.   Future Price Policy
5.10      Each of the expansion projects will bring about reductions in
operating costs, which - though different for each company - if fully
reflected in lower prices, could reduce the average price level for flat
products by about 10%. The financial projections, however, assume that
price reductions would be small and would be made only in cold-rolled
products from 1976 onwards. The rationalization effect stemming from the
expansion would, therefore, primarily strengthen the financial position of
the steel companies and help them to generate funds for subsequent expan-
sion for which the present projects already lay the ground.
5.11      The price assumption has been thoroughly discussed with the Brazil-
ian authorities and, during negotiations, the Bank received assurances that
the Government, as long as it exercises control over the setting of steel
prices, will establish maximum selling prices which will (i) permit the com-
panies to earn an adequate return on funds invested in them, meet their fi-
nancial obligations and make a reasonable contribution to future investment
for expansion of capacity; (ii) be reasonably related to production costs
under conditions of efficient operation at reasonable levels of capacity
utilization; (iii) be reasonably competitive with the prices for such prod-
ucts in other major steel producing countries; and (iv) once the foregoing
conditions have been met, share any further declines in the cost of produc-
tion with Brazilian consumers.
5.12      Furthermore, with the view to improving the price structure for
the various flat products so that it may bear a more rational relationship
to production costs and to the price structure in other important steel
producing countries, the Government has commissioned a study and has under-
taken to exchange views with the Bank with regard to the recommendations of
this study. Also, in order to ensure that the companies' cash generation
will be sufficient for the requirements of the projects, the companies will
take all reasonable steps to ensure that projected revenue will not be re-
duced, in real terms, before the end of 1975.
VI. THE EXPANSION PROJECTS OF CSN, USIMINAS AND COSIPA
6.01      All three companies have ongoing expansion projects.  The three
projects which the Bank has been asked to help finance are part of the
companies' overall expansion plans, which are designed to raise individual
raw steel capacity to between 3.5 and 4.0 million tons for a combined capacity
of 11.0 million tons upon completion of the third stage at the end of the
current decade. Each project envisages a substantial expansion of basic iron
and steel making capacity, including the installation of a new blast furnace
with sufficient hot metal capacity to meet the requirements of each plant
in Stage III. In addition, CSN will expand its coated products capacity,
while USIMINAS and COSIPA will both install a 160-inch plate mill.



- 19 -
6.02      The decision to build one large blast furnace, rather than two
smaller furnaces - one in Stage II and the other in Stage III - was taken
in recognition of the substantial economies to be derived from the operation
of a single large unit (see also para. 11.05), and the expectation that
Stage III would be implemented during the second half of the 1970's.  The
Bank is satisfied that the proposed method of increasing blast furnace capac-
ity represents the least cost solution at discount rates of up to 30%. It is
noteworthy that the combined capacity of the proposed blast furnaces would
exceed that of the three largest blast furnaces in any country outside Germany,
Japan and the U.S.S.R. The related facilities -- raw materials prepara-
tion, sinter plant and coke ovens -- will, however, be sized to suit the
requirements of Stage II with provision for increases in Stage III. All
projects are designed to reduce the cost of producing steel. In other
respects the three expansion projects (Stage II) are briefly characterized
as follows.
A.   CSN
6.03      CSN, which started operations some 25 years ago, and is the largest
steel producer not only in Brazil but in the whole of Latin America, has an
old plant and much of the project represents modernization and replacement of
obsolete and inefficient iron and steel-making facilities. This in part
explains why CSN's capital cost per incremental annual raw steel ton is higher
than that of the other two companies (para. 14.01). The new blast furnace
will provide sufficient hot metal capacity to permit the existing No. 2 fur-
nace to be blown out and rebuilt pending completion of Stage III. The re-
placement of the existing open-hearth melt shop by a basic oxygen furnace
(BOF) shop will enable better quality steel to be produced, while operating
costs and atmospheric pollution will be reduced. The choice of continuous
casting over ingot casting and primary reduction in a new slabbing mill (the
latter being the traditional two-step method of producing slabs) is also in
line with modern technology. Lastly, the proposed finishing facilities will
permit an improvement in the quality of CSN's coated products, such as gal-
vanized sheet and tinplate.
B.   USIMINAS
6.04      Although USIMINAS started operations in 1962, it is still in the
early stages of development, because of the considerable delay in arranging
the financing of the Stage I expansion. The planL was well conceived at the
outset and the ongoing expansion is in line with the original concept. The
project includes a second, larger BOF shop with two continuous casting ma-
chines for the production of slabs for a new 160-inch plate mill.  As the
new facilities were largely foreseen in the basic design of the plant, they
can be installed with a minimum of interference with production. Conse-
quently, USIMINAS expects to have the prodect in operation by early 1975,
almost one year ahead of CSN and two years ahead of COSIPA.



- 20 -
C.   COSIPA
6.05      COSIPA was started up in 1965 and is the only one of the three
companies with only one blast furnace. Since the furnace has to be shut
down from time to time for relining, iron and steel production ceases and
the rolling mill has to operate on purchased slabs. With the installation
of the new large blast furnace this unsatisfactory situation will be
corrected. Unlike USI4INAS, the desigh of COSIPA's rolling mill prevents
an easy expansion of capacity and another rolling mill will therefore have
to be added. After first opting for a second hot strip mill, the company
has now decided to proceed, like USIMINAS, with the installation of a
160-inch plate mill. COSIPA, in contrast to the other two companies, can
expand steel-making capacity in Stage II without constructing a new BOF
shop. The COSIPA project includes the installation of a coke oven battery
for the manufacture of coke for sale to domestic iron works and foundries
presently relying on imported coke or charcoal. The company has probably
the best market location, but this is offset to some extent by poor subsoil,
which necessitates extensive piling and increased construction costs.
D.   General Expansion Strategy
6.06      In its appraisal the Bank considered four alternative strategies
for expanding Brazil's flat-rolled products capacity:
(a)  not to expand the three existing plants beyond their
Stage I capacity and, instead, to construct a large
new coastal plant;
(b)  to expand only two of the three plants in Stage II
and expand the third in the second half of the
1970's;
(c)  to expand basic iron and steel making capacity at
only two of the plants, but rolling and finishing
capacity at all three plants, and ship slabs from the
two plants, which would have excess steel making capacity,
to the third; and
(d)  to use the potential excess steel making capacity at
one of the plants to produce billets for the nonflats
sector.
6.07      None of these alternatives offers such clear-cut advantages over
the Government's plan as to compensate for the lack of balance which would
have ensued in the industry as a whole, and each company presented a valid
case for its project. In any event, once the goals of Stage III and the
premise that it would follow reasonably closely upon completion of Stage II
are accepted, the alternatives are reduced to differences of timing and
would not affect to any significant extent the economic rate of return of
the overall expansion program during the 1970's.



- 21 -
6.08       The case for constructing two 160-inch plate mills, one at
USIMINAS and the other at COSIPA, in preference to one 160-inch mill, and
one universal (having both horizontal and vertical rolls) mill of lesser
width, was also investigated. The Bank accepted the argument that the
better utilization of the second wide mill outweighed the relatively minor
savings in investment cost, which would result from the installation of a
universal mill.
6.09      Hiaving accepted the concept on which the long-range expansion
plans of the three flat-rolled products plants are based, the Bank has re-
ceived assurances during negotiations that the Government will not itself
establish any new integrated flat products plant nor give incentives for
the construction of such a plant, without prior consultation with the Bank,
before the existing plants have been expanded to their Stage III - and thus
relatively balanced - capacities.
VII. ECOLOGY
7.01       The modern processes used in the manufacture of iron and steel
give rise to dust, smoke and the red oxide fume, which is a characteristic
of the industry, as well as acid, chemical and oily effluents. Over the
years, as increasing attention began to be paid to the environmental impact
of steel works, equipment has been developed which reduces air and water
pollution. This equipment has now become an integral part of "dirty" process
units, such as sinter plants, coke ovens, BOF shops and pickle lines, so that
it is difficult to conceive of them without their associated effluent treat-
ment or fume cleaning devices.
7.02      All the new facilities which are included in the Stage II expansion
projects, incorporate pollution control equipment, which is generally consis-
tent with the requirements of industrialized countries. Very few of these
devices are optional and all of them were foreseen in the companies' propos-
als. The cost of these devices of around US$30 million is included in the
capital cost estimates.
7.03      All water will be given a primary cleaning in the vicinity of the
facility where it is used and recirculated to the extent possible. Con-
taminated effluent will be treated prior to discharge.
7.04      Air pollution control equipment will be installed at the coke
ovens, sinter plants, blast furnaces, BOF shops and slabbing mill scarfer,
which generate particulate matter or oxide fumes.
7.05      The ecological aspects of each company's expansion project are
discussed in greater detail in the individual appraisal reports.

VIII.  CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCIAL PLAN
A.   Capital Costs - Basis of Estimates
8.01      Total costs for the three projects are estimated at US$1,283 mil-
lion equivalent, including additional working capital and interest during
construction, expected to be distributed as follows: CSN US$448 million;
USIMINAS US$407 million; and COSIPA US$428 million.1/
8.02      All the capital cost estimates have been updated to February 1971,
when the rate of exchange was Cr$ 5.03 to US$1. The companies were asked to
include in their capital cost estimates a 10% provision for contingencies
and to allow for price escalation by providing 5% per annum from February
1971 to the expected dates of disbursement.
8.03      There was considerable debate as to the most appropriate escala-
tion allowance for equipment, in view of the somewhat higher rate (6 to 7%
annually) of increase of European prices in the recent past and the realign-
ment of the dollar in relation to European and Japanese currencies. However,
two factors were thought to militate against a rate of increase in excess of
5% per annum. First, it is generally held that there is at present a buyer's
market for steel mill equipment from which the projects can be expected to
benefit and second, while neither the steel companies nor their consultants
were able to assess the effect of international bidding on equipment prices
(estimates of which are largely based on U.S. or Japanese prices), they
thought that prices somewhat lower than those estimated should be obtainable.
8.04      A provision of 15% to cover the maximum increase in cost of
Brazilian over imported equipment was added to the portion of equipment
expected to be procured in Brazil with IBRD/IDB funds. CONSIDER and the
steel companies, in consultation with the Brazilian manufacturers' associa-
tions, estimated that the local share would average about 25% of total equip-
ment purchases or approximately US$150 million. In the Bank's view, this
may be on the high side, not so much because of the limited capabilities of
Brazilian suppliers, but because of restrictions in their capacity to produce
similar items for the three companies at more or less the same time. If this
is correct, the 15% provision on items not procured in Brazil will add an
element of contingency to the estimate. The equipment cost estimates for
items expected to be imported exclude import duties, which have been waived
for the steel expansion program.
1/   The capital cost estimates were originally prepared in February 1971
and revised in September 1971 taking into account the currencies of
the equipment cost estimates.



- 23 -
8.05      The Bank compared, item by item, the capital cost estimates of
each of the projects (Chapter XIV) and caused the companies to review those
estimates which were found to be out of line. The revised estimates result-
ing from this review (Annex 4) show much closer agreement and can therefore
be regarded with greater confidence. The estimates of the civil engineering
and construction work were obtained from the companies' ongoing expansion
projects.
B.   Financial Plan
8.06      The following sources of funds are expected to finance the projects:
Financial Plan
Millions      % of
of US$     Financing
Foreign Debt:              - IBRD                      192          15
- IDB                      128          10
320         25
- Bilateral Credits        300          23
Sub-Total:                              620          48
Local Debt:                                            121          10
Total Debt:                             741          58
Cash Generation and
Share Capital:                                         542          42
Total Financing:                      1,283         100
8.07      The Bank and IDB loans will have a length of 15-1/2 years 1/,
including a grace period of 4-1/2 years, and an interest rate of 7-174% per
annum on the Bank loan (plus a guarantee fee accruing to the Government of
1-3/4%) and 8% 2/ on the IDB loan. The bilateral credits are expected to
1/   A final maturity of more than 15 years was chosen in order to provide
Brazil with external credits on terms which correspond to the require-
ments indicated in the latest Economic Report on Brazil (WH-210a dated
November 30, 1971). The 15-1/2 year term is compatible with the
requirements of the projects.
2/   The IDB loan conditions include a 1-1/4% per annum commitment fee and
a 1% commission for inspection and supervision, so that the actual
cost of the IDB funds to the companies is close to the Bank's including
the guarantee fee.



I



- 25 -
9.02      For equipment packages jointly financed by IBRD/IDB bids will be
evaluated on the basis of the FOB factory price of domestically manufactured
equipment and the CIF landed price of imported equipment, with the landed
price increased by a 15% margin of preference, which is less than the custom-
ary rate of import duty on steel mill equipment. In calculating the CIF
landed price for purposes of bid comparisons, the merchant marine renewal, port
improvement or other similar taxes will not be included. In the case of
bids composed of both Brazilian and identifiable non-Brazilian components,
only the Brazilian portion will be treated as a Brazilian bid and thus benefit
from the 15% preference. In other cases, any bid with more than 50% Brazilian
value added will be considered a Brazilian bid. This definition of what con-
stitutes a Brazilian bid is in accordance with the National Law of Similars.
It is expected that about 50% of the IBRD/IDE loans will finance local curren-
cy expenditures, all after full international bidding.
9.03      Bid evaluations for equipment packages financed by bilateral credits
will take into account differences in the credit terms of the various countries
by discounting at the rate of 10% per annum all principal and interest pay-
ments, fees, commissions and premiums, which the companies would have to make
under the purchase contracts. This method of comparing bids on the basis of
the net present value of the CIF landed price, which was devised by CONSIDER,
is acceptable to the export credit agencies.
9.04      An important feature is the use of a two-stage bidding procedure
for the larger and technically complex facilities. This method is designed
to permit the companies to achieve a degree of uniformity in the bidders'
technical specifications before prices are read out. The first stage of
bidding will consist of the presentation of two separate envelopes, the first
containing the technical proposal and the second the price. Only the
envelope containing the technical proposal will be opened at this stage.
After reviewing the technical proposals and requesting such changes as may
be necessary to make the bids comparable, bidders will be asked to submit
an appropriate amendment to their specification and price. At the second
stage of bidding, the prices originally submitted and the amendments thereto
will be read out and the amended prices used for bid evaluation purposes.
9.05      The "Instruction to Bidders" document (which sets out the bidding
procedure) and the distribution of bid packages between multilateral and
bilateral-financing sources (and thus the extent of Brazilian participation
in the bidding) have already been approved by the Brazilian authorities and
manufacturers' associations. In addition, the Bank has received assurances
from the Government that purchase contracts will be registered and import
licences issued promptly for equipment required for the projects, so that
the formalities associated with the importation of equipment should not delay
the implementation of the projects.
9.06      The companies will purchase the equipment, FOB port of embarka-
tion in the case of foreign and ex-works in the case of domestic suppliers.
The companies will themselves arrange for shipment and insurance to the
plantsite and for local contractors to construct the foundations and build-
ings and carry out the erection under the supervision of the equipment
suppliers.



- 26 -
9.07      Local construction work will not be financed by IBRD/IDB.  Civil
works, building and erection contracts will be negotiated with local con-
struction companies, including subsidiaries of international companies,
known to the steel companies on the basis of the unit rates applicable to
the ongoing expansion projects. The Bank believes that the construction
industry in Brazil has the capacity to undertake the work involved in the
expansion of the three steel companies, in addition to its other commitments,
without overtaxing its resources in terms of management, skilled labor and
construction equipment. This aspect will be watched very closely during the
execution of the projects (para. 10.02). During negotiations with CSN, the
company agreed that, if due to its heavy workload the construction industry
showed signs of becoming uncompetitive, as indicated by extended construction
times and undue price increases, proposals will also be solicited from foreign
companies for subsequent construction contracts.
X. SUPERVISION
10.01     The simultaneous implementation of the CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA
expansion programs will require supervision and coordination of the highest
order, if delays in completion and cost overruns associated with such delays
are to be minimized.
10.02     To strengthen its own supervisory effort, it is therefore proposed
that the Bank together with IDB retain an experienced firm of engineering
consultants for the construction stage (1972-76) to make an independent
assessment of the progress of the projects, monitor the cost of local con-
struction contracts, identify possible weaknesses in the companies' project
management organizations and make recommendations for action designed to
prevent future problems. The draft terms of reference are given in Annex 7.
10.03     The appointment of such consultants is strongly supported by
CONSIDER and would be in line with IDB's normal supervision practice, for
which service it makes a standard deduction of 1% from the loan amount.
10.04     To safeguard the objectivity of the consultants' work, they will
be retained by and report directly to the Bank and IDB. The consultants
will, however, be encouraged to work closely with CONSIDER, because CONSIDER
will initiate whatever action may be required on the part of the Government.
10.05     The Bank will closely coordinate with IDB the supervision of the
projects, and the consultants' fee estimated at about US$1.5 million will be
shared with IDB on a 60/40 basis, with the Bank's share of about US$0.9
million being paid out of allocations from its administrative budget.
10.06     Since American and Japanese engineering consultants are already
extensively engaged in the Brazilian expansion program, proposals for the
supervision and coordination of the projects are being solicited only from
European consultants. Invitations to submit proposals will be sent out during



- 27 -
January 1972 and it is expected that the consultants can be appointed soon
after the first loan to the steel companies (CSN) has been approved by the
Board and before the first orders for equipment are scheduled to be placed
(April 1972).
10.07     During negotiations, the Government and the companies were advised
of the consultants' terms of reference and agreed to cooperate fully with
them in the execution of their work.
XI. RAW MATERIALS
A.   Iron Ore
11.01     In the past decade Brazil has developed into a major force in
the world iron ore market. In 1971 Brazil produced an estimated 40 million
tons of iron ore (5% of world production), while exports amounted to 31 mil-
lion tons (17% of world exports). Reserves are immense and the ore is of
top quality. The outlook for iron ore is described in detail in the apprais-
al report of the Mineracoes Brasileiras Reunidas Iron Ore Project (Ref.
No. PI-10 dated June 16, 1971).
11.02     The availability of high quality ore at low cost is one of the
key elements in the development of a competitive steel industry in Brazil.
On average it means that domestic ore is available at a delivered price of
approximately USJ 7 per iron unit, compared with a minimum of US16 which
the European or Japanese steel industries pay for imported ores. All other
factors being equal, this results in a saving in the cost per ton of average
finished products of about US$10.
B.   Coking Coal
11.03     Brazil's known coking coal reserves are all located in the State
of Santa Catarina. Compared with imported coking coal, national coal is of
inferior quality (high ash and sulfur content) and is more expensive on
account of the low yield of metallurgical grade coal from run-of-mine. Because
of these disadvantages, the companies are concerned to reduce their consumption
of Brazilian coal. Government regulations presently require the companies to
consume 30% of national coal, but after completion of the second stage of the
expansion program a lower national coal requirement is foreseen. In order to
produce an acceptable blend of coking coal, the companies import West Virginia
coal from the U.S. in view of its low ash content. Formal assurances that the
stipulated national coal requirement will not be raised above 20% assumed in
the projections, unless a significant improvement in quality and reduction in
price can be effected, were obtained during negotiations.
11.04     The outlook for coking coal is discussed in a paper by the Bank's
Economics Department 1/. This concludes that while short-term or medium-term
1/   Economics Department, Coke and Coking Coal Availabilities:  A Potential
Problem or Not?  January       .



- 28 -
imbalances in the market cannot be ruled out, coking coal availabilities
do not pose a serious long-term problem for the world iron and steel industry.
Reserves are ample, and recent price increases have induced a wave of capacity
expansion, particularly in North America. Prices, however, are likely to rise
in response to rising costs of production.
11.05     The high cost of both national and imported coking coal places
the Brazilian steel industry in much the same position as that of Japan.
Consequently, one of the principal objectives of the expansion program is
to expand iron making capacity so that coke consumption will be reduced to
a minimum. The three large blast furnaces, equipped for fuel injection and
high hot blast temperature and top pressure operation, and the provision of
sinter capacity to run two of them (CSN and USIMINAS) on a fully prepared
burden, are proposed with this end in view. A fuel rate of 520 kg per ton
of hot metal, including 460 kg of coke and 60 kg of heavy oil has been fore-
cast for these two furnaces, while the corresponding figures for COSIPA are
500 kg of coke and 50 kg of heavy oil respectively. The coke and fuel rates
projected by CSN and USIMINAS are the same as those currently being achieved
by the five leading Japanese steel companies and represent very good practice,
but are considered achievable in the overall context of the expansion projects.
On this assumption the cost of coke per average ton of finished steel pro-
duced by these two companies would be US$27.50, which compares with about
US$20-US$22 for the Japanese and German steel industry.
C.   Flux Materials
11.06     Ample supplies of high grade flux stones, both limestone and
dolomite, are available at economic cost.
XII. FUTURE PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION
12.01     The projected overall profitability of the three companies has
been compared on the basis of return on assets for the years 1972 through
1979. As summarized below the exact calculation was net profit before taxes
and interest as a percentage of total assets (excluding assets under con-
struction).
Net Profit before Taxes plus Interest as a
% of Net Operative Assets
Avg.
1972  1973  1974  1975  1976  1977  1978  1979  72-79
CSN                     15.6  14.7  11.9  11.3  13.7  16.2  16.9  17.8  14.7
USIMINAS                12.9  14.3  10.3  11.5  12.1  12.8  13.5  14.1  12.7
COSIPA                   6.2   8.3   6.8   7.7  12.1  10.1  10.4  11.4   9.1
CONSOLIDATED            11.6  12.6  3 .7  10.6  12.7  13.1  13.5  14.3  12.3



- 29 -
12.02     While the financial rates of return on the proposed expansion pro-
grams are relatively in line with CSN showing a 13.4% return, USIMINAS a
12.6% return and COSIPA an estimated 14% return, the overall returns on
assets of the companies show a wide divergence with CSN having the highest
average at 14.7% a year and COSIPA the lowest at 9.1%. The average con-
solidated return on assets for all three companies for 1972-1979 is expected
to be 12.3%.
12.03     The table indicates that CSN's return is higher in practically
every year than those of the other two companies. This is due to the fact
that CSN's original plant has a lower cost in dollar terms and has been
written down for depreciation purposes considerably more than the other two
plants. In addition, CSN has a more profitable product mix than its com-
petitors. While the return of each of the companies will improve substan-
tially on completion of the expansion programs, the effect is much more
noticeable on COSIPA, which has the highest fixed asset cost of the three
plants and has not produced as efficiently as the other two. Another con-
tributing factor to COSIPA's low return is its low iron and steel-making
capacity in relation to its rolling and finishing capacity, which requires
it to import slabs in order fully to load its mill.
12.04     The companies' financial projections are all based on average sell-
ing prices prevailing in February 1971, adjusted downward from 1976 onward as
discussed in Para. 5.12, and operating costs based on the price level of in-
puts prevailing in February 1971. The justification for this assumption is
that under the Government's present price policy all cost increases outside
the companies' control such as those due to adjustments in exchange rates,
nationally negotiated wage increases, etc., can be passed on in the form of
higher selling prices.
12.05     Other major assumptions are as follows:  (i) the companies will
produce at their full effective capacity and sell their entire production, 1/
subject only to a planned build-up of inventory; (ii) most fixed assets on
the companies' books up to December 31, 1970 will be depreciated at a rate
of 4% while the new assets added after this date will be depreciated at a
rate of 5.5% per annum; (iii) the companies are liable for income tax only
on that portion of the profit which is attributable to private ownership
which ranges at present from about 25% for USIMINAS to about 1% for COSIPA: 2/
and (iv) no dividends, except to preferred stockholders, are projected by
USIMINAS and COSIPA and the dividends paid by CSN to the National Treasury
will be reinvested in the company under a special law, "Law 5114".

2/   CSN's forecasts assume private participation increasing to 29% in
1979.

12.07     CSN is financially the strongest of the three companies.  Its debt
service is ample, being consistently over three times except for the years
1974/1975. The debt service coverage and debt/equity ratios of USIMINAS and
COSIPA will be satisfactory after the planned conversion of part of their
debt to equity. Based on the forecasts, CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA will accum-
ulate funds of nearly US$130 million, US$60 million and US$60 million, re-
spectively, by the end of 1977. These surpluses are expected to be retained
by the companies and used for the further expansions proposed for Stage III.
12.08     On the whole, all three companies will be financially strong enough
to carry out the projects, provided the planned conversions of debt to share
capital are completed as required by the Bank of USIMINAS and COSIPA.
XIII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM
13.01     The combined economic rate of return of the three projects is ex-
pected to be about 13%. The return to CSN is 13.4% and may be slightly
higher than that of the other two due to the large proportion of coated steel
in its product mix. Based on preliminary calculations the economic rate of
return to USIMINAS is expected to be 13.3% and COSIPA is slightly above 13%.
These returns are quite good considering that portion of each of the three
projects which will be unutilized until the next stage of expansion. In



- 31 -
calculating these returns the selling prices used are based on FOB European
export prices prevailing in March 1971 (para. 5.05) plus freight and delivery
charges to Sao Paulo.
13.02     By utilizing the local iron ore and having efficient modern
facilities, the projects will benefit the Brazilian economy through substan-
tial savings in imports. At full production the combined net foreign exchange
savings of the three projects should be about US$235 million per year.  The
use of B,razil's high quality domestic iron ore for these projects will not
detract from the country's export potential since Brazil lhas virtually un-
limited supplies of readily accessible iron ore and is proceeding with plans
to increase substantially its ore exports over the next few years.
13.03     The use of modern technology and low cost domestic raw materials
makes overall production costs in Brazil competitive with those in other
countries. After completion of the projects domestic selling prices are
expected to be only slightly higher than imports and no undue protection is
tieeded to make the projects viable.
XIV. C011PARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE THREE PROJECTS
14.01     CSN is expanding its production capacity essentially of coated pro-
ducts, whereas USI!!INAS and COSIPA are expanding their plate and hot and
cold rolled steel production capacity. Based on the CSN appraisal and those
in process for USIMINAS and COSIPA, comparisons have been made with regard
to the capital cost per ton of additional raw steel capacity and capital cost
per incremental unit of net annual sales and are shown below:
Comparative Capital Costs
CSN     USIMINAS      COSIPA
Added Capacity - Million, Raw Steel TPY         .75         1.4          1.3
Capital Cost/Ton of Added Raw Steel
Capacity                                  US$421       US$263       US$257
Capital Cost/Incremental Unit of Net
Annual Sales                              2.1:1        1.6:1        1.7:1
14.02     Wlhile USIMINAS' and COSIPA's cost per ton of annual raw steel capac-
ity increment are similar to and consistent with current steel plant construc-
tion experience, CSN's higher cost is mainly attributable to the replacement
of the existing open-heartlh melt shop by a larger BOF facility, and its heavy
investment in finishing facilities, especially tinning lines. A similar com-
parison, the ratio of capital cost to incremental net sales, also indicates
that CSN's capital investment is higher than that of the other two companies.

14.03     Typical production cost projections - materials, labor and service
costs as well as yield assumptions - were compared and are, in general,
fouind to be compatible.  Differences in costs for inpults among tlhe three
companies are minor and accounted for by transportation and other local
differences, e.g., iron ore cost and labor rates.
14.04     As can be seen from the following table, CSN's cost to produce one
ton of not metal is expected to be slightly lower thian that of the other two
companies, mainly because CSN is expected to have a better operating efficien-
cy as a result of its expenditure for modernization and replacement of oli fa-
cilities as well as its full utilization of the new blast furnace, while re-
tiring one of the existing ones until Stage III production starts. To some
e-xtent the variations in the production costs are also attribtutable to differ-
ences in the companies' cost accounting practices and in the operating effi-
ciencies projected for their finishing facilities.

14.05     The number of additional employees estimated for the proposed ex-
pansion program is about 9,500 (3,500 for CSN, 3,000 for USIINAS and 3,000
for COSIPA). At full production capacity, productivity of CSN, USI'ITNAS and
COSIPA is forecast to be 21.0, 12.2 and 13.7 man hours/ton of finished pro-
duc_ compared with 13.2 and 13.0 in the U.S. and Japan in 1970. CSN's em-
ployment in 1971 of a labor force that is three-fold that of the other two
plants will be reduced to approximately two times. Although the large num-
ber of employees at CSN can, in part, be explained by the company's heavy
investment in labor-intensive finishing facilities and the inclusion of the
Volta Redonda city payroll, the labor force at the steel plant is neverthe-
less excessive. CSN's management has agreed to take steps to bring its la-
bor force to acceptable levels. Incremental productivity (additional man
hours/added finished product e-apacity) for CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA is ex-
pected to be 12.7, 6.5 and 7.6 respectively.



- 33 -
14.06     The managements of the three plants are aware that their expansion
will impose new and greater technical, operational and management challenges
and are taking steps to attain their objectives with help from consultants
on a continuing basis. In the past CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA have maintained
engineering contracts with USS, Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) and McKee for
studies involving specific operational problems and expansion programs. All
companies have used management consultants and CSN is about to undertake a
review of its organizational structure with the assistance of a U.S. firm of
consultants. Additional arrangements for engineering services and operational
assistance have been contracted for the Stage II expansion projects.
14.07     USIMINAS' project implementation schedule is shorter because of
long range planning of the original layout as well as the advantage of
larger equipment packages. COSIPA, on the other hand, has the longest
schedule because of a poorer basic plant layout, the need for piling and
delays in finalizing the project details.
XV. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
15.01     During negotiations on the CSN project agreement was reached on
the following:
(a) The Government will not itself establish any new inte-
grated flat products plant nor give incentives for con-
struction of such a plant, without prior consultation
with the Bank, before the existing plants have been expanded
to their Stage III - and thus balanced - capacities (para.
6.09);
(b) Satisfactory arrangements for the provision of funds for
project completion in case of cost overruns or shortfalls
in cash generation (para. 8.08);
(c) Assurances that bilateral financing on satisfactory terms
is being arranged (para. 8.06);
(d) Assurances that the Government will take all measures which
shall be necessary in order to facilitate the prompt importa-
tion by the steel companies of goods for the project purchased
outside Brazil (para. 9.05);
(e) Agreement on the Government's future steel pricing policy
(para. 5.11);



- 34 -
(f) Assurances that, if the local construction industry shows
signs of getting overextended, foreign bids for subsequent
construction contracts will be solicited (para. 9.07);
(g) Agreement that the steel companies will not be required to
use low quality, high cost coal for more than 20% of their
coal requirements (para. 11.03);
(h) Assurances that both CONSIDER and the steel companies will
cooperate with the banks' supervising and coordinating con-
sultants in the execution of their work (para. 10.07).

BRAZIL - STEEL EXPANSION PROGRAM
The Market and Prices for Steel
A.   The Market for Brazilian Steel
Introduction
1.        Present (1971) capacity of the Brazilian steel industry is rated
at 6.0 million raw steel tons divided almost equally between flat and non-
flat rolled products.  The Government hopes to develop it to about 20 million
raw steel tons per year by 1980 or shortly thereafter; 11 million tons
would be for flat products and 9 million tons for nonflat products. This
is an ambitious program particularly when viewed in the context of steel
production and consumption in other countries. If achieved, it would repre-
sent an average increase in steel making capacity of about 14% per year
during the current decade - though less in consumption. Total world pro-
duction 1/ of steel increased from 348 million tons in 1961 to 578 million
tons of raw steel in 1970 (at an average annual rate of 5.4%) and is expected
by the Bank to grow to about 950 million tons by 1980, at about 5% per year.
Steel output in Brazil rose from about 2 million raw steel tons in 1960 to
5.2 million tons in 1969 or from about 0.5% to 0.8% of world production;
and if it grows to 20 million tons by 1980 or shortly thereafter, would
constitute about 2% of world output. Per capita steel consumption in Brazil
rose from 41 kg in 1960 to 61 kg in 1969, but has remained less than in
many other Latin American countries as the table below indicates.

In Western Europe the lowest level of per capita steel consumption is found
in Portugal (79 kg) and Greece (80 kg). Australia and Canada used 502 kg
and 529 kg per capita respectively, and the USA 682 kg. Figures of world
steel production and per capita consumption by country are given in Table 1.

Present Status of the Industry
2.        There are three principal producers of flat products, all ovned
by the Government, namely CSN (1.6 million tons 1/); USIMINAS (1.0 million
tons); and COSIPA (0.6 million tons), and a small mill, ACFSITA, with an
iristalled annual capacity of 36,000 tons of special steel sheets.  Nonflat
steel is produced by 41 companies, of which the eight largest account for
1.5 million tons, or about two-thirds of total capacity. The remaining 33
units zre rather small and work mostly on the basis of scrap. Most nlants
have been operating at a high level of capacity utilization.
Recent History of Steel Consumption
'While consumption of steel in Brazil over the last two decades
has on average increased by about 9% annually, it has fluctuated substantially
from year to year, in step with the general economy. Consumption exceeded
one million tons of raw steel equivalent for the first time in 1947, and by
1960 had increased to about 2.8 million tons of raw steel. It rose further
to ?d.5 million tons in 1963 but then declined to 2.9 million tons in 1965.
Sinice then steel consumption has risen as shown in the following table:

4.        Consumption of flat and nonflat products has grown virtually in
step. Except for 1970 exports of nonflat products were negligible, and
exports of flat products have been just about in balance with imports of
qualities which are either not produced or not available in sufficient
quantities in Brazil. While imports are licensed, there is no indication
that consumption of steel in recent years has been held back due to import
restrictions. Growth in apparent consumption is therefore judged to reflect
7:easonably well the increase in demand for steel in Brazil.

CSN this figure includes 0.3 million tons of nonflat products.

5.        The following market analysis concentrates on the demand prospects
for flat products, which are the principal goods of the steel expansion
projects of CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA that the Bank has been asked to
finance. But it will also deal with the growth prospects of nonflat products
to the extent that market expectations for both categories are interrelated.
Market Forecasts - Demand
Flat Products
6.        In the context of the Government's intention to develop Brazil's
steel industry, several market forecasts have been made over the past few
years. Two of these were conducted in particular detail; one in 1965 by
Booz, Allen & Hamilton International (BAHINT) of New York for Banco Nacional
Do Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE), and the other in 1970 by Tecnometal, a
Brazilian consulting firm, on request of Conselho Nacional da Industria
Siderurgica (CONSIDER), and the Brazilian Iron and Steel Institute.
7.        The findings of the BAHINT report of 1966 reflect to some extent
the relatively depressed state of the economy at that time; it estimated
that steel consumption would rise to 4.5 million raw steel tons in 1969, reach
5 million tons in 1970 and exceed 7.3 million tons by 1975, the last year of
the forecast. Actual consumption in 1970 exceeded the BAHINT forecast by
about 5%, reflecting the fact that steel demand has been steadily buoyant
since 1967.
8.        The Tecnometal study which took 1969 as base year and which was
completed in April 1971 covers demand projections for the period 1970-1980
and gives particular emphasis and detail of analysis to the years 1970-1975.
The Bank has used this study (which comprises six volumes of about 930
pages) as the principal basis for its own assessment of the Brazilian steel
market during the current decade.
9.        Fundamentally the Tecnometal projections are based on a sector
by sector analysis of the 10 major steel consuming industries in Brazil,
as well as on a variety of macroeconomic demand analyses. A summary of
the range of these projections is shown in the following table:

10.       The spread between the "low" and the "high" estimates is relatively
small. and the low demand growth forecast trails behind the more optimistic
high projections by only one or two years for the later years of the decade.
Trhe Bank expects steel demand to grow at a rate close to the "low" estimate, 1/
representing average annual growth rates of about 9.5% for all steel products
(in terms of raw steel) and about 10% for flat-rolled products alone.  While
suc(1 a forecast is considered realistic in the context of Brazil's overall
development plan, it needs to be mentioned that a rate of growth in steel
consumpt-on of approximately 10% per year is nevertheless substantial, and
during the past decade has only been exceeded in relatively few countries.
Japan achieved 13.4% average annual growth of steel consumption. Taiwan,
Spain and the Philippines attained even higher growth rates but they had a
very smnaLl base of consumption for a start. Canada, which used about the
c,&ame auantity of steel in 1960 as Brazil did in 1970, achieved 8.3% average
gowth in consumption during the 60's; and Italy, with a somewhat larger base,
increased its consumption at the same rate (8.3%).
11.       In order to check and confirm the sectoral forecasts, both
Tecnorieral and the Bank independently prepared a number of macroeconomic
projections. In its most likely forecast Tecnometal has assumed a 7% annual
growth of GDP during the 1970's and has regressed per capita steel consump-
tici on (i) real per capita GDP, and (ii) real per capital national income
and Brazil's "degree of industrialization." The Bank's projections on the
other hand, assume that GDP will grow by 7.5% per year during the decade,
and are based on a correlation between GDP and steel consumption, which is
statistically closer, and appears better suited to the circumstances of
Brazil's industrial structure. 2/
12.       The latest Bank Economic Mission to Brazil reported (Report No.
Wvii-210a of Nov. 30, 1971) that there is scope for growth of Brazil's GDP
at an annual average rate of 8-9% in the years 1972-77; but there is some

possibility that inflationary trends may develop if external aid is not
forthcoming to the extent envisaged by the Government. In such a case the
growth rate may have to be trimmed back. The Bank, therefore, also
examined the implications of growth at 7-8% per year, which would be more
certainly achievable. It also found that there would be a tendency for the
rate of growth of GDP to fall somewhat below the 8-9% range after 1977,
even if this average rate is achieved upto 1977. In this context, the Bank
has assumed a relatively conservative figure of 7.5% for average growth
of GDP through the decade of the 1970's as a basis for projecting steel
demand up to 1980. Available capacity for steel production is expected to
be somewhat more; and if the economy grows more rapidly than is assumed,
the installed facilities would be more fully utilized for meeting domestic
needs, and the margin available for export would be less.
13.       A summary of what Tecnometal and the Bank consider the most
realistic projections for the growth of demand for flat products in Brazil
is shown below:

14.       It can be seen that the results of the sectoral and macroeconomic
analyses are indeed quite close.  Tecnometal intends to undertake additional
studies sometime in 1972-73 to obtain more reliable data for the period
1975-80, to help decide on the further expansion of flat products capacity
that is expected to be needed at the turn of the decade.
15.       At this stage it appears realistic to assume that the Brazilian
demand for flat products will rise to somewhere between 3.3 and 3.5 million
tons in 1975, and to a level between 5.1 and 5.4 million tons by 1980, if the
growth rate of GDP in the current decade can be maintained at an average level
of 7.5% per year. The probability of achieving Tecnometal's forecast of
consumption between 5.8 and 6.2 million tons by 1980, on the other hand,
appears somewhat less at this time.

19.       The table indicates that flat products capacity will be fully
utilized over the next several years, that even after completion of Stage I
in 1973 domestic supply will fall short of demand and imports will have to be
increased. It is only after completion of Stage II (the Bank financed
program) that available capacity will exceed domestic demand for three or
four years. Depending on whether the conservative Bank projections of market
growth for flat products or the more optimistic projections of Tecnometal
will prove to be closer to actuality, flat products capacity iii 1976 may only
be utilized at between 84 and 91%, if we were to assume that export and import
tonnas,es of flat products are equal. If on the other hand, Brazil's exports
of flat products were to reach 10% of capacity (about 0.43 million toins) the
target set for it in the Government's plan, and imports would stay at 0.1
millicn tons, then capacity utilization would rise to between 93 and 100%
in 1976. Any capacity under utilization, however, is expected to be
sliortlived. Less than two years later (in 1978) exports would have to be
reduced under pressure from domestic demand; and in 1979 domestic demand
would e4ther have reached domestic supply or possibly even surpassed it.
20.       The question was considered whether the expansion program should
be staggered by one or two years to obtain higher levels of capacity utiliza-
tion in 1976 and 1977. However, a deliberate delay at this stage was not
considered advisable in view of the possibility that market growth may be
somewhat better and the technical build-up of production to full capacity
somewhat slower than assumed in the above table.
Export Performance and Policy
General
21.       It is apparent that for a few years upon completion of Stage II
Brazil will have some flat steel capacity available that could be used to
produce for exports. CONSIDER has explicitly indicated that the expansion
program includes provision for the export of flat products to the extent
of about 10% of capacity or a maximum of some 500,000 tons per year. During
1976-1978 it is possible that more free capacity would be available for
exports. Mnile the companies will try to build up their capabilities for
exporting such tonnage - which is not much larger as a percentage of
capacity than the 150-260,000 tons of flat products that Brazil has been
exporting in the period 1967-70 - their financial projections have
been tested on the basis of export prices being equal to marginal cost of
production.  This is not only a rather conservative assumption, but renders
the assessment of the tonnage actually exported less crucial in evaluating
the companies' financial strength. The results indicate that they would be
viable in such adverse circumstances.
22.       Also in the context of the current volume of international trade
in steel - some 48 million tons of products in 1970 - and the likely
pattern of its growth, export targets appear achievable. In the past the
bulk of Brazil's exports have been directed to Latin American countries -
Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru and small quantities have gone to



ANNEX 1
Page 9
the USA and European countries. It is expected that the proportion of
plates, coil and sheet may increase in future, but no major changes are
foreseen in the pattern of trade.
23.       The extent to which these export targets are actually achieved
will of course depend on the competitive position of Brazilian suppliers
vis-a-vis Japanese, European and U.S. exporters and it is not practicable to
forecast with much degree of confidence the price level that may prevail
five years hence. Export plans have therefore been made with the
knowledge that actual profitability will depend on conditions largely
beyond the control of the Brazilian steel produces. At relatively high
prices such as in 1969 and 1970, exports would be expected to yield
profits comparable with those on domestic sales; but under unfavorable
conditions, it may be necessary to accept prices only slightly above
marginal cost such as has been the case from time to time for other steel
exporting countries - as an alternative to unutilized capacity. Steel
prices in international trade are examined in further detail below.
Export Incentives
24.       Exports of steel as well as other manufactures from Brazil are
encouraged by the Government. Apart from allowing full exemption from IPI
(Federal tax levied at 4-5% of invoiced price) and ICM (State tax of 14.5-17%)
the Federal Government allows incentives in the form of credits which can be
adjusted against the exporters' IPI and ICM payments account for domestic
sales. The current rates of tax credit applicable to the three main producers
are shown below:
Tax Credit Rates for Exports
Company        State          ICMLi          IPI/
CSN        Rio de Janeiro   10%             10%
USIMINAS   Minas Gerais       5%            10%
COSIPA     Sao Paulo         10%            10%
/1   Calculated on ex-plant price.
/2   The lower rate of credit for ICM for USIMINAS
is connected with its location in Minas Gerais.
25.       In addition to these tax credits, exporters also benefit from the
Bank of Brazil's export credit policy; they can borrow up to 80% of the
"CIF" export value of orders for a period of four months at a preferential
interest rate of 8% per annum. Comparing these terms with those of short-
term credit for domestic sales, the advantage of the export credit facility
amounts to about 3.6% of the export price.



ANNEX 1
Page 10
26.       Tax credits and concessional export financing arrangements are not
limited to steel exports, but - though rates vary - are allowed for a wide
varieLy of exports from Brazil.  In interpreting the extent of the incentives
yran-i=d to steel exports, it has to be recognized that export incentives
und s-ecial credit facilities are given by many other countries and
- o  the Brazilian export incentives package is intended to equalize
sucrh ,(dantages. It has not been possible to quantify with any degree of
s-ccurcvz the extent, if any, to which these incentives may be deemed a
subsidy, However, the structure of export incentives in Brazil extends
to many commodities besides steel.
Com.retitive Posit-lon
imports and Import-Tariffs
27.       As the domestic output of flat rolled products in Brazil has not
- ensu'-fficient to fulfil demand in recent years, substantial quantities
have lhad to be imported each year. Import licences are issued on a fairly
llberal basis at present, to consuming industries as well as to the three
Main p-.oducers. CONSIDER has responsibility for watching the demand and
sunply position and advising government to authorize imports as necessary
to ensiure that all legitimate demands are met and shortages do not develop.
In 1970 imports of flat products exceeded 300,000 tons. In 1971 licences
for over 400,000 tons were issued during the first half of the year, and
actual imports during the year are expected to exceed 500,000 tons.
28.       Import tariff regulations provide that imports of steel products
simiiar to those available within Brazil shall pay import duties, which
vange from 20 percent on common steel products, e.g. plate, coil and
s.oeet Wo 45% on high carbon steel, galvanized sheets and welded tubes
and pipes, and 55% on angles, shapes and sections in assemblies, steel
se  rs for railways, etc. 1/ The tariff rates are intended to provide
eFe :lve protaction for domestic industry, and high rates of 45% and 55%
,n specific items are explained as being necessary in the content of small
31.ze and/or inefficient structure of domestic producers at present - e.g.
galvanized sheets, welded tubes and pipes.
29.       The impact of the high tariffs is somewhat softened by a proviso
which allows duty free import of specific steel products which are either not
produced at all or produced in insufficient quantities. Government exercises
its discretion to permit some duty free imports of scarce products each
year. In 1970 a conspicuous example was tinplate, which was in short
supply and had to be imported at rather high cost.  But if import prices
are lower than domestic prices, as for cold rolled sheet for the automobile
indusi.-ry, then the import duty is not waived.  Users are allowed to import
under provisions of the general law which permits imports up to 25 percent
(for sSeel products) of the quantity of domestic product purchased; but these
imports are subject to import duty.
1/   A list of products and rates of duty applicable is at Table 14.



ANNEX 1
Page 11
30.       As the cost structure of the Brazilian steel industry is expected
to change upon completion of Stage II of the expansion project, there will
be scope for some changes in the price structure and also In the level of
protective tariffs necessary. This question is dealt with in greater detail
further below, after consideration of prices.
Price Comparisons between Brazil, the U.K. and Common Market Countries
31.       International price comparisons for industrial goods are well
known to be difficult; and this is equally true for steel products. What
appear superficially to be rather standardized product categories are, in
fact, greatly diversified, with substantial differences in metallurgical and
chemical composition, physical characteristics and dimensions. These
differences demand a wide range of "price extras." The relationship between
"Base Prices" and "Extras" varies considerably from one country to another;
and the structure of "Extras" in domestic trade is frequently different from
that in external trade. It is also necessary to draw attention to some
other important features of the price structures studied in various countries.
32.       In Brazil CIP's steel price control applies to a "CIF delivery
Sao Paulo" basis, allowing the producers to quote ex-works prices by making
standard deductions for freight from works to Sao Paulo, and to charge
"extras" for dimensions and qualities within certain approved ranges. The
three principal flat products producers have presently an almost uniform
schedule of "extras," and the only significant differences in their
respective prices relate to "delivery ex-works." Purchasers in the Sao
Paulo area, which accounts for about 70% of Brazil's steel consumption,
pay the standard contract rates for freight to Sao Paulo, unless they can
make cheaper arrangements, and steel products of all three producers cost
them about the same. They generally choose suppliers on the basis of
quality and delivery time. Consumers in other areas would choose the
supplier nearest to them, if quality and delivery time suit them. Rebates
are permitted, but in view of prevailing market conditions for flat products,
are not generally available to consumers.
33.       The structure of "Base Prices" is rather simple.  There are
separate "base prices" for slab, plate, hot-rolled coil, cold-rolled
coil, galvanized sheet, tinplate and a few other products. But within
each category, there is a wide range of price "extras" for dimensions,
composition, and physical characteristics. The share of the price extras
in total price paid by the buyer may vary from 5% to 30% for hot-rolled
sheet, and upto 50% for plate and cold-rolled products.
34.       In order to compare Brazilian prices with prices in other
countries, standard qualities and dimensions which account for a substantial
part of total consumption, have been chosen, and prices have been calculated
on the basis of delivery at Sao Paulo, excluding ICM and IPI (State and
Federal Taxes). These prices are comparable with prices quoted in the
Common Market for "Basis points," e.g. Essen or Oberhausen, Thionville, or
Dunkerque, Sidmar or Seraing.



ANNlEX 1
Page 12
35.       In the United Kingdom price policies of the British Steel
Corporation (BSC), which accounts for about 75% of the country's steel
output, are subject to Government direction and approval. In early
1971 BSC proposed an average price increase of 14%, but the Government
allowed only half as much.  However, within such a general framework, the
Corporation is free to determine its price structure and to change it as
necessary, in response to international competition and changes in demand
patterns. BSC quotes for delivery at purchaser's works or warehouse and
absorbs freight in its price.  For each  major product group there is a
"base price," to which "extras" are added for quality, dimensions, packirig
and size of order. The total of extras is generally less than 10% of the
base price. BSC's price structure has been under review for major changes,
partly in preparation for Britain's entry in the European Common Market.
It is likely that the new structure will be patterned on the European "Basis
Points" system (described further below,) so that part of the cost of freight
would have to be borned by the buyers. At present, the U.K. allows import
of steel ingots, semi-finished steel, and some products which are in short
supply, free of tariff duties. It imposes 10% advalorem duty on most steel
products, and charges higher rates for some products, e.g. 17.5% on cast
iron pipes and steel tubes, and 25% on drawn wires. There are no quantitative
restrictions or licensing requirements for import of steel into the U.K.;
and in 1970 the country imported about 2 million tons of steel to supplement
its domestic output of about 25 million tons, and exported over 3 million
tons. No special incentives are allowed for steel exports since the last
major change in external value of the iE Sterling. Export prices are quoted
on CIF or FOB basis, as required, and are adjusted to meet competition.
They do not bear any clearly identifiable relationslhip to domestic prices,
though at present they are recognized as being somewhat lower.
36.       In the Common Market area, the price structure is quite flexible.
All principal producers keep the Commission in Brussels informed about their
price schedules, and changes are published monthly by the Secretariat of
the Commission. Prices for principal products are quoted for delivery at
"Basis Points" (e.g. Essen or Oberhausen, Thionville or Dunkeraue, Seraing
or Sidmar). Extras are charged for quality and dimensions. W4hile Basis
Prices change frequently, extras may remain unchanged for several years at
a time. Main producers and distributors practice "price alignmen-'t" to
the extent of 3-5% below published prices, by adjusting their prices to
equal those of competitors from botlh within the Common Market and outside.
At present, however, producers appear determined to avoid indiscriminate
reductions in prices as had been practiced in the years prior to 196B. All
prices are quoted net of turn-over tax, which varies considerably from one
country to another. (Germany - 11%; Belgium - 18%; France - 23%).
37.       Export prices are quoted on CIF or FOB basis, as necessary, to
meet prices offered by other competing suppliers. Major exporters arrange
a special freight rates for bulk shipments and part with the savings to the
extent needed to secure business. Marginal costs of production appear to
play a much more significant role in setting export prices than in domestic
sales. The range of export price fluctuations, which are evidently
unrelated to changes in production costs, as quoted in the Metal Bulletin,



ANNEX 1
Page 13
London and other sources, during the past two years alone, is sufficient
to illustrate the flexibility displayed by major producers in pricing for
export markets (see Table 2).
Comparison of Domestic Steel Prices in Brazil and the European Common Market
38.       In order to compare domestic prices of steel in Brazil and the
European Common market, qualities and dimensions were selected from the
three major products - plate, hot rolled coil/sheet and cold rolled
coil/sheet which account for the bulk of flat products demand in Brazil.
Prices were calculated on the basis of delivery at Sao Paulo, excluding
ITa and IPI (State and Federal taxes), and these were compared with prices
quoted for corresponding qualities and dimensions in the Common Market for
delivery at "Basis Points". Details of the prices for specific qualities
of (i) Plate, (ii) Hot rolled sheet, and (iii) Cold rolled sheet are
at Tables 3-5, and corresponding price extras for variations of size are
at Tables 6-8. It may be noted that prices for plate in Brazil are fairly
competitive with European prices. Price extras for size variations are
somewhat higher in Brazil than in Europe, but the differences are small,
and are related to the limited range of equipment in the Brazilian steel
mills. Prices for Hot rolled sheet are slightly higher than in Europe.
Prices for some deep drawing qualities are lower; but this is understood
to be because of differences in surface finish. Brazil has been exporting
small quantities of hot rolled products to other Latin American countries.
Prices of Cold rolled products in Brazil are markedly higher than in Europe;
and the quality of Extra-deep drawing varieties is also reported to be
somewhat inferior to that of corresponding European products.
Import Prices and Their Impact on Domestic Prices in Brazil
39.       Brazil is at present importing substantial quantities of steel
products and is expected to continue to do so until 1974. Expansion of
domestic capacity would enable it to reduce imports from 1975-79; and it
was considered necessary to assess the impact of this objective on consumers.
Assuming constant domestic prices, at the levels which prevailed in February
1971, the cost of freight, handling, insurance, and finance charge (averaged
for imports from Europe to Brazil) was deducted, to derive a notional FOB
European port price which would be equivalent to the domestic Brazilian
price for domestic output; and this was compared with (a) European domestic
prices, and (b) European export prices.  A sample calculation is at Table
9. It will be noticed that the notional European export prices, which would
deliver steel products in Brazil at Brazilian domestic prices are all
substantially lower than the corresponding quoted domestic prices in the
Common market; but are higher than quoted export prices. It is difficult to
determine the exact magnitude of differences between the notional and actual
export prices because (i) quotations for specific qualities are not readily
available except in response to trade inquires; and (ii) prices fluctuate
considerably. However, it is apparent from the sample data presented, if
such a demonstration is at all necessary, that Brazil can purchase steel in
Europe and ship it to its principal domestic market in the Sao Paulo area



ANNEX 1
Page 14
at costs which are somewhat lower than the sales prices contemplated in
the steel expansion projects. This has also been confirmed by the major
steel importing companies in Brazil. But the price margin is unstable, and
generally less than the prevailing level of import duties (20%).
40.       It appears, however, that the price structure for Brazilian
steel products should be capable of improvements when the projected expansion
plans are completed so that the prices of various products may bear a more
rational relationship to costs of production, and to the price relationships
for different products which exist in other important steel producing
countries. With this object in view, the Bank has compared the cost-price
relationship for the principal categories of products in Brazil. While the
position is different for each of the three main producers there is a
common pattern for all, which shows a wider margin for cold-rolled than for
hot-rolled products, and a greater difference between cold-rolled and hot-
rolled sheet than between cold-rolled and hot-rolled coil (Table 10). There
is perhaps considerable historical justification for these price differences;
but looking to the future, it should be possible to reduce the differences,
by adjusting the prices of cold rolled products, when additional capacity
becomes available.  In that way, the prices of cold-rolled products in
Brazil would also draw closer to the levels that prevail at present in the
European common market, and Brazilian industries which use cold-rolled
steel for their products (automobiles, commercial and domestic utilities,
e.g. refrigerators, washing machines, cooking ranges, etc.) would become
more competitive in domestic and international markets.
41.       In this context, the Bank has had to project average prices for
the major categories of products for domestic sales, for purposes of
project appraisal. The table below indicates the proposals made by the
companies on the basis of existing prices in February 1971, and changes
proposed in respect of prices for cold rolled products of CSN and hot-rolled
sheet as well as cold-rolled products for USIMINAS. COSIPA prices are
presently being reviewed by the Bank.

Export Trade and Prices
42.       In recent years (1967-70) Brazil's exports of flat-rolled steel
products have ranged between 260,000 and 150,000 tons annually. The bulk of
exports have been directed to other Latin American countries - Argentina,
Colombia, Bolivia, Peru; and small quantities have been exported to the
U.S.A. and Europe too. The prices earned for these exports in 1970 were
fairly good. The table below indicates the weighted average price per ton
received by USI?INAS and CSN:

Cold-Rolled Sheet                 143.60              140.00
Galvanized Sheet                    -                 185.00
Tin plate                                             205.00
These prices cover base price plus extras for dimensions and quality
specifications, as also handling and transport to point of shipment.
43.       In the first 6 months of 1971, Brazil exported plate and
some hot- and cold-rolled materials at even better prices. In this context,
the prices realized in 1970 were assumed as the basis for calculating
earnings for exports in the years 1971-80.
44.       It must be noted that the prices obtained by Brazilian exporters
in 1970 and 1971 relate to relatively small quantities sold mainly to Latin
American countries (the main exception being plate exported to the U.S.);
future exports would involve larger quantities spread over markets covering
a wider geographical area. Hence freight costs would be higher, and
competition from other steel exporting countries more severe. The export
prices assumed by USIMINAS and CSN have been compared with published price
data (London Metal Bulletin, Japan Daily) and with information obtained
from major steel exporters in Europe (Thyssen, Hoesch, BSC). Really
accurate comparison was not possible because it has not been possible to
isolate shipping costs in "CIF basis" quotations or to attach a single
value to payment terms which cost a seller much less than they are worth
to a buyer or even to another seller. It has also not been possible to
correctly isolate the "Base Price" for standard dimensions/commercial
quality products from Price Extras for specifications, dimensions, etc.
HIOwever, available data were reviewed with the leading exporters mentioned
above and with importers in Brazil (CSN, Volkswagen and Food Processors
which import tinplate). It appears that prices for exports from Europe
during the first half of 1971 have ranged within the limits indicated in
the table below. Differences in price quotations relate to many individual
reasons, applicable to specific contracts or countries or qualities or
delivery periods.

45.       Comparison of these price ranges with the prices for exports
assumed by UISIMINAS and CSN indicates that while prices for plate, hot-
rolled coil and hot-rolled sheet, galvanized sheets and tin plate are
within the ranges prevalent in export trade, the prices for cold-rolled
coil and cold-rolled sheet are higher.
46.       The Bank has reviewed the average prices proposed by CSN and
USITHINAS for the major categories of products which would be available for
export trade after completion of Stage II of their expansion program, in
the context of prices current in international trade in 1970-71 for the
respective qualities; and has prepared revised estimates of prices which
may be achievable for each category of product. The table below indicates
the comparative position. It will be noted that some reductions have been
suggested for prices for all products except tinplate.

/1   All prices are on FOB basis per ton.
TI   Prices for hot-rolled sheet reflect proposed specifications
for quality and inspection, which should yield the margin
of difference between coil and sheet prices.
/3   Prices for cold-rolled coil and sheet reflect the following
considerations: (i) relatively small quantities are to be
exported., principally to Latin American markets, where Brazil
has an advantage of $5-7/ton on freight; and (ii) exports will
consist of relatively high-quality products.

47.       The net impact of these changes would be quite small for CSN,
which has a very modest export target; and it would be somewhat more for
USIMINAS, which has more ambitious export plans. Details of calculations
of impact in 1976 and 1977 are given at Table 11.
48.       It should be noted, however, that world prices of steel products
can vary considerably in short periods of time. A 6-10 year forecast must
be interpreted as being subject to major changes on account of variations
in international supply and demand conditions as well as exchange rates and
cost trends.

REVIEW OF STEEL DEMAND BY SUB-SECTORS
1.        The prospects of steel consumption in the principal manufacturing
sub-sectors, as reported by Tecnometal, have been reviewed by the Bank
mission in the context of information supplied by the Ministry of Industry
and Commerce, important industry associations and leading industrial
establishments; and revised sub-sectoral projections have been made for the
years 1975, 1977 and 1980. A summary of findings is contained in the
following paragraphs.
2.        It may be mentioned that the Tecnometal forecast for 1972 has
not been revised, as the differences would have been small; and the
proposed expansion of capacity (Stage II) will become available only in
1975.
Sub-Sector No. 1.1
3.        Automotive:  There are eight major producers of motor vehicles
in Brazil, of which VW, Ford, GM and Mercedes Benz are the more important.
Production of motor vehicles increased from 185,000 units in 1965 to 352,000
units in 1969. Unofficial estimates placed production in 1970 at over
400,000. The Tecnometal forecast, based on data supplied by the Association
of Automobile Manufacturers (ANFAVEA) envisages growth of output as
indicated below:
Class of Vehicle                  1972         1975          1980
(i)  Trucks and Buses            65,000       82,000      120,000
(ii)  Station Wagons/Utilities  74,000          76,000      80,000
(iii)  Passenger Cars             340,000      490,000      800,000
TOTAL                     489,000       648,000   1,000,000
4.        The Department for Industrial Development (CDI) forecasts even
more rapid growth, and expects the target of one million vehicles per year
to be achieved in 1977 or 1978. This hope is reflected by some manufacturers
also (VW, GM); but their plans do not yet go beyond 1973-74, and do not
envisage production beyond about 600,000 vehicles.
5.        Even the relatively modest estimates adopted by Tecnometal have
implications which need further studies to underpin them. It appears that
the present total population of motor vehicles in Brazil is about 2.5 million
units, which gives one vehicle for every 37 persons. If annual output
increases to about 650,000 vehicles by 1975 and to 1,000,000 by 1980, the



APPENDIX I
Page   2
population of vehicles will probably increase to 3.5 million vehicles by
1975 and over 5 million in 1980, which will give one vehicle for every 23
persons in the latter year. A very large percentage (over 70%) of all
motor vehicles in Brazil are at present located in the Rio, Guanabara, and
Sao Paulo areas. The rapid growth of vehicle population envisaged raises
questions about (1) the likely pattern of income distribution, (2) regional
dispersal of the upper income groups, and (3) investment in construction
of inter- and intra-city roads that would be required, to permit ownership
and operation of the number of vehicles to be produced.
6.        Correlating motor vehicles demand with other relevant considerations,
e.g. degree of concentration of population, the role of public transport in
urban areas, expected growth of the number of income earners in the category
relevant for motor car ownership, and export possibilities, it appears that
motor vehicle production may not exceed 620,000 units in 1975 and
900,000 units in 1980. These lower figures would reduce the direct demand
for flat-rolled steel products in the automotive industries sub-sector by
about 25,000 tons in 1975 and 77,000 tons in 1980. In addition the demand
for flat-rolled steel products in the automobile parts and components industry
and steel bodies construction industry would be reduced to some extent.
Sub-Sector No. 1.3
7.        Shipbuilding:  This industry is still in a nascent stage in
Brazil and in 1969 consumed only 69,500 tons of steel (mostly plate). The
Government has ambitious plans for development of the industry and would like
to commit shipyards to production of about 1.6 million tons (gross tonnage)
during the next 5 years. However, there are physical limitations to the
capability of shipyards for expansion in the next several years. After
consulting principal shipbuilders regarding their plans up to 1975, Tecnometal
estimated that the demand for steel in this sub-sector would increase as
follows:
Year:                         1972           1975           1980
-------------- TPY _--------------
80,000        207,300       394,800
8.        While it is possible to envisage consumption of about 200,000 tons
of steel for shipbuilding by 1975 in response to the Government program, it
is more difficult to accept the estimate for 1980 in the absence of adequate
plans for achievement of the high growth rate implied (about 14% annual
average). It would, therefore be advisable to review the program as soon
as the first phase of expansion, now envisaged, is completed. The Bank
lias retained the Teonometal demand forecast for this sub-sector in its own
revised estimate.

Sector No. 4
9.        Industrial Machines, Machinery and Equipment.  This sector
includes the demand for oil pipelines and other heavy piping. The Tecnometal
forecast has relied heavily upon the optimism of Government planners, and
the hopes of domestic machinery and equipemnt suppliers for rapid import
substitution over a very wide range of products, to develop the following
forecast of demand for flat products.
1969
Actual       1972      1975       1980
142,000     230,000   340,000   579,000
This estimate implies an average annual growth rate of 18% for the years
1970-72, 13% for the years 1973-75, and 11.5% for the years 1976-80.
10.       The Bank discussed these estimates with leading machinery and equip-
ment manufacturers, with representatives of some of the more important con-
suming industries, and with concerned officers in CDI (Industrial Development
Department); and it appears likely that consumption of steel in this sector
of industries may grow at a slower rate than has been forecast. Revised
figures are suggested below:
Annual                   Annual                   Annual
Growth Rate              Growth Rate              Growth Rate

Sector No. 8
11.       Packings:  The Tecnometal study includes in this sector the
demands for packing of foods, oils, paints and all petroleum based products,
as well as gas cylinders. The growth of demand forecast is as follows:
1969

12.       These forecasts were discussed with a large number of tinplate
and associated packing materials users, and it appears that, in the
context of the current shortage of packing materials in Brazil, future
demand has been overestimated to some extent. Even the more optimistic users
of packing materials could not support the projections. It is also possible
that some quantities of packing materials will continue to be imported for
special purposes, exports, etc. Hence more conservative projections are
suggested, as below:
1975     1977       1980
Tinplate, etc.                        427       505        640
Hot-Rolled Coil and Steel             108       126        158

Total                 623       733        936
13.       A question has been raised as to whether the expansion plans of
CSN should include capacity for production of chromated sheet at some stage
between 1976-80. This question should be examined in due course; and such
flexibility as may be deemed desirable, built into the facilities at the
appropriate stage.
Sub-Sector No. 11.2
14.       Welded Pipes:  The demand forecast for this sub-sector envisages
an annual average growth rate of 11% in the years 1970-75, and over 12% in
the years 1976-80. While industrial capacity for manufacture of welded pipes
would be related to the growth of the housing, water supply and sewerage, and
other pipe using industries/services. Brazil does indeed have an ambitious
plan for the development of housing and water/sewerage systems; but it
appears that the projection of growth of steel demand in this sub-sector
has been overestimated to some extent. Tecnometal expects demand for steel
in this industry to grow to 352,000 tons by 1975 and to 637,000 tons by
1980; but all the available information suggests that demand may not exceed
500,000 tons by 1980; and the projection for 1975 has been scaled down
slightly to 325,000 tons.
15.       A comparative statement showing the full range of demand projections
by Tecnometal and the Bank on sectoral basis is given below:

Review of Macro-economic Projections of Steel Demand
Introduction
1.        Based on a market survey, Tecnometal had arrived at the following
forecast of domestic demand for steel products:
Steel Consumption: Historical (1969) and TECNOMETAL Forecast
(in million of tons)

1980    14.2    15.3       16.0   5.4       5.8       6.2   5.1      5.6        6.0
Source:  Tecnometal, Vol. I:  Annex II, and pages c/83 to c/87.
2.        The upper and lower limits on the sectoral forecasts reported above
were obtained (somewhat arbitrarily) by an inspection of a wide variety of
alternative forecasts developed from historical data. The methodology and
the substance of these forecasts is examined below.
Tecnometal: Data, Variables and Methodology
3.        The basic data consisted of time-series (1948-68/69) an apparent
consumption (in tons) of ingots, flat products, and non-flat products. These
three variables were analyzed with respect to the following explanatory
variables:
(a) "time" (defined as 1957 - 0);
(b) GDP at 1949 prices; and
(c) National Income at 1949 prices, and "Industrialization
Degree". (Industrialization Degree was defined as the
ratio between the (nominal) value of Industrial Output
and GDP as 1949 prices.)
Except for the analysis of trend (regressions on "time") all analysis was
conducted in terms of per-capita values of the dependent and independent
variables.



Appendix II
Page   2
4.        For each of the three consumption variables, four sets of
forecasts were developed from fitting linear, parabolic, exponential, and
adjusted exponential (3-year) moving averages) time-trends to the historical
series. This resulted in twelve (4 x 3) sets of independent forecasts from
an analysis of the trend, irrespective of any macroeconomic considerations.
The macroeconomic analysis consisted of estimating two equations for
ingot consumption with a loglinear specification: (i) a simple regression
on (real) per capita GDP; and (ii) a multiple regression on (real) per
capita National Income and Industrialization Degree. The first was used
to develop three sets of ingot consumption forecasts corresponding to 7%,
8%, and 9% per annum growth in GDP (2.8% per annum growth in population);
and the second equation was used for a fourth forecast with the additional
assumption of 7% per annum growth of National Income and 10% per annum
growth in the Value of Industrial Output.
5.        Tecnometal also regressed flats consumption and nonflats consump-
tion on ingot consumption. They concluded that historically the year to
year change (on a percentage basis) in the consumption of flat products is
13% in excess of the change in consumption of ingots, while nonflats lag
11% behind the corresponding change in ingot consumption. With the aid
of this result they developed three sets of forecasts of flats and non-flats
consumption implied by the following ingot forecasts:
(a) Exponential Trend Forecasts;
(b)  7% GDP (simple regression) forecast; and
(c)  Multiple Regression forecast.
6.        To summarize, the following forecasts were developed:
(a)  Ingots
(i) 4 Trend forecasts - linear, parabolic, exponential
and adjusted exponential;
(ii) 3 Forecasts from simple regression with GDP rates
of growth of 7%, 8%, and 9% per year; and
(iii)  1 Forecast from Multiple Regression.
(b) Flats and Nonflats (each)
(i) 4 Trend forecasts - like A(i);
(ii) 1 Forecast implied by adjusted exponential trend
forecast of ingot consumption - see A(i);



Appendix II
Page   3
(iii) 1 Forecast implied by 7% GDP forecast of ingot
consumption - see A (ii); and
(iv) 1 Forecast implied by A(iii).
Tecnometal: Analysis of Trend
7.        The plausibility of forecasts based on trend-fitting is directly
proportional to the degree of belief in the proposition that steel consumption
grows according to the particular specification (linear, parabolic, etc.)
used, with the passage of time being the sole explanatory variable. This is
clearly an undesirable procedure, but is sometimes used nevertheless by
invoking the ceterus paribus assumption and arguing that it suffices as an
approximation.
8.        With these qualifications, the Tecnometal forecasts on the basis
of linear, parabolic, and exponential trends is reproduced in the Annex.

Source:  Tecnometal, Vol. IV:  pages c/1, c/9 and c/12.
9.        For 1972, the Tecnometal "sectoral" forecast (see para 1) is of the
same order of magnitude as the exponential trend forecast. Thereafter, the
Tecnometal "sectoral" forecasts increasingly exceed the exponential trend.
This implies that the steel-users surveyed by Tecnometal foresee growth in
steel-consumption over the decade in excess of the (very liberal) exponential
specification of growth pattern.



Appendix II

10.       To assess if these anticipations can be realized, it is necessary
to explore the relationship between steel consumption and other indicators
of economic activity; and thus by examining the prospects for economic
growth we may deduce the likely growth in steel-consumption. Tecnometal
has done this only indirectly for finished products.
Tecnometal Macroeconomic Analysis
11.       Tecnometal estimated two equations on which their macroeconomnic
forecasts are based. Using a loglinear specification, they regressed per
capita ingot consumption on: (i) real per capita GDP; and (ii) real per
capita National Income and Industrialization Degree. Forecasts of ingot
consumption based on alternative assumption of GDP growth are as follows:

Source: Tecnometal, Vol IV: pages c/3, c/4,
c/5 and c/8.
12.       The levels of consumption of flats and nonflats  implied by these
ingot forecasts, as derived by Tecnometal, are given in sections IV and V.
13.       In assessing the realiability of these forecasts of ingot consump-
tion, it might be noted that the goodness of fit for both equations is
relatively low - R2 of the order of 0.88. This is partly because the analysis
is conducted in per capita variables - introducing changes in population as
a confounding explanatory factor.  Secondly, the reliability of the multiple
regression equation is extremely questionable due to the use of current
cruzeiro data on the Value of Industrial Output, divided by constant cruzeiro
data on GDP in order to obtain the second explanatory variable, Industriali-
zation Degree.



Appendix II
Page   5
14.       Although, for reasons noted above, Tecnometalts macroeconomic
analysis is not entirely reliable, it might be noted that the forecasts
resulting from the simple regression are all considerably above the exponen-
tial trend forecasts, as well as the "sectoral" forecasts. To get reliable
macroeconomic forecasts, the Bank has conducted further analysis, with
special attention to flat products.
Further lacroeconomic Analysis: Flat Products
15.       From an analysis of Tecnometal and other data the Bank found that
(i) GDP is a much better predictor of steel consumption than National
income; (ii) correlations between steel consumption and macroeconomic
variables are higher when considered by themselves rather than on a per
capita basis; and (iii) due to wide fluctuation in the most recent data, the
series from 1947-69 gives considerably superior fits to those for the
recent decade.
16.       In keeping with these results, the Bank analyzed apparent consumption
of flats vis-a-vis an index of industrial output and real GDP. With a simple
loglinear regression the latter gave a somewhat better fit. Using the GDP
regression the Bank developed three sets of forecasts conditional on alter-
native rates of growth of GDP. Based on discusssions with area department
economists the Bank termed a 6-1/2%, 7-1/2% and 8-1/2% per year GDP growth
rate over the entire decade as "conservative", "probable" and "optimistic"
assumption, respectively. Area economists stressed that the last corres-
ponds to the Government's target rate of growth. The Bank's forecasts,
as well as some of the Tecnonetal forecasts reported above are as follows:

APPENDIX II

17.       Comparing the Bank's macroecnomic forecasts for flats consumption
with that of Tecnometal's it can be seen that the Tecnometal forecast at
7% GDP growth exceeds the Bank's at 8-1/2% GDP growth. As the Bank's fore-
casts are derived directly and give much better fits, this discrepancy may
be explained by Tecnometal's peculiar methodology of using per capita values
and of deriving flats forecast from ingot forecasts.
18.       Tecnometal's "sectoral" forecast corresponds to the Bank's
"optimistic" economic forecasts for all but the last years of the decade.
In comparison to the Bank's "probable" forecast, the Tecnometal sectoral
forecast is increasingly greater.
Conclusions
19.       To the extent that a relationship does exist between GDP and
steel consumption, forecasting steel demand conditional on projected values
of GDP is considerably superior (methodologically) to forecasting from
specific time-trends. In comparison with the Bank's "probable" macroeconomic
forecast, the Tecnometal "sectoral" forecast exhibits an upward bias. To
a great extent this may be explained by the methodological pecularity of
market surveys, which assess business anticipations that are notoriously
high at the upturn if the business cycle and correspondibly low at the
downturn. The Tecnometal forecasts reflect the mood of optimism generated
by the two/three years of boom in the Brazilian economy. (Indeed the Booz,
Allen and Hamilton forecasts of 1966, based on a similar methodology were
biased downwards for similar reason.)

MEMORANDUM OF THE FOUR MINISDRS ON THE BOARD OF
CONSIDER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
January 6, 1971
Ref, EMJNo./8
To the President of the Republic:
1.       The steel sector plays an essential strategic role in the process
of industrial developuent. Its importance is all the greater now that
indastry is attaining high indices of growth, is improving its technological
level and is making decisive inroads on foreign markets. The continuity of
the industrial development program is closely bound up with an adequate and
increasingly large supply of basio raw materials, especially steel, wbich,
in its various forms, is a factor commn to al1 infustrial activity.
2.       The Brazilian steel industry has overcome the financial difficul-
ties that formerly hindered its growth and is prepared to assume the out-
standing role reserved to it in the development process.
3.       Throuh CONSIDER, the National Council of the Steel Indastry,
which you have reorganized and strengthened, we now have the necessary tools
for planning and coordinating the development of the Brazilian steel industry.
4.        Production of steel ingots in 1970 amounted to 5.37 million tons;
consumption was 5.8 million tons. The advisability of keeping at least 10%
of the production for export faces us with a deficit of about 1 million tons
in supplies for the domestic market in 1971, which will be made up by imports.
5.       In 1970 the steel ills worked to capacity and the consumr market
is still growing at a rate of more than 500,000 tons a year. This demDn-
strates the urgency for promoting an increase in supply either by expanding
existing plants or by building new ones.
6.       Pursuant to your instructions and on the basis of studies made by
CONSIDER, we are planning for 1980 a steel industry with a production
capacity of 20 million tons to guarantee full satisfaction of the domestic
market, maintenance of the export rate and the reserve capacity needed to
meet peak demands.
7.       This program represents an increase of installed capacity at an
average rate of 12% per year and will involve investments of about Cr¢15
billion between now and 1980.
8.        The goal in terms of per capita consumption will enable us to pro-
gress from 63 kg in 1970 - less than the average for latin America -- to
125/130 kg in 1980.



ANNEX 2
Pag-e r
9.        The increase in production capacity of flat rolled common steel
was given priority classification by CONSIDER and, pursuant to the instruc-
tions contained in the document "Goals and Bases for Government Action" will
be achieved through expansion of Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN),
Usinas Siderurgicas de Millas Gerais, S.A. (USIINAS) and Companhia Siderargica
Paulista (COSIPA).
10.       Plans for the metallurgical units needed to expand these three
companies are now complete. They include a new blast furnace for each
compary, which, for technological reasons, have been designed to meet the
steel production capacities forecast for 1980; 4 million tons in OSN;, 3.5
million in USNAS and 3.4 million in COSIPA.
11.       Betveen 197; and 1975, under their expansion programs, these com-
panies will mobilize resources to cover fized investments, financial charges
and working eapital on the order of Cr$2,050 million for CSN, Cr$1,500 million
for USIMINA., and Cr$l,950 for COSIPA, a total of Cr$5,500 million.  It is
expected that by 1975 the production of the three companies will be 100%
higher than in 1970.
12.       USIMINAS and COSIPA, which suffered the effects of the heavy
initial investments in relation to production, will be financially rehabili-
tated by consolidation and rescheduling of their debts so as to establish
adequate ratios in the composition of their liabilities.
13.       From 1971 on, mixed econor' steel cotpanies will submit consolidated
balance sheets and adopt standard costing in accordance with studies being
made under CONSIDER's coordination.
14.       The non-flat rolled products sector vill have its production
increased through expansion of existing plants and establishment of new ones
on sound technological, economic and financial bases.
15.       This sector will continue to be in the hands of private enterprise,
which will receive Government support through credit incentives for carrying
out its programs of expansion or construction of new plants and mergers of
companies. The Government may, in order to make feasible the realization of
larger-scale projects, take a minority participation in the capital of private
companies.
16.       Studies carried out by CONSIDER shoved the need for an installed
production capacity for non-flat rolled products of common steel of
4,650,o00 ingot tons by 1975 -- an increase of 2,500,000 tons over present
capacity. Feasibility studies being reviewed by CONSIDER concerning expansion
of existing plants or new units provide for increasing production to the
desired level. By 1980 the capacity for non-flat rolled goods should reach
8 million ingot tons.
17.       By 1975, the special steels sector should expand its capacity by
about 60% to 940,000 ingot tons. The necessary studies are in progress for
production of flat stainless steel, the demand for which is rapidly increasing
as new projects are planned in the chemical and petrochenical industry. Pro-
duction of seamless pipes ia expected to increase by 60% by 1975.

18.       The National Bank for Economic Development (BNDIE) win be the
chief financial agent for the steel sector and :ill receive budgetary con-
tributions from the Federal Government and funds from the National Monetary
Council.
19.       Long-term plaanning of the Brazilian steel industry is based on
basic studies of the market and of technology.
20.       The market study is being conducted under the sponsorship of the
Brazilian Iron and Steel Institute and consists of the seotoral profile of
consunption by consumer regions and States, covering 267 products and 64
consumption sectors and subsectors. This profile, updated annually, and its
projections according to the sectoral goals set by the Government will be
the basic elements for determining the nimber of rolling units of the
expansion program.
21.      For the purpose of defining a policy for development and transfer
of know-how to the steel sector, the National Research Council and CONSIDER,
in collaboration with other government agencies, private enterprises and
steel-making companies, are starting a survey of the principal technological
problems of Brazilian steelmaking and the availability of human and material
resources with whioh to solve them.
22.       The technical and economic feasibility of putting world technological
innovations in steel products and processes to use in Brazil will be analyzed,
with coordination by CONSIDER, in a program sponsored by the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization.
23.       The principle adopted by Resolution No. 19 of the Interministerial
Counoil on Prices assuring the steel industry of an adequate return and
ratios compatible with the investment effort required for its expansion, will
be maintained as a price-policy guide for steel products.
24.      In the field of distribution and marketing of steel products,
improvement of the system is fundamental, according to the rules of CONSIIER
Resolution No. 5, which also aims at the adoption of a similar policy by
private steel companies.
25.      Until the first phase of the expansion programs is completed, the
demand of the domestic market vill exceed the sWpply. The deficits will be
covered by imports that will be coordinated by CONSIDER in the case of semi-
finished and finished products intended for processing or marketing by State
steel companies.
26.      These are the general guidelines of the National Steel Program,
which we have the honor to submit for your consideration.
Respectfunly yours,

ANNEX 3
THE HANDLING OF INFLATION
IN THE PROJECT APFRAISALS
GENERAL
Inflation is particularly important in project appraisal when the
country's inflation is greater than worldwide trends. In each area of
appraisal it is necessary to treat inflation in a consistent manner. For
example, it is essential to add estimated price escalation to capital costs
to ensure that necessary funds are made available but it may not be possible
in the financial projections to assume accurate escalation for selling prices
and input costs for the life of the project. The basic rule should be either
a consistent use of a constant value or a consistent use of inflated values.
It would be inconsistent, for example, to inflate capital costs but to ignore
inflation in prices and input costs for the rate of return calculations.
BRAZIL
Brazil offers an unusual case of high rates of inflation, automatic
adjustments (compulsory revaluation of assets and frequent changes in the
exchange rates), price controls and the wide use of indices. In addition,
the recent changes in the international exchange rates and the generally
recognized need for greater flexibility in the future make forecasting pari-
cularly difficult.
THE COMPANIES
Looking at the three steel companies requesting Bank financing,
specific problems were encountered in showing the financial history in a
consistent manner, taking into account preferential exchange rates for the
purchase of fixed assets, postponement of depreciation, and the charging
of interest to fixed assets after construction. To make inter-company com-
parisons, as well as to make year by year comparisons for each company more
meaningful, it was decided to convert the financial statements into histori-
cal dollars. The companies' forecasts were analyzed and the capital costs
in dollar equivalents were revised taking into account the basis for the
equipment cost estimates (i.e., U.S. prices for CSN and Japanese prices for
USIMINAS and COSIPA). To overcome the problems of cruzeiro inflation combined
with the need to assume future exchange rates as well as worldwide inflation
rates, the Bank and the companies agreed to make forecasts in constant
dollars at February 1971 costs and prices, with exception of the financial
plan which would match the escalated capital costs. The fact that cash
generation would probably escalate in real terms during construction because
of the Brazilian practice of maintaining the ratio of prices to costs caused
a great deal of debate between the two banks on the one hand and the
companies on the other. In the end it was decided that cash generation,
particularly from existing facilities, should be based on 1971 costs and
prices as this was more conservative. Escalated cash generation would mean
less reliance on outside financing in actuality, but for planning purposes



ANINEX 3
Page 2
the Bank felt it was not prudent. The possibility of escalating all costs
and benefits was discarded on the basis that actual (1971) costs and prices
were reasonably related. It was further considered that the benefits would
be real even if they were shared with labor in the form of higher wages or
with consumers in the form of lower prices.
HISTCRICAL
The historical financial statements for the companies have been
presented in the appraisal reports in both cruzeiros and dollars. The basis
for the dollar conversion is shown at the end of this annex. The basic
differences between the two currencies is the value of the fixed assets and
the resultant depreciation. While the cruzeiro cash generation has been the
actual situation, the dollar statements represent a more accurate picture of
the net profit by correcting both the basis and the method of depreciation,
i.e., the historical cost of assets depreciated over a straight line for
about 25 years. The use of historical dollars still has its shortcomings,
such as the elimination of preferential exchange rates which was a financial
benefit to the companies, and the use of cost rather than replacement value
for the assets which makes a comparison between the oldest company (CSN) and
the younger companies (USIMINAS and COSIPA) somewhat misleading. In view of
these prcblems the histories of the companies have been investigated in depth
and the distortions eliminated in describing the financial problems and their
solutions, especially those of USIMINAS and COSIPA which began sales during a
recession, with a high debt burden requiring refinancing by the Government.
PROJECT COSTS
The estimated capital costs for each company were converted to
dollars at February 1971 exchange rates taking into account the recent
changes in international exchange rates for estimates based on costs in
currencies other than dollars or cruzeiros. In those cases 8-10% was added
to allow for the currency realignment. Although estimates are difficult
because of the combination of (a) international competition, (b) a buyers'
market for steel making equipment, and (c) the probable tendency of supplying
countries to offset some of the effect of revaluation, the capital costs
appear realistic. To the revised February 1971 prices a flat 10% was added
for contingencies and 5% per annum added until the estimated disbursement for
funds to allow for price escalation.
FINANCIAL PLANS
The financial plans for the three companies are based on the above
project cost estimates. Internal cash generation was based on February 1971
costs and prices. Equipment (local and foreign) is being financed about 50%
by the Bank and IDB on a joint basis and 50% by bilateral credits. Any over-
run on the Bank/IDB list could be offset by transferring equipment to the
bilateral credits provided the equipment is not to be supplied, after com-
petitive bidding, by Brazilian suppliers. Most of the equipment to be financed



ANNEX 3
Page 3
by the BANK/IDB is composed of items which can be manufactured in Brazil, of
which Brazilian suppliers are expected to win about 50%. The Bank's loan
amount has been increased to match the total estimated cost of these items
after physical and price contingencies were added to give the fullest possible
opportunity for competition to Brazilian suppliers.
RATE OF RETURN
The incremental financial and economic rates of return were calcu-
lated on the basis of February 1971 capital and operating costs and selling
prices,I/ eliminating the price escalation for the capital costs on the theory
that constant values for both costs and benefits were more realistic than a
variety of assumed escalations over the life of the project. Thus, the base
is essentially a projection of 1971. The sensitivity tests indicate the
results of increased costs and reduced benefits which show the return should
be acceptable if in fact inflation rates affect the costs and benefits unevenly
as will undoubtedly be the case. However, it is felt that the base case is the
most realistic way to treat the unforeseeable future.
DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE
By using the escalated capital costs as the basis for the financial
plan the loans have in fact been inflated while the cash generation has not.
In actuality the debt service, which will be fixed in foreign exchange, should
increase in cruzeiros at a slower pace than cash generation. This is due to
the Government1s policy of allowing prices to rise according to inflationary
costs while the exchange rate changes are based on a formula which subtracts
U.S. inflation from Brazilian inflation.
FINANCIAL FORECASTS
The projected ineome statements, sources and applications of funds,
and balance sheets have been based on constant 1971 costs and prices with the
exception of those items which are derived from escalated capital costs, e.g.,
fixed assets, depreciation, and loans. In order to show this inconsistency
the statements have shown the escalation separately. This has been done to
permit the statements to be used for rate of return and other calculations
without escalation and for future reference when the actual statements are
compared with the "constant" dollars.
1/ 1971 selling prices were reduced somewhat for cold-rolled products in
1976 for the financial return. Import prices, for the economic returns,
were based on actual FOB Europe prices in mid 1971, plus freight.

BASIS FCR CONVERTING HISTORICAL STATEMENTS TO DOLLARSi- 
(a) Balance Sheets
Assets
Cash and banks, all current assets except inventories, all long-term
assets except properties for sale and deferred charges - at the year end rate.
Inventories - raw materials, finished products, work in process and
materials in transit - at the year end rate.
Stores - at the year end rate if they have been valued at updated
standard cost, otherwise at the average rate of the year.
Exchange losses have no dollar equivalent.
Deferred charges to be amortized - at historical dollar values. Amorti-
zation is 10% of the dollar value, charged to profit and loss.
Prepaid expenses - at historical dollar value.
Fixed assets - Importations at actual dollar value. Local purchases at
average rate of the year of purchase.
Exchange differences included with cruzeiro fixed assets have no dollar
equivalent.
Revaluations have no dollar equivalent.
Construction in progress, expansion and other constructions - same as
fixed assets.
Depreciation - exclude the provision for relining the Blast Furnace,
included with current liabilities, where it will be translated at the year end
rate.
The provision for depreciation calculated at 4% a year on the annual
dollar balance, starting in the year that production commenced.
Liabilities
All liabilities at the year end rate. The foreign currency liabilities
are automatically adjusted to the year end rate on the cruzeiro statements.
1/   These conversions were prepared by the companies' independent public account-
ants, Price Waterhouse and Company (for USIMINAS and COSIPA) and Boucinhas,
Campos, Coopers and Lybrand (for CSN).



ANNEX
Share Capital
Foreign capital at the effective dollar equivalent. Local capital at
the average rate of the year the money was received. Fixed asset revaluation if
capitalized has no dollar equivalent, hence no effect on share capital in dollars.
Reserves and Surplus
Appropriations of prior earnings at the rate at the end of the previous
year. Reserves relating to revaluations have no dollar value. Reserves for in-
creases in capital resulting from appropriation of current profits have a dollar
equivalent in the same proportion that the increase in cruzeiro reserves have to
the profit of the year. Differences between assets and liabilities after conver-
sions, not accounted for by conversions of share capital or reserves and surplus,
are attributable to gain or loss on conversion.
Provisions
Allowance for doubtful accounts and for social security contributions
are translated at the year end rate. The employees service guarantee fund has
the same dollar value as its corresponding asset.
(b) Profit and Loss Account
All items are translated at the average exchange rate of the year with
the exception of:
(i)   Depreciation is calculated on the dollar value of the fixed assets;
(ii) Amortization calculated at 10% of the original dollar value of
the asset being amortized;
(iii) Prior years' adjustments are calculated at the average rate of
the year to which they refer;
(iv) Allowance for income tax and other provisions at the average rate
for the year;
(v)   Profit or loss on sale of fixed assets, if material is calculated
on the original dollar value of the asset; otherwise, the actual amount received
is translated at the average rate for the year.

BILATERAL FINANCING TaRMS AND CONDITIONS
The following summary of terms and conditions of bilateral credits
is based on the offers submitted to the Brazilian Government by the countries
participating in the financing of the steel expansion program:

NOTES:
1) Each proposal, received by the Brazilian Government from the countries
which are offering credit lines, has indicated that the best offer re-
ceived from other countries will be matched.  It is therefore expected
that (i) the bilateral credits will cover 90% of the expenses incurred
in those countries plus the ocean freight and insurance charges of the
equipment ordered, and (ii) the amortization period will be 12 years,
starting 6 months after commissioning.
2)  Financing of 10% downpayment, which is presently under negotiation,
will be provided by the Brazilian Government, either in the form of
equity or through BNDS or Treasury financing.
3)  Amortization schedule, 12½ years after comisdsioning of the equipment,
is equivalent to a program of 15 year financing, since start-up is
expected on average to take place 3 years after the placing of the order.
4) The interest rate on the bilateral credit including credit insurance
and commissions, is expected to be between 7 percent and 8 percent.

ANNEX 6
BANCO NACIONAL DO DESENVOLVIMENTO ECONOMIC DO BRASIL (BNDE)
GENERAL INFORMATION ABSTRACTED FROM A RECENT IDB REPORT
BNDE was founded by Law No. 1628 on June 20, 1952 as an autonomous
public entity, initially under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance
and since February 1967, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Planning
and General Coordination. BNDE is supervised by the Federal Financial Court.
It is one of the oldest development banks in Latin America with a considerable
operational volume. In June 1971, BNDE was transformed from a public entity
into a corporation, with the Federal Government of Brazil holding all the shares.
The new statutes, however, permit the sale of shares to private investors, al-
though the Federal Government will always retain a majority holding. The new
corporation will remain under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Planning and
General Coordination and under the supervision of the Financial Court.
At present, BNDE finances the development of manufacturing and agri-
cultural industries, transport facilities, research and technology. BNDE also
grants global credits to regional development banks and sometimes acts as
financial agent of the Federal Government in case of loans from foreign govern-
ments to Brazil.
In April 1971, BNDE employed 560 persons of which about 200 were pro-
fessionals. Its equity (capital plus reserves) totalled about US$395.5 million
equivalent on December 31, 1970.
BNDE is primarily financed from domestic sources, such as federal
tax revenues and, since 1968, appropriations from the federal budget and the
monetary reserve system.
Prior to June 1971, BNDE's statutes prohibited the issue of bonds.
According to its new statutes however, BNDE is allowed to issue bonds in Brazil
as well as in foreign countries. Major foreign credits up to December 31, 1970
comprised 4 loans from IDB (US$53 million), 3 loans from IBRD (US$28 million),
4 loans from KfW (Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, Germany) (US$30 million) and 2
loans from Eximbank, USA (US$63 million). BNDE also operated as financial agent
of the Federal Government of Brazil for the following three foreign loans:
(a) Russia (US$100 million), (b) Denmark (Dan. Kr. 21 million), (c) France (Fr.
37.5 million). BNDE's operations over the last three years can be summarized as
follows:
1968        1969         1970
Number of approved credits                         6,794       6,434        8,430

Total Income (Million US$ equivalent)                 65.0        41.0         53.0
Net profit (Million US$ equivalent)_'                 32.0        16.0         28.0
1/ According to the statutes of BNDE no dividends are to be paid.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
The total financial sources for 1970-1973 based on historical data
for 1970 and on the budgets for 1971-1973 established before the change of
the statutes in June 1971 are expected to total:
1970       1971        1972       1973
(actual)  (preliminary) -7proj ec t ed---
Million US$ equivalent         305          397         498        606
The figures may rather be on the low side since the possibility of
additional bond issue did not exist at the time of establishing these budgets.
Between 92 and 94% of the above amounts are expected to be raised
from domestic sources (public sources 57-66%, internal cash generation 27-35%,
and funds from foreign sources 6-8%).
BNDE will participate in the steel expansion program in financing part
of the local currency cost of USIMINAS and COSIPA, whereas CSN will cover its
local currency requirements for the expansion project entirely out of cash genera-
tion and reinvestment of Treasury dividends. The financial plans of USIMINAS and
COSIPA indicate that for the ongoing Stage I expansion and for the Stage II
expansion which the Bank has been requested to help finance, BNDE funds will be
required. Moreover, BNDE as majority shareholder of IJSIIMINAS and COSIPA, will
have to make funds available for capital increases in both companies. These
funds will partly be used for the companies' repayment of their debts to BNDE
and partly to finance the expansion projects. BNDE funds for loans and capital
increases during the 1970-1975 period are expected to be in the order of:

1/ COSIPA will repay debts to BNDE of the whole amount, while USIMINAS
will cancel debts to BNDE of US$38 million equivalent.  Therefore
the net total of requirements during 1971 is reduced to about US$54 million.
The above net requirements for BNDE's participation in the financing
of the steel expansion program during 1970-1973 represents between 7% and 14% of
the total budgeted financial sources of BNDE. Considering the high priority
given to the steel expansion projects by the Brazilian government, sufficient
funds are available.

The scope of work of the consultant would include the following:
(a)   In collaboration with the Companies, work up a format for con-
struction progress reports, which will meet the Banks' requirements and ensure
that they are prepared properly and on a comparable basis;
(b)   Provide an independent assessment of progress, partly by gene-
ral observation and partly by selective sampling of the inputs which go into
the Companies' reports;
(c)   With the Companies, monitor quotations received for civil engi-
neering and erection work and assess whether they provide evidence that the
resources of the local construction industry are being overtaxed;
(d)   Ensure that the Companies update their capital cost estimates
consistently and on the basis of the latest information available to them;
(e)   Ensure that the Copanies monitor actual versus forecast disburse-
ments and periodically update their disbursement forecasts;
(f)   With the Companies, review the allocation of equipment into the
Banks' list on the one hand and the bilateral list on the other in the light of
actual contract prices and recommend the necessary adjustments;
(g)   With the Companies, review bidding procedures and, as appro-
priate, make recommendations as to how they might be optimized;
(h)   Provide a channel whereby information on the construction aspects
of the projects may be exchanged between the Companies at a working level;
(i)   Provide data for the identification of future problems and make
recommendations for action, preventive or otherwise.
NOTE:   The terms of reference for the coordinating consultant will be finalized
after consultation with IDB and CONSIDER.
