PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Second Minas
Gerais Water Supply and Sewerage Project for which Loan 1309-BR was
approved in July 1976 for the sum of US$40.0 million. The Loan was
closed in April 1982; there were no cancellations.
The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean Projects
Department on the basis of the findings of a September 1983 mission,
information contained in the Beneficiary's (COPASA) Completion Report
and documents in regional files. The Borrower (BNH) and the Beneficiary
were most helpful in providing information.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project per-
formance audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the PCR were
sent to COPASA, BNH, and the Government for their comments. Comments
which were received are in agreement with the report's findings and
are reproduced in Annex IX.

SECOND MINAS GERAIS WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.          The project was designed to finance a time slice of COPASA's
investmeat program for 1977-1980. Its main objective was to provide waLer
services to about 640,000 inhabitants of mostly medium and small-size
cities and sewerage services to about 400,000 inhabitants in the area of
Belo Horizonte (para. 1.01).
2.        The project, as implemented, was substantially differenL from the
project as appraised.  In 1980, the Serra Azul System (para. 3.04) became
the main project component.   As a result, works in metropolitan Belo
Horizonte represented a much larger share of the project cost than expected
at appraisal; the total cost of the program was substantially increased;
and Bank financing amounted to 5% of the program, instead of 13X envisaged
at appraisal (para. 3.07).
3.         The number of project beneficiaries surpassed appraisal expect-
ations. The project, in 1982, provided water to about 1.6 million addi-
tional inhabitants of whom 284,000 live in small communities aud 369,000 in
medium-sized cities. The inclusion in the project of the Serra Azul System
was instrumental in achieving the better than expected performance. Addi-
Lional populaLion benefiLting from sewerage services totalled about 640,000
inhabiLants  (paras. 3.04, 7.02 and 8.02).
4.         The substantial change in the size and scope of the project re-
flects weaknesses in the planning capabiliLy of COPASA, mainly due to
shifts in priorities thaL accompany changes in COPASA's authorities.
Because of Lhese deficiencies, the project completioa report suggests that
a standard project approach rather than time slice financing, would have
been more advisable (OED Note: See also COPASA comment, page 2, Attach-
ment 1, Annex IX).
5.        COPASA's ficancial performance, alLhough below appraisal targets,
was adequate. During 1976-1979, COPASA experienced a shortfall of 31X of
revenues in meeting Lhe revenue covenant.  In 1980 the cash shortfall re-
presented 14% of revenues. COPASA complied in 1981 and subsLantially com-
plied in 1982 wiLh the less sLringenL revised revenue covenanL introduced
after Lhe approval of the National Tariff Law (para. 5.01).
6.        The projecL, as parL of the Bank's involvement to support the im-
plemeatation of PLANASA, contributed to help BNH to evolve from iLs orig-
inal role of a financial intermediary to thaL of a truly sectoral agency.
During project implemenLtation BNH increased iLS parLicipation in all the
sLages of the projecL cycle, becoming more efficient in promoting sector
development (paras. 9.03 and 9.04).

SECOND MINAS GERAIS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Project objectives were to support achievement of PLANASA's goals
in the State of Mlinas Gerais by extending water services to an estimated
500,000 inhabitants, upgrading the quantity and/or quality of water
supplied to a population of 140,000, and providing sewerage to 400,000
inhabitants.  The project included works in the Belo Borizonte Metropolitan
Area, 38 medium-size cities aad 63 small communities. The project area is
the second most heavily industrialized region in Brazil.
The Sectorl/
1.02        Expansion of urban infrastructure in the 1960s, particularly
water supply and sewerage, did not keep pace with Brazil's overall develop-
ment. In 1967, the Banco Nacional da Habitacao (BNK), created the Sistema
Financeiro de Saneamento to address existing sector institutional and
financial constraints.   This action led to the launching in 1971 of the
National  Sanitation  Plan  (PLANASA).    PLANASA  encompasses  the design,
financing, construction and operation of water supply and sewerage systems
and Lhe training of sector personnel.   Under PLANASA, basic sanitation
increased impressively in the 1970s.  The total population connected to
water sysLems increased from 28 million people in 1970 to 59 million people
in 1980.  The population connected to sewerage increased from 10 million
people in 1971 Lo 28 million people in 1980.  By 1980 the urban population
served with public water supply and sewerage services was 74% and 34%,
respectively, compared to the PLANASA target of 80% and 50%.
The Borrower and the Executing Agency
1.03      The National Housing Bank (BNH), the Borrower, was established in
1964.  It is an administratively and financially independent Government-
owned Bank.  ILS lending activities are concentrated in low-cost housing,
urban development and sanitation.
1.04      The executiLng agency for the project was the Sanitation Company
of Minas Gerais (COPASA). COPASA is owned by the State. It is headquart-
ered in Belo Horizonte, the State Capital. COPASA's Board of Directors is

appointed by the State Governor for a period of four years.  Apart from the
President, who is the Chief Executive Officer, each Director is the head of
one of the operating departments. COPASA's organizatioa underwent several
changes to adapt the company to the dramatic growth it experienced during
the 1970s. The last major restructuring took place in 1976, when simpler
and clearer lines of responsibility were instituted. It is now one of the
best organized SWCs in Brazil.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preappraisal and Appraisal
2.01       In early 1975, Brazilian authorities and the Rank held discus-
sions on further Bank participation in support of PLANASA.  It was agreed
that it would   be desirable to consolidate advances made in the sector
under a previous Bank loan to COPASA,2/ rather than to invest in other
areas of the country. The project, as the second phase (1976-1979) of the
project financed under the first loan, was to complete water supply systems
for 2.3 million people and sewerage for 1.3 million.  The project was to
extend COPASA's activities to a large number of small and medium-sized com-
munities.
2.02      Considerable attention was given during preparation and appraisal
to:
(a)   The financial situation of the Beneficiary:  During the implemen-
tation of the First Minas Gerais Water Supply and Sewerage
Project, COPASA did not comply with the Bank's financial coven-
ant.  The Bank felt that the inclusion in this project of ser-
vices to small communities generating low or negative financial
rates of return would further endanger COPASA's recovery.
Measures to increase revenues through realistic tariff levels
were discussed with the Bank and agreed during negotiations.
COPASA also agreed to develop an intensive program to reduce
costs, including reduction of unaccounted-for water, trausport-
at-on expenditures, overtime payments aud other operating and
administrative costs.
(b)   Subproject selection criteria:   Experience under the first Loan
indicated that use of the internal financial rate of return
(IFRR) cutoff in small, low-iacome communities, where investment
per capita is high, excluded many subprojects, thereby under-
mining the objective of providing water supply to consumers who
could not afford Lhe full cost of water service. More responsive
selection criteria were thoroughly discussed during project
preparation and agreed during negotiations (Annex I).

Negotiations
2.03       Negotiations were held in Rlo de Janeiro ln early May 1976.  Two
issues received particular attentioa: subproject selection criteria
(para. 2.02) and procuremeat procedures.  Brazilian authorities felt that
the procurement procedures under Loan 1009-BR, which called for prior Bank
review of procuremeat documents aad contract awards of more than US$1.2
million, were uaduly cumbersome. The Bank agreed to raise the limit for
ex-post facto review Lo US$4.0 million.
2.04      Key covenants agreed at negotiations are described in Annex II.
Project Description and Objectives
2.05        The project was designed to flnance a time slice of COPASA's
investmeut program for the period 1977-1980 and provided the flexibility
to delete and add subprojects. The project, as described in the Appraisal
Report, comprised:
(a)   a pilot program to supply water to about 63 small communities
(populatlon up Lo 5,000 inhabitants) and help develop standards
for the preparatlon, executlon of water works and operation of
waLer systems;
(b)   constructLoU or expansion of waLer systems in about 38 medium-
size cilties (populations of up to 150,000 lnhabitants); and
(c)   water supply and sewerage works In the Belo Horizonte Metropol-
itan Area, complementary to, but distinct from those financed
under Loan 1009-BR.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and SLart-up
3.01       The projecL was presenLed Lo the Board on July 6, 1976, and the
Loan was signed on August 27, 1976.  The Loan was Lo become effecLive on
November 30,  1976.   Because of delays by Lhe Brazilian authorities in
registering the Loan documeuLs, the Loan became effective on January 18,
1977. The projecL was to be compleLed by June 1980, and the closing date
was seL aL September 30, 1980.
3.02        Final engineering desigus for Lhe water distribution system in
Belo Horizonte and 29 waLer supply systems in medium-size cities were well
advauced, permitting implementaLion Lo begin immediately after effective-
ness.   The  Loan  included US$1.0 million of retroactive  financing for
expenditures incurred before Lhe signing of the Loan Agreement.



-4-
Implementation Schedule
3.03      The project waS completed about two years later than estimated at
appraisal. The delay was principally the result of: (a) a 20% reduction
in investments in 1977 in response to requests from the Fedural Government;
(b) the failure of COPASA's guarantor (Banco de Desenvolvimento de Minas
Gerais) to provide BNH with the proper guarantee for financing new projects
(the State Government provided the necessary guarantee in early 1980); and
(c) the need to divert funds to the rehabilitation of systems damaged dur-
ing the 1979, 1980 and 1981 floods.
3.04        Because of weak planning, priorities changed during the early
stages of implementation, and the program was substantially revised. The
urgent need to expand water sources for metropolitan Belo Horizonte led to
the addition of the Serra Azul System (construction of a dam and an 80 mil-
lion m3 reservoir) to the project.   This system became the main project
component.   Small comunities benefitting from the project increased from
63 at appraisal to 175 (Annex III).   Twenty-nine of the 38 medium-size
cities selected at appraisal benefitted from the project; the remaining
nine were replaced by other cities (Annexes IV and IX).
Reporting
3.05      COPASA adequately fulfilled reporting requirements, furnishing to
the Bank technical and contractual documents and auditors' and progress
reports in a timely fashion.
Procurement
3.06      During project execution, BNH took increasing responsibility for
procurement, but continued to delegate most procurement matters to its
technical consultant (OT) and to COPASA.  In 1981, procedures were estab-
lished through the Multistate Loan (1970-BR) to increase BNH involvement in
procurement. BNH issued procurement guidelines, consistent with those of
the Bank, detailing the participation of BNH and the Bank in supervising
the procurement process at all stages of project preparation and execu-
tion. Loan Agreements for all sector projects were amended in accordance
with the guidelines at the end of 1981.   Bank participation has been
reduced to ex-post review of selected procurement documents (Annex IX).
Costs
3.07         The appraisal report presentation of only aggregated project
costs precludes a detailed analysis of changes in the relative weight of
each project component during project execution.   From the qualitative
analysis in the appraisal report and the actual cost distribution (Annex
V), it can be concluded that works in metropolitan Belo 1Rorizonte repre-
sented a much larger share of the project cost than expected at appraisal.



Because of the substantial changes in project design, it is not possible to
estimate the cost overruns or underrucs. The appraisal envisaged a 1975-
1979 investment program of US$298.0 million with Bank financing amDuating
to 13%.  The investment program carried out during the period 1975-1982
amounted to US$752.0 million, of vhich the Bank financed about 5%.
3.08       A comparison of appraisal and actual costs per capita for water
supply works is presented below:

The substactially lower-than-expected per capita cost is attributable to:
(a) underestimatior at appraisal of the population to be served by the
project; (b) increase of the number of small communities with low-cost
extension works; (c) economies of scale derived from the inclusion in the
project of the Serra Azul system;   and (d) devaluation of the cruzeiro
which reduced the dollar cost of the project.
Disbursements
3.09      The origical closing date of September 30, 1980, was extended to
SepLember 30, 1982. The Loan was fully disbursed by April 1982. The Bank
reimbursed BNH for paymenLs to local contractors acd suppliers against
certificates of expenditures. This procedure has worked satisfactorily and
continues to be used in most water supply loans to BNH.  CO  October 13,
1978, the Loac Agreement was amended Lo permit disbursement of Loan funds
to finance water supply projects in small communities under BNH's FINEST II
and III lines of credit (Annex VI).

Major factors contributing to the slow pace of disbursements, in addition
to the delays in project execution menticaed in para. 3.03, were:
(a)   delays in the presentation of subprojects to the Back caused by
revisions of tecbnical documents to comply with the agreed selec-
tion criteria; and
(b)   a  substaatial  devaluation  of  the  cruzelro  during  project
implementation, which reduced project costs in terms of dollars.
Disbursements accelerated in 1981 as a result of the inclusion in the
project of the Serra Azul System and of the new procurement procedures
(para. 3.06).
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.11      COPASA used consultants to prepare feasibility studies and final
des gns and to supervise construction of major subprojects. Their work was
satisfactory, except that costs were very often underestimated. COPASA bad
no significant problems with contractors and suppliers.
P.rformance of the Beneficiary and the Borrower
3.12      At the outset, COPASA prepared iacomplete terms of reference and
did not adequately supervise the consultants' final design work. After the
OT and BNH's regional office intervened improvements were male. BNH aad
COPASA do not have the capability to review costs estimates prepared by
coasultants or to estiuate costs for planned projects. BNH is addressing
the problem through a technical assistance program being finsnced under
Loan 1970-BR.  In the case of small communities, COPASA has successfully
developed standards that pay adequate attention to the adoption of least-
cost solutions.



-7-
3.13         COPASA's performance in executing works was extremely satis-
factory, considering the large number of subprojects and quantity of
works. COPASA adequately carried out the supervision of construction for
which it was responsible.
3.14       During the early stages of the project, BNH participated on a
limited basis in preparation and supervision but left most procurement
responsibilities to COPASA.   Because of the slow pace of disbursements
under Bank-financed projects, BNH began in 1981 to participate more
actively in all phases of the project cycle. This increased role, achieved
in part through decentralization to BNH regional offices, especially
benefitted project preparation.
3.15      During project execution the channels for exchange of information
among COPASA, BNH and the Bank were improved, fostered by the Bank's
insistence on a clear definition of each party's responsibilities.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01         The table below provides a summary of COPASA's expected and
actual operating performance:

The 1979 appraisal target of 210 million m3/year in water sales was
achieved in 1980. Increased production and sales volumes were attained in
1982 as a resuit of the inclusion in the project of the Serra Azul System
(para. 3.04).
4.02      Data on COPASA's unaccounted-for water are not reliable, but the
available figures suggest that there was little improvement during project
implementation.   The project provided funds for the acquisition of water
meters, but meters supplied were not sufficient to keep pace with tne
increase in new connections. In late 1982, BNM gave first priority to the
unaccounted-for water problem. BL1H provides the SWCs financial assistance
to develop programs to reduce unaccounted-for water and conditions its
loans on the existence of such programs. COPASA is currently developing a
program to reduce unaccounted-for water.   Results of pilot projects have
been impressive (Annex IX).



V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      The original financial covenant required COPASA to generate suf-
ficient funds to cover operatiag costs, debt service, alscellaneous cash
outflows, working capital increases and a cash reserve equal to 1Z of the
value of gross fixed assets.  The covenant was amended in December 1981
following the enactmezt of the National Tariff Law (NTL). The NTL requires
that beginning in 1983, revenues are to be sufficient to cover operating
costs and depreciation and provide a rate of return on operating invest-
ments whlch will generate as a minimum the cash equivalent of full debt
service. The NTL provided for a program of gradual compliance in 1981 and
1982.
5.02      A comparison of COPASA's actual fiancial results and the revenue
covenant targets is summarized below. COPASA's actual and projected finan-
cial statements are presented in Annex VII.

1/ SAR contains projections for 1976-79 only.
5.03      During 1976-79, COPASA's financial performance was below apprai-
sal targets. COPASA fell UPC 2.7 million (31% of revenues) short of meet-
ing the revenue covenant.   Revenues were 262 below appraisal estimates
because: (a) volume of water sold was 16% lower than the appraisal targets;
(b) water tariffs In UPCs were 6% below appraisal estimates; (c) the
increase in sewerage connections had not yet materialized; and (d) the
sewage tariff increased to 70% of water billed rather than to 80% as fore-
casted at appralsal.   Operating costs were 4% below appraised targets;



however, with lower sales volume, unit operating costs increased by 14X.
The increase was caused mainly by:
(a)   incorporation in COPASA of a great number of small communities.
The diseconomies of scale generated by these communities were to
have been offset by the large cities expected to join COPASA, but
only one major city joined COPASA in 1975-1982;
(b)   substantial increases in the real cost of inputs such as elec-
tricity caused by a reduction in subsidies; and
(c)   increases in administrative costs resulting from hiring staff for
political reasons, rather than operating needs.
5.04       COPASA's financial performance, although still not satisfactory,
improved in 1980: the cash shortfall as measured by the revenue covenant
dropped to UPC 0.6 million or 142 of revenues.   Tn 1981 COPASA complied
with the less stringent revised revenue covenant and substantially complied
in 1982.  During these two years, (a) water sales volume increased by 11%
p.a.; (b) sewerage connections increased by 18% p.a.; (c) real-term
tariff increases were granted; and (d) the sewage tariff was increased to
1OOZ of water billed. Costs escalated during the same period because of
(a) hi-her real costs of inputs, particularly energy and chemicals; (b)
continued incorporation of small communities in COPASA's operations (para.
5.03); (c) underutilized capacity of the Serra Azul System (para. 7.05);
and (d) an increase in staff in 1982 (Annex IX).
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01      COPASA's Board of Directors and management changed several times
following changes in the state government.   This lack of continuity was
detrimental to the planning process as the Company's objectives and prior-
ities were constantly changed. Investment decisions were made on an ad-hoc
basis. The latest change in the top management took place in March 1983.
The new management has revised COPASA's organization only slightly.
6.02       COPASA's new management is giving priority to improving informa-
tion and planning systems.   State regulations require all State-owned
companies to use the State-owned data processing center.   The present
arrangement is not satisfactory. The State data processing center is not
always responsive to users' needs and is costly. The State Government has
not yet agreed to COPASA's repeated requests for an independent computer
facility.
6.03       Inadequate  data processing capacity also affects COPASA's plan-
ning efforts.   The company generates valuable information that could be
used, inter alia, to improve cost estimates and demand projections but
because of the limited capacity to process and analyze available data, past
experiences are not fully utilized in planning. BNH is currently reviewing
the data processing requirements of all SWCs to develop more efficient and
cost effective computing activities (Annex IX).

VII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RE-EVALUATION
Project Achievements
7.01       Project objectives to increase access by residents of small com-
munities and low-income areas of larger cities have been met. Water supply
service levels In the small commuxities included in the project increased
from an average of 51% in 1975 to 83Z in 1982.  Service levels in the
medium-sized and large cities increased from an average of 46% in 1975 to
79% in 1982.   The 80% target set under PLANASA was thus substantially
achieved because of the project.
7.02       Total population benefitting from water supplied by the project
at mid-1983 was about 1.6 million new consumers of whom 284,000 live in 175
small communities (63 estimated at appraisal) and 369,000 in 38 medium-
sized cities (same number of communities as estimated at appraisal).  By
1990, the project is expected to benefit a total population of 2.0 million,
as compared to the 550,000 new consumers and 140,000 existing consumers
with upgraded services estimated at appraisal. By 1982, 650,000 inhabit-
ants were served by the project's sewerage works compared to 400,000
appraisal estimated beneficiaries.
7.03      At appraisal, specific targets were not established for the prop-
ortion of urban low-income families in the beneficiaries of water servi-
ces.   Sufficient data were not available at completion to evaluate the
impact of the project on the poor. But as 54% of the families in the urban
areas of Minas Gerais are classified as poor aad as water supply invest-
ments under the project were emphasized In such areas, considering the
increase In service levels (para. 7.01), it is probab'le that a large major-
ity of project beneficiaries were poor.
Economic Rate of Return
7.04      Because of the flexibility of the investment program and because
the subprojects were at various stages of preparation, an economic rate of
return (ERR) for the project was not calculated at appraisal. The apprai-
sal report however, pointed out that subprojects accepted for financing
under Loan 1009-BR had ERRs averaging 8% (2% higher than COPASA's cost of
capital).   Weighted average ERRs of groups of completed subprojects were
calculated after completion for purposes of illustration and comparison.
7.05       The ERRs estimated at completion were based on actual invest-
ment, incremental operating and maintenance costs, and incremental revenues
from tariffs, all adjusted to mid-1982 prices.   For the calculation of
economic costs, labor was shadow priced at 0.7 of its market price3/.
Results (Annex VIII) show an overall rate of return of 3%. This low return
results from the fact that demand has not grown as rapidly as expected from
the Serra Azul system. In addition, Loan 1009-BR emphasized subprojects in
areas of Belo Horizonte where profitable operations could be expected, but
the project under review emphasized services to low-income beneficiaries
of the lowest tariff bracket which reduces the benefits expected by
3/ Based ou currenL Bank estimates.

the company from those operations. COPASA's tariff structure is based on
cross subsidies from higher income consumers to the poor and from Belo
Horizonte to small and medium-sized communities (for the former, revenues
are not expected to cover operating costs, while for the latter, the ERR is
estimated at only 1%).   Finally, the Serra Azul System experienced a 96Z
cost overrun, reducing its ERR from 12% to 3.5x. COPASA estimates that 32Z
of the cost increase was caused by price variations in the costs of civil
works in Belo Horizonte not fully reflected in the ORTN index used in
tariff calculations; 28% of the cost increase was the result of under-
estimation of costs during project preparation; and the remainder stemmed
from the inclusion of works not contemplated in the original subproject
design.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01      During the early stages of project execution, measures were taken
to correct the shortcomings in project preparation, execution and super-
vision identififed under Loan 1009-BR. During project execution, the Bank
was instrumental in helping BNH to evolve from its limited role as a finan-
cial intermediary to that of an active participant in all stages of the
project cycle. The Bank also assisted in the design of the National Tariff
Law, which, inter alia, provides for the financial viability of the SWCs.
8.02       The substantial change in the scope of the project and the slow
rate of disbursements until the inclusion of the Serra Azul System suggest
that appraisal might have been premature or that the Bank was overly
optimistic about COPASA's project planning and preparation capabilities
(Annex IX).
IX. CONCLUSIONS 4/
9.01         The project was successful in expanding water and sewerage
services in the State of Minas Gerais.   Because of higher than expected
costs and overestimated demand, the ERR of the major project component, the
Serra Azul Svscem, is below expectations.
9.02        The major lesson to be learned from the project is related to
project conception and design.   The beneficiary's weaknesses in planning
suggest that a standard project would have been preferable to the time
slice approach finally adopted.   The substantial differences between the
project as appraised and the project as implemented point both to inade-
quate planning on the part of COPASA and to probable premature project
appraisal on the part of the Bank.
9.03     The project developed in COPASA and BNH a deeper understanding of
the problems of extending water services to small communities.   In the
process BUH developed the flexibility to adapt system designs to local
needs. This experience is being used in similar endeavors by other SWCs.
9.04       The project shows the benefits of long-term Bank involvement in
the sector, where institution building cannot be achieved in the framework
of one Bank loan. BNH began to develop as a true sector agency under this
project. Subsequent Bank Loans were of the multistate and sectoral type.

Subproject Selection Criteria
A.        Preparation
Whea preparing relatorios and projetos tecnlcoo for subprojects,
COPASA will follow its own and the Borrower's guidelines in effect on the
date of this Agreement and the provisions of this Schedule.
1. Least Cost Solution
For each subproject, the alternative to be selected among dif-
ferent technical alternatives will be that with the lowest
present value of incremental capital investments and operational
expenses during the selected design period, discounted at a rate
equal to the cost of funds to COPASA.
2. Basic Considerations
(i)   The Borrower and COPASA will continue to use common basic
parameters for establishing technical, economic and finan-
cial data.
(ii) Standard module designs will be used for treatment plants,
pumping stations and storage tanks in order to facilitate
design of a large number of systems and their future
ealargements.
(iii)   Special design standards satisfactory  to the Bank,  the
Borrower and COPASA will be used for communities with a
population of less than 3,000 inhabitants.
3. Technical Considerations
(i)   Topographic plans at an adequate scale will be prepared for
the presentation of the relatorios and projetos tecnicos.
(ii)   Soil condition studies will be made for the installation of
pipes.

Page 2 of 4
(iii)   Foundations of main structures, such as treatment plants
and storage tanks, will be designed according to actual
subsoil conditions of the selected site as evaluated by the
necessary technical studies.
(iv)   For the standardization of modular designs mentioned in 2
(ii) above, special economic studies will be made, com-
paring technical specifications and costs for investment,
maintenance,   operation   and   installation,   among   the
different alternatives.
4. Subproject Cost Estimates and Financial Projections
The relatorio and the projeto tecnico for each subproject will
include cost estimates and projections prepared and presented
purslant to methods satisfactory to the Bank, the Borrower end
COPASA.
B.        Appraisal and Eligibility Criteria
The following criteria will be used to appraise and select sub-
projects to be carried out by COPASA and to be financed by the Borrower by
means of BNH loans:
1. The following test will be used to determine whether or not a
water supply subproject is eligible to be included in the Project; pro-
vided, however, that if the subproject consists of the improvement of part,
or extension, of an existing system, the test will be applied to the entire
system that includes the subproject.
(i) Communities with more than 20,000 inhabitants:
Subprojects will be eligible if their cash flow, or the
cash flow of the system of which they form part, as the
case may be, for the five year period counted either from
the date of the first repayment of principal of the BNH
loan, or three years after the start of constructioa,
whichever is earlier, is positive;   and provided that if
during any one or more of such years such cash flow is
negative, the construction of the proposed subproject would
not cause the cash flow of COPASA for such year or years to
fall below that required pursuant to Section 4.06 of this
Agreement.

(ii)   Communities with populations  between  3,000 and  20,000
inhabitants:
Subprojects will be eligible if the average unit cost of
the services (cubic meter of water produced) to be provided
by the sub-project or the system, as the case may be, does
not exceed by more than 40% the then current average unit
cost of COPASA, provided that the construction of the
proposed subproject would not cause the cash flow of COPASA
during any one or more of the five years counted either
from the date of the first repayment of princ:tpal of che
BNH loan, or three years after the start of constructiou,
whichever is earlier, to fall below that required pursuant
to Section 4.06 of this Agreement.
(iii) Communities with less than 3,000 inhabitants:
Subprojects designed in accordance with paragraph A hereof
will be eligible to be included in the Project if the
construction of the proposed subproject would not cause the
cash flow of COPASA during any one or more of the five
years counted either frem the date of the first repayment
of principal of the BNH loan, or three years after the
start of construction, whichever is earlier, to fall below
that required pursuant to Section 4.06 of this Agreement.
2. The financial incremental rate of return will be calculated
=c all water supply subprojects to be constructed in communities
wich 3,000 inhabitants or more, provided that if the subproject
forms parL of a system, such calculation will be made for such
system.
Subprojects with a financial rate of return lower than the cost
of funds Lo COPASA will be further reviewed, especially to
determine whether it is practicable to redesign the subproject so
as to lower its cost to the extent necessary to meet such test,
and they will be rejected if, after such redesign, the eutire
system of which the subproject would form part does not meet the
tests set forth in paragraph 1 above.
3. Sewerage subprojects desigaed in accordance with paragraph A
hereof will be eligible to be included in the Project if the
construction of the proposed subproject would not cause the cash
flow of COPASA during any one or more of the five years counted
from the start of construction to fall below that required
pursuant to Section 4.06 of this Agreement.

4.  For purposes of this paragraph B, the following terms have
the following meanings:
(a)   Cash flow  means the comparison between the aggregate
of all revenues obtained by a system or subproject, as the case
may be, during a 30-year period, and the aggregate of all oper-
aLing expenses and payments to be made on account of debt service
in respect of such system or sub-project, during such period;
and the cash flow will be regarded as positive if such revenues
exceed such expenses and payments.
(b)   Financial incremental rate of return" means the dis-
count rate equalizing the stream of revenues provided by the sub-
project (incremental revenues), excluding the Quota de Previden-
cia Social, and the stream of capital (investment costs) and
operating, maintenance and administrative costs (incremeatal
costs), over the life of the subproject, sucn incremental
revenues and costs to be evaluated in accordance wlth the provi-
sions of paragraph A hereof; provided, however, that in computing
the financial incremental rate of return, municipal grants for
any subprojecL in towns with less than 20,000 inhabitants may be
considered as user contributions.
(c) Average unit cost of the services- of a system (where a
subproject will be built) means the present value of the stream
of cash outflows (operating, maintenance, and administrative
costs plus debL service payments), divided by an amount equal to
Lhe quantiLy of water produced by the system and metered
(expressed in cubic meters) during the life of the subproject,
discounted by a factor equal to the cost of funds to COPASA.
Cd) "CurrenL average uniL cost of COPASA- means total estim-
aLed COPASA cash out-flows (operating, maintenance, and adminis-
Lrative costs, plus debt service payments) in the year the sub-
project is approved, divided by Lhe total volume of water
produced by COPASA during the same year.

Subject: Comments on Project Report on Brazil: Second Minas Gerais Water
Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 1309-BR).
Dear Mr. Watanabe:
We are pleased to forward the comments requested in your letter of
November 12, 1984 on the Project Completion Report on Loan 1309-BR.
The report was carefully reviewed by the technical staff of
COPASA MG, coordinated by the Planning Advisory Office, and we have made
certain observations which will confirm the results of the analysis made by
the Bank.
We would like to take this opportunity to record our appreciation of
the valuable contribution made by the World Bank, especially the missions that
visited COPASA MG led by Mr. Emilio Rodrigues, who is so well versed in the
problems of our region. Indeed, these recommendations are regarded by the
management of this company as of the greatest importance for the achievement
of our future plans and for our relationship with the World Bank and BNH.
As usual we are sending copies of these comments to the Ministry of
Planning/SUBIN, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the
National Housing Bank and the Secretariat of Public Works in the State of
Minas Gerais; subsequently we will send you a copy in English.
We are at your disposal for any other information that you may need.
Yours etc.
(signed) Marco Antonio Guimaraes lonteiro
Chairman

This should be changed to read:  Average of Years 1975/82.             Changes made
on pg. tii
page (iv)
ITEM 4:   It should be noted that the changes in priorities were a consequence
of the company's own position as a result of its meeting requests
from the interior of the state, especially from cities of medium
size and small communities. The company's planning capability can
and must be improved through more appropriate administrative
procedures, better processing of technical data and improved
programming and control. The allocation of financing to specific
projects will be a function of the company's capacity to negotiate
concessions in medium-sized and large cities that are economically   Note added
and technically viable.                                                 to para. 4.
III.      PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Schedule
3.04      In our view priorities were changed in the light of certain
operational considerations (construction of the Serra Azul dam). in view of
the great industrial development potential of the region around AMBR* (Betim. Reference to
Contagem, Santa Luzia); this implies that there must be proper planning.          Annez IX
Nevertheless, the greater objective, namely meeting the needs of a large          adde.l to
number of cities. was achieved, thus improving social conditions in the           para. 3.04
region.
Procurement
3.06      From 1983 onwards the new management of the company adopted and         Ref. to-
adapted the IBRD procurement guidelines for materials and civil works, as         Annex IX
demonstrated during the September 1983 mission to COPASA MG.                      addedI to
para. 3.06
IV.       OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.02      We would like to emphasize the support given by BNH/IBRD in the         Ref. to
implementation of the State Loss Control Program -- PECOPE. which enabled the  Annex IX
company to make the technical preparations for a program with wider coverage.  added to
Currently COPASA MG has an ideal technological base for pursuing its              para. 4.02
Operational Development Program.

V.        FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE                                                     ODD Notes
5.04      It should be noted that Loan 1850-BR enabled COPASA MG to improve
its financial performance through an integrated program making it possible to
introduce appropriate water consumption charges through micro-measurement.
Currently the company is investing strongly in:
-    Finalizing the implementation of the Mechanized Billing System            Raference
(computer), which will greatly improve commercial operations.            to AnnAx TX
COPASA MC has also recently negotiated with PRODEMGZ (State Data         added to
Processing Company) the exclusive leasing of a date processing           para. 5.04
center.
-    Another important Eeature is the development of the PAM (Market
Action Program) which will enable the company to expand its market
and improve its comnercial efficiency.
VI.       INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01      The IBRD mission very properly analyzed the question bf
institutional development as an important tool in guaranteeing the continuity
of effective planning designed to foster a business orientat;ion within the
company. Future managers will merely adjust certain iten. in a program that
is already laid out and is technically, socially and politically viable.
6.02/6.03  On this issue, in addition to previous comments, we are annexing         Ref. to
the COPASA study entitled "Reorganization of Data Processing in COPASA MG,"         Annex II
considered and approved in the Data Processing Policy Comoittee.                    added to
para. 6.03
As projected in the EVG in (? for) 1985, COPASA will invest, through
ENK/IBRD financing, a total of 150,000 UPC on reorganizing data processing in
the company. Therefore from this year onwards the production and treatment of
data in the company will be greatly improved.
VIII.     BANK PERFORMANCE
8.02      As already noted, COPASA MG has for many years benefited from the
assistance of the OT with e.g. analyses of engineering plans, budgets and
appraisals of undertakings. However. appraisal periods became longer since
the OT itself was part of the critical path for projects. COPASA has also
improved its project appraisal and coordination capacity as a result of this
relationship with the OT. BNE eliminated the OT from September 1984 onwards
in view of the company's technical position.  We therefore anticipate a             Ref. to
considerable improvement in project preparation periods, leading to better          Annex IX
overall planning.                                                                    added to
para. 8.02
IX.       CONCLUSIONS
In the light of the conclusions of the Project Completion Report.
very well set out by the World Bank, we must make certain observations which

complement those previously made on the occasion of the Project Performance
Audit Report of May 1983:
1.   Put into effect the guidel:ines enabling the company to be gradually
but systematically regionalized; in other words, the company should
operate as a holding company within the state of Minas Gerais,
responsible for the technical and administrative coordination of
"*regional units."
2.   Once this step has been taken, the negotiating strategy regarding
concessions must be altered, since the most representative
municipalities would participate in the administration of the
regional unit; this process will surely coincide with the policy of
future federal governments in terms of the introduction of reforms
in taxation designed to bring about a better distribution of income
to municipalities (or prefectures).
3.   It is not difficult to see that this increases even more the
importance of effective business planning to complement the
institutional measures taken by the company.
