entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.
      Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall
follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in
making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.    (a) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment
out of the Special Account:
          (i)     was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible
                  pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or
          (ii)    was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank,
                  the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank:
                  (A)   provide such additional evidence as the Bank may
                        request; or
                  (B)   deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank
                        shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount
Page  15
                        equal to the amount of such payment or the portion
                        thereof not so eli-gible or justified.  Unless the
                        Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by
                        the Bank into the Special Account shall be made
                        until the Borrower has provided such evid-ence or
                        made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b) If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
      (c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all
or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special Account.
      (d) Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and
(c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent
withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
