MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR THE FIFTH KABUPATEN ROADS PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the
equivalent of US$101.5 million to help finance the Fifth Kabupaten Roads
project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with
a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.         Background.  Indonesia has a total of 243 kabupatens or rural
districts. They vary greatly in size and resource endowment, but the average
k%bupaten has a population of 0.7 million and a land area of 4,000 km2.
These kabupatens are served by a road network that has three main
administrative classifications--national, provincial, and kabupaten.
Kabupaten roads, at a total of 181,000 km, represent the largest segment of
the network. Although there is a wide degres of variation, on average the
kabupaten roads are of poorer quality than the national and provincial roads
with only 46 percent in stable (good and fair) condition as opposed to
60 percent for the latter road classes. The main reasons for a majority of
the kabupaten network being in poor condition have been poor maintenance
practices, weak institutional capabilities, and limited budgets.
3.         Currently, in line with Indonesia's high proportion of rural
population and the importance of agriculture in its economy, GOI has given
priority to the improvement of the kabupaten network and has been making
adequate budgetary allocations for it. In support of this strategy, donors
(ADB, IBRD, OECF, and USAID) have provided considerable assistance for the
improvement of kabupaten roads. Two Bank assisted projects covering a total
of 124 kabupatens (Third Kabupaten Roads - KR3, and Eastern Indonesia
Kabupaten Roads - KREI) were approved in FYs 92 and 93, respectively. The
proposed Fifth Kabupaten Roads (UR5) project is mostly an extension of RR3 and
KREI to all 27 kabupatens in the provinces of Riau, Maluku, and Kalimantan
(east, central and south). With this project, all kabupatens except for those
in East Timor will have been covered with a kabupaten road project, though not
all Bank-assisted. The KR5 kabupatens account for 29 percent of the land
area, 11 percent of the cultivable area, and have 6 percent of the population
of Indonesia and 9.5 percent of the kabupaten road network. Though there is
oil production in Kalimantan, the vast majority of the population depends on
agriculture. Maluku is one of the poorest provinces of Indonesia with about
30 percent of its rural population living in absolute poverty as opposed to
15 percent nationwide.
4.         Subsector Issues.  Indonesia has made considerable progress in
recent years in the development and management of its road system but
significant technical and institutional weaknesses remain. The main if.sues
concerning the sustainability of the kabupaten roads program as a whole can be
summarized as (a) inadequate road maintenance, due partly to a lack of
appreciation of the economic role of maintenance and to insufficient funding;
(b) inefficient practices in preparation and implementation that lead to a
product of poor quality and short economic life; (c) shortages of skilled
technical staff and inadequate training programs; (d) insufficient use of



-2-
modern road technologies and weak institutiona, especially at kabupaten and
province levels; and (a) inadequate attention being paid to environmental
impacts of projects in the planning and implementation of road works.
5.         GOI Oblective. and Strateav.  In line with its regional development
and poverty reduction policies, GOI emphasizes infrastructure investments that
would provide access to the main economic centers for the agriculture
dependent rural population outside Java. A key element of this strategy is to
achieve higher coverage of kabupaten roads and to raise the proportion of the
network in good and fair condition to about 60 percent throuth a consistent
annual level of funding and steady improvements in the institutional and
technical framework for preparation and implementation of kabapaten road
programs. To this effect substantial measures have been taken by GOl, with
the assistance provided under the recent Bank-approved projects for other
areas, to increass the capacity and accountability of kabupaten governments,
and improve systems and procedures for road planning, design, and
implementation.
6.         Lendint Ex2erience.  The Bank has financed 13 projects to date in
t.he road sector, including four kabupaten roads projects (FY82, FY88, FY92,
and FY93). Lessons learned from the earlier kabupaten road projects are the
following:  (a) kabupaten planning procedures need much improvement; (b) due
to the small, highly dispersed nature of the road subprojects, effective
supervision requires considerably more time and effort than a typical highway
project; (c) kabupatens tend to allocate insufficient funds for road
maintenance; and (d) sustainable institutional improvements in the kabupatens
requires significant effort from both the central government and from foreign
donors over a long time. Drawing upon these lessons, KR3, KERI and the
proposed project provide support for further improvement in planning proce-
dures and institutional strengthening. The prcject also includes measures for
tender certification, prequalification of contractors, technical audits, and
annual reviews of actual road maintenance achievements with the Bank.
7.         Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The main reasons for Bank
involvement in kabupaten road improvement programs are the followings
(a) improved access to commercial centers is a prerequisite for most
development activities in rural areas and is important to reducing rural
poverty; (b) a sizeable part of GOI's development budget is now aimed at
improving kabupaten roads and it is important that these funds be used as
efficiently as possible and that the environmental impacts be addressed
systematically; and (c) Bank involvement would help GOI induce local
governments to give greater priority to road maintenance rather than to
rehabilitation and betterment projects. In addition, the Bank would provide
further assistance to GOI through the proposed project in the formulation and
implementation of institutional and technical improvements at subsector level.
Thus the project is fully consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy for Indonesia which was discussed bv the Executive Directors on
April 12, 1994.
8.         Bank Strategv.  In view of the assignment of sector management
responsibilities in Indonesia, Bank strategy in the road sector makes a
distinction in the focus of lending operations for the primary network
(national and provincial roads) and those for the kabupaten roads. Projects
that support development of the primary network attempt to improve road
transport incentives and regulations as well as address the more complex



technical and organizational issues. The focus under kabupaten road projects
is more on institutional development, maintenance, and resource allocation at
the local levels. Similar to its predecessors for other kabupatens, this
project will be designed therefore to: (a) help GOI, and hence the local
level agencies, focus on improving organization, systems, procedures, and
implementation methods through its technical assistance components;
(b) introduce these improvements on a large scale through civil works
components; (c) help ctevelop local capabilities for project monitoring and
supervision, and (d) help GOI put together and strengthen provisions for
protection of the environment and consultation with indigenous peoplo.
9.         Proiect Obiectives.  The main objective of the project is to
improve access to commercial markets for the agriculture dependent, rural
population. Specifically, the project aims at enhancing the capability of GOI
agencies that manage the development of kabupaten roads, and improve the
quality and the capacity of the road network in selected kabupatens in
Kalimantan, Malukls, and Sumatra on a sustainable basis.
10.        Pro_ect DescriDtion.  It would have the following main components:
(a) civil works, including rehabilitation of selected roads in project
kabupatens (US$92 m); (b) routine and periodic maintenance (US$42 m);
(c) provision of ma ntenance equipment, spare parts, and supplies (US$18 m);
and (d) consultant supervision services, and technical assistance for
continuing the strengthening of systems and procedures for planning and for
environmental analysis (US$20 m). The project's total oost is US$206.8
million including contingencies, and implementation would cover three GOI
fiscal years, starting FY94/95. Retroactive financing for some civil works
and essential consulting services, not to exceed US$5 million, is recommended
for expenditures incurred after January 1, 1994 and prior to the date of the
loan agreement. This is necessary to help complete the agreed first year
program.
11.        The project represents an extension of KR3 and KR1 to more
kabupatens. Tn this sense it is starting with an already approved analytical,
organizational, and conditionality framework and refining it further. Similar
to KR3 and lRRI, the project's list of kabupatens is based on criteria
established by the Bank and GOI. Also, the Bank loan would continue to
finance part of the routine maintenance costs for roads because experience of
past projects has shown it to be essential to a change of attitude, to
fostering incremental local funding, and to successful implementation. In
view of the short duration (3 years) of the project and its programmatic
nature, Bank financing of maintenance would be at a constant 37 percent, for
the sake of both administrative simplicity and effective implementation.
Nevertheless, the requirement for a steady increase of 001 maintenance funding
for the overall program will be met through the annual increasing targets
agreed with the Bank.
12.        Status of PreDaration.  Preparation of the project is relatively
well advanced. Long lists of subprojects for road maintenance and
rehabilitation as well as proposals for laboratory and civil works equipment
have been prepared in accordance with planning procedures and methodologies
agreed previously with the Bank. The first year program has been prepared.
The selection of civil works supervision consultants is underway. A sectoral
environmental analysis has been prepared, and also a set of environmental



- 4 -
management and monitoring measures have been developed for application to all
subprojects. These are all acceptable to the Bank.
13.        Implementation:  The project will utilize the same implementation
and coordinating arrangements as KR3 and K312. Hence, the project's civil
works will be implemented by the Kabupatens' Public Works Offices, with the
assistance of DGH and technical consultants. The other project components
(provision of equipment, supervision of works, and technical assistance) will
be implemented by the central DGH.
14.        Agreed Actions.  At negotiations agreement was reached with GOI on:
(a) Environmental and Social Analysis - the scope of work of thie KREI
project's socio-economic monitoring committee will be extended to
cover all the kabupatens participating in Bank-financed
subprojects;
(b) Maintenance - kabupatens would receive Bank funding for
rehabilitation only if they plan, budget and implement maintenance
satisfactorily; i.e., in accordance with specific targets to be
set;
(c) Subnroiect Selection and Annual Reviews - covenants, similar to
those agreed for KREI and KR3, and criteria to be used for
subproject selection and annual work program reviews that will
apply to the proposed project;
(d)  Equi=ment -implementation of the equipment managemenx  guidelines
and related recommendations in a manner satisfactory to the Bank;
and
(e) Quality Assurance - the implementation of a program of quality
assurance, including technical audits of project implementation
quality, and sharing the results of this program with the Bank.
15.        Environmental Im,act.  Most road improvements would be c cried out
on existing alignments and would have only minor, short-term impactb on the
environment that are to be mitigated through the use of environmental
guidelines for design and implementation. Subprojects with possible
significant impacts, as identified by the environmental screening process,
would be submitted to a detailed environmental assessment (EA) in accordance
with GOI procedures and criteria agreed to by the Bank. The HA would be
reviewed by the Bank, and only road works for which there is no doubt that the
impacts are adequately mitigated would be accepted for Bank financing. The
construction contracts would have addenda incorporating the mitigation
measures. No road works would be eligible for Bank financing if they provide
access to any area where induced development might have significant indirect
environmental impacts. The project does not involve any resettlement or
significant land acquisition, nor will people be denied access to traditional
lands during implementation. However, the institutional capabilities of DGH
will be strengthened under the project in order to better manage and monitor
the screening and implementation process for all kabupaten road projects.
16.        Profram Obiective Categories.  The main contribution of the project
will be to basic infrastructure upgrading and public sector management,



- 5 -
through the improvements expected in road network quality, in the subsector's
institutional and technical framework, and in the capabilities of kabupater
roads staff. The project will also make indirect contributions to poverty
reduction by providing access to commercial centers for populations living in
some of the poorest provinces in Indonesia and will introduce practical
methods to identify and control any potential negative environmental impacts
of kabupaten roads.
17.        Project Benefits.  Rehabilitation and improved maintenance of roads
would lead to reduction of vehtcle operating costs in project kabupatens.
Lower road transport costs would translate into reduced costs of marketed
goods and agricultural inputs, and shtould therefore induce higher production
and rural incomes. In addition, the project would increase kabupatens ability
to plan and implement road works programs efficiently, thereby reducing
further the costs of road provision and road use. The estimated ERR for the
project overall is 29 percent; the individ.al road links' ERRs and costs will
be kept on file for monitoring purposes.
18.        Risks.  The main project risks are related to the implementation of
the planning procedures and the funding of maintenance. Partly because of the
limited capacity of the agencies in charge of assisting and supervising
kabupatens, the implementation of the planning procedures is inconsistent in
some kabupatens and road investments are not properly prioritized. To reduce
the risks, GOI's national planning agency, Bappenas, would continue to play a
strong coordinating role and project implementation reviews would be held with
the Bank for KR3, KREI and KR5 at regular intervals. As for maintenance
funding, Bappenas is expected to allow the continued use of central grants for
road improvement (INPRES) on road maintenance, if needed, to meet a
kabupaten's target. Also, project maintenance targets would be carefully
designed and annual eligibility conditions established aiad enforced for
individual kabupatens failing to adhere to the targets.
19.        Sustainability.  The project represents an attempt to utilize the
resources available to kabupatens more efficiently and effectively. It
pursues difficult objectives such as developing the planning and institutional
capability in kabupatens so as to enable them to maintain viable road
networks. It will also try to encourage the use of more appropriate road
rehabilitation and maintenance technologies. Taken together, this is a
sustainable package as over time it will increasingly be the more economically
justified investments that are completed, and the appropriate conditions for
adequate maintenance of the network fostered. Implementation of this project
will therefore lead to more kabupatens practicing better road maintenance and
management techniques. In addition the demonstration effect will lead to
these better practices being followed in non-Bank-assisted kabupatens.
20.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
