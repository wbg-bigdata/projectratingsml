REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OF IRAN WITH THE GUARANTEE OF IRAN
FOR A SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Telecommunications Company of Iran, with the guarantee of Iran,
for the equivalent of US$82 million to help finance part of the foreign ex*-
change cost of a second telecommunications project. 1/ The loan would have
a term of 20 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Iran" (R71-129) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 1, 1971.
An updating memorandum will be circulated to the Executive Directors next
month. The next economic mission is expected to visit Iran in the fall of
1973 after the Fifth Plan is published. A Country Data Sheet is attached as
Annex I.
3.        Over the past decade, Iran has given strong emphasis to the estab-
lishment of a diversified industrial base, the introduction of new institu-
tional and on-farm development practices in agriculture, the creation of
urban centers, and the application of modern technology in capital forma-
tion and distribution. Iran's achievements in these areas have succeeded
in bringing about a fundamental transformation of the whole production
complex.
4.        The structural change was accompanied by rapid and sustained eco-
nomic growth. Real GNP has doubled in the course of seven years and continued
high growth can realistically be projected. The development process, sustained
by fast growing oil revenues (which increased to an estimated $2.4 billion in
1972), has affected all sectors.: Ambitious public and private investment pro-
grams in construction, water and power, transport and communication, as well
as considerable diversification and expansion of the industrial sector, have
not only generated uninterrupted growth, but have also changed the social
and economic profile of Iran. In the process, a number of structural prob-
lems associated with rapid growth and technological progress have arisen.
These are elaborated below, and their effects are being monitored by the
Government with a view to introducing such adjustments as may be necessary.
1/   The cost estimates and financing plan in this report and in the Appraisal
Report are expressed in US$ equivalents established prior to the recent
currency changes. Since the project is part of a continuing investment
program which consists of a large number of expenditure items, it is not
considered necessary at this time to adjust the amount of the proposed
loan.



- 2 -
5.        Rapid economic growth in Iran has been achieved at a high foreign
exchange cost. While GNP has been rising at around 10 percent per annum,
imports grew at 19 percent annually during 1963-71. This is mainly due to
the high import content of investment and production, primarily in industry.
In order to meet the rising import bill, Iran pursued a policy not only of
maintaining low foreign reserves but also of taking advantage of its enhanced
creditworthiness to borrow abroad on a large scale. Until recently, its for-
eign reserves represented a few weeks' imports, resulting in short-term ex-
change crises with varying degrees of severity. However, following the re-
vision of oil agreements, since 1971 Iran has been able to build up higher
levels of foreign reserves, which in November 1972 amounted to $750 million,
or about five months' imports at the 1971 level. Nevertheless, imports are
expected to grow, and the Government is watching the foreign exchange situa-
tion closely notwithstanding the 12 percent annual growth of oil revenues.
6.        In the Fourth Plan and, to a larger extent, in the draft Fifth Plan
(1973-77) greater emphasis is being given to the processing and production of
domestic inputs and capital goods, as well as to more effective industrial
linkage policies. The Government already has under way a number of major
projects to replace imported intermediate and capital goods (e.g. steel,
machine tools, engineering and agricultural machinery and chemicals) and
the private sector is also embarking on a number of industrial ventures in
this sub-sector. These projects can be economically integrated with the
user industries if their output is priced competitively. The Government's
role in adjusting the protection system and in helping establish the neces-
sary industrial infrastructure is crucial in inducing further industrial
growth. These problems were highlighted in the Bank report on "Iran, In-
dustrial Policies and Priorities" (R72-76) and are the subject of a continu-
ing dialogue with the Iranian authorities.
7.        Continued adjustment of industrial development policies, however,
while necessary, is not sufficient. Industries need markets, either within
the country or abroad, and the domestic market for intermediate and capital
goods (and hence the incentive for the establishment of plants to produce
them) depends to a great extent on the market for domestically produced con-
sumer goods. This market has largely been made up of the urban population,
whose demands are unlikely to increase at the rates experienced during the
1960's. Since the development of foreign sales of modern manufacturers is
still in its infancy, the continued expansion of sales of consumer goods
requires increasing the real incomes of the poorer urban dwellers and the 18
million people still living in the rural areas.
8.        The dynamic growth of industry in recent years, contrasted with
low rates of growth in agriculture, has created a social imbalance as the
income gap between Iran's urban and rural populations widened. Growth of
rural per capita income has been further depressed as farmgate prices re-
mained constant, as a result of Government measures for the benefit of urban
consumers. This acted as a constraint on the potential expansion of agricul-
tural production. Because of the growing gap between the urban and rural
areas the Government has decided to give high priority to acceleration of the



-3-
development of the agricultural sector in the forthcoming Fifth Plan. The
draft Plan calls for a four-fold increase in the resources to be allocated
to that sector during the next five years. Intensive efforts are current-
ly under way to work out a comprehensive strategy aimed at maximizing
production through cooperatives and farm corporations as well as agri-
businesses. The Fifth Plan includes projects designed to achieve more
efficient use of irrigation facilities, expansion of the agricultural ex-
tension corps, wider distribution of credit, fertilizers and improved seeds.
It should be recognized, however, that given the scarcity of irrigation
water in Iran, the agricultural sector cannot provide higher incomes and
gainful employment opportunities for all those residing at present in the
rural areas (60 percent of the population), let alone for a growing rural
population. The urban drift, which has accelerated over the past decade or
more is, therefore, expected to continue.
9.        This urban drift is an important element in reducing the degree of
underemployment in the rural sector and a recognition of the physical con-
straints on agricultural growth. Attempts to stop or decelerate the urban
drift would be tantamount to perpetuating the state of underemployment, and
the consequent low income levels in the countryside. The real issue is how
to balance the flow of rural emigration with the employment potential and the
absorptive capacity of the urban centers. While it is not realistic to at-
tempt a projection of the urban employment potential in Iran, the employment
record so far has been impressive. Despite an annual growth rate of urban
population of over 5 percent during the past decade, there are no major signs
of open unemployment in the major cities. This observation is supported by
the rising trend of wages (which, nevertheless, are still low and just above
subsistence level for the unskilled workers) and by the rapid expansion of
employment opportunities in industry, construction, public utilities and
services. The few pockets of unemployment observed in some areas of major
cities are essentially of a transitional nature during the urban adjustment
process. Nevertheless, at the anticipated rate of urbanization, the urban
labor force would grow from some 3.7 million workers in 1972 to 4.7 million
workers in 1977. The capital cost of employing the one million new entrants
in the urban labor market over the next five years will be high, but the
Fifth Plan calls for creation of a total of 1.4 million new jobs, and there-
fore aims not only to accommodate new entrants but also to minimize seasonal
and hidden underemployment.
10.       Pressures on urban facilities (e.g. housing and mass transporta-
tion) are, however, rapidly approaching intolerable levels in Tehran where
development over the past decade has tended to concentrate. Current projec-
tions indicate that continued urbanization at present rates would mean a
two-fold expansion in the size of other major towns. To face these prob-
lems, Iran is intensifying its efforts to decentralize development away
from Tehran by creating "poles of development" in key provincial areas.
During the Fourth Plan several such poles have begun to emerge in Esfahan,
Ahwaz, Shiraz, Mashhad, Tabriz and Kerman. Continued success of this policy
requires more, not less, expenditure on urban centers. Such expenditures



-4-
should include the establishment of a network of economic and social infra-
structure for the emerging urban centers, including transport, communications,
power, housing, education and health facilities. It is in this context that
the project under consideration has to be viewed.
11.       Iran is considered creditworthy for substantial borrowing on con-
ventional terms. There has been a marked increase in debt outstanding in
recent years, which, as of MLrch 31, 1972, amounted to $5 billion (of which
$2.9 billion was disbursed).' Of the total debt, including the undisbursed
amount, about half was held by governments (some 18 percent was held by the
USSR and 15 percent by the USA, the two largest creditors), and about 10 per-
cent by the Bank. The rest is private debt owed to foreign suppliers and
private financial institutions. There have been some changes in the nature
and source of loans which Iran has received in the past few years. The most
significant of these is the increase in short-term indebtedness to financial
institutions since 1969/70. The improved reserve position of the Central
Bank allowed the repayment of a large portion of these short-term loans in
1970/71, as well as the accumulation of an additional $500 million in for-
eign reserves. Long-term projections of Iran's external position show that
a gross inflow of capital would still be required to meet about 27 percent
of the investment program envisaged in the draft Fifth Plan. Such inflows
of some $1.5 billion annually would increase the debt service ratio, which
is presently 17 percent, to about 20 percent by 1978. In view of the ex-
pected continued buoyancy of oil receipts, these levels of debt service are
considered manageable.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN IRAN
12.       Since 1957 when the first loan was made to Iran, the Bank has made
24 loans, amounting to $774.1 million (net of cancellations). By the end of
January 1973, $423.4 million had been disbursed and $206.6 million had been
repaid. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC invest-
ments as of January 31, 1973, and some notes on the implementation of ongoing
projects.
13.       Bank lending, which up to the end of FY1969 had been primarily for
roads, irrigation and industrial credit, has been diversified to cover also
power, telecommunications, pipelines, ports, agricultural credit and education.
Ten loans totalling $375.2 million (net of cancellations) have been made for
infrastructure projects, of which $167.2 million wqas for road construction,
$111.0 million for power, $36.0 million for telecommunications, $32.0 million
for pipelines and $29.0 million for ports. The Bank has also made seven loans
to the Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran (IMDBI) for a total of
$204.4 million. In agriculture, three loans amounting to $81.0 million were
made for a multi-purpose project and two irrigation projects in the Dez and
Ghazvin areas. Two loans ($20.5 million) were for agricultural credit through
the Agricultural Development Fund of Iran (ADFI). One loan ($19.0 million)
lhas been made for an education project.



-5-
14.       As of January 31, 1973, the IFC had made investments totalling $22.8
million in four companies in Iran, producing ceramic tiles, steel pt:W-lucts,
textiles and paper. In addition, an investment of $0.4 million in the equity
of a carbon black project, together with a $3.0 million loan, was approved
on September 7, 1971. A loan of $1.25 million for a company engaged in agri-
culture was approved in October 1972; the agreement was signed on February 7,
1973.
15.       The Bank's operations during the next few years have necessarily
to be related to the policies and programs in the Fifth Plan covering the
five-year period commencing March 21, 1973. The lending program is intended
to support the high levels of investment required if Iran is to maintain the
growth rate of 10-12 percent annually. However, the Bank's assistance is to
be viewed not merely in terms of its financial contribution; it is hoped that
increasing Bank involvement will bring additional objectivity and experience
to project formulation and appraisal, awareness of the economic value of pro-
per scheduling and more effective procedures for implementation. While the
program will provide for continued investment in infrastructure (further
power, irrigation and ports projects are being processed) and in industry (a
repeater loan to the IMDBI is envisaged), special emphasis is to be given to
agriculture and the social sectors, where the developmental needs are greatest.
This is in accord with the Government's declared policy. A first family plan-
ning project is in an advanced state of preparation and is to be negotiated
shortly for presentation in FY1973. Discussions are being conducted with the
Government on the content of a second education project. A Tehran urban
transport project is being appraised and water supply and sewerage projects
are also being considered for Bank lending. Moreover, in response to a re-
quest by the Government, the Bank has established a special Task Force which
will work full-time on the complex problems of agriculture and rural devel-
opment and develop specific plans for investment in these areas. The Task
Force will adopt a comprehensive approach covering the production, welfare
and employment aspects. It is expected to result in one or two projects for
consideration during FY1974 and others for the subsequent years.
PART III - TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN IRAN
2
16.       Iran has an area of 1,648,000 km , which is equivalent to the ag-
gregate size of the countries comprising the Common Market. Its population
is concentrated in the north and central regions, with agriculture also cen-
tered mainly in the north; and oil development and the chief ports located
in the south. This places a heavy burden on the country's transport and com-
munications facilities. As a result of the government policy of establish-
ing new poles of development, infrastructure facilities such as power supply,
roads and rail, and air transport have been, or are being, developed in sev-
eral cities. However, the rate of development of telecommunications facil-
ities has not kept pace with progress in other sectors. In 1970, the number
of telephones per 100 persons in Iran was only 1.03 compared with countries



-6-
such as Columbia (2.63)., Brazil (1.94), Malaysia (1.58) and Zambia (1.28),
which had lower per capita GNP than Iran. The existing facilities are over-
loaded and calls between many major cities often cannot be made on the day
of placement. Although subscribers are required to pay a large deposit,
there is a waiting list of 90,000 applicants in Tehran and more than 54,000
in other centers. The average waiting time of over two years for telephones
is indicative of the unsatisfied demand. It is estimated that demand will
increase by 15 percent annually, reaching 1,100,000 in March 1978 compared
with the estimated demand of 500,000 at present. Even with the substantial
investment planned for the next six years (see paragraph 24 below), there
will still be over 100,000 waiting applicants in March 1978.
17.       Until June 1971 local telephone services were operated by the
Telephone Company of Iran (TC), a wholly government owned joint stock com-
pany, while a department of the Ministry of Posts, Telegraph and Telephones
(PTT) operated other telephone, telex and telegraph services, and was respon-
sible for regulatory and licensing functions. TC was organized along commer-
cial lines, employed competent staff, and its accounting system met commer-
cial standards. PTT, however, was deficient in these respects.
18.       Since the former division of responsibilities between TC and PTT
acted as an impediment to the rational development of telecomnunications and
resulted in inefficient operation and increased costs, the Government decided
to rationalize operations in the sector by establishing a single commercial
entity responsible for all pu-blic telecommunications in Iran. In June 1971
the Telecommunications Company of Iran (TCI), which as in the case of TC is
a government owned joint stock company, was established by an Act of Parlia-
ment merging the former TC and the Telecommunications Department of PTT to
operate public telecommunications services in Iran. The Ministry of PTT
retains certain regulatory functions, chiefly allocation and management of
radio frequencies. It is also responsible for the execution of major proj-
ects that were approved before the establishment of the new TCI, the most
important being the Integrated National Telecommunications System (INTS)
network and construction of the new Tehran Telecommunications Center. Under
the Act, as each phase of these works is completed, the corresponding assets
will be transferred to TCI.
,9.       Television and broadcasting are the responsibility of separate
authorities affiliated to the Ministry of Interior. The Plan Organization
(PO), Iran's central economic planning authority, is responsible for coor-
dinating investment proposals by the various Government ministries and agencies
and incorporating them in the National Five Year Plans. It has a telecommu-
nications division which oversees development in the sector on the Govern-
ment's behalf.
20.       The first project (Loan 717-IRN), which covers the expansion of
local service under the Fourth Plan, is making a significant contribution
both in terms of financial support and of institution-building. The organ-
izational structure has been rationalized and improved and new tariffs intro-
duced. Good physical progress has been made in exchange installations, par-
ticularly in the Tehran network where the project target of 336,000 exchange



- 7-
lines, involving installations of 183,500 new lines by March 1974, may even
be exceeded. As a result of cable shortages, now being overcome by large im-
ports under the Loan, it may take 6 to 12 months beyond the project period
to achieve the March 1974 targets for Direct Exchange Line connections. The
telex/gentex installation has been considerably delayed due to a decision to
retender and, although the contract will be awarded shortly, construction will
carry over into the Fifth Plan period. This item, however is a small part of
the project. Although disbursements under the Loan are behind schedule, the
bulk of the funds have been committed, and the Loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by its Closing Date of March 31, 1975.
21.       W4hile TCI is continuing the former TC's accounting procedures,
which meet commercial standards and ensure reasonable financial control,
the extension of these procedures to embrace the former PTT activities has
not yet been completed. However, the consultants are assisting TCI in this
regard, and we expect that this work will be completed within about a year.
TCI has complied with the requirement under Loan 717-IRN that TC and its
successor, TCI, submit accounts audited by independent auditors to the Bank.
This arrangement will be continued under the proposed project.
Service Facilities
22.       At the commencement of the Fourth Plan (1968-72) the exchange ca-
pacity in Iran was about 240,000 lines. This compares with the September
1972 level of 462,000 lines (260,000 in Tehran and 202,000 lines in the
provinces). There is a reasonable standard of exchange maintenance but
more attention should be given to regular traffic measurements, particularly
in the rapidly growing parts of the network, and to assessment of service
quality experienced by subscribers. TCI proposes to increase the frequency
of traffic measurements and to introduce regular quality measurements by
means of a systematic program of test calls.
Integrated National Telecommunications Service (INTS)
23.       With the completion of the INTS network in March 1974, Iran will
have a high capacity microwave system serving almost all existing telephone
locations to provide high quality long distance telephone, telegraph and
television relay facilities. Several high priority INTS routes have already
been commissioned and by the end of 1974 Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD)
should be available to all cities in Iran. Microwave systems already in
operation include the CENTO system, which spans the country diagonally from
Turkey to Pakistan providing both national and international facilities to
civilian as well as government authorities, a system from Tehran to the
earth satellite station at Asadabad, and an extensive "Seven Links" network
used also for TV transmission.
The 1972-1977 Telecommunications Investment Program
24.       Investment in telecommunications from March 1972 to March 1978, that
is, up to the end of the Government's Fifth Plan period, is projected at some



-8-
$880 million equivalent. That total also includes the completion by TCI of
the network expansion program begun by TC under the Fourth Plan, preliminary
expenditures by TCI in respect of the Sixth Plan, and the completion of works
currently under construction by the Ministry of PTT, notably the INTS network
referred to above.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       A detailed report entitled "Iran, Appraisal of the Second Telecom-
munications Project" (41a-IRN) is being distributed separately. A Loan and
Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
26.       In April 1972, TCI requested the Bank to provide financing to help
continue its expansion program. A project identification mission, which also
reviewed progress under the ongoing project, visited Iran in June 1972. The
data required for appraisal were prepared by TCI and the Government. The
project was appraised in July, and a further mission in October 1972 clarified
outstanding issues. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington
during the week of January 29, 1973, with Mr. Homayoun J. Ansari, Managing
Director, Telecommunications Company of Iran, representing both the proposed
Borrower and the proposed Guarantor.
27.       The project corresponds to the first two years (1973/74 and 1974/75)
of TCI's expension program under the Fifth Plan. The total project cost is
estimated at some $194 million equivalent, including contingencies, with a
foreign exchange component of $102 million, part of which would be financed
by the proposed loan. The project would consist of:
(i) installation of approximately 163,000 lines of exchange
equipment (71,000 in Tehran, 92,000 in the provinces)
together with associated buildings, subscriber plant
and junctions; provision of directory information, re-
corded announcements and miscellaneous services;
(ii) expansion of the long distance network by equipping some
5,000 additional channels on existing microwave routes
and the addition of TV relay facilities on selected
routes;
(iii) provision of trunk switching equipment to permit Subscriber
Trur;k Dialling between Tehran and 66 provincial centers,
and public call offices at some 80 towns of more than 5,000
inhabitants and selected villages en route;
(iv) installation of a second ground terminal to connect with
countries served by the Indian Ocean satellite; increasing
satellite capacity from 19 to 100 circuits; provision of



High Frequency systems and a 60 channel tropospheric-
scatter system to Bahrein; installation of a 200 line
international automatic exchange in Tehran; and
(v) consultancy and training services.
Items for Bank financing are switching equipment ($25.8 million), subscriber
and junction network plant ($29.0 million), long distance equipment, national
and international ($18.5 million) and miscellaneous items, including consul-
tants and contingencies ($8.7 million), amounting in total to $82.0 million.
Items not proposed for Bank financing, but which form part of the project,
include locally manufactured EMD switching equipment to be purchased by TCI
under an existing agreement, and TV transmission equipment to be purchased
from the original suppliers.   The cost per Direct Exchange Line (DEL) of $750
is within the typical range of $450-$850 for developing countries and is rea-
sonable considering the high proportion of new installations; it also includes
customs and local taxes amounting to some 30 percent of cif costs of imported
equipment. Work under the project would commence in March 1973 and be com-
pleted by September 1975.
28.       The training program takes into account the resources of TCI and
the staff needed to cope with the expansion proposed, and will be carried
out in collaboration with the recently commissioned UNDP training center,
which operates under the Ministry of PTT.
29.       Consultancy services are for further organization and management
studies, for assisting in the preparation of specifications for and evalua-
tion of bids for switching systems, and supervision of installation of the
system selected, extension of the long distance network, and for coordina-
tion of planning and implementation of the training program. The resources
of TCI, expanded through recruitment and the training program under the proj-
ect, and augmented by consultants' supervisory assistance, are expected to be
adequate to carry the project and the expansion program to a successful con-
clusion.
The Telecommunications Company of Iran
30.       The Act of Parliament establishing TCI and the Articles of Asso-
ciation approved by the appropriate Parliamentary Committees call for the
operation of TCI along commercial lines and confer considerable autonomy on
the Company. The Government, the only shareholder, is represented by the
Ministry of PTT (Chairman), the Minister of Finance, and one of the other
Secretaries of State or the Managing Director of P0.
31.       TCI's Managing Director is appointed by the Council of Ministers
for a term of three years, which may be renewed. The Board of Directors
consists of the Managing Director as President, two regular members and an
alternate member, all full-time executives of TCI. The organizational struc-
ture, which presently follows that of the former Telephone Company (TC) with



- 10 -
the addition of a position of Director (Long Lines and Telegraphs), is fairly
strongly centralized. TCI's senior managers are generally considered com-
petent. Staff is technically competent at the operating level, and instal-
lations are operated and maintained well. The finance and planning groups
require strengthening, but the shortage of qualified and experienced per-
sonnel within the Company and in the private sector makes it difficult to
effect rapid improvements. The training program will thus help to cope
with the needs for supervisory and middle management staff required for
the expansion.
32.       Under the first project, consultants SWEDTEL have been studying
the reorganization requirements of the new company TCI and have submitted
a preliminary proposal which is now being revieoed by TCI's management.
It recommends an increase in the number of specialist departments at head-
quarters, and decentralization of operations through the appointment of ad-
ditional regional managers. TCI expects that the general framework of the
future organization could be decided by June 1973, although implementation
of the reorganization is likely to require some years because of the diffi-
culty of finding suitably qualified personnel in the required numbers. 1While
it is important to finalize the reorganizational arrangements, TCI's transi-
tional problems are recognized. The management consultants under the ongoing
project will continue to assist TCI in this regard, and progress will be re-
viewed by the Bank periodically through reports to be submitted under the
ongoing and proposed projects.
Tariffs
33.       The new tariffs introduced in August 1971 are adequate to secure
TCI's future financial viability, taking into account the proposed commercial
rates for leased services. The TCI Law authorized the Board of Directors
to review and propose revisions to domestic tariffs, while authority to ap-
prove the proposals is vested in the General Meeting of Shareholders. In-
ternational tariffs are negotiated directly by TCI but are subject to the
e4inister of PTT's approval. The long term tariff requirements, including
those for TV circuits, are presently being studied by the management con-
sultants. The requirement that all users of leased telecommunications
services pay full commercial rates for such services is now being put into
effect.
Finances
34.       TCI commenced operations on March 21, 1972, too recent a date to
permit an adequate review of its financial performance. Instead some salient
features of TC's and PTT's past financial performance, prior to their merger
into TCI, are given below. The former TC's operating expenses were reasonable,
but low local tariffs resulted in cash generation barely adequate to cover
operating expenses, while capital expenditures were financed almost entirely
through PO funds and subscriber deposits. The revision of tariffs increased
revenues in 1971/72 by almost 40 percent, thus improving the rate of return
and operating ratio. The results for the PTT operations were also poor until



- 11 -
1970, but in 1971 with the expansion of the long distance network, revenues
increased by over 50 percent, thus resulting in improved rates of return.
It is expected that the favorable trend in revenues would continue and en-
sure the new TCI's viability. TCI's accounts receivable are still rela-
tively high compared with those of the former TC which represented about
three months billings. However, TCI is taking steps designed to bring down
all accounts receivable to about three months billings by March 20, 1974.
35.       The forecast balance sheets for TCI indicate that in the period
1972/73 to 1977/78 the value of plant in operation (less depreciation) and
equity will about treble. While expenses would rise from some Rials 4.7
billion to about Rials 10 billion, revenues are expected to increase from
some Rials 5 billion to about Rials 17 billion during this period, thus
enabling the achievement of satisfactory operating ratios and a steady in-
crease in net income. The large revenue increase follows from the introduc-
tion of higher local tariffs, increased STD traffic at adequate rates, new
connections and rentals from leased private, government and TV circuits ac-
cruing from 1974.
36.       The present and forecast debt/equity ratios are satisfactory.    As
under Loan 717-IRN, no debt may be incurred by TCI without the Bank's prior
approval, unless the preceding 12 months internal cash generation was more
than twice the maximum future annual debt service requirements.
37.       In order not to penalize the TCI financially, the Government has
confirmed that the extra costs resulting from the urgency with which the
INTS network was contracted - amounting to not less than a third of the
total estimated costs - will be written off as each phase is completed and
the corresponding assets are transferred by Government to TCI. In addition,
it has been confirmed that all funds contributed by the Government to PTT
and the former TC in the First, Second and Third Plans have been treated
as equity, and the Government has also agreed that not less than 50 percent
of funds provided under the Fourth Plan will be transferred as equity. The
terms and conditions of the loan portion of the Fourth Plan investment will
be consistent with the debt limitation provisions. Under the financing plan
for TCI's 1973-75 capital program, internal cash generation and subscribers
deposits will finance 34 percent of total requirements, borrowings from the
Bank under the ongoing and proposed loans 22 percent, and the balance requir-
ed to complete the project and the program will be provided by Government on
terms and conditions mutually satisfactory to the Government and the Bank.
38.       The rate convenant agreed under Loan 717-IRN, and reconfirmed in con-
nection with the proposed loan, specified that, commencing March 21, 1974, TCI
would maintain its tariffs at a level sufficient to achieve a rate of return
of at least 9 percent on net fixed assets in operation. Forecasts on the basis
of current tariffs indicate that, whereas the rate of return for 1972/73 would
only be some 1.5 percent because of initial difficulties in billing procedures
and the large increase in assets resulting from the merger, as a result of the
continued addition of new subscribers and of the substantial increase in long-
distance traffic, it would rise to 8 percent in 1973/74. With the revenues



- 12 -
expected to accrue from leased circuits, it is estimated to increase to 9.4
percent in 1974/75 and to 10.6 percent in 1977/78.
Economic Justification
39.       The proposed loan is for a high priority project aimed at provid-
ing adequate telecommunications facilities to support the country's continued
growth by improving service, opening up new areas of service in Tehran and
the provinces, providing an efficient subscriber dialled long distance serv-
ice and giving a basic service to a number of rural centers. Provision of
basic facilities in rural areas presently without facilities will fulfill
a social objective as well as meeting an economic need. The extension of
telecommunications in the provinces will also facilitate administrative ef-
ficiencies and reform. Based on the assumption that the assets financed
under this project would have an average lifetime of 20 years and applying
constant prices to costs and revenues, the financial rate of return is 16
percent. This is a conservative estimate of the economic rate of return as
it is likely that the forecast revenues understate the economic benefits of
the project, particularly in the case of long distance traffic. This con-
clusion is supported by the fact that the project is designed to cater pre-
dominantly to the needs of commerce, business and agriculture, with probable
external benefits that are not taken account of in the rate of return analysis.
Procurement and Disbursement
40.       Contracts for all goods financed under the proposed loan will be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. An amount of
$25.8 million is included for local and trunk switching equipment; this will
be procured as part of a tender covering the full Fifth Plan switching require-
ments. For locally manufactured goods to be financed under the proposed loan,
a preference of up to 15 percent, or the prevailing customs duties, whichever
is lower, will be applied for purposes of bid evaluation.
41.       Disbursements under the proposed loan would cover the cif costs of
imported equipment, the foreign exchange costs of installation and consultants'
services, and ex-factory costs of any contracts awarded to local manufacturers.
Such local contracts are likely for PVC (plastic) ducts, small-size cables and
a limited quantity of telephone sets and multiplex equipment, and would involve
local cost financing of the order of $2.5 million equivalent. If the local
factory (Iran Telecommunications Manufacturing Company) were awarded the
switching contract after international bidding, the local cost component of
the ex-factory price, which would be financed under the loan, is estimated
at a maximum of $9 million equivalent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Telecommunications
Company of Iran, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Iran and the Bank, the



- 13 -
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
agreements conform to the recent pattern for loans for telecommunications
projects.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOK1ENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Loan No. 410; Roads III; US$28.0 million Loan of April 28, 1965;
Closing Date:  April 30, 1973
$4.0 million was cancelled irn July 1969 when two road sections were
deleted from the project.   The original Closing Date, September 1,
1969 was first postponed to September 1, 1971, and then to December
31, 1972.   Two of the five roads had been completed on April 20,
1972 and construction of the remaining roads was expected to be
virtually completed by December 31, 1972 but in order to ensure that
final disbursements could be made, the Closing Date has been postponed
a third time to April 30, 1973.
Loan No. 517; Ghazvin Development; US$11.0 million Loan of October 17, 1967;
Closing Date: June 30, 1973
At the request of the Government, $11.0 million of the original Loan
of $22.0 million was cancelled in September 1971.   This amount was
no longer required because the project had been reduced in scope and
local procurement, which was not eligible for financing under the
Loan, was more than had been originally expected.   The supervision
mission in December 1971, reported that the project was proceeding
satisfactorily.   The Closing Date which was originally scheduled for
December 31, 1972 has been postponed to June 30, 1973.
Loan No. 594; Dez Irrigation-; US$30.0 million. Loan of April 18, 1969;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1 974
Construction is progressing satisfactorily.   Disbursements have fallen
short of forecasts due to delays in awarding the major civil works
contracts for roads and bridges; this has now been done and it is
expected that disbursements will increase markedly.   At the request
of the Government $2.0 million of the Loan, no longer required, was
cancelled in July 1972.   The Bank has agreed to the Government's
request to utilize some $1.1 million of Loan funds towards housing
for operation and maintenance staff.
Loan No. 602; Fifth EFC - IMDBI; US$4O.0 million Loan of May 28, 1969 ;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
In December 1972 IMDBI prepaid, with Bank approval, $31.1 million
of the $31 .3 million outstanding under this loan.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in particular
to report any problems which are being encountered, and the action
being taken to remedy them.   They should be read in this sense,
and with the understanding that they do not purport to present
a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

Loan No. 662; Agricultural Credit - ADFI I; US$6.5 mlilion.
Loan of March 25, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1973
The project is proceeding satisfactorily and the loan is fully
committed.   In an effort to reach smaller farmers, ADFI further
reduced in 1971 the minimum level of its sub-loans fram US$33,000
equivalent (previously US$66,000 equivalent) to US$13,000.   The
Closing Date which was December 31, 1972 has been postponed to
March 31, 1973 due to delays in disbursement of some funds.
Loan No. 697; Roads V; US$40.0 million. Loan of June 29, 1970;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1975
There have been delays in arranging for consultants to carry out
studies on transport coordination, and road maintenance.   It is
understood, however, that contracts for both studies have now been
negotiated and that work will commence early in 1973.   The Tehran
Urban Transport Study was begun in March 1971, and the consultant's
Immediate Action Program covering recommendations for the next five
years was submitted in July 1972.   The consultants are presently
studying the longer term actions required to alleviate transport
problems in Tehran.   Disbursement which has been slow, has
accelerated since work on road construction began in the summer of
1972.
Loan No. 716; Tehran Power Distribution; US$60.0 million
Loan of December 18, 1970; Closing Date:  December 31, 1974
The project is proceeding satisfactorily but there has been some
delay in the execution owing to the Tehran Regional Electricity
Company's (the executing agency) unfamiliarity with the procurement
procedures required for Bank loans.   Following the recent joint
review of these problems by the Bank and TREC, procurement is
proceeding more satisfactorily.   Accordingly, disbursement is also
expected to accelerate shortly.
Loan No. 717; Telecommunications I; US$36.0 million
Loan of December 18, 1970; Closi-n_ Date: March 31, 1-975
Owing to delay in parliamentary ratification of legislation
establishing the new company and the appointment of management
consultants, the transfer of the telecommunications assets of the
Ministry of Posts, Telegraph and Telephones (PTT) to the Telephone
Company of Iran (TC) to form the new Telecommnications Company of
Iran (TCI) did not take place on schedule, but consultants have
now completed evaluation of the assets.   Procurement of telex/
gentex items under the PTT component of this project has been
delayed by a decision to retender.   However, good progress is
being made with exchange installations in the Tehran area and the
targets may even be exceeded; works for provincial exchanges and
telex networks are behind schedule by about a year.   Although
disbursements under the loan had been somewhat slow, a substantial
amount has been committed.

Loan No. 718; Education I; US$19.0 million  Loan of December 18, 1970;
Glosing Datet Junee30_ 1977
The project is progressing satisfactorily.  The implementation of
the project is about 5 months behind schedule due to delays in the
selection of consultant architects.  However, the Project Unit
is functioning satisfactorily.  The disbursement schedule has been
revised and envisages a substantial increase in disbursements
in the course of FY1973.
Loan No. 821; Agricultural Credit - ADFI II; US$14.5 million
Loan of May 22, 1972; Closing Date: November 30, 1976
Progress under the project is satisfactory and disbursements have
commenced. AIFI has taken steps to enlarge its lending volume
through an agreement concluded with Bank Melli, a Government
owned commercial bank, for joint lending in amounts of between
$6,600 and $33,000 each.   As the present lower limit of ADFI's
loans is $13,000 the recent agreement will enable ADFI to lend to
farmers somewhat smaller in size than it has been able to in the past.
Loan No. 855; Ports; US$29.0 million Loan of September 8, 1972;
Closing Date: April 30, 1978
Physical implementation of all elements of the project has begun on
schedule.   Earth work for the four berth extension of Bandar
Shahpur is proceeding satisfactorily, tenders for berth construction
and some floating equipment have been issued, and the Iran Ports
Studg has commenced; the interim report with recommendations for
fhture port development is expected to be available for review in
April 1973. The loan was declared effective on Febrnlary 13, 1973.
Loan No. 856; Power Transmission; US$51.0 million  Loan of September 20,1972
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project is proceeding satisfactorily and a number of
tenders have already been issued.
