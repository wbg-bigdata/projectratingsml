INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR THE LAKE CHAD POLDERS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Chad for the equivalent of US$5 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance the development of two polders of Lake
Chad. Other contributors to the project are: The African Development Fund
(ADF) US$5 million on the same terms as IDA; Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation
(FAC), US$2 million as a grant; and USAID, US$1 million as a grant. The
proceeds of the Credit and contributions from the other donors would be
relent to the Societe' de Developpement du Lac (SODELAC) for 50 years at an
interest rate that would initially be set at a nominal 0.25 percent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report "Chad's Economic Development:   Constraints and Potential"
was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 2, 1973 (R73-191). A
special mission visited Chad in December 1973 to update our information on
the public finance situation. Its conclusions, which were reviewed in the
light of recent economic developments, are reflected in the following para-
graphs. Annex I contains country data.
3.        With extremely poor natural resources, a harsh climate, a limited
infrastructure and a pervasive lack of skills, Chad faces unusually difficult
handicaps in its economic development. An additional difficulty is the high
cost of transport to and from the outside world, because the main centers of
activity of this large land-locked country are located at 1,500 to 2,500 km
from sea ports. With a per capita GNP estimated at US$82 in 1973, Chad is
classified by the United Nations as one of the 25 least developed countries
in the world.
4.        Over 90 percent of Chad's 3.8 million inhabitants live in rural
areas, deriving their livelihood from agriculture and livestock. About half
of the rural population lives in central and northern Chad as semi-nomadic
herdsmen who exploit the Sahelian grasslands. The other half lives in the
somewhat higher rainfall zone in the South, where they grow millet and sorghum
as food crops and cotton as a cash crop. Recently, there has been some effort
to intensify traditional rice growing on the flood plains of the Logone River.
5.        In the first decade since independence in 1960 GDP grew by about 5
percent annually in current prices, and 2 percent in constant prices. The
most rapid growth took place in the market economy, mainly import substitution
industries and services, while the growth of livestock and subsistence crops
probably did not exceed the population growth rate of 1.8 percent annually.



- 2 -
Accordingly, income disparities somewhat widened between the small modern
urban sector and the mass of the people living in the rural areas and, within
the rural population, between the cash crop growers and the herdsmen.
6.        Since the late 1960's two events have affected Chad's growth and
financial situation -- the rebellion and the drought. The rebellion which
broke out in 1968 made wide areas of the country insecure and cut off tradi-
tional cattle trading routes. Wells were neglected and the supply of water
for livestock dwindled. Earlier progress in animal disease control was set
back. The effects of the rebellion were compounded by droughts which occured
to a severe extent in three of the five years, 1969-1973. Water levels in the
major rivers reached an all-time low, while Lake Chad dried up to one-third
of its normal size, impeding river transportation and causing great damage
to an already fragile ecological system. The impact on the livestock sector
was critical: by the end of 1974, almost one-half of the national herd had
apparently perished. Food crops were especially hard hit, particularly millet
and sorghum -- the basic staple crops which declined by more than one-third
during 1972 and 1973. Only emergency food shipments from abroad were able
to avert widespread starvation. With return of good rainfalls in 1974, the
country is nearing self-sufficiency in food crops.
7.        These factors have made the financial situation of the Government
more precarious. Up to 1968, the Government's current budget had been in
balance, and considering the country's development constraints, the overall
fiscal performance appeared satisfactory. After 1968, however, expenditures
began to grow much more rapidly than receipts as military outlays rose sub-
stantially. Meanwhile, the droughts further increased the demand for Govern-
ment services while reducing revenues. The overall budget deficit rose from
CFAF 2.1 billion in 1970 to CFAF 2.8 billion in 1973 (about 17 percent and
24 percent respectively, of yearly revenue) and is estimated provisionally
to have further increased in 1974. External budgetary subsidies have partly
covered these deficits. However, a considerable financial gap remained,
causing arrears on Government payments to rise to CFAF 8.1 billion bv September
1974.
8.        The fiscal situation constitutes a serious obstacle to development,
as Chad cannot contribute to the financing of the required capital outlays nor
finance all the recurrent expenditure of ongoing and new high priority projects.
Even essential economic services have had to be curtailed. Chad's new mili-
tary government which took over power in April of this year is aware of the
necessity of re-examining current spending priorities and has taken steps to
reassess the economic and financial situation and plan the best course to
follow ahead. Limited sources of domestic tax revenue and the current costs
of maintaining even the present level of public services mean that there is
little prospect of generating budget surpluses through the end of the 1970's.
9.        Chad's development potential lies in its rural areas.    Opportunities
for productive employment in towns will remain small. Progress in the rural
economy, however, will be slow. Even assuming political stability and normal



- 3 -
rainfall, it will take many years and great effort to restore the productive
capacity destroyed by years of rebellion and droughts. In the meantime,
improvement of livestock and diversification of agricultural output should
be pursued. Recently, the Government announced that oil has been discovered
in the North-Western and Southern parts of the country, but it will take
more time to assess the size of the deposits and their exploitability.
10.       In view of Chad's very limited savings capacity, almost all of the
country's investment has been financed by external sources. Foreign aid
received during 1970-72 averaged $10 million a year, about $3 per capita.
Most of the aid -- 90 percent -- consisted of grants. France and FED provided
the bulk of aid (about 40 and 30 percent respectively). Other aid donors,
including the European Investment Bank and United Nations agencies made
smaller contributions. In 1973 foreign aid rose substantially to about
US$30 million, not only on account of increased development grants, but also
because of higher drought relief transfers.
11.       Since most of the external aid to Chad came in the form of grants,
outstanding and disbursed external debt is small and amounted, by preliminary
estimates, to US$70.5 million at the end of 1974; disbursed IDA credits re-
presented about 15. percent of this amount. In 1973, debt service was estimated
at 2.5 percent of the export earnings. Since 1973, Chad has continued to
receive grant aid from its traditional sources of aid and also from some
Middle Eastern countries. Taking into account the concessionary nature of
most of the assistance extended and in prospect for Chad, the debt service
ratio is likely to remain low.
12.       In the light of Chad's poverty, its modest prospects for growth
of GDP and exports of goods and non-factor services, external borrowing
should be, to the extent possible, on very concessionary terms. Furthermore,
even with good fiscal performance, Chad will have neither the free budgetary
resources through the end of the 1970's to enable it to pay its share of
capital outlays, nor will it be able to afford substantial new outlays for
recurrent costs associated with new projects during that period. In the next
few years, foreign aid agencies should, therefore, consider financing a very
high proportion of the total cost of projects including, in the early years
of project operation, a high proportion of current operating costs.
13.       An economic mission will visit Chad in spring 1976 to review the
effects of recent important international and domestic developments on the
country's economic prospects and the future role of Bank Group assistance
to the country.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHAD
14.       To date the Bank Group has extended seven credits to Chad totaling
US$24.2 million. Three of these credits were for agriculture (including



-4-
livestock), two for highway maintenance and improvement, and two for education.
Except for the Drought Relief (agriculture) project, which is being imple-
mented satisfactorily, all ongoing projects are behind schedule as a result
of time-consuming administrative procedures, the Governiment's inability to
finance its contribution and cost overruns resulting from world inflation and
foreign exchange adjustments.
15.       Following the Govern.ment's development priorities, the Bank Group's
lending to Chad continues to focus on agriculture (inicluding livestock),
transportation and education - the key sectors of the economy.
16.       In agriculture, our objectiv.e is to help the Government assure a
sufficient food supply for a growing urban as well as the predominantly rural
population, to restore Chad's production base, which was seriously affected
by drought, and to make it less vulnerable to the vagaries of climate. Hence,
the importance of irrigation where our efforts started with the Sategui-Deressia
project and are continued with the proposed project.
17.       In transportation, we give priority to the improvement of crop
marketing roads. To this end,, we have planned a two-phase improvement pro-
gram for cotton roads. The f:irst phase covering the improvement and main-
tenance of feeder roads in cotton growing areas was financed in 1974. The
second phase whose preparation is provided for under the first phase would
cover the improvement of roads used for transporting cotton fiber from gin-
neries to export outlets. We are also exploring ways and means of improving
landlocked Chad's transport links with the sea.
18.       In education, we are trying to identify a project giving priority
to the training needs in rural areas, taking into account a study of the
training of young farmers financed under an existing IDA credit as well as
related UNESCO work.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN CXAD
19.       Chad's rural sector directly supports some 90 percent of its popula-
tion and accounts for over half of its GDP. Chad is the leading cotton pro-
ducing and exporting country in West Africa with cotton accounting for about
70 percent of exports. Next to cotton, livestock Is Chad's most important
foreign exchange earner. Foodcrops are grown for subsistence. Although the
adverse impact of the recent drought is difficult to measure, it is undeniable.
Livestock and foodcrop production were most severely affected by the drought,
while cotton suffered least. The country is still in the process of recover-
ing from its disastrous effects.
20.       Given Chad's very limited agricultural resource base, Government's
options for developing the rural sector are quite restricted. Because of the
importance of the cotton and livestock sectors in Chad's economy, their



- 5 -
development presents a good opportunity for producing new resources, employ-
ment and incomes required to raise the standard of living of the bulk of Chad's
population. Accordingly, many development projects, mostly financed by ex-
ternal sources, have been directed at raising productivity in these sectors.
21.       In the case of livestock, projects mainly financed by FED, FAC and
IDA (Credits 309-CD and 445-CD) have concentrated on improving animal health,
transportation and marketing facilities, and on increasing the supply of
water so that unused pasture can be exploited. In the case of cotton,
which is mainly grown by traditional smallholders in the South, the Govern-
ment, with the financial and technical assistance of FED and FAC, launched in
1965 a five-year productivity program to raise output. Under this program,
the participating farmers were provided with fertilizers, insecticides and
sprayers at subsidized prices, and trained to adopt more intensive and better
methods of cultivation. After an initial increase, both area and output under
this program declined because of the drought, which also caused farmers to
turn to food crop production. A second five-year productivity program, which
was started in 1971 is currently underway. IDA has contributed to it by
financing the improvement, and maintenance of feeder roads in the cotton
growing areas. The Government is now organizing a detailed evaluation of
the program to determine its viability for the future.
22.       As far as rain-fed farming is concerned, however, there is a limit to
the increase in output and income that can be generated by development pro-
jects such as the cotton program discussed above. Current income levels in
rain-fed areas of Chad are about US$35 - 50 per capita and can probably be
increased by maybe 50 percent, with present technology. However, the bene-
ficiaries of such projects will continue to remain very poor, and the food
base of the country will continue to depend upon a rainfall that even in
normal years is very variable and that from time to time, as in the recent
Sahelian drought years, fails to a degree where national catastrophe results.
Further increases in productivity will require development projects for crops
that combine high yield with drought resistance. The Government of Chad has
made efforts in this direction.
23.       Thus, while rain-fed projects will continue to be given the highest
priority, Government believes that in time it will be necessary to develop
the irrigation potential of Lake Chad and the rivers of the Lake Chad basin.
Given Chad's arid climate and the susceptibility of most of the country
to droughts, irrigation would make a major contribution toward solving the
critical problems faced by the economy as a whole and the rural sector in
particular. It would bring a wide range of benefits from (i) diversifying
crop production into wheat, sugar, rice, vegetables, and medium staple cotton;
(ii) better utilization of the country's livestock resources through fodder
production; (iii) evolving a high technology agriculture; and (iv) insuring
against the disruptive effects of recurring droughts.
24.       Given the very high investment cost, irrigation is not a panacea
but rather a complement to the expansion and intensification of rain-fed
agriculture. The first irrigation project, which IDA (Credit 489-CD) and



-6-
the African Development Fund are helping to finance, is the development of
about 11,000 ha of land for improved rice cultivation in the Sategui-Deressia
plain alolng the Logone River. Bids received from contractors for the civil
works component have been excessively high and Government has now decided,
in agreement with the co-lenders, to try out labor intensive methods of
construction by force account (see page 4 of Annex II). The proposed Polders
project would be our second operation in this sector and takes into account
experiences on construction methods gained so far with the previous project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
25.       The project was identified in 1968 by a joint FAO/RMWA sector mis-
sion. Over the years, the Bank - with the support of Government, FAC and
more recently ADF - has followed the preparation of an irrigation project
totaling about 2,800 ha by Fretnch consultants, SCET-International, and the
operation of a 70 ha pilot farm, both financed by FAC. The project was
appraised in October 1974 by a Bank Mission which concluded that it should be
reduced to 1,170 ha in size. Negotiations for the proposed credit were held
in Washington from September 8 to September 13, with a Chadian delegation
led by Mr. Madengar Beremadji, Secretary of State for Finance, the Economy
and the Plan.  A report entitled "Chad:   Appraisal of Lake Chad Polders Pro-
ject" No. 828a-CD dated October 16, 1975 is being distributed separately and
a Credit and Project Summary is attached to this report as Annex III.
26.       The project would consist of:
(a) rehabilitating and completing the irrigation and drainage
networks of Guini polder (370 ha net area);
(b)  constructing the irrigation and drainage networks for Berim
polder (800 ha net area);
(c) establishing a Commercial Agricultural Development Section
within the Project Unit which would prepare the way for farmer
settlement, and be responsible for the first year of operations
on all newly developed land, and for the basic cultivations during
the following year;
(d) providing a package of services to the farmers who would take
up cultivation of the polders after the initial first year of
operations by the Commercial Agricultural Development Section.
Such services would include resettlement assistance, training
extension, credit and marketing;



(e) constructing necessary service centers and houses for project
staff;
(f) expanding adaptive agricultural research at the Matafo Research
Station; and
(g) providing consultant assistance to reorganize the Societ6 de
Developpement du Lac (SODELAC).
Organization and Execution
27.       SODELAC has incurred heavy losses over the past few years and as a
result has not been able to pay all its bills. We estimate that about CFAF 124
million are needed to straighten out its financial situation and Government has
agreed to provide these funds in the form of equity (CFAF 70 million) and
budget subsidies for 1973 and 1974 (CFAF 54 million) prior to effectiveness of
the Credit. Under the project, SODELAC would be reorganized with the assistance
of a consultant to make it more efficient but, pending such reorganization,
management of funds used by the Project and the Project Unit, and their account-
ing would be kept entirely separate from those required for SODELAC's other
activities.
28.       The Project Unit Manager and key project staff would be recruited
internationally. As it is essential, under the harsh living conditions pre-
vailing in the lake area, that internationally recruited staff should form
a compatible team and receive adequate technical backstopping, staff would be
provided by an international company with the expertise to carry out irriga-
tion projects including construction of works. The Government has chosen the
French consultants SCET-International to provide the internationally recruited
staff. SCET-International prepared the project and operated the Matafo
Research Station from 1970 to 1972.
29.       Construction of the water intakes and the pumping stations and
the supply of secondary irrigation pipes (US$3 million in total) would be
financed by ADF which would apply its own procurement procedures. It is
expected that construction of the water intakes and pumping stations would
be let to local competitive bidding, and supply of pipes to international
competitive bidding among ADF members. The remaining irrigation works would
be small (US$2 million) and would include different items such as construction
of primary canals, laying down secondary pipes, and land levelling. Because
of their smallness and their nature, it is proposed that the remaining works,
which would be financed by IDA, would be constructed by force account. The
force account approach could result in some savings as we expect it will in
the Sategui-Deressia project (paragraph 24) and in addition, would have the
advantage of (a) integrating the agricultural development with construction
of the irrigation systems, and (b) enabling SODELAC to acquire capability
in basic irrigation construction techniques.
30.       To prepare the polders for settlement, a Commercial Agricultural
Development Section would be created within the Project Unit. This section



would be equipped to develop up to 400 ha of new land each year.    It would
exploit all newly developed land in the first year, drawing its labor force
from the population of the project area. In the following year, when the
farmers are settled, it would provide them with mechanical assistance for
basic cultivation and would p:Lant their cotton and wheat crops. The cost of
this assistance would be incorporated in the credit extended to participants
for purchasing the tools and inputs necessary for participating in the project.
In the first year of settlement, the farmers would be responsible only for
irrigating and harvesting their crops and would thus be able to attend short
training courses on the new crops and production techniques that they would
encounter through participating in the scheme. After these initial courses,
farmers would receive assistance in the field from project employed extension
workers.
31.       About 1,200 farm families would be needed to settle project land,
if each family is allocated and cultivates an average of one hectare, which
is the maximum the typical family could effectively handle without outside
help. The selection of farmers would be made jointly by the Project Unit
and a committee consisting of representatives of the local authorities.
Selection criteria would include, among other things, present proximity to
the polders, size of family, farming experience and ownership of bullocks.
It is expected that the 700 families already living in the project area,
who are already practicing traditional irrigation, would join the project.
An additional 500 farm families would be needed from outside the project
area. As these families represent only 7 percent of the farming population
within a 60 km radius of the project area, it should not be difficult to
recruit them. The Government, who owns all polder lands, would issue a
decree to confirm that SODELAC is authorized to settle farmers on newly
developed polder land. The publication of this decree is a condition of
effectiveness of the credit.
32.       The land to be exploited by the farmers would be alloted to them
for a renewable period of three years by SODELAC on terms and conditions that
would be acceptable to the Gcovernment and IDA. These conditions would
specify, among other things, that SODELAC would control water supply for
irrigation, established crop cultivation patterns, and provide maintenance
of irrigation works, marketirLg, extension and credit services. The farmers
would be assured tenure, supply of water, basic services and sale
of their produce at guaranteed prices. They would pay an annual consolidated
fee to SODELAC to cover the amortization of the government loan as well as
the Project Unit's operating and maintenance expenses.
33.       Farmers would receive credit for the purchase of farm inputs,
equipment and oxen on terms and conditions that would be acceptable to the
Government and IDA. All credit would be made in kind.     Seasonal credit
would average US$300 per ha per year and would carry an interest rate of
10 percent, the prevailing rate in Chad. It would be repaid after each
crop.  Medium-term credit would average US$350 at an interest rate of 10
percent, and would be repaid over 5 years.



34.       The Matafo Research Station Program would continue and expand its
efforts to determine optimum cultural methods for the main crops grown on the
polders, paying particular attention to improved methods of cultivation, weed
and insect control, and water application. In addition, it would carry out
trials to determine the long-term fertility of polder soils, including the
development of rotations satisfactory to maintain fertility. It would con-
duct also research into alternative irrigation methods in an attempt to
achieve reductions in development costs, particularly experiments with low
lift pumping from wells. Finally, it would evaluate ongoing project results
and initiate a program to look into the sociological problems involved in
recruitment and settlement of farmers.
Marketing of Project Output
35.       The project is expected to produce 3,000 tons of wheat and 3,000
tons of seed cotton by 1980. SODELAC would sell project produced wheat to
the Grands Moulins du Tchad (GMT), a private company which has the monopoly
for flour milling in Chad. SODELAC and GMT would enter into a formal agree-
ment by which GMT would purchase project wheat at a price that would provide
an adequate incentive to farmers. For cotton, SODELAC would enter into a
similar agreement with Cotontchad, the Government-owned corporation which
has the monopoly for the purchase of seed cotton and the processing of
cotton lint. These agreements would be acceptable to the Government and
IDA, and their signing are conditions of effectiveness of the credit.
Project Cost and Financing
36.       The total cost of the project, net of duties and taxes, is estimated
at US$13 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$10.4
million (80 percent). The costs of the project are high--with civil works,
without contingencies, costing US$4,800 per ha in 1975 terms. This very high
cost reflects conditions specific to Chad: high external and internal trans-
portation costs, lack of a technically developed Chadian domestic contracting
industry, and a generally low level of experience in irrigation works. The
situation will not change in the short run, but it should improve as experience
is built up through the implementation of irrigation projects. Other major
items in p- ject costs are similarly high but generally reflect the disecono-
mies of a small scale operation.
37.       Given the exceptionally difficult situation of Chad as described in
paragraph 8, the co-donors have agreed that together they would finance the total
cost of the project net of taxes. The proposed IDA credit of US$5 million would
finance 38 percent of this cost and would cover some 48 percent of the foreign
exchange requirements. The remainder of project cost would be financed as follows:
ADF, US$5 million covering 38 percent of total cost; USATD, US$1 million
covering 8 percent; FAC, US$2 million covering 16 percent. The IDA credit
and the funds from the other donors would be relent to SODELAC by the Govern-
ment for 50 years at 0.25 percent. SODELAC would repay the loan from the
proceeds of the consolidated fee collected from farmers. If farmers are to
be provided with sufficient incentive to participate in the project it would
not be feasible, initially at least, to set this fee at a level that would
enable SODELAC to repay the Government at more than a nominal rate of interest
(see paragraph 40). The consolidated fee would be reviewed from time to time



- 10 -
by SODELAC, the Government and IDA, as the farmers' response is tested, and
adjustments would be made by mutual agreement. Should an increase of the fee
prove feasible, the interest rate on the Government loan to SODELAC would also
be increased.
38.       The financing plan recognizes the differences in the procurement
practices of the co-donors. ADF, which cannot finance goods or services
supplied from non-member countries, would finance alone 100 percent of the
irrigation works built by contractors, 100 percent of the procurement under
international competitive bidding of equipment and PVC secondary distribution
pipes, and 100 percent of the cost of staff housing and service centers to be
built by local contractors. USAID would finance 100 percent of the agricul-
tural research component for cereals. IDA and FAC would jointly finance the
remaining project items, providing 71 and 29 percent of the required funds
respectively.
39.       Following credit effectiveness, IDA would disburse US$400,000 into
a revolving fund to be held by the Banque de Developpement du Tchad to
finance project activities as they are incurred and prior to reimbursement by
IDA. The co-donors will make similar arrangements. l'o facilitate the early
start of the project, IDA would finance retroactively expenditures incurred
under IDA's share of the project from October 1st, 1975 in an amount not to
exceed US$100,000 equivalent.
Recovery of Costs from Farmers
40.       It has been agreed that the consolidated tee would be set initially
at CFAF 130,000 (US*578) per ha per annum, a level which would give partici-
pating farmers adequate remuneration and incentives while at the same time
allowing Government to recover as much as possible of its cost. Although
this fee is about 7 times that collected on the only ongoing large scale
irrigation scheme, at Bongor, in southern Chad, it is estimated on the basis
of farm models that participating farmers will still receive a net income
equivalent to about twice what they could earn at the minimum official wage
rate in the agricultural sector. 'This is considered to be an adequate incen-
tive. On the other hand, at the initial level of the consolidated fee,
Government would recover 40 percent of its initial investment and recurrent
expenditures in the project over a 50-year period, assuming the cost of
capital to be 10 percent. Government recovery would :Lncrease to 68 percent,
if project induced cotton taxes and profits generated by Cotontchad are
taken into consideration in addition to the consolidated fee. The level
of the consolidated fee will be reviewed periodically with a view to ensuring
the maximum recovery of cost which appears compatible with the successful
implementation of the project.



Procurement and Disbursement
41.       For those project items financed by IDA and FAC, the following pro-
curement procedures would apply: orders or contracts for equipment, cement,
vehicles or chemicals with a value of more than US$25,000 will be through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines.
ADF and USAID procurement procedures would apply to those project items
they would finance.
42.       The Credit would be disbursed against 71 percent of total expendi-
tures for cement, equipment, vehicles, and chemicals; for operating expense,
local staff, expatriate staff and for consulting services.
Economic Benefits and Justification
43.       The proposed project holds the promise of drought protection and
high yields of food crop - in addition to cotton. Thus, it fits well into
the Bank's approach to agricultural development in the Sahel. In view of
the fragility of the rain-fed farming system, investment in irrigation -
despite its high cost - is essential in Sahelian countries such as Chad,
if any type of sound economic base is to be established and sufficient
food assured. Moreover, pending comprehensive and time-consuming surveys
beyond the work of the 1968 sector mission, there are at present no other
alternatives for substantial investment in agriculture.
44.       The project's direct benefits would be the 3,000 tons of wheat and
the 3,000 tons of seed cotton production that it would generate annually,
and which would cause the per capita income of the 1,200 farm families to
rise from US$35 to about US$300. If farmers are allotted less than 1 ha
each, and if farm family size increases, as it is expected to, through in-
creased birth rates caused by better diet and higher incomes, and through
the attraction to the project area of members of the extended family, the
number of people who would eventually benefit directly from the project
could reach 14,000. The economic rate of return of the project is estimated
at 17 percent with shadow pricing of the incremental work required of farmers
under the project, inclusion as economic cost of the foregone incomes from
traditional irrigation, and exclusion of the cost of agricultural research.
Pricing the work of the farmers at the minimum wage rate for the agricultural
sector would lower the rate of teturn to 13 percent.
45.       The project would also have a number of secondary benefits which
have not been included in the economic rate of return calculations: it would
prevent the progressive salinization, a normal process exacerbated by tradi-
tional irrigation, and eventual abandonment of Guini and Berim polders; it

would create a pole of development in an exceptionally fertile area of the
so far under-privileged northern part of Chad and help stabilize the farm
community by reducing the income disparity between northern and southern
regions; it would create employment opportunities and strengthen the balance
of payments by providing a permanent source of foreign exchange; it would
provide a reliable source of agricultural production, protected against
the adverse impact of possible droughts, and it would provide the basis
for the development of a modern technology in irrigated agriculture.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Chad
and the Association, the draft 'Project Agreement between the Association and
SODELAC, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article V, section 1 (d)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
47.       Special features of these agreements have already been referred to
in paragraphs 31, 32, 35 and 38 of this Report.   Additional conditions of
effectiveness provided for in sections 6.01 and 6,02 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement include:
(a) the agreement for onlending the proceeds of the Credit to
SODELAC shall have been concluded;
(b)  the marketing agreements between SODELAC and GMT, and SODELAC
and Cotontchad shall have been concluded;
(c) a decree empowering SODELAC to organize farmers' settlement on
newly developed polder lands shall have been enacted and duly
published;
(d) the Project Unit Manager shall have been appointed;
(e) the French Republic and the African Development Fund, shall
have approved their contributions to the project; and
(f) the Government shall have paid to SODELAC its contribution
to SODELAC's capital as well as the amount budgeted in favor
of SODELAC for the preceding two years.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of -the Association.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION=-
Credit No. 125      Highway Maintenance Project:   US$4.1 million Credit of
August 14, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The Project consisted of (a) a five-year program for highway mainte-
nance including technical assistance, the procurement of equipment and mate-
rials, repair shop extension, training of operators and mechanics, and estab-
lishment of traffic data collection system; and (b) feasibility studies, and
if found justified, detailed engineering for the Djermaya-Djimtilo road.
The Project was completed by December 31, 1973 but two of its compo-
nents were not implemented: the training program was dropped at the Govern-
ment's request because the cost of the consultants' proposals exceeded the
amount available under the credit. However, a comprehensive training program
is included in the Second Highway Project. The feasibility study for improve-
ment of the Djermaya-Djimtilo road was completed; however, detailed engineer-
ing, found premature, has been deferred due to low traffic volume.
The Project's closing date has been postponed from December 31, 1974
to December 31, 1975 to allow the Government the use of about US$250,000 in
undisbursed funds to acquire spare parts, vehicles and to expand the training
program under the Second Highway Project.
Credit No. 126       Education Project:  US$2.2 million Credit of August 29, 1968
(as amended); Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The Project consists of (a) the construction and equipping of a
teacher training college at Moundou, and (b) the construction and equipping of
an agricultural technician training center at N'Djamena 2/ (transferred to
Sarh 3/ under Credit 251).
Project implementation is about 36 months behind schedule due to
(a) delay in reaching agreement on each stage of design; (b) the need to revise
the design and negotiate with the lowest bidder because of cost overruns;
(c) delay in reaching agreement on the location of the agricultural technician
training center; and (d) amendment of the Credit Agreement to resolve the
financial problems created by the US dollar fluctuation and budgetary diffi-
culties of the Government. The closing date has been postponed from March 1,
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

1974 to December 31, 1975. The Project is near completion and no further
extension of the closing date is forecast.
Credit No. 251      Second Education Project:   US$2.7 million Credit of
June 16, 1971 (as amended); Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The Project consists of (a) the construction and equipping of a
secondary technical school at N'Djamena; (b) supply of complementary equip-
ment for the existing vocational training center at N'Djamena; (c) the trans-
fer of the agricultural technician training center, financed under Credit 126,
from N'Djamena to Sarh; and (d) a study of young farmers' training schemes.
The Project is about 12 months behind schedule due to (a) delay in
reaching agreement on the educational programs and architectural requirements
for the secondary technical school; (b) delay in the procurement of instruc-
tional equipment for the technical secondary school, (c) delay in reducing
the cost overruns related to the agricultural technician training center; and
(d) amendment to the Credit Agreement to resolve the financial problems
created by the fluctuation of the US dollar and the budgetary difficulties of
the Government. The Project is now progressing satisfactorily and no exten-
sion of the closing date is forecast.
Credit No. 309      Livestock Development Project:   US$2.2 million Credit of
May 31, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The Project now comprises: (a) the construction of 18 new stock
wells and the repair and rehabilitation of 18 existing wells in the Batha
prefecture; (b) the establishment of two well maintenance units, including
their operating costs for the first two years; and (c) special studies carried
out by a Livestock Development Unit (LDU) established with UNDP assistance.
Although the Credit became effective in November 1972, project im-
plementation was begun only following the Board's decision to finance 100
percent of project costs, net of duties and taxes, and to establish a revolv-
ing account, which became effective in March 1974. The closing date of the
project has been postponed from June 30, 1975 to June 30, 1976. Works have
now started and progress is satisfactory. All needed equipment is delivered
and about 15 wells are expected to be completed by the end of 1975.
Credit No. 445      Drought Relief Fund Project; US$2.0 million Credit of
December 7, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The Project is designed to help people in areas affected by the
drought to re-establish their productive base; it comprises the following
eight sub-projects: equipment, buildings, technical assistance and operating
costs for underground water development; equipment and operating costs for
"Genie Rural", "Water Survey Bureau" and "Land Development" Department; equip-
ment, buildings and operating costs for the Livestock Service; construction
of warehouses and seed stores; equipment and inputs for a vegetable growing
pilot scheme; and equipment end operating costs for the Planning Department.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 4 pages
Physical execution and financial management of the project is
satisfactory, and five out of fifteen subprojects are completed or nearing
completion.
Credit No. 489      Sategui-Deressia Irrigation Project: US$7.5 million
Credit of June 28, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The Project covers the development of 11,000 ha in the Sategui-
Deressia plain under controlled flooding for rice production. It includes
(a) the construction of an intake on the right bank of the Logone River to
provide water for the whole irrigated area, protection dykes against high
floods for 5,000 ha, main canals and drains, feeder roads, buildings, a rice
mill and storage facilities (b) strengthening of the project authorlity with
management staff, facilities and equipment and (c) agricultural research and
in-service training.
A first call for bids was held in August 1974. Cost were so high
that it was decided to rebid under a new type of contract (management contract).
However, the new bids opened in June 1975 were equally unsatisfactory and can-
celled. Following a recent Board decision, consultants are preparing plans for
a 300 ha labor intensive pilot scheme. Depending on the results of this scheme,
a reappraisal of the project will be necessary and proposals will be submitted
to the Executive Directors in due course.
Credit No. 490       Second Highway Project:  US$3.5 million Credit of June 28,
1974; Closing date June 30, 1980
The Project comprises (a) a five-year program for improvement and
maintenance of feeder roads in cotton growing areas; (b) preinvestment studies
for about 120 km of cotton export routes; (c) a two-year training program for
DPW staff; (d) technical assistance for the reorganization of the road trans-
port industry; (e) a two-year traffic count on about 2,000 km of the most
important roads; (f) reconditioning of ferryboats and their interim maintenance
over a three-year period; and (g) feasibility study for replacement of ferry
boats and improvement of dock facilities.
Contracts for preinvestment studies (BCEOM), technical assistances
for the training program (ORT) and the management contract with Cotontchad for
the feeder road program will be finalized shortly. Because of a higher than
anticipated inflation rate, a substantial cost overrun is expected. In order
to reduce this cost overrun, the Government contacted the local UNDP office
for financing of the preinvestment studies. The UNDP approved in principle
the request and normal procedures to allocate about US$700,000 to this pur-
pose is underway. The Bank Group will be requested to act as executing
agency. The Government proposed and IDA approved the procurement of a re-
duced list of highway maintenance equipment, following local bidding. Inter-
national competitive bidding for 6 motors for ferry boats will be called
shortly.

The credit of US$5 million would finance 38 percent of total project cost net
of duties and taxes and would cover some 48 percent of the foreign exchange
requirements. The remainder of project cost would be financed as follows: the
African Development Fund, US$5 million covering 38 percent of total
project costs; USAID, US$1 million covering 8 percent; Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation (FAC), US$2 million covering 16 percent. ADF which cannot finance
goods or services supplied from countries which do not belong to it, would
finance alone 100 percent of the irrigation works built by local contractors,
100 percent of the procurement of PVC secondary distribution pipes, 100 percent
of the equipment required for construction of the irrigation works, and 100
percent of the construction contracts for staff housing and service centers
to be built by local contractors. USAID would finance 100 percent of the
agricultural research component for cereals.   IDA and FAC would jointly
finance the remaining project items, providing 71 and 29 percent of the
required funds respectively.

Procurement
Arrangements:            For those project items financed by IDA and FAC, the
following would apply: orders or contracts for equip-
ment, cement, vehicles, or chemicals, with a value of
more than US$25,000 would be through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA
guidelines. ADF and USAID procurement procedures
would apply to those project items they would
finance.
Consultants and
Experts:                  The Project Manager and the key staff of the Project
Unit would be provided by a consulting firm recruited

would be recruited by USAID under its own procedures.
Consultants would be engaged to help with the reor-
ganization of SODELAC.
Rate of Return:           The economic rate of return is estimated at 17 per-
cent.
