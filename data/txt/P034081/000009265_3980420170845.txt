Block 1: Project Description
1. Project Development Objectives
(see Annex I for key performance indicators)
The objectives of the project are: to provide flood protection for 103 million people in the North China Plain in rural
areas, several large and medium cities and major industrial centers; to control sediment accretion in the lower reach of
the Yellow River for a period of about 20 years; to generate much needed hydropower; and to supply irrigation water
(and increase the reliability of irrigation) for some 2 million hectares and ensure more stable water supplies for
downstream cities and industries.
2. Project Components
(see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
The project will finance the second stage in the construction of a dam and hydroelectric power plant on the Yellow River.
The main features of the Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project consist of dam and structures: (i) a rockfill dam, 154 m high,
with a crest length of 1,667 m and 51 million m3 of fill; (ii) a common intake structure, feeding nine large-diameter
tunnels and a surface spillway for river diversion, flood handling and sediment management; and (iii) a power station
with six power tunnels with turbines and generators with an installed capacity of 1,800 MW (6 x 300 MW). Civil works
have been under construction since 1994 under three Bank approved contracts awarded following ICB. The contracts
have an estimated total value to completion of US$883.2 million equivalent and Loan 3727-CH-A financed US$386
million of this amount. The proposed project will provide Bank funding for (a) completion of the civil works contracts;
(b) technical assistance for training in operation and maintenance (O&M) of the dam, powerhouse and related facilities
and planning and personnel training for operation of the project; (c) implementation of the environmental management
plan (EMP); (d) implementation of a flood, sediment, ice and drought management system and real time reservoir
operation system including training and equipment; and (e) implementation of water institutional support progran,
including optimizing institutional structures for regulation and management of water resources of the Lower Yellow
River reach, undertaking studies for pricing, improving financial management systems, upgrading water-level measuring
devices, and introducing communications systems.

3. Benefits and Target Population
Economic Benefits: The project will generate enormous benefits: (a) Flood control measures will substantially reduce
the risk of normal annual floods, ice-dam breaches, and major floods. The flood control benefits (about 18 percent of the
total) have been calculated in terms of damage reduction for agriculture, urban and industrial areas. Benefits from
avoidance of massive loss of human life and suffering have not been quantified. About 103 million people will benefit
from protection from infrequent catastrophic floods and about 3 million of some of the poorest people in China living
between the levees and in flood detention areas will benefit from prevention of annual and frequent floods (1-in-2 years
and less); (b) Sediment control benefits (about 7 percent of total) have been calculated in terms of reducing the
expenditures for levee raising and maintenance; (c) Power benefits (about 41 percent of total) will arise from power and
energy generation that would replace energy from fossil-fueled power plants; and (d) Irrigation and water supply benefits
(34 percent of total) will include a doubling of crop (mainly grain) yields and an increase in cropping intensities on about
2 million ha and make more water available to major cities and towns. The net present value of total economic benefits
is US$2.262 billion (see Annex 4). The economic rate of return calculated on this basis is about 20.8 percent. Project
investments would increase productivity and incomes of about 2.7 million farm families with incomes rising by
10.2 percent in Henan, and by 14.3 percent in Shandong. Urban families will benefit from flood control and a more
reliable water and power supply.
4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
Implementation period: 5 years (1997-2002).
Executing agencies: Yellow River Water and Hydropower Development Corporation (YRWHDC) and Ministry of
Water Resources (MWR).
Project Coordination. MWR has overall responsibility for the Xiaolangdi Project. A Central Project Leading Group
was established under the leadership of the State Council consisting of a vice-minister of MWR and directors from the
Ministry of Finance, the State Planning Commission, and Vice Governors of Henan and Shanxi Provinces to oversee its
management, resolve policy matters and solve interdepartmental/interagency problems. Since mid-1995, a Vice Minister
of MWR has been resident on-site to fulfill these functions.
Project Execution: The executing agency for implementing the dam, dam operations and maintenance, and EMP
components of the project is YRWHDC, which coordinates with the provincial project management offices of Henan and
Shanxi Provinces. YRWHDC is a state-owned enterprise whose main function is to build, operate and maintain the dam
and power station. The general manager of YRWHDC reports to MWR. MWR is the executing agency for the flood,
sediment, ice and drought management system, real-time reservoir operation system and water institutional support
components of the project. These organizations have performed well in implementing the first-stage project and will
remain in place for the proposed second-stage project.
Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing Arrangements: YRWHDC has submitted annually (since 1994) audit
reports of the project account, SOEs, and the special account for the first-phase project and these have been found to be
satisfactory. The State Audit Administration (SAA) undertakes these financial audits. Financial reporting is also
indicated twice yearly in the progress reports. In general, the accounting and financial reporting are well in place and in
order.
Environmental Management and Audits: YRWHDC has an environmental management office (EMO), which is
responsible for implementation of the environmental management plan (EMP). The detailed implementation of EMP is
performed by the international contractors at the damsite. Detailed monitoring of the compliance by contractors is
performed by EMO, which hires institutions such as the Reconnaissance Planning and Design Institute (RPDI) of YRCC
for air, water, land quality protection and construction safety; YRCC Water Resources Protection Institute (WRPI) which
monitors compliance of water supply and wastewater; and Yellow River Central Hospital Unit (YRCHU) for public
health, rat control and mosquito control. In addition, an international/local panel visits the site twice a year to review the

Country: China                                                   Project Title: Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project: Stage ll
work of the EMO. Although the implementation of the EMP is satisfactory, there needs to be improvement in the
monitoring. Hence, improvements have been recommended in Annex 8.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS Objective(s) Supported by the Project                      Report No. 1632 1-CHA, February 25, 1997
At the time of its appraisal in 1993, the Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project was found to be consistent with the Bank
Group's Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Board in August 1993 that emphasized poverty alleviation as the
highest priority objective. The current CAS, presented to the Board on March 18, 1997, is much more specific on how
these goals will be achieved. It specifically indicates investment in major water resource schemes in the dry north of
China, and the importance of flood control and water storage as part of the Bank's rural development lending program.
The proposed project, which would complete the highest-priority water resource development on the entire Yellow River,
will directly fulfill such objectives.
6. Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy
Flood control has high priority in China's national development program. The struggle to tame the Yellow River has a
prominent place in the earliest chapters of Chinese history. The fertile floodplain of the river has supported several of
China's great dynasties and is regarded as the cradle of Chinese civilization. However, the lands along the river have
also been the scene of great human suffering from floods, droughts, and famines. For example, as many as 900,000
people were killed in 1938 and the following years due to breaching of the flood dikes. Only since the founding of the
People's Republic of China can the river be said to have been placed partially under control through the heightening of
the 800 km of dikes along the river and through the establishment of flood-detention basins. Nevertheless, much remains
to be done. A great flood, like the one that visited the basin in 1843, could not be contained by the existing flood control
works, and would cause severe damage and loss of life of up to I million people. In addition, frequent lesser floods still
cause considerable damage to about 3 million of some of the poorest people in China, living between the dikes and in the
detention basins. The river also carries a vast quantity of silt that accumulates every year in the lower reaches of the river
and causes the riverbed to rise ever further above the surrounding land. To keep pace with this, the flood embankments
have to be raised at a rate of I meter every 10 years, costing several billion dollars for each dike raising.
In March 1992, the Bank and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) undertook the Yellow River
Investment Planning Study (Report No. 11 146-CHA, June 30, 1993). The aim of this study was to place water-related
investment options for the Basin in a consistent, basinwide economic framework, and to evaluate them with respect to the
development goals and the physical and economic constraints under which they operate. The study established that the
Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Dam is the most urgently needed, and the most economically viable multipurpose project
proposed in the basin. Without it, the specter of a major flood will continue to overhang the entire lower reach, including
some of China's most productive farmland and major oil fields. The Xiaolangdi Project would reduce the flood of record
to a level that could be contained by the existing flood embankments, which protects about 103 million people, and
would also greatly reduce damage from floods of a lesser frequency for the people who live within the dikes and
detention basins. The project is also designed to be operated in such a way that it would trap sediment for the first 20
years of its life. It would thereby prevent deposition of silt and make it possible to defer by 20 years the raising of
800 km of dikes.
7. Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices
The first-stage project addressed two important issues in sector development: the management of large multipurpose
projects and improvements in water resource planning. Accordingly, the project included (a) training and technical
assistance for YRWHDC in contract management, project scheduling, cost control, claims management, financial
management, management information systems, organizational support, corporate planning and personnel management;
and (b) an institutional program for MWR and YRCC to support the reform process in the water sector including
sustainable resource mobilization for water resources projects, economic water pricing, water licensing, enhancing

effectiveness of river basin organizations, and improved water-dispatching systems for basins. Based on the lessons
learned in the training and institutional development components in the first project, additional training and institutional
components have been incorporated into this second project.
8. Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection
The lower reach of the Yellow River is vulnerable to an extreme flood and a breach at any point in the dikes would have
disastrous consequences. Alternatives to Xiaolangdi for flood and sediment control, considered in the past, and the
reasons for their rejection are:
a) Raising the dikes to control a 1,000-year flood: this option is very costly and would involve considerable uncertainty
due to structural weaknesses of the dikes. It would not reduce sediment deposition in the lower reaches of the River
nor would it (nor any other nondam alternative) protect the millions living within the levees and detention basins;
b) Implementing large-scale conservation and rehabilitation measures in the Loess Plateau to reduce sediment loss at
source: this alone cannot solve the massive erosion problem in the operational future. The plateau covers over
500,000 km2 and, in some regions, is eroding at a rate of 8-13 mm a year;
c) Constructing an emergency flood channel parallel to the existing river course: this would require relocation of
700,000 to 930,000 people, disrupt irrigation, communication and transportation facilities, and present many difficult
technical problems;
d) Modifying the existing river channel configuration, or creating a new channel, abandoning part or all of the existing
channel: this would have the same effects as the option above. It would require resettlement of up to 500,000 people
and give no sediment control in the lower reaches.
9. Major Related Projects Financed by the Bank and/or Other Development Agencies
(completed, ongoing and planned).
* Two ongoing projects directly related to the proposed project are the Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project (Loan 3727-
CHA) and the Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project (Credit 2605-CHA).
* Since 1982, the Bank Group has financed eight projects (5 ongoing and 3 completed) in the Yellow River Basin to
improve drainage, irrigation efficiency, and related agricultural and rural development activities. Over 2 million ha
have benefited from these projects, most of which have been well managed and executed by the provinces and local
government authorities, and their specialized agencies.
* In 1994 the Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project was financed by Credit 2616-CHA in the amount of
US$150 million. This project has as one of its objectives a substantial reduction in sediment runoff from 15,600 km2
in the parts of the Yellow River Basin with the highest sediment yield. Excellent progress is being made in the
implementation of this project.
* Related projects outside the Yellow River Basin are mainly the hydropower projects: (a) Shuikou Hydroelectric
(Loans 2775/3515-CHA) and (b) Ertan Hydroelectric (Loan 3387-CHA)
10. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design
Lessons learned from previous and ongoing projects such as the Shuikou Hydroelectric (Loans 2775/3515-CHA) and
Ertan Hydroelectric (Loan 3387-CHA) Projects with similar dam construction requirements have been reflected in the
first-stage project and proposed second-stage project. These lessons include: (a) review of the project using international
technical panels and consultants who have made substantial contributions in improving the designs, economic impact
assessment, and resettlement planning and designs; (b) definition of civil works procurement packaging and joint-venture
arrangements between foreign and local contractors to obtain transfer of technology and best international practices;

(c) early startup of procurement for major civil works so that bid award will correspond with loan effectiveness in order
to avoid delays and cost overruns; and (d) stringent prequalification criteria to ensure all partners of foreign and local
joint ventures are adequately qualified to fulfill their responsibilities.
11. Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership
Aside from timely counterpart financing of both the first-stage and resettlement projects and provision of other resources
as needed, the Government has set up national and provincial steering groups including MOF and SPC, and moved a
responsible Vice Minister of MWR to residence on-site, which is indicative of strong borrower commitment.
12. Value Added of Bank Support
Bank involvement in the first-stage project is supporting the Central Government's effort in a major water resource
development with wide-ranging catastrophe prevention, irrigation, water supply, power, and other benefits that will cut
across several provinces. Bank involvement has assisted and will continue to assist the Government in resettlement
planning and implementation, and in the development of viable, autonomous river basin and project management
institutions for resource mobilization and efficient management of operations. The resettlement program of the project,
financed as a separate IDA project (Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project, Credit 2605-CHA), though huge (198,000 total
eventual resettlers), has proceeded more smoothly than resettlement operations without Bank support. Bank assistance in
the preparation of the multipurpose project through the Second Technical Cooperation Credit (Credit 1664-CHA) has
already made significant contributions to: (a) the establishment of YRWHDC, as a financially autonomous entity to
manage the sale of power and of water for irrigation and municipal and industrial users; and (b) clear definition of the
authority and responsibilities of the owner (YRW}HDC), the engineer, Xiaolangdi Engineering Consulting Company
(XECC), and the contractors.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments
(Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 4)
13. Economic Assessment                   Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV = US$2,262 million; ERR = 20.8 percent
(see Annex 4):
Cost-Benefit Analysis.
*  Economic appraisal of the project was undertaken using standard cost-benefit analysis techniques. All investment
costs (including resettlement costs of US$771 million),' including physical contingencies and operation and
maintenance costs, have been taken into account in estimating the economic costs of the project. Contributed labor
for farm construction and agricultural activities has been shadow-priced at the wage rate of Y 10/day prevailing in
the project area, and electricity at 40 fen/kWh. World Bank price projections were used to estimate farm-gate prices
in constant 1997 terms for traded outputs and inputs. Economic prices for nontradables were estimated using
conversion factors based on the deviation of social opportunity costs from actual financial prices.
*  Measured economic benefits derive from (a) hydropower output, (b) flood control, (c)cost-savings from sediment
control, (d) increased irrigation, and (e) improved reliability of urban water supply. The six generating units will
supply 1,500 MW of power and produce annual energy of 5,429 GWh when fully operational. Most of this energy
will supply peak demands and is valued at the rate of 52 fenlkWh established through forward sales contracts. Power
generation produces 41 percent of total discounted project benefits. Flood control benefits were estimated at losses
avoided based on a probability analysis of values of property protected, and the opportunity costs of lost farmer
production and income. They comprise 18 percent of total benefits. On average, 300-400 million tons of silt is
deposited along the lower reach of the Yellow River annually, requiring periodic dike-raising programs and ongoing
maintenance works. The dam will trap much of the incoming sediment in the early years of operation, and otherwise
Do not include price contingencies, transfer payments, taxes and duties.

manage sediment deposition by helping to pass silt-laden water to the Bohai Sea. These operations will reduce the
need for dike works amounting to a discounted cost savings of Y 2,817 million, or 7 percent of benefits. Irrigation
benefits derive from a larger and more timely water supply to about 2 million ha of irrigated land in Henan and
Shandong provinces. Currently severe seasonal water shortages mean that in most years, farmers cannot get
sufficient water in the spring and early summer months for maximum crop yields. About half of the reservoir's
shortage will be devoted to irrigation, with the result that grain production is expected to rise by about 686, 000 tons
per year, and cotton production, by 352,000 tons. Irrigation benefits comprise 30 percent of total benefits, and
directly target poor farmers in the region. Diversions from the Yellow River to Hebei-Beijing-Tianjin and Qingdao
city provide significant shares of the urban water supplies to these areas, which are unreliable at present. The dam
will significantly increase the reliability of these supplies, resulting in a discounted value of Y 1,717 million, or 4
percent of total benefits.
* Total discounted economic benefits are US$4,880 billion (Y 40.5 billion), and total discounted costs including O&M,
are US$2,618 billion (Y 21.7 billion). The economic rate of return is estimated to be 20.8 percent and benefit-cost
ratio, 1.86.
Cost Effectiveness. Given the multipurpose nature of the project, it is difficult to conceive of a combination of works
that could achieve the same objectives, let alone at a lower cost. The thermal alternative to the hydropower component
has been estimated to be twice the cost of the power components of Xiaolangdi. To establish the same level of flood
control would require a massive program of dike-raising costing perhaps as much as the dam itself. There are virtually
no alternatives to controlling sediment deposition, without which dike raising would become even more costly. There
are no alternative means of ensuring timely water supplies to the region's farmers except for the proposed South-North
transfer scheme. But that scheme, involving pumping water from the Yangtze, although eventually necessary, would
cost at least twice as much as Xiaolangdi with no flood control or power benefits. Groundwater supplies are already
exploited beyond safe yield levels, and the only other reservoir in the region, Sanmenxia, does not have sufficient
capacity to regulate flows for flood control or irrigation.
14. Financial Assessment                       FRR=I 1.3 percent (Total Project)
(see Annex 6)                                  FRR= 19.7 percent (Power Component)
Project Charges. Irrigation Charges. Since the mid-I 980s, it has been government policy that the charges for irrigation
water should be high enough to recover all the capital and O&M costs, while fees for M&I water should be raised to
levels ensuring a reasonable return for production investments. In line with this policy, YRCC increased its charges on
water diverted at the lower reaches of the Yellow River to a full cost-recovery level in the early 1990s. For the proposed
Xiaolangdi Project, YRWHDC would be able to fully recover its capital and operating costs by applying a uniform
surcharge on all water diverted to end users of YRCC distributed water. Equally, YRWHDC will also initiate charges for
flood and sediment control services which will be applied as a surcharge on the water bills for end users of YRCC. At
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Borrower that they would.: (a) develop, on the basis of guidelines
acceptable to the Bank and furnish to the Bank not later than December 31, 1998, a plan to ensure the efficient
(i) delivery of water to users of waterflowing through the lower reaches of the Yellow River and (ii) collection of water
charges from users of said water; and (b) implement said plan not later than June 30, 2000, taking into account the
comments of the Bank on the matter. Power Tariffs: An existing power sales agreement with the Henan Electric Power
Bureau provides that the Bureau will buy four-hour peak power from 2,700 GWh/yr in 2000, to 3,673 GWh/yr in 2001,
4,223 GWh/yr in 2002, and 5,105 GWh/yr in 2003 and thereafter. While the initial price has not been set, the agreement
specifies that it will be set along market principles to enable the YRWHDC to fully recover both operating and capital
costs as well as earn a fair return on invested capital. It is estimated that the tariff rate will be set at a base price of
approximately 52 Y/kWh or a US dollar equivalent of 6.3 cents.
Financial Management.  To increase financial incentives and accountability, the government has also greatly
decentralized its management system for the water resource sector. Water conservancy institutions were first asked to
adopt business management systems in the early 1980s. Since the late 1980s, they have been allowed to convert

themselves into publicly owned corporations whenever conditions permit, and become fully responsible for their
financial performance according to the Enterprise Law. This trend of decentralization is further enhanced by recent
government decisions to establish a market economic system in China.
Against this background, YRWHDC was set up in 1993 as an independent publicly owned enterprise with financial
autonomy and accountability (as have other publicly owned enterprises). To further enhance the financial accountability
of YRWHDC, profit centers (or unit) will be set up for the hydropower, water supply, and flood and sediment control
operations, and separate cost accounts will be maintained for each operating unit in order to fully assess the units'
contribution to the consolidated financial operations. Although cross-subsidization is not avoidable for this multipurpose
operation because of the very different financial circumstances of the three major operations, separate accounting will
track the cross-subsidization.
In addition to the organizational setup, the project would further enhance financial management of YRWHDC by
facilitating institution building, including (a) training in financial management for YRWHDC (see Annex 2); and
(b) financial performance targets for YRWHDC that would provide a framework for financial discipline (Annex 6).
With a view to obtaining economic efficiency and promoting prudent financial management, YRWHDC's operations will
meet the following requirements.
*  YRWHDC would take all measures, including but not limited to adjusting tariffs of all its services, to ensure that its
internal cash generation is sufficient to maintain a debt service coverage ratio for consolidated operations of no less
than 1.2 times in 2002 to 2007, and no less than 1.6 times thereafter;2
*  YRWHDC would take all measures, including but not limited to tariffradjustments of all its services to earn an annual
return on fixed assets as adjustedfor inflation3 of 2 percent in 2004 to 2007 and 5 percent thereafter;
*  YRWHDC would set water charges, including cost recovery forflood and control services, at levels such that it will
be able to fully recover all direct operating expenses during the first operating year and recover capital expenses by
the year 2010.
e  In terms of the management of working capital, once operations commence in 2001, YRWHDC will maintain a
current ratio of at least 1. 0.
To buffer the impact of varying hydrological conditions YRWHDC would maintain a cash or cash equivalent account
with a bank for unexpected shortfalls of cash during periods of low hydrology. Such account will be funded from
retained earnings and will be equal to at least 15 percent of annual operations and debt service requirements.
Future Finance. Annex 5 presents the financial assumptions and the financial projections are in Annex 6 for YRWHDC for
the period 1999-2010 along with a summary of important accounting principles employed by the Corporation and revenue,
cost and financial management assumptions. It is recognized that the Corporation will rely substantially on its power sales
to carry the finances of the enterprise. However, a reform progran has been established to enable YRWHDC to gradually
set and increase its charges for important services such as water supply, flood and sediment control. The projections reflect
an action plan of water and other tariff adjustments designed with YRWHDC so that it may be able to achieve a favorable
financial position throughout the entire projection period and achieve an overall pretax financial internal rate of return for
the project of 8.33 percent.
2 This represents a slight postponement of the requirement in Xiaolangdi I, which forecast a ratio of 1.2 from 2000.
3 Presently, accounts in China are revalued for inflation. However, given the importance of gauging total projected returns on an
appropriate fixed assets base, an off-the-books adjustment will be made annually by YRWHDC by applying the inflation index
published annually by the Henan State Statistical Bureau to its fixed assets base of the Corporation.

Actual power supply will fluctuate substantially with changing hydrological conditions. According to the available
hydrological data, the worst recorded multiyear dry period lasted for 12 years. If this worst multiyear dry period occurs
immediately after commissioning, it will cause an average annual reduction of 35 percent in power generation for almost
the entire repayment period. However, even under the worst scenario, peak power would only be reduced slightly
(around 5 percent); therefore, the extent that the sales revenue is reduced will depend mainly on the price differential
between peak and base power.
15. Technical Assessment:
Dam and Powerhouse. The Xiaolangdi dam site was selected after detailed studies of five alternative sites extending
over a 13 km stretch of the river. The site geology is well understood as a result of extensive and thorough explorations
dating from 1958.  Rock conditions on the left bank are considerably more favorable for the founding of concrete
structures and excavation of large tunnels and caverns, and this factor was taken into account in locating all ancillary
structures on this bank. An international panel of experts reviewed all aspects of the dam site geology and confirmed the
site selected by YRCC. Responsibilities for design and construction are described in Section 16.
The dam is a 1,667-m long earth and rockfill embankment. The maximum height is 154 m and the volume of fill is
about 51 million m3. Materials for construction of the dam are in abundant supply close to the site. The highest section
of the dam, about 500 m in length, is founded on alluvial sands and gravels, while the abutment sections are supported on
bedrock. Extensive investigations of the alluvium foundation have proven it to be dense, and dynamic analyses have
verified that liquefaction will not occur under the design earthquake.
Reservoir outflows for sediment management, flood handling and power are passed through 16 large-diameter tunnels
fed from a common intake tower with nine separate sections, each 60 m wide. The highest towers, which are those
feeding the sediment and power tunnels, are 112 m above their foundations. The grouping of these facilities is dictated
partly by geology and topography, but the compact intake structure and approach channel layout also allows operations
to keep all intakes free of siltation and debris. Total concrete volume is about I million cubic meters. Dynamic analyses
have been carried out to verify structural adequacy and strength under earthquake loading.
The underground powerhouse is located within the left ridge in a stratum of competent sandstone. The cavern has a span
of 26 m, a height of 45 m and a length of 193 m. There are six 7.8 m diameter power tunnels, one for each 300 MW
generating unit, and six basically rectangular free-flow tailrace tunnels 12 m wide x 16 m high.
In addition to the extensive site investigations and mathematical analyses supporting the design of these structures, 51
hydraulic model studies have been undertaken. Particular emphasis was given to sediment handling (11 models) and the
orifice tunnels (30 models), since both features are virtually unique to the current project. The international panel of
experts accepted, with minor modifications, the designs of the Yellow River Reconnaissance, Planning and Design
Institute (RPDI) after three missions during which they had discussions with RPDI and site visits. There have been five
detailed reviews by the international dam safety panel that have helped confirm the major design parameters and no
major changes have been made to the original design.
Reservoir Operation. The second-stage project will provide training for project staff to operate the reservoir to meet a
range of objectives (Annex 2). These are briefly described below.
The first objective of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir is to control flooding along the Yellow River below Huayuankou. The
reservoir will be operated to allow the level of protection to increase from the present 60-year return period to 1,000
years. The reservoir will also be operated to reduce the peak of a 10,000-year flood so that it will not overtop the dikes.
The project will also help to reduce flooding from ice jams in the river downstream of Xiaolangdi. Coordinated
operation of the Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi reservoirs will reduce river flows at the time of ice-jam formation and
thereby eliminate flooding.

Country: China                                                   Project Title: Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project: Stage II
The second objective is to manage the large volumes of sediments that are being carried by the river. The reservoir will
trap some of these sediments and pass the remainder through in a more controlled manner. This will result in a long-term
postponement in raising the dikes and thereafter reduce the frequency of subsequent raising of the dikes.
The third objective is to meet downstream water demands. The water demands along the Yellow River exceed the
available supply. Nevertheless, large volumes of runoff, particularly from the middle reach of the river, flow into the
ocean every year due to lack of capacity to store it for future use. The reservoir will provide some of the required storage
capacity. These demands in order of importance are municipal and industrial water supply diversions to Hebei and
Tianjin, irrigation requirements in Henan and Shandong provinces, firm energy production and water supply to the oil
industry in the lower delta as well as fresh water to maintain spawning and hatching of fish in the lower delta.
16. Institutional Assessment:
General. The Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) has overall responsibility for the project under the guidance of the
Central Project Leading Group (CPLG) set up by the State Council. At the provincial level, the provincial leading groups
of Henan, Shanxi and Yellow River Water and Hydropower Development Corporation (YRWHDC) guide project
management offices in implementation of both the resettlement program and the dam construction.
Executing Agency. YRWHDC is a state-owned enterprise whose main function is to build, operate and maintain the dam.
Its general manager reports to MWR. It has, at present, 100 staff, many of whom have been involved in the construction
of large dams and water resource projects. Its general manager (Vice Minister of MWR) is the former director of a
construction bureau and has been involved in the construction of several large dams. YRWHDC's resettlement office
(YRWHDCRO) will coordinate implementation of resettlement phasing with dam construction.
YRWHDC is responsible for preparation and execution of all tenders for goods, services and civil works. It is also
responsible for contract management, cost control and quality control of all civil works and plant and equipment
installation. It is assisted by the Xiaolangdi Engineering Consulting Company (XECC) for construction supervision; the
Reconnaissance, Planning and Design Institute (RPDI) of YRCC for design changes and new designs; foreign consultants
for contract management, cost control, etc.; and by a panel of experts to review major design and construction issues.
Since 1994, the international consultants have been working with and assisting YRWHDC and XECC staff and have
been undertaking on-the-job training for both groups of staff.
Construction Supervision. Construction supervision has been contracted to XECC, which acts as the "Engineer" for the
client and is responsible for construction supervision in terms of detailed fieldwork for quality control, authorization of
payments to the contractor, maintenance of a field laboratory for testing of materials, revision of design documents
according to field conditions, etc. Several of the staff of XECC are from design and construction bureaus that have had
long experience in implementing large dam projects. XECC, with support from YRWHDC and MWR and assistance
from consultants, has demonstrated its capability to manage such a large dam project.
Engineering Design and Technical Assistance. RPDI has been retained by YRWHDC to assist in design. It is one of the
most experienced design institutes in China, and in recent years it has completed the design of several large hydroelectric
projects. RPDI has over 3,000 professional staff and is equipped with modern facilities and laboratories. Nevertheless,
YRWHDC recognizes the complex nature of the construction activities of this project, and therefore has employed
foreign consultants to provide technical advice during the implementation of the project. These consultants have also
been actively involved in reviewing project design and resolving specific technical matters related to the dam,
powerhouse, equipment, and log passing facilities. A number of technical delegations and prominent hydropower
experts have visited the project site, offered valuable suggestions, and shared their experience with the Chinese in
building large and complex projects.
Panel of Experts. YRWHDC employs a dam safety panel (DSP) to assist in resolving particular project problems and in
advising on major design and construction issues. The DSP was appointed in March 1991. The original DSP consisted
of 14 experts in relevant technical specializations, of whom 2 were Chinese and 12 were internationals. Presently, the



Project Appraisal Document                                                                           Page 11
Country: China                                                     Project Title: Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project: Stage II
DSP consists of five experts (one Chinese, four internationals) who have been advising on detailed technical construction
matters and on construction schedules of the project. YRWHDC has had five meetings with DSP between 1994 and
1997 and has appreciated the advice given by the panel. With their assistance, technical and contractual issues have been
resolved.
Foreign Consultants. Due to the magnitude and complexity of the project and the use of foreign construction contractors
and equipment suppliers, YRWHDC has appointed experienced and qualified international consultants to assist in
managing project construction. The scope of work for the consultants includes contract administration, cost control,
scheduling, construction inspection and quality assurance, design engineering services, and construction site
administration during the entire implementation period. The consultants added considerable insight to construction
supervision, contract and claims management and quality assurance of designs.
Resettlement Coordination. Various agencies and jurisdictions are responsible for resettlement implementation. As a
representative of the owner of the Xiaolangdi Project, YRWHDC's Resettlement Office (YRWHDCRO) is responsible
for overall supervision and coordination of resettlement activities. It is assisted in this by RPDI and the Yellow River
Conservancy Commission Resettlement Office (YRCCRO). YRCCRO monitors progress independently and audits
reports prepared by the local government resettlement agencies and reports to YRWHDCRO. In addition, independent
monitoring of the welfare of the resettlers is undertaken by the North China Hydroelectric Engineering Institute's Social
Science Department (NCHEI). The institute was appointed in March 1993 and has conducted surveys of resettlers twice
annually. Most reports indicate that the resettlement program is very successful.
MWR has authority to ensure that guidelines for resettlement implementation are followed. Also, MWR can use this
authority to exert indirect control on the disbursements of project-related resettlement funds from the Ministry of Finance
to the provinces. In this way, MWR can act upon specific recommendations from YRWHDC. The MWR Resettlement
Office has assigned staff to coordinate and monitor the implementation of Xiaolangdi resettlement.
The provincial governments of Henan and Shanxi have ultimate authority for resettlement implementation and bear the
responsibility for the welfare of their citizens. The provincial Resettlement Bureaus are responsible for coordinating the
various levels of local government and departments involved with implementation. Once funds are released from the
Ministry of Finance, the provincial Resettlement Bureaus control the disbursement of resettlement funds. For this
reason, close liaison between YRWHDC/MWR and the provinces is maintained on a continuous basis.
17. Social Assessment
The social impacts of the project are those to do with project benefits and those resulting from the large program of
resettlement.
Project Benefits. The social benefits of the project arise from flood protection, irrigation and water supply. About 103
million people will benefit from protection from infrequent catastrophic floods and about 3 million of some of the
poorest people in China living between the levees and in flood detention areas will benefit from prevention of annual and
frequent floods (1-in-2 years and less). Higher yields and cropping intensities on about 2 million ha of irrigated land will
benefit directly over 7.7 million farm families and indirectly benefit many others involved in processing and marketing
of farm products. Several large cities will benefit from a more reliable water supply in a water-short area.
Resettlement. The project requires the resettlement of about 198,712 people in the moving year. This is being partially
financed by a US$110 million IDA Credit (2605-CHA). The people will be moved in four stages over an 18-year period.
About 56,074 people were resettled between 1992 and 1996 from the damsite and reservoir areas. This program of
resettlement is about nine months ahead of schedule.
The main objective of the resettlement plan is that both resettlers and host population affected will not be disadvantaged
by the project and their living standard will be improved or at least restored. Resettled families will be established in
new locations where the house, yard and amenities will be improved; the family's new earning potential will be at least

as good as previously; and income losses during transition will be compensated for. The following principles have been
adhered to in resettlement planning:
*  The methodology for land compensation calculation stipulated in the Law of Land Management 1986 as amended in
1988 is adopted. Land compensation should be used productively to restore and improve the living standard of the
relocatees and host populations.
*  Compensation for houses and caves should be paid at replacement costs.
*  Compensation should be paid at replacement cost for equipment, structures and other facilities in industries and
mines.
*  Infrastructure should be reconstructed to restore its original function. The cost should be estimated according to the
reconstruction technical design.
*  Resettlement of the agricultural population should be land-based wherever possible.
*  Land sharing with host villages should be based on the principle of mutual acceptance and should be planned so as to
provide higher incomes (from all sources) for relocatees and hosts.
*  Houses and community facilities at new town and village sites should be constructed to higher standards than
previously.
*  The financial resources to carry out the relocation and development proposals should be available when and where
required. Development plans should be prepared in concert with relocation plans.
*  All the daily wage laborers will receive a compensation equal to 3-6 month salary.
*  If sharing farmlands does not result in achieving target incomes some of the labor force should be offered
nonagricultural employment opportunities.
The resettlement project has three main components: (a) residential and infrastructure development; (b) transfer of
resettlers; and (c) livelihood development, vocational training, monitoring, supervision and social adjustment. These are
described in detail in Report 12527-CHA and updated plans are briefly summarized below.
*  Residential and Infrastructure Reconstruction. This component will consist of constructing 233 villages and 11
2
towns for the resettlers. About 49,800 new houses will be built covering a floor space of 4.29 million m2. Almost all
houses will be made of brick and will be provided with piped water supply, proper sanitation, electricity, drainage,
etc. Public facilities such as schools, hospitals, clinics, cultural centers, etc. will be built to service all new villages
and towns. Commercial and industrial enterprises will be reconstructed in the new sites. New infrastructure will
include roads, transmission lines, communications lines, broadcasting facilities, water supply works, hydraulic
stations and other special items to service the settlement areas. A total of 1,832 km of roads will be built. Every
village will be serviced with electricity requiring the construction of 667 km of power lines and other facilities.
Twenty-seven wharves around the reservoir will be built and 132 ferries procured. A total of 524 km of telephone
lines and broadcasting facilities will be built to guarantee that every village is well linked with communications.
*  Transfer of Relocatees. This component makes special provisions for transfer of all salvageable materials and
personal belongings, factory machinery and other goods from the present to the new sites. A total of 32 percent of
the people will be moved downstream to 34 host sites on the Wenmengtan plain and in three counties in Kaifeng, 42
percent will move to new townships within their home counties at 120 host sites, and another 13 percent will move
back away from the reservoir perimeter within their home townships to 101 host sites. The town population totaling
3 percent of the people will be moved to the 11 new towns created in the eight affected counties.

Country: China                                                    Project Title: Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project Stage II
*  Livelihood Reestablishment. This component, designed to reestablish the livelihoods of the rural relocatees in
agriculture, comprises irrigation, dryland development and the reestablishment of sideline activities.  Several
production models have been studied and proposed for agriculture resettlement. The population to be resettled into
agricultural production will share existing land resources with the host population. A total of 206,406 mu of land
would be acquired for the resettlers in the hosting areas to ensure 1.2 mu of agriculture land per relocatee and 3.8 mu
per agricultural laborer. Significant resource development investments are planned in irrigation, land improvement,
crop diversification and sideline activities to increase land productivity and maintain the living standard of both the
resettlers and host population. Agricultural improvements cover an area of about 166,500 mu. These improvements
will include completion of the Houhe Irrigation Scheme of about 75,000 mu and the Wenmengtan Scheme, which
will protect about 200,000 mu of cultivated land and create about 81,000 mu of new land for the resettlers.
*  It was previously planned to develop or expand 84 county-based enterprises to create employment for 20,528 surplus
rural laborers between 1993 and 2000. It was noticed, however, that after 1,700 jobs were established in these
county-based industries that these jobs were not very stable. The resettlement offices also found that township and
village industries were more dynamic than these county-based industries. Given the instability of county-based
industrial employment and based on lessons learned in the Phase I resettlement, the resettlement strategy has been
modified to resettle all affected rural population in agriculture, allocating farmland for every resettler, with concerted
efforts in diversified off-farm activities, including forestry, animal husbandry, aquaculture, service industries and
village industries. This strategy has been fully reflected in the detailed resettlement designs for Phases II, III and IV.
In addition, the latest inventory of the reservoir area indicated an increase in the number of factories and mines in the
reservoir area, including 234 industries and mines in Phase II and 554 in Phases III and IV. Detailed resettlement
designs have been completed for Phase II and preliminary designs have been completed for Phases III and IV. After
detailed consultation with the individual industries, for Phase II, 20 of the enterprises will be relocated and 128 will
switch to new production. Eighty-five will go out of production with compensation. Detailed consultation with
villagers was held in 1996 and detailed resettlement designs are under way for industries and mines in Phases III and
IV. Regular industrial employees will be employed in new (fewer cases) or expanded industries and the temporary
daily laborers will be paid a compensation of three to six times their salary and they are assured alternative
employment.
Implementation schedule. Resettlement is planned to be carried out in four stages. Phase I Resettlement at the damsite
occurred between 1992 and 1994. Phase II (below EL 180) is planned to be implemented from 1994 to November 1997
when the cofferdam is completed and the river will be closed requiring the resettlement of 46,133 people. Phase III
(El 180-265) will take place from 1997 to 2000, resettling 118,985. Phase IV (EL 265-275) will take place from 2010 to
2012, requiring the resettlement of another 23,020 persons by 2011. Overall, 198,712 people will require relocation and
rehabilitation on account of the creation of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir.
Resettlement cost. The appraised resettlement cost in 1993 was US$571 million. With the latest inventory, price
escalation and optimization of resettlement designs, the resettlement cost was reestimated and reviewed by the Bank.
The total cost amounts to US$839 million, including US$752 million for the reservoir resettlement, US$68 million for
Wenmengtan Scheme and US$19 million for Houhe Scheme. SPC has reviewed and will approve the revised
resettlement budget in a phased manner-Phase II had already been approved in April 1997, and Phase III and IV will be
approved in September 1997.
Resettlement progress. At the damsite 12 resettlement villages have been established with complete community
amenities of water supply, power supply, road, communication and broadcasting. A total of 2,315 households have
2
moved into new houses with a total area of 296,000 m . Some 8,500 mu of cultivated land have been allocated to the
resettlers and the objective of one mu of cultivated land per capita has been achieved. Seventeen enterprises have
employed 963 resettlers and the affected villages have set up 31 rural enterprises and 408 resettlers have been employed.
In Phase II Resettlement, 11,268 households (45,500 people) have finished their house construction with a total area of
1,011,000 m2 . The house completion rate was 88 percent by October 31, 1996. Also, by October 31, 1996, 16,580



Project Appraisal Document                                                                         Page 14
Country: China                                                    Project Title: Xiaolangdl Multipurpose Project: Stage II
people in 4,478 households had moved into their new houses. Although 88 percent of the households (9,915) have
completed their houses, only 40 percent of them (4,478) have moved as whole families. The rest of the households are
living in the old and new places to maximize their incomes during the transitional period. The new housing is expected
to be completed by December 31, 1996 and most families would start to move to the new area and the entire movement
of people will be completed by June 1997. Of the planned 38,781 mu of cultivated land, 34,467 mu of land had already
been allocated to the resettlers by the end of 1996, including 26,654 mu of irrigated land. Extensive on-farm
development works are under way to provide irrigation to the resettlers. After land acquisition for the resettlers, all
hosting villages have redistributed their remaining farm land among the villagers. In the meantime, they have either used
the land compensation on farm development to raise productivity of their remaining land or have started off-farm and
side-line economic activities to restore income losses due to land acquisition. By the end of 1996, 28 township and
village enterprises had been established.
The sample investigation of early 1995 carried out in the damsite area covered 82 families. As the results indicate, the
per capita net income was increased from Y 485.8 before resettlement to Y 1,104.3 in 1995. The number of families with
different income levels included:
Per Capita          No. of families                           No. of families
Income (Y)       before resettlement        Percent          after resettlement        Percent
<300                  35                   42.7                  19                   23.2

500-800                16                    19.5                 15                    18.3
800-1,000                3                    3.7                  10                    12.2

The income composition before resettlement was 48.4 percent by farming, 39.4 percent by industrial activities, and 12.2
percent by sideline activities. After resettlement, the percentages are, respectively, 15.3, 68.4 and 16.3 percent, showing
that industrial jobs are now the major income source, and that less importance is attached to agricultural production. This
degree of switching may actually be excessive if it occurs on a large scale. The local resettlement offices may need to
provide more input for development of farmland, for the sake of income security.
The follow-up survey covering the period December 1995 to August 1996 covered a total of 460 families from the
damsite area and the reservoir area, about 17 percent of the total families involving 37 villages (2,730 families).
According to the results, the net per capita income levels are categorized as follows (the average per capita income is
Y 1,110/year):
Income (Y)   Number of families   Percent
<300              28              6.1
300-500            35               7.6
500-800            73              15.9
800-1,500          128             27.8
>1,500            196             42.6
*  Industrial and sideline activities contribute more than 80 percent to the total income. These incomes of resettlers are
much higher than the preresettlement status. In most cases, incomes have risen over 100 percent. A detailed
progress report of the resettlement activities and updated Resettlement Action Plan has been completed in February
1997 and is summarized in Annex 9.
Accounts and Audits. As a first step, the general principles of enterprise accounting have recently been revised by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and these are now consistent with international accounting standards. Within this broad



Project Appraisal Document                                                                        Page 15
Country: China                                                   Project Title: Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project: Stage II
framework, specific accounting standards has been developed with the assistance of the Bank Group under the Financial
Sector Technical Assistance Project (Credit 2423-CHA).
Previously, YRWHDC established two sets of accounts, one set for capital construction and the other for operation.
Since these two sets of accounts were not consolidated, the balance sheet for operations did not include construction
work-in-progress and the related financing. However, under the newly revised general principles set forth by MOF,
enterprises will have to consolidate the capital construction accounts with the operations accounts. YRWHDC has
consolidated its accounts with help from consultants included as part of the first-stage project.
Audits of Bank-financed projects have been conducted by the State Audit Administration (SAA) Foreign Investment
Audit Bureau, or by one of the Provincial Audit Bureaus (PAB) under its guidance. YRWHDC's annual accounts are
audited by SAA under the first stage project and this arrangement will continue. YRWHDC has developed an internal
auditing section which periodically will examine the accounts of each operating unit.  The objective of these
examinations is primarily to test for accuracy and compliance with MOF regulations. The section serves as liaison
between external auditors and the project entity.
Monitoring. YRWHDC and MWR monitor the project's progress and keep a current account of physical and financial
progress of each of their respective project components. Physical indicators include such items as civil works (for dam,
intake and outlets, and power house), equipment and materials to be procured and training undertaken. Financial reports
track project expenditures and claims for disbursement against loan proceeds. Information on financial and physical
progress are presented in semiannual progress reports prepared by YRWHDC, for submission to the Bank in April and
September each year.
18. Environmental Assessment:     Environmental Category  [x] A    [ ]   B    [I  C
The major environmental threat in the lower Yellow River region is catastrophic flooding. Xiaolangdi will offer virtually
complete protection in the downstream reaches against the 1-in-1,000-year flood. Due to the initial sediment trapping
and longer-term sediment regulation operations in Xiaolangdi, the project will also defer dike raising and strengthening
for 20 years and reduce the magnitude of dike reconstruction thereafter. An updated environmental impact assessment
(EIA) was completed in February 1997 (updated from the initial EIA made in December 1992) and the updated EIA
summary (EIA/97) was distributed to the Board on March 11, 1997.
Although the EIA covers all environmental aspects, the updated EIA confirms the identification of three environmental
issues as being of primary importance: (a) dam stability and safety, (b) cultural heritage; and (c) public health. The
findings on these are summarized in the following:
Dam Safety. This issue was the subject of extensive analysis by YRCC and DSP. The assessments of and provisions for
dam safety are believed to be the most detailed ever undertaken for a major dam. A wide range of safety features are
provided in the project design including: (a) access road systems are located so that, if access to one bank is interrupted,
access to the other bank will be maintained; (b) a comprehensive communications system will be provided, including
microwave and radio; (c) emergency power supplies are available; (d) an integrated reservoir flood regulation plan has
been prepared to utilize all reservoir capacities to minimize flood hazards under extreme flow conditions; (e) emergency
response planning has been completed to account for possible failure of the coffer dam during construction; (f) a Flood
Emergency Response System has been established and is operational in the lower basin and elsewhere.
The water mass of the reservoir may increase the risk of induced earthquakes in or near the reservoir area. Because the
damsite is in a region prone to earthquakes, seismic sensitivity has been given particular attention. Studies were
undertaken by YRCC including geological mapping of the area, a thorough review of reservoir-induced earthquakes
within China and abroad, and detailed earthquake probability assessments. These studies led YRCC to conclude that the
potential magnitude of induced earthquakes subsequent to flooding of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir is between 5.5 and 5.6 on
the Richter scale.

Country: China                                                    Project Title: Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project: Stage II
As agreed between YRCC and DSP, the dam, embankments and intake tower have been tested by modeling for stability
during a postulated earthquake of magnitude 6.25 on the Richter Scale with a hypocentral distance of 10 km and a
corresponding horizontal peak acceleration of 0.5 g. The results indicate that the dam, embankment and the intake
towers would not be endangered under these conditions. The seismic design of the dam is considered to be fully
consistent with the best state of the scientific knowledge on these aspects.
As noted in the updated EIA (EIA/97), the XLD seismic monitoring network consists of 9 seismoscopic stations,
I repeater center, and I data processing center. The network uses telemetry module-module antenna transmission,
visible and magnetic-medium recording, man-machine interaction, and computer real-time data processing. Network
construction was started in December 1994 and the overall network put into operation in November 1995. The system
2
focuses on the area 40 km upstream and 8 km downstream, covering a total land area of 1,400 km . Within this range
any seismic event at ML=0.5 will be recorded with epicenter positioning accuracy within 0.5 km. During the period from
November 1, 1995 to December 31, 1996, a total of 26 minor seismic events, with no consequences, were measured in
the network area and vicinity.
Cultural Heritage. The Yellow River runs through the "Cradle of Chinese Civilization," and archeological relics are
plentiful throughout the river basin, especially in the main population and farming areas of the middle and lower river
reaches but less so near the dam site.
A comprehensive archeological exploration, classification and salvage program has been undertaken to locate, recover
and protect important underground and surface relics and cultural treasures in the inundated area. To date, work has
focused in the area of known and important sites, and priority has been given to those areas that will be flooded first.
There will be more time available to complete the required work in the host areas and the inundated areas at higher
elevations. The EIA team, together with their government counterparts with expertise in the subject area, have monitored
the salvage and curation of these archeological relics. The overall budget for the archeological detection and salvage
program makes provision for exploratory borings, excavation, relocation and reconstruction. The archeological relics
protection program is on schedule, and all critical tasks are expected to be completed within budget and according to
plan. About 70 percent of the cultural relics have been salvaged from the reservoir areas and 30 percent will be
completed in this phase of the project.
Details on the relics program are given in Tables 4.2.4.4-1 and 4.2.4.4-2 in the revised EIA/97 for Henan and Shanxi
provinces respectively. Some 285 relics of graves, pottery, house foundations, structures, stone tablets, etc., dating
hundreds of years have been retrieved. These tables show that, for Henan Province, the only remaining major work is for
relocation of the Xiwo Grottoes, to be completed in 1997-2000, and that the bulk of the work in Shanxi province had
been completed by the end of 1996.
Public Health. The prevalent communicable diseases common in the project area and for which the incidence could be
increased by the project without proper controls, are malaria, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and sanitation-related
enteric diseases including dysentery, hepatitis and typhoid.
The project will change the hydrology of the Yellow River by creation of a reservoir, and by providing an opportunity for
increased irrigation of the surrounding and downstream agricultural areas. These changes will modify the ecological
conditions for vector-borne diseases such as malaria and encephalitis, and for communicable diseases such as dysentery,
hepatitis and typhoid. Inundation of the reservoir area will also force out-migration of disease-bearing rats, almost
certainly resulting in an increased hazard of hemorrhagic fever in the surrounding area and population. The influx of
construction workers will increase the risk of both insect-borne and sanitation-related enteric diseases in the vicinity of
the construction and host areas.
The public health vector control and sanitation programs to be implemented by the contractors at the damsite, with
assistance from subcontractors including the Yellow River Central Hospital Unit (YRCHU) and local Antiepidemic
Stations, are the following:

*  Malaria and Encephalitis. During the construction phase, medical screening of construction workers (800 to 1000
workers per month) for carriers of malaria (as well as other contagious diseases), and routine spraying of
construction site buildings and breeding areas to control mosquitoes are being undertaken. The screening reveals that
the present incidence levels are very low (0-0.1 percent). During the operation phase, disease prevention will be
undertaken in both the reservoir and irrigation areas comprising periodic medical checks of the affected population to
determine malaria incidence, and periodic monitoring of potential mosquito breeding sites for anopheline larvae to
determine the need for special control measures. The encephalitis control program is similar to that for malaria,
except that different mosquito species are involved. No malaria has been reported in the region which has been or
will be affected by the project, and one incident of encephalitis was promptly controlled.
*  Hemorrhagic Fever. Rats are the principal vectors of hemorrhagic fever. The prevention and control program to be
implemented during the construction and operation stages consists of: (a) destruction of rodents in the area
inundated prior to inundation; (b) monitoring rodent density and the incidence of hemorrhagic fever in the peripheral
area around the reservoir in the year prior to inundation; and (c) monitoring after inundation and applying rodent
control and medical treatment as required. Monitoring data indicate that there has been no incidence of hemorrhagic
fever between 1994 and 1997.
* Sanitation-Related Enteric Diseases. Enteric diseases are being controlled by hygiene, provision of clean water and
adequate sanitation facilities at the construction site and in all resettlement village areas. Contract documents require
construction contractors to comply with relevant provisions and the Environmental Management Office monitors
compliance. Enteric diseases are prevalent in the damsite vicinity because of the large numbers of local workers who
live on the periphery of the damsite and who do not come under the jurisdiction of the damsite sanitation program.
However, the incidence of enteric diseases is much lower than baseline levels originally in the villages close to the
damsite. For the resettlement villages, these hazards are being controlled by provision of safe water supply and
adequate sanitation facilities together with village clinics. Monitoring of these facilities, including adequacy of
construction and operation, will be upgraded in 1997, as part of the Stage II conditionality, to ensure that enteric
disease rates will be maintained at low levels.
Other Significant Environmental Issues (SE]s). Other forms of impact analyzed include fisheries (in-stream, aquaculture,
estuarine and coastal), water quality, land accretion in coastal areas, inundation of physical resources, landslides in the
reservoir, reservoir seepage, reservoir area clearing, rare species and special habitats, wetlands, and global environmental
issues. The analyses showed that the adverse effects on these impacts will be small and controllable with suitable
mitigation and offsetting measures. Some forms of impact (e.g., on greenhouse gas emissions) are assessed as being
positive. In addition the updated EIA includes evaluation of the issues of public participation, compliance with
environmental laws, environmental economics, and environmental risk assessment.
Environmental Management Plan Improvements. The experience in implementing the Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) specified in EIA/92 and in the Stage I Appraisal has shown, as expected, the need for improving the plan to
achieve the target level of environmental protection (Annex 8). The recommended improvements, to be part of the Stage
II Agreement, include: (a) separation of the present Expert Panel on Environment and Resettlement into two panels, one
on environment and one on resettlement, (b) separation of the present EMO under the Resettlement Office into two
EMOs, namely EMO/Dam Project and EMO/Resettlement, together with (c) provision of expertise in environmental
monitoring technology and of special environmental training, to assist the EMOs and all others involved in implementing
the EMP, in achieving the desired goals with maximum efficiency.

The participatory approach under the project as summarized above is generally very satisfactory.
20. Sustainability
The design of the dam is based on similar upstream dams functioning under large silt loads, and the designs have been
tested by prototype technical studies. The safety factors used were conservative. The sustainability of technical
operation of the project is therefore as certain as possible, given state-of-the-art technology in design of large dams.
Project charges for power and water supply needed to recover the capital costs and to finance operation and maintenance
are not excessive, making financial sustainability reasonably certain.

conditions, unless provinces upstream of the dam significantly increase
their consumption of Yellow River water.
Risk Minimization Measure. The State Council has established strict
limits on consumption of Yellow River water for all provinces bordering
the river.

training operators of the reservoir. A state-of-the-art, computer-based
reservoir management system is being developed by international
consultants.
Overall project risk rating
Overall Risk                               NR       China's long experience with constructing and operating dams similar to
Xiaolangdi has been drawn upon, as well as the advice of numerous
international experts. A large-scale physical model of the Lower Reach
and the dam has been thoroughly tested. Several mathematical models of
various aspects of the dam's characteristics have been developed and
tested for design and operational aspects.
Note: MR = modest risk and NR  low or negligible risk.
22. Possible Controversial Aspects
Large dams are often controversial. In the case of Xiaolangdi some international critics raised questions regarding the
project during the processing of the first-stage Bank Loan. These were carefully reviewed and the Government and the
Bank provided answers that in their view were responsive. Resettlement is the area where most dams attract criticism
and disputes. In the case of Xiaolangdi, this has been and will continue to be avoided by the commitment of the
Government, the Provinces, and the project authorities to careful planning and efficient execution of the resettlement
plan, with the continuing financial assistance of Credit 2605-CHA (Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project) and intensive Bank
Group supervision of that project.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
ANNEX 2: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Project Component 1-Dam and Appurtenant Structures and Hydropower Plant-US$2,218 million (total cost of
component; phase 11 US$1,068 million). The main features of the component are:
* construction of Xiaolangdi rockfill dam, 154 m high, with a crest length of 1,667 m;
* construction of a common intake structure, feeding nine large diameter tunnels and surface spillway for river
diversion, flood handling and sediment management, discharging into a common plunge pool; and
construction of a power station with six associated power tunnels with turbine and generators with an installed
capacity of 1,800 MW (6 x 300 MW) and associated switchyards, and transformers
Site Selection and Reservoir Sizing. The control of floods and the management of silt deposition in the lower reach of
the Yellow River require a site with ample storage capacity, as close to the upstream end of the lower reach as possible.
Xiaolangdi is the only project below Sanmenxia capable of storing an appreciable amount of sediment while maintaining
the long-tern capabilities of flood control and of managing the deposition of silt downstream. With its strategic location
within a deep valley and yet close to the upstream end of the lower reach of the Yellow River, Xiaolangdi cannot be
replaced by any other project to achieve the same objectives. The possibility of developing the Yellow River between
Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi in stages has been considered. Along that stretch of the river, eight dam sites were considered
out of which Renjiadui, Eight-Li Lane and Xiaolangdi were the best. These sites are respectively located at 38.5, 100 and
131 km downstream of Sanmenxia.

A three-stage cascade development would have three low dams with a total effective storage volume of 500 million m
This scenario would not satisfy the multipurpose requirements of flood control, ice-jam prevention, sediment
management, water supply and power generation. While the cost of the three dams is less than the cost of one large dam,
the sediment and flood discharge facilities would be 4 to 5 times the cost of such facilities at Xiaolangdi as a one-stage
development. This is because the size of the sediment and flood bypass tunnels would have to be larger for each of the
three low head-dams in order to pass the same volumes at much reduced heads. There are therefore no great economies
to be had by opting for a multistage development.
A two-stage development with two medium-high dams would feature a run-of-the-river type plant at Reniiadui. With
this scenario, Xiaolangdi reservoir would only store I billion m3 of sediment, as compared to 7.55 billion m for a single-
stage development. With respect to flood control, a flood storage volume could be provided of 3.60 billion m as
compared to 4.05 billion m3 for a single-stage scheme. A two-stage cascade development was recognized as a costly
compromise solution and a single, high dam at Xiaolangdi was clearly the preferred alternative.
Geological investigations of the site were started in 1958 and have continued ever since. Studies by YRCC confirmed
the suitability of the site for its intended multipurpose development. At the initiative of the State Planning Commission
(SPC) and the Research Center for Rural Development, a meeting was convened in March 1983 with broad participation
to discuss the long-term program of harnessing the Yellow River. In its 1983 report, the meeting concluded that the
crucial problem in harnessing the river is the effective management of its sediment load. Dikes alone are not the long-
term solution. A substantial decrease in sediment delivery from the Loess Plateau into the Yellow River by means of soil
and water conservation can only be expected after a considerable period of time. The meeting concluded that the
Xiaolangdi single dam project, with its flood prevention capability and sediment storage capacity, is the desirable next
step in the development of the river. The Bank's own Yellow River Investment Planning Study of 1993, as well as
international consultants and the panel of experts have repeatedly confirmed the findings of the Chinese studies, over the
past several years.
Design Flood. The present dikes are able to safely pass a flow of 22,000 m3/s at Huayuankou. At this flow there are still
several meters of freeboard in the dikes. The dikes will start to overtop when the flow is 30,000 m3/s (once in 200 years).
Between 22,000 to 30,000 m 3/s the dikes are unsafe and the probability of dike breaching increases to 100 percent as

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
flow nears 30,000 m3/s. Without the Xiaolangdi Dam the flood flow for frequencies of 100, 1,000 and 10,000 years
measured at Huayuankou are 24,500, 32,000, 45,000 m3/s, respectively. The probable maximum flood at Sanmenxia is
estimated at 51,000 m3/s. The present level of protection by the dikes is very low considering the value of the assets
invested in the lower reach environs estimated to be about $400-600 billion. This does not include the large number of
lives that could be lost in the event of a catastrophic flood with a frequency of 100-year recurrence and upwards.'
Flows as low as 10,000 m3/s (1 in 2 year flood) will inundate 1.4 million people in the floodplain. At a flow of 22,000
m3/s, 2,000 villages in the floodplain will be entirely inundated and about 1.7 million people will have to be moved out of
the floodplain and the Dongpinghu detention basin. At a flow of 30,000 m3/s, a further 1.4 million people will be
inundated in the Beijingdi Detention Basin and the Zhongguan oilfield, which produces about 10 percent of China's oil
will be inundated. Beyond 30,000 m3/s, the breach of the dike is certain.
The Xiaolangdi Dam and reservoir is designed to operate with all the other reservoirs (Guxian, Luhun and Sanmenxia) to
mitigate catastrophic floods up to once-in- 10,000-years frequency, removing all possibility of dike breaching. A flood of
45,000 m3/s is reduced to 27,500 m3/s and may pass through with a relatively good probability of dike endurance. A
once-in-1,000-year flood with the dam is reduced to 22,500 m3/s and will pass through the lower reach safely. In
addition, the dam will be operated to reduce very dramatically the smaller floods in the floodplains, which displace about
1.4 million people every other year. For example a 12,000 m3/s flood (once in seven years), which would displace about
1.4 million people in the floodplain, would be reduced to about 6,000 m3/s, which would be contained within the river
channel and hence would not displace anybody. The detailed dam and power station parameters are provided in Table 1.
In the 1843 flood of 33,000 m3/s (slightly over I in 1,000 years), there were 54 breaches and the flood inundated 11,0o0 km2. In
present-day terms, this flood would affect about 9.2 million people and probably kill about 100,000 people.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
Project Component 2-Training for Operation-US$4.34 million (total cost of component; phase II $1.42 million)
During the first-phase project, most of the training was focused on training YRWHDC staff on construction management
(cost control, contract management, scheduling). In this phase of the project, the main emphasis will be to complete the
training on construction management and proceed more strongly into training for operation of YRWHDC after construction.
The main objectives of the second phase program are:
*  to enable YRWHDC to function as a autonomous body in the efficient development and operation of water and
hydropower projects, and be capable of exploiting opportunities expected to arise from the current wave of enterprise
reform in China; and
*  to staff YRWHDC with appropriately skilled personnel capable of handling the planning, general management, and
financial management during the running of YRWEDC as a business enterprise.
Scope: Training will relate to senior and middle management who will receive training in a wide range of general and
financial management tools. These would include organizational arrangements, planning, monitoring and performance
evaluation, management information systems, advanced management skills development, management of change,
budgeting, costing, auditing, quality assurance, information technology, computer skills and personnel management. Some
initial overseas training for top management has been performed in 1993/94 in some of the general and financial concepts,
which would be useful in the early stages of YRWHDC's development. Much of the future training would, however, be
carried out at various stages of the implementation phase, with particular emphasis on ensuring preparedness for the post-
implementation phase.
The general approach would be:
-  From 1997 to 1998, more emphasis will be placed on development of individual general and financial management
skills and management and financial reporting systems for senior and middle management to get equipped for the
transition.
-  From 1999 to 2002, training on change management for senior and middle management and extensive training on new
operational conditions and procedures for supervisory and clerical staff will be provided to ensure smooth transition
from implementation to operation stage.
Organization of Training: While most of the training for senior management would need to be carried out overseas, as
much of the remaining program as possible would be conducted in China. This would enable a greater number of staff to be
covered by the program at less cost and would also enable the program to relate more readily to the operating environment
in China. The level of language skills of the trainees would also need to be considered in developing the training materials
and conducting the courses.
The training program should be undertaken with assistance from an overseas agency, which would arrange or undertake the
overseas element, and also be involved in the implementation of the remainder of the program in China. An organization
currently involved in the management of a large-scale organization with responsibilities in a river basin environment would
be well suited to undertake this assignment. The organization would also need a clear understanding of the way in which the
employees of a recently created and developing corporation can best be trained and developed to operate and carry out its
functions in a businesslike and efficient manner. This organization might have its own training capability or could work
with other training establishments to implement the program.
There is a clear understanding of the areas of training that need to be addressed during the period covered by the training
program, but it is impossible to be certain that the actual needs will be as now understood. It is for this reason that a
provision for some 30 percent of the total training program has been left unspecified. This provision is a direct reflection of
new and specific requirements that can be expected to emerge in the early part of the training period in the light of the
training undertaken and the experience gained by senior management in the early stage of the development of YRWHDC.
Full account would also need to be taken of the advice and experience of the overseas organization appointed by the

corporation to assist with the implementation of the program. A formal review of the training needs should be undertaken
after 18 months from commencement and at similar intervals throughout the training program to take account of such
revisions as may be necessary. The controlled flexibility within this approach allows for the dynamic nature of the
developing training needs that can be expected to arise during a period of significant change.
Implementation. Provision has been made in the program for the training of some 120 employees in skills relevant to their
responsibilities. Provision has been made for the training of a further 40 employees whose need for training is only likely to
emerge during the period covered by the training program. Allowance has been made for the costs of overseas and local
training, including consultants' costs, traveling costs, overseas training advisors and for contingencies and price inflation
over the period. It is estimated that the cost of this program would be US$1.0 million, most of which relates to overseas
consultants.
Training Details. YRWHDC is a relatively new corporation and it has recognized the importance of training in developing
the skills and techniques of its staff in order to run the corporation as a business enterprise. YRWHDC will be concerned
with the construction stage of the Xiaolangdi project in the earlier years of its existence but in the period approaching the
year 2000, it will become more involved in operating the dam for power generation, irrigation and flood control purposes.
The training needs have accordingly been identified and reflect the development stages through which YRWHDC will
progress in the period 1997-2000. Early attention will be paid to the needs of senior managers in the areas of contract
management and also in general and financial management concepts. After the initial stage, attention will be paid to training
in specific management skills for senior and middle management. In the period immediately preceding the dam becoming
operational, attention will be paid to covering the management of change in the ensuing period as well as ensuring that
supervisory and clerical staff are well equipped to cope with the new operating conditions and procedures.
The program that has been drawn up by YRWHDC addresses the following main areas:
* Financial Planning and Budgetary Control. This will equip senior staff with the necessary expertise in undertaking
financial planning for both capital investment and operating costs and revenues. It will also ensure familiarity with the
budgeting process and an understanding of the importance of exercising proper controls in relation to any authorized
budget.
* General Management and Organization. This is intended for senior managers to acquire a knowledge of basic
management and organizational concepts and skills. This would extend to running a corporation as a business entity and
making senior managers aware of the external pressures to which businesses are subjected.
* Financial Accounting System, Reporting and Standards. This will provide expertise to senior financial staff to whatever
accounting standards may be required. It will cover aspects of financial accounting and will address the relevance of
international accounting requirements to this particular business undertaking.
* Quality Assurance System Development. This will make appropriate staff aware of the importance of quality assurance
in all aspects for which YRWHDC is responsible. This will range from operational and administrative procedures to
construction works.
* Information Technology (IT) and Computing Skills. This would enable staff at various levels to acquire a knowledge of
the potential benefits to an organization from IT with attention being paid to the pros and cons of distributed processing
vis-a-vis mainframe processing. The relevance of an IT strategy for a business environment would also be addressed.
Appropriate staff would also obtain suitable computing skills to enable them to operate the equipment most suitable to
their needs.
* Cash/Treasury Management. This will provide a small number of financial staff with the necessary expertise to
maximize the benefits of cash handling and investments. The need for proper procedures will be stressed. The
requirements in respect of short-term and longer-term financial management will also be addressed.
* Management Information System (MIS). A knowledge of the availability of various management information systems
would be obtained, so as to enable senior staff to understand their importance and potential benefit to YRWHDC. An
understanding of the requisite flow of information in a normal business environment would be obtained along with a

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
*  Planning, Monitoring and Performance Evaluation. This should equip senior staff with the necessary skills to
undertake corporate planning, and obtain an understanding of the various elements covered by the planning process and
of their interrelationships, and relevance to the determination of corporate objectives.
*  Personnel Management. The management of human resources is very important to any organization and this should
enable senior staff to become familiar with current thinking in this area. In so doing, it should identify how efficiencies
within a corporation might be obtained through challenges and opportunities for development of staff, while maintaining
due regard to their welfare.
*  Management of Change. This would be undertaken so as to equip senior and other staff to cope with the period during
which YRWIHIDC would be subject to fundamental change. It would enable such staff to identify the challenges and
problems which might arise and understand the importance of handling the transitional period satisfactorily.
* InternalAuditing. This is for a small number of specialized staff involved with internal auditing. Although much of the
current auditing procedures and requirements flow from the State's requirements, this training would also seek to
acquaint the staff with a knowledge of internal auditing practices in other countries.
Project Component 3-Environmental Management Plan Implementation-US$10.1 million (total cost of
component; phase 11 $5.57 million)
A salient feature of the recommended environment protection program in the first-phase project was the implementation
of an Environment Management Plan. The Plan includes provision for an Environmental Management Office (EMO),
which has lead and coordinating responsibility, during the phase I project, for implementing all needed environmental
protection measures including:
e Management of continuing periodic monitoring for assessing the actual effects of the project;
- Planning and implementation of the needed correction measures identified through the monitoring program;
- Preparation of routine periodic reports( and special reports, when needed) for distribution to concerned Government
agencies and to the Bank; and
- Long-term monitoring of the downstream hydrology and sediment flows and deposition
This project will continue detailed monitoring ensure the environmental management plan is implemented. There are
five areas of monitoring:
*  Construction Site Monitoring. Under the project the contractor is required to monitor all the air, water, land, water
supply, waste disposal, dust and take all measures to maintain ambient environmental quality parameters. The
Reconnaissance Planning and Design Institute (RPDI) and the Yellow River Water Resources Protection Institute
(WRPI) are to undertake independent sample monitoring and ensure that there is compliance with environmental
quality standards. RPDI is also to review the site safety procedures adopted by the contractors and ensure that site
safety is maintained at all times. The total input required under this project is 15 person-months of foreign, 180
person-months of RPDI and 50 person-months of WRPI. Also included in this component is a small number of
computers (15) and software to keep records of the monitored data and two vehicles.
*  Public Health and Cultural Relics Monitoring: Public health monitoring reviews the health statistics of workers;
water and wastewater quality of sanitation and drinking water supply facilities; mosquito larvae and rat population;
and incidence of communicable diseases such as malaria, encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. The contractors are
required in their contract to keep monthly records of each of these parameters. The Yellow River Central Hospital
Unit (YRCHU) working with the County/Townships Antiepidemic Stations (ASs) will continue to review this data
on a three-monthly basis and determine if the monitoring and antiepidemic measures taken by the contractor are
sufficient to maintain the public health standards required at the damsite. In addition the AS will continue to
undertake rat eradication and mosquito larvae eradication programs around the reservoir if the monitoring programs
indicate that these programs are required. The total inputs by YRCHU and AS will be 180 person-months (15
person-years). Ten person-months of foreign consultants will be included for training and updating skills of the AS
staff. Included in this subcomponent is the procurement of 4 vehicles to YRCHU and AS and 10 computers and
software. Cultural relics will continue to be monitored by the damsite and resettlement EMOs using RPDI's
services.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Descriptlon
*  Seismic Monitoring: The purpose of this monitoring is to determine if the dam or reservoir induce any additional
seismic activity as a result of the construction. Presently eight seismographs are placed in key locations 35 km
upstream and 10 km downstream. The Henan Geological and Seismological Department monitors the data and they
and the international contractors undertake analysis of the data recorded by the seismographs. RPDI will review the
data collected and the analysis and expeditiously report unusual events to the appropriate decision makers in
YRWHDC and MWR.
*  Downstream  Catchment Hydrology and Sedimentation Monitoring, etc.. This program  is to be undertaken by the
YRCC Hydrology Bureau. The main purpose of this program is to monitor the baseline conditions in the Lower
Reach of the Yellow River and the changes during and after construction. The monitoring program will be for the
river water, ice and sediment flow volumes at about 10-15 sites upstream and downstream of the dam. Water quality
will also be measured at all these sites. In addition rainfall and meteorological parameters will also be measured.
The input will be mainly for construction of gauging stations, procurement of equipment and services by the Yellow
River Hydrology Bureau involving about 1,000 person-months.
*   Special Studies and Monitoring: Studies will be undertaken for the Lower Yellow River Areas for: (a) surface and
groundwater balance for the areas outside the dikes within the influence of the river and setting up special surface
and groundwater monitoring systems to establish the influence of the new regulation of the river; (b) special studies
for reservoir navigation; and (c) special studies for river geomorphology and design of stabilization works for the
lower reach.
Several recommendations have been made in the revised Environmental Management Plan. The revisions essentially are
to: (a) separate the international/local panels for damsite and resettlement projects; (b) establish two environmental
management offices (EMOs), one for the damsite and ariother for the resettlement project; (c) the monitoring of each of
the EMOs will be more focused on each of their sites. The detailed monitoring requirements are indicated in Table 2.1.
Detailed tasks managed by EMO/Dam and EMO/RS are given in Tables 2.2 and 2.3. Detailed tasks of environmental
consultants (ECs) are given in Table 2.4. The organizational arrangements are shown in Figure 2.1. The costs are
presented in Table 2.5. The Bank financing will cover mainly consultants for the panel, monitoring and special studies,
and for training.

Project Component 4-Flood, Sediment, Ice and Drought Management System-US$14.8 million (total cost of
component; phase II $13.75 million)
When the Xiaolangdi Dam is completed, it will play a major role in controlling floods, drought, sediment deposition and
ice dam formation in the Lower Yellow River Basin (LYRB). The present system for flood management in the LYRB is
a fairly sophisticated system (see Figure 2.2). The Yellow River Flood Prevention and the Flood Information Offices are
responsible for managing floods in the LYRB. The YRCC Hydrology Bureau is responsible for inflow forecasting of all
tributaries and the main-stem flows. Presently, there is no real regulation by reservoir except by Guxian and a little by
Sanmenxia Dams. However, the flood management system and inflow forecasting system need to be strengthened. In
addition, the present flood prevention offices do not do any formal management of ice floods, droughts or sediment for
the lower reach. The importance of managing all the other aspects of the river flows cannot be underestimated. For
example, in August 1996, a high sediment-laden flood of 7,600 m3/s at Huayuankou, which should only fill up the center
channel of the river recorded the highest stage in the river since 1949 because of high sediment concentration in the flow
and because the river channels had silted up. Hence, in this component is a design to upgrade the present flood
management system to be a flood, drought, sediment and ice management system.
The component has four different aspects.
* Establishment of Institutional Arrangements for flood, sediment, ice and drought management. The arrangement
should clearly define the roles of different institutions within YRCC for (a) data collection; (b) database
development; (c) flood, sediment, drought and ice flow forecasting; (d) model building; and (e) operation of decision
support system. The tentative plan is to upgrade the present flood prevention and flood information offices to be

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
fully responsible for management of all other aspects of river flows. The Hydrology Bureau of YRCC will be
responsible for forecasting all flows (floods, droughts, sediment and ice) and also establishing a computer database
that will be accessible by other agencies. RPDI and the Institute of Hydraulic Research will be responsible for
building and maintaining the sediment models for forecasting sediment flows and managing the operation through
the reservoirs. The YRCC River Bureaus in Henan and Shandong will provide water stage and river cross-section
geometry data to the Hydrology Bureau.
* Upgrade the existing facilities, computer network, communications and computer systems in the various agencies.
The hydrologic and technical information database to be established is shown in Figure 2.3. The computer
communications system and local area network is shown in Figure 2.4. These systems need to be upgraded as
follows: (a) 10 computer workstations, software to upgrade the existing hydrologic monitoring systems; (b) 40
additional telemetric rainfall and runoff stations must be established above Sanmenxia Dam to complement the 60
stations below Sanmenxia Dam; (c) river cross-section data real-time transmission stations; and (d) computer
software for radar and satellite image processing, database management system for both the Hydrology Bureau
(YRCC) and for the Flood Information Center, advanced graphical interface systems (GUI), and dam-break
modeling.
In addition, international consultants will be needed for review panels (RPDI) and for flood system design and training.
Local consultants have already been appointed for sediment modeling (Y 35 million), funded by the Government. Other
local consultant services are needed for more detailed reservoir sediment routing, flood-ice-sediment dispatch system and
designing more detailed systems. In addition, there is foreign and local training for decision support systems and for
conversion of some of the workstation-based programs to PC-based programs. The overall cost of this component is
US$14.79 million; the Government will fund US$8.68 million and Bank funding is US$6.11 million (Table 2.6).
Project Component 5-Water Institutional Support-US$2.46 million (all phase II). This component consists of
reforming the water institutions in the lower reach in order to ensure that water management in the lower reach of the
Yellow River is sustainable. It is necessary to make sure that charges are collected from the various sectors to recover
costs according to the measure of benefits that they receive. The present plan does not recover costs from the flood and
sediment control beneficiaries because of fragmentation of the institutions. The table below shows sectoral economic
benefits, financial charges and the institutions in charge of the charging system.:
Sectors/Benefits      Economic          Financial Charges                Institutions in Charge
Irrigation            34 percent            15 percent       YRCC Henan/Shandong Bureau
Power                 41 percent           85 percent        YRWHDC
Flood                 18 percent            0 percent        SanmenxiaNYRWHDC/YRCC/Shandong/Henan
Sediment               7 percent            0 percent        Sanmenxia/YRWHDC/YRCC/Shandong/Henan
The institutional reform program will have the following activities:
* Recruitment of foreign and local consultants to undertake detailed studies: (a) to demonstrate the best way to
integrate the various organizations so that the control of the Lower Yellow River water resources will be under one
institution. This institution will be responsible for flood control, sediment control, power generation and irrigation
and urban water supply releases. This institution will be an amalgamation of YRWHDC, Sanmenxia Dam Bureau,
and the water management sections of YRCC's Henan and Shandong Bureaus. The various government functions of
the YRCC's Henan and Shandong Bureau will be separated from the enterprise functions for water management and
would be part of YRCC and would act as the regulator; (b) to deternine the mechanism for pricing of water for
irrigation, urban and industrial use and charges for flood and for sediment control; (c) to combine the financial
statements of the various institutions to form a single statement; (d) to determine the staff implications for the
various institutions; and (e) determine the legal requirements to set up the institution.

The total costs of the project are estimated to be US$2,855 million equivalent, of which US$1,307 million (46 percent)
represents the foreign exchange component. These estimates exclude the costs of the resettlement program, totaling US$839
million, being implemented under separate financing by IDA Credit 2606-CHA. The project base costs are in January 1997
prices. The dam and powerhouse costs are based on the existing three international contracts with adjustments for variation
orders (existing and expected) and changes in quantities for works. The costs of electrical and mechanical equipment,
transformers and gates are based on recent quotations from manufacturers and suppliers for similar equipment and materials
involved. The costs of the remaining items are based on the consulting engineers' data for similar works. Physical
contingencies are assumed as follows: 8 percent for the dam, underground powerhouse intakes, tunnels and outflow
structures and 10 percent for the remaining works, engineering, contract administration, technical assistance, environmental

management, studies and training; and 10 percent for the electromechanical equipment. These percentages are considered to
be reasonable in view of the site features, the stage of construction, design, and the contracts let to date. The price escalation
for costs expressed in foreign exchange (US dollars) has been calculated in accordance with the anticipated international
price escalation of 1.7 percent in 1997, 2.2 percent in 1998, 2.5 percent in 1999-2000, and 2.4 percent in 2001 and thereafter.
The price escalation for costs expressed in local currency is calculated according to the projected local inflation rates, 6.2
percent in 1997, 5.8 percent in 1998, 5.5 percent in 1999 and thereafter. Phase I costs are estimated expenditures between
1993 and September 1997, whereas Phase II are between October 1997 and 2002. The interest during construction covers
the Bank loan I (Loan 3727-CHA), proposed Bank loan, local bank loans and from suppliers' credit for the purchase of
turbines.

Main Assumptions
A. General
The primary motivation for the Xiaolangdi multipurpose reservoir project is flood and sediment control. Xiaolangdi
reserves 4.1 billion m3 of long-term reservoir storage for major flood control in the wet season, and, in the dry season,
2 billion m3 for downstream ice management. In the first 20 years of Xiaolangdi's operation, 7.5 billion m  of coarse
sediment can be trapped in reservoir dead storage, and, after the reservoir reaches long-run equilibrium, it can be
operated so as to pass floods (with the exception of major floods) and their sediment loads, together with all of the
sediment accumulated during the nonflood season, through the reservoir and the lower reach. Secondary benefits of the
project are substantial, primarily from power generation and irrigation. The annual incremental economic benefits of the
project at full development (year 2015) include Y 1,228 million for flood control, Y 508 million for sediment control,
Y 3,040 million for power generation, Y 2,008 million for more timely irrigation, and Y 339 million for reduced
shortages in urban water supply. The present value of the economic benefits of the project, discounted at 12 percent to
the present, is Y 40,504 million (US$4,880 million).
There are also significant social and environmental project benefits. In particular, flood control will substantially reduce
the risk of loss of life in the case of a major dike breach. Historical records of large floods, where there was both
advance warning and orderly evacuation, suggest that fatality rates of nearly I percent of the affected population might
be expected. Approximately 103 million people live and work in areas that could be inundated by a major flood
combined with a dike failure. No attempt was made to estimate the value of human lives that might be saved by the
project. Xiaolangdi's control of sediment deposition also reduces the risk of dike failure. Finally, Xiaolangdi's
operation will substantially reduce the environmental damage to the estuary by sharply decreasing the frequency of the
river running dry.
All investment costs, including physical contingencies, and operation and maintenance costs have been taken into
account in estimating the economic costs of the project. Economic O&M costs include: electricity, valued at
Y 0.4/kWh, contributed labor valued at the shadow wage rate, as well as other labor, management, maintenance, repair,
overhaul and replacement costs expressed as economic values.

Annex 4: Cost Eflectiveness Analysis Summary
The investment costs for the Xiaolangdi hydropower plant and the alternative thermal power plants are based on shadow
prices developed in local studies. Coal prices are based on the shadow price at the plant site and include handling and
transportation charges. Fuel price is based on coal equivalent using 7,000 kcal/kg. Investment costs were calculated
using straight-line depreciation with a salvage value.
World Bank price projections are used to estimate farm-gate economic prices in constant 1997 terms for traded inputs
and outputs. Economic prices for nontradables were estimated using conversion factors are based on an analysis of the
deviation of social opportunity costs from actual prevailing financial prices induced by tax and price distortions in
nontraded goods on the lower reaches of the Yellow River. All economic values were converted to local currency at a
shadow exchange rate of Y 8.3 to $ 1. Agricultural labor has been valued at Y 10 per person-day, the average project area
rural wage rate.
B. Economic Benefits
Flood Control Benefits. Flood and ice jamming control along the lower Yellow River are presently provided through a
combination of main works, embankment dikes, storage reservoirs, and flood and ice run detention basins, and through
regular and coordinated programs of river training, dike maintenance and warping. If the storage reservoirs and dikes
cannot control large floods that threaten the main dikes, then, as a last resort, excess flood flows would be diverted into
heavily populated detention basins, so as to control flooding and avert catastrophic dike breaching. However, inundation
of detention basins would become prohibitively expensive as the social and economic damages resulting from flood
diversion into these areas increase over time. As part of the YRCC's comprehensive flood control program, the
Xiaolangdi project would provide 4.1 billion m3 of flood storage capacity, substantially reducing flood risks in the
2                               2                                   2
3,172 km  of detention basins, in the 3,544 km  floodplain areas and in the 125,000 km  major protected area behind the
main dikes (see Map 25533).
Flood control benefits are defined as the reduction in expected average annual flood damage due to operation of the
Xiaolangdi project. These benefits assume that without the Xiaolangdi Reservoir regular programs of main dike
maintenance and strengthening, ice run control, river training and warping will continue in order to prevent undermining
and other types of dike failure. Further, it is assumed that the main dikes will be raised, as necessary, to keep up with
future aggradation of the river channel due to sediment deposition. Underlying estimates of expected average annual
damages with and without the project were made for floodplains, detention basins, oilfields, and areas protected by the
main dikes. Damages include personal and public property, and lost agricultural and industrial production. The damage
estimates are linked to the flood frequency simulations through the use of percentage damage rates for different flood
depths and conditions developed by the YRCC. Table A4.1 summarizes the flood control benefits for the first few years
of operation. Benefits from flood control will begin accruing in 1998, when the coffer dam is in place. Estimates have
been disaggregated into the types of areas affected: floodplains, the flood detention basins Dongpinghu and Beijingdi,
the oilfields near the mouth, and the areas protected by the main dikes.
The annual incremental flood control benefits of the Xiaolangdi project, with allowance for future growth of expected
benefits, are calculated in constant 1997 prices as Y 732 million annually for the first year, rising thereafter at rates
varying up to 5 percent (depending on type of damage) to reflect future economic growth and increases in property and
productive asset values. The total flood control benefits, discounted at 12 percent to the present, are Y 7,345 million, 18
percent of total benefits.
Sediment Control Benefits. On average, between 300 and 400 million tons of sediment have been deposited on the
riverbed along the lower reaches every year, resulting in a rise in the riverbed of 8-10 centimeters annually. In places,
the riverbed is 10 meters or more higher than the surrounding plain. Under existing deposition conditions, it is necessary
every decade to raise 696 km of the main dikes at least 1 meter, to strengthen 969 km of levees, to raise or strengthen
5,395 spurs in vulnerable sites, and to reconstruct or complete 51 channel training works and 439 spurs totaling 40.8 km.
The total cost of one of these decade-long comprehensive programs is now estimated, in present costs, to be at least Y 6.6

billion (US$795 million). These costs will increase over time as the base of the dike is widened and as the integrity of
dike foundations is threatened by seepage and salinity as the riverbed rises.

The direct benefits of sediment reduction are defined as the difference between capital and resource expenditures on
sediment management with and without the project. During the first 10 years of Xiaolangdi's operation, 7.5 billion m3 of
coarse sediment, responsible for most of the aggradation in the lower reach, will be stored in the reservoir. In the same
period, there will also be some degradation along the lower reach to Lijin. Eventually, a new equilibrium alluvial
channel will develop through the deposited sediments in the reservoir that will allow the prevailing flows through the
flood season to just transport all of the annual sediment load through the reservoir with neither deposition or erosion,
preserving 5.1 billion m3 of long-term reservoir storage. After Xiaolangdi reservoir reaches equilibrium, deposition
along the lower reach will continue but at a slower rate, because the flows can be regulated to increase the duration of
flows favorable to flushing sediments through the reach.
An extensive YRCC measurement and research program has culminated in a series of physical models of sediment
deposition along the lower reach. Based on projected deposition, maximum safe channel flow capacities, upon which
system flood plans depend, were calculated and used as the basis for estimation of the dike elevations required to
maintain that capacity (as the river aggrades) at 15 cross-sections for the years 2000, 2020 and 2050. The cost of dike
raising was determined parametrically using the detailed quantities estimated for the current dike-raising work program.
Recent review of this work program has confirmed that it is a practical basis for estimating future dike-raising needs.
The analysis was repeated for 2020 and 2050 with and without Xiaolangdi and the difference between the discounted
cash flows was taken as the major component of sediment management benefits.
Sediment trapping and regulation in Xiaolangdi will result in a sediment reduction time for the design series of 1950-74
of about 25 years, which is repeated giving a 50-year series of joint Sanmenxia-Xiaolangdi Reservoir operation. The
deposition reduction period is defined as the difference between accumulated deposition with and without Xiaolangdi for
the design time series. Over the life of the project (50 years), it will not be necessary to raise the dikes upstream of
Huayuankou, the dikes between Huayuankou and Aishan will need to be raised only twice, and the dikes between Aishan

and Lijin will need to be raised only four times. Unit labor and machine cost estimates, from YRCC engineering surveys
of the 1974-85 Third Dike Raising and Strengthening Campaign works, appropriately adjusted to reflect differences in
dike works above and below Aishan and to 1997 economic prices, were used to estimate the annual incremental sediment
control benefits of this component of the project. The completion of the cofferdam, in November 1997, will permit
postponement of major dike works downstream between then and the project commissioning date. Therefore, sediment
benefits will accrue downstream during this early period. These benefits are independent of, and in addition to,
downstream flood control benefits.
Incremental benefits from controlling sediment deposition on the main channel and floodplain are calculated in 1997
prices as Y 508 million annually for the first two decades, and Y 197 million annually thereafter. The decline in annual
benefits reflects the slower pace of sediment deposition due to the expected operation of the reservoir. The net present
value of sediment control benefits, discounted at 12 percent, is Y 2,817 million, 7 percent of total measured project
benefits.
Electricity Generation Benefits. Existing hydropower developments on the middle reach of the Yellow River are
limited to run-of-river plants at Sanshenggong (40 MW) and Tianqiao (128 MW) in Inner Mongolia, and Sanmenxia
(250 MW) in Shanxi/Henan. The power output of the two daily storage facilities is fed into the North China Power
Network (NCPN), while that of Sanmenxia feeds the Central China Power Network (CCPN). Xiaolangdi (1,800 MW
installed) is designed to operate as a peaking plant using only five of its six units, supplying 1,500 MW or 80 percent of
power output to the CCPN through the Henan grid and 20 percent to the NCPN through the Shanxi grid. The NCPN
covers Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, Hebei and Shanxi provinces and the western part of Inner Mongolia. The
western part of this system is rich in coal reserves, but the loads are mainly concentrated in Beijing and Tianjin. This
situation gives rise to large mine-mouth coal-fired power stations and high-voltage transmission lines, for example, the
Shentou and Datong thermal power plants in Shanxi supply power via a 500 kV transmission line to Beijing and Tianjin.
There are only a few hydro resources located in the service area of this grid and hydropower accounts for only 4.5
percent of capacity and 1.5 percent of energy. The hydropower proportion in the CCPN, primarily located in the Yangtze
Basin, accounts for 40 percent of total capacity and 38 percent of energy. The only Yellow River hydro station feeding
into this network is the Sanmenxia power station. With run-of-river power stations accounting for half of total capacity,
hydro energy output reduces to half during winter months, which, with very high system load factors, leads to difficulties
in meeting the load during these months.
For the decade of the 1990s, generating capacity for the whole of China is conservatively planned to grow at about the
same rate as the economy. Recent revised economic growth targets (as high as 10 percent) would also require upward
revision of power generation targets.
The load forecast for the Henan Power Grid was reviewed with the Henan Power Bureau. The actual load for 1989 and
1990 was 4,700 MW and 5,000 MW, respectively; however, about 1,400 MW of load was not met in 1989. The load
forecast for 1995 is 6,035 MW. However, this value still excludes some 1,000 MW that will be curtailed due to a
shortage of generation. The load forecast in the year 1999, the in-service year for the first two units at Xiaolangdi, is
about 9,380 MW and it is assumed the load curtailments will be negligible. The load growth rate used in the study over
the following 10 years is about 6 percent and is considered to be reasonably conservative. The load forecast for the
Henan grid is summarized in Table A4.2.
The benefit of electricity is traditionally valued on the basis of "willingness-to-pay," which is often computed by adding
the average tariff paid by the consumer to the estimated consumer surplus. It is appropriate to use "willingness-to-pay"
or alternative cost, whichever is the lower. China has large reserves of low-cost coal, and manufactures low-cost coal-
fired generation equipment. In the potential service area of Xiaolangdi, alternative power generation is limited to coal-
fired thermal plants. If it can be shown that the "willingness-to-pay" is higher than the alternative cost of coal-fired
generation, the appropriate benefit measure to use is the cost of coal-fired generation.

Until 1986, electricity tariffs in China had been generally unchanged since 1953 and were well below the marginal cost
of supply. However, at that time, the Government recognized that large increases in electricity prices would be required
to finance electricity system expansion. With this aim, the traditional practice of grant financing was replaced by debt
financing of new power plants, and a "new power/new price" policy was formulated. This provided that all consumption
above 1985 levels would be priced at higher levels, computed so as to permit new plants to repay debt. Since electricity
consumption has almost doubled since 1985, and demand is still constrained by supply, there is ample evidence that, at
the margin, consumers are willing to pay the higher price. In the NC and CC grids where additions have been largely
coal-fired plants, and where demand is particularly constrained, a "willingness-to-pay" tariff based on coal fired
generation costs is amply demonstrated.
Generation costs for coal plant at various capacity factors were calculated based on assumptions concerning economic
costs and plant characteristics. The options considered as candidates for supplying the load are coal-fired plant (unit
sizes of 200 MW, 300 MW, 350 MW and 600 MW), 100 MW  combustion turbines, a pumped storage plant (4 x
300 MW) at Bao Quan with the first two units coming into service in 2001 and Xiaolangdi (5 x 300 MW) with the first
two units coming into service in 1999. Because Xiaolangdi is designed with a capacity factor of 17 percent, it is
appropriate to use the corresponding values derived from these assumptions for firm energy, that is, 51.7 fen/kWh. This
installed capacity is fully supported by firm energy, therefore, the only value of secondary energy is the avoidance of
thermal generation, valued at the variable generation cost of 3.95 fen/kWh. These values are based on computations
made for Stage II in 1993, and would be substantially higher today.
A forward power sales agreement between YRWHDC and Henan Province establishes a price of 76 fen/kWh for all
electricity generated by the project beginning in 1999 or whenever the power plant becomes operational. Discounted to
1997, this price is 52 fen/kWh-which is most certainly greater than the thermal alternative valued in 1993.
Accordingly, all firm power from the project is valued at 2 fen/kWh.
Table A4.3 summarizes mean annual power production from Xiaolangdi as simulated by RPDI for 56 years of runoff to
the dam. The changes in average annual energy production after project year 11 have to do with the changes in the
reservoirs morphology as the sedimentation increases, which affect the effective head. The Lower Reach Model
(discussed below) also simulates power production in an optimization framework, but for 70 years. The latter model's
expected annual output at full development was 6,036 GWh-about 3 percent higher. For the economic analysis, we
take the more conservative figure of RPDI.
The total power generation benefits of the Xiaolangdi reservoir at full development are computed to be Y 2,660 million
annually after all five units are operational. Discounted at 12 percent to the present, the present value of these benefits is
Y 16,536 million, 41 percent of total benefits.

Irrigation Benefits. Approximately 30 million mu (2 million ha) of cropland are currently irrigable along the lower
reach of the Yellow River, about one-third in Henan province, and two-thirds in Shandong. The total irrigable area is
planned to expand to 36.67 million mu by 2000, and 40 by 2010. The dominant irrigated crops are wheat, corn, cotton
and paddy. To fully irrigate these crops requires about 23 billion m3 diverted from the Yellow in addition to about
1 billion m3 of groundwater available for irrigation in Henan, and about 2 billion m3 in Shandong. The mean annual
volume of Yellow River flows in the lower reach is only 32 million. Given water demands for municipal and industrial
(M&I) needs, extrabasin transfers, and sediment management, water available for irrigation is seldom sufficient. In most
years, crop yields are substantially below biological maxima due to water shortages. Wheat, corn, and sometimes cotton
sometimes get no irrigation at all, resulting in yields 50 to 70 percent below those possible with full irrigation. In
addition, the timing of irrigation water availability does not match crop needs. River flows are highest in the July-
September period, but irrigation demands peak during March-June.

Xiaolangdi will partially alleviate this shortage situation through its ability to store up to 4.57 billion m3 and divert it to
irrigation when it is needed most. Even with Xiaolangdi, there will not be sufficient water to fully irrigate all crops. But
the gains from even partial irrigation are significant. Table A4.4 shows the increases in crop yields, and gross financial
and economic benefits from additional irrigations for wheat, corn, and cotton (according to preferred practice, paddy gets
four irrigations (860 m3/mu) whenever possible. Irrigation water in the table is measured at the crop; because of low
canal and field efficiencies, about twice as much water is required to be diverted from the river. But it can be seen that
even one irrigation per crop can nearly double the income per mu, depending on the cropping pattern.

The irrigation benefits were computed with the assistance of the LRM,' a nonlinear optimization model covering water
supplies and demands within a framework of hydrologic, agronomic, and engineering constraints. The model solves in

diversions to irrigation that not only maximizes irrigation benefits, but does so while respecting other, perhaps more
pressing, demands. One of these demands is for flood control, and the LRM is restricted in its storage of water for
irrigation by the need to maintain sufficient free storage in Xiaolangdi and Sanmenxia reservoirs during the months June-
September to handle incoming flows. Another is the need to supply M&I demands (discussed below), which are given
preference in water allocation decisions. A third is the need to maintain sufficient flows in the lower reach to flush
sediment to the sea to slow the pace of channel aggradation.
The necessit' of flushing sediment is not debated, but the volumes of water required to do so are, ranging from 10 to over
20 billion m /year on average. This necessity gives rise to a conflict between sediment management and irrigation: part
or all of the water used to flush sediment cannot be diverted to irrigation. The more water released by Xiaolangdi for
flushing sediment, the lower will be the irrigation benefits. How much water is actually required is the subject of
ongoing studies, not completed at the time of appraisal. But for the purposes of appraising irrigation benefits, some
number is required, and that number is chosen as about 14 billion m (the actual volume simulated will depend on a
variety of factors, but 14 is taken as the target). Considering M&I and extra-basin transfer demands, this leaves about 12
billion m3 available for irrigation, a number which approximates the average of recent historical diversions to Henan and
Shandong.
The LRM also includes water allocation constraints that require that diversions be shared between Henan and Shandong
in the ratio of 1:2. This allocation has been agreed to by the concerned provinces with the consent of YRCC and MWR.
Without an allocation constraint, the model would attempt to divert a much larger share to Shandong irrigation because
the yields and canal efficiencies are higher in that part of the lower reach.
Table A4.5 reports runoff, diversions, and flows to the sea for the with- and without project cases for the years 2000 and
2010 (very little which might affect the results beyond 2010 has been planned). In 2000, Xiaolangdi permits diversions
to irrigation to increase modestly, by about 0.76 billion m3, and it also permits a greater reliability of extrabasin transfers.
Because the same volumes of water are available to the with and without cases,2 flows to the sea must decline. Although
the same sediment flushing constraint applies to both versions, the without case shows higher flows to the sea that result
from water being available during times of no irrigation demand.
Although the increases in annual irrigation water are small, the impacts on production and incomes are not. These
changes are summarized in Table A4.6. In both 2000 and 2010, the LRM finds it preferable to reschedule irrigation
diversions away from wheat toward more profitable corn and cotton when it is able to do so (i.e., when it has
Xiaolangdi's storage available). This results in a greater number of irrigations for corn and cotton, and significant
increases in yields. Overall, cotton production increase by nearly 140 percent with the project, and grain production, by
nearly 5 percent. Farm incomes from irrigated agriculture increase by 12.9 percent, while the economic returns rise by
9.3 percent.
In 2010, the main differences are (a) greater M&I and extrabasin demands, slightly more irrigable area, and planned
increases in the efficiency of water distribution and use. Although there will likely be increases in yields due to better
farm practices and more intensive use of nonwater inputs, these factors will be independent of the project, and are not
taken into account (doing so would increase the benefits from improved irrigation supplies). Combined, these factors
serve to lower the relative performance of irrigation, but not by much. Farm incomes are still 12.8 percent higher with
the project, and economic returns, 8.5 percent higher.
2 Actually, there is less water available with Xiaolangdi because of losses from the reservoir (0.039 billion m3/year) and required
diversions to resettlement areas near the dam (0.232 billion mr/year).

For the purpose of appraisal, economic returns are based on projected economic (border) prices of outputs and fertilizers
inputs,3 and a labor shadow wage of Y 10/day. Given recent trends in China, local market prices for grains are higher
than projected world prices. Fertilizer prices are subsidized by about 20 percent. The prevailing financial wage rate in
the project area in 1996 was Y 6.5/day. These economic values produced the "economic returns" shown in Table A4.6,
as well as the economic returns per m of water of Table A4.3 above. The former figures are the annual average benefits
from the project. Intermediate years between 2000 and 2010 have been interpolated, and benefits beyond 2010 are
assumed to remain unchanged. The present value of irrigation benefits is Y 12,089 million, which is 30 percent of total
project benefits.
Municipal, Industrial, and Extrabasin Demands. M&I demands have been projected by RPDI to be 0.65 billion m3 in
2000 in Henan and 0.90 in Shandong, increasing to 0.96 and 1.30 respectively in 2010. Supplying these demands is
given the highest priority both by water sector decisionmakers, and by the LRM. Next in priority comes transfers to the
Hebei-Beijing-Tianjin (B-T) corridor, and to the industrial city Qingdao in eastern Shandong. B-T diversions are about
0.5 billion m at present, scheduled to increase to 1.0 in 2000, and 1.5 in 2010. Qingdao diversions will be 0.5 in 2000,
and 1.0 by 2010.
Without Xiaolangdi, these diversions are not always possible because of low river flows. In the 2000 simulations, an
average of 81 million mi3 of shortages were reported, which dropped to only 5 with the project. This increase in
3
reliability is valued at Y 3/mi, a rate estimated for similar Yellow River diversions to the urban household consumers
benefiting from Wanjiazhai Water Transfer project. In 2010, the desired extrabasin transfers are much larger, and the
increase in reliability more important. The discounted values of the increased reliability amounts to Y 1,717 million, or 4
percent of total benefits.

Estuarial Flows. To maintain the environmental integrity of the estuary, facilitate fish spawning, and supply water to
the oilfields near the mouth, it is desirable to maintain a 50 m 3/s flow in the far lower reach, Lijin-sea. At present,
under low runoff conditions, this is not possible. The river is observed to be dry in the far lower reach one to three
months of the year, usually in the late spring. The LRM attempts to maintain this flow in all scenarios. In the without
Xiaolangdi cases, the probability that any given month is dry is 7.6 percent under 2000 conditions, and 7.3 percent under
2010 conditions. Because the LRM optimizes reservoir operations, these probabilities are undoubtedly much higher than
in reality. With Xiaolangdi, the probabilities of running dry at the mouth fall to nearly zero: out of 840 months
simulated, only four months were dry in 2000, and three in 2010. Whether this performance can be duplicated in practice
will depend on the quality of flow forecasting and reservoir operating procedures.
Dry Year Results. The economic benefits from irrigation and M&I water supply presented above are averages over the
70-year simulations. How do the results vary under dry conditions, i.e., P75 runoff? The water years 1940-41 and
1987-88 approximate P75 conditions, with average annual runoff to the lower reach of 20.01 billion m (average runoff is
32.62)? The numbers are shown in Table A4.7.

In the dry years, the economic performance of Xiaolangdi is significantly enhanced. This result is particularly important
to farmers, who typically suffer the most when river flows are insufficient to provide adequate supplies of irrigation
water.
C. Economic Costs
The economic costs of the project were derived from the financial costs (Annex 3) by adjusting for taxes, credits, and
interest during construction, and shadow-pricing foreign exchange at Y 8.3 = $1. Costs incurred during phase I of the
Project (through 1996) were inflated to 1997 levels to account for forgone opportunity cost of capital (12 percent). Total
economic costs excluding O&M costs total Y 24,807 million. These include the resettlement costs of Y 6,718 million.
Discounted to 1997, total costs are Y 21,728 including O&M economic costs are estimated to be Y 227 million per year,
beginning in 2002. The economic cost stream is shown in Table A4.8.
D. Economic Performance
Based on the assumptions contained in these cost and benefit streams, and a 50-year period of analysis, the EIRR of the
project is estimated at 20.8 percent. Its net present value discounted at 12 percent (to 1997) is Y 18,775 million. The
benefit-cost ratio is 1.86. The economic cash-flow that produced these results is shown in Table A4.9.

E. Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
The major economic risks associated with the project are related to:  (a) construction risk; (b) cost overruns;
(c) inappropriate reservoir operation and management; (d) disastrous flooding or hyper-concentrated flows; (e) delays in
commissioning of power units; (f) inadequate dike and offtake maintenance programs, resulting in failure to achieve the
crop yields assumed for 2000; and (g) delays in resettlement, thereby delaying project implementation. Construction
risks are within reasonable limits and would be manageable with continuous supervision by foreign and Chinese
consultants and international panels who have been retained for the construction phase. Cost overruns have been
minimized by incorporating actual bids for the three major civil works lots, accounting for over 65 percent of the cost
estimate. Chinese water resource engineers and managers have had considerable experience with the survey, design,
construction, operation and management of large reservoirs on the Yellow River, subject to heavy flooding and hyper-
concentrated flows. In all aspects of the appraised work, the tremendous care and caution of Chinese water resource
engineers and managers with respect to flood and sediment control is pronounced. The likelihood of egregious errors in
reservoir operation and management or dike or offtake operation and management in the face of large flooding and/or
hyper-concentrated flows is minimal. The operation of the reservoir will drastically lessen the possibility of disastrous
flooding.
Several of these risks were tested and the results reported in Table A4.9. Should inflows to the reservoir be unusually
low (P90, meaning that 90 percent of years would have a greater inflow) for an extended period after commissioning,
power benefits would be about 42 percent lower, and the EIRR would drop to 17.8 percent.
Should crop yields fall short of expectations by 20 percent (or economic values of crop output be lower by a similar
percentage), total benefits would be 6 percent lower, and the EIRR would drop to 19.7 percent.
Delays in construction (which would not affect costs) of one year implies that all benefits would be delayed one year. In
this case, discounted benefits would fall by 8 percent, and the EIRR to 18.6 percent. A two-year delay in benefits would
still produce a 16.8 percent EIRR.
Cost overruns of 10 percent (on post-1996 incurred costs, not including O&M costs), would result in only a drop in the
EIRR to 20.3 percent, and even a 20 percent cost overrun would still yield 19.7 percent.
To minimize such potential risks associated with the execution of the project and its associated resettlement program,
assurances were obtained from GOC under the Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project that it would ensure an adequate and

timely flow of funds, and establish and maintain effective project implementation management and detailed independent
monitoring.
Employment and Incomes. Construction of project works will generate 320,000 person-years of employment during
the seven-year project period. Of this, 300,000 person-years will be employed directly or indirectly on the actual dam
works in Henan, and 20,000 person-years on intake structures and silt basin construction for Yellow River diversions in
Henan and Shandong. Specialized labor needs during project construction include: 10,000 person-years for equipment
operation, management and maintenance. After the project is completed, 1,600 person-years of employment will be
newly created for operation and maintenance of hydraulic structures, Xiaolangdi's power generation, and basinwide
Yellow River water resource coordination and management.
Project investments would increase labor productivity and incomes of project area farmers, people with incomes only 61
percent of the national rural average and only 58 percent of the provincial rural averages in Henan and Shandong. At
present, there are 2.7 million farm households in the project-affected areas in Henan, and 5.0 million in Shandong.
Average farm family income from agriculture in Henan is Y 4,050, and in Shandong, Y 5,535. The larger and more
timely diversions for irrigations will increase these incomes by an average of Y 413 (10.2 percent) in Henan and Y 791
(14.3 percent) in Shandong. The project should also increase agricultural employment as more intensive irrigation is
associated with higher farm labor demand.

Annex 6: Financial Analysis and Assumptions
ANNEX 5: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND ASSUMPTIONS
A. Financial Management Policy Applied in the Financial Projections
A fully integrated financial planning model was developed to project operating and financial activity of YRWHDC in its
continued efforts to develop and operate the Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Dam Project presently scheduled for operation in
the year 2000. The model accepts as inputs engineering assumptions on project costing, construction scheduling and
other important aspects of the development of the Xiaolangdi Dam, which was initiated in 1993. In addition, other
assumptions regarding the projected operations and maintenance of the dam were considered as inputs to the revenue
projections. Operating and cost data were estimated for operating the entire facility and for providing the various
services in power generation, water resource supply and flood and sediment control to downstream communities. Other
inputs to the model include assumptions for debt and equity financing and financial management policies.
The model was programmed to simulate the financial and commercial activities of YRWHDC, according to acceptable
financial management and accounting principles. Such principles were drawn largely by current accounting and
reporting practices of the Corporation, as outlined in the Rules for Accounting for Construction Activities and for
Ongoing Corporate Enterprises. In addition, the model incorporates generally accepted standards for the financial
management of a commercial entity. As such, the total funds available through internal and external financing sources
are allocated based on specific priorities as would typically be done by the chief financial officer of the Corporation
assuming a reasonable degree of management decision making autonomy. Requirements for working capital, obligations
to debt service are fulfilled first in order to finance ongoing operations and to fulfill credit commitments to third parties,
including the Bank. New investment requirements are satisfied from the remaining internally generated funds and the
estimated debt and equity financing secured by the project financing scheme. Specifically, external sources of funds,
including both borrowings and equity contributions, are drawn as independent variables in order to bridge whatever
financing gap may result between the estimated capital expenditures and remaining cash available after meeting debt
service and working capital obligations. As such, the model does not draw excess funds than what is absolutely desired
to meet the needs of the project while still maintaining adequate levels for working capital. This is particularly important
during the early and more critical period of the project's life when the inefficient use of funds will have a significant
effect on the project's rates of return. As such, the efficiency of the modeling exercise allows the projected flows to
maximize returns under realistic expectations (base case assumptions), a policy which would be necessarily expected by
any developer undertaking the project.
Annual cash surpluses are initially reinvested in short-term deposits earning a minimal yield. Cash deficits that may
result in any given year during the projected period would be financed first by the liquidation of excess short-term
deposits or other current assets, while still maintaining an appropriate level of current assets to meet ongoing working
capital requirements. Unidentified debt financing is not considered an option for meeting shortfalls in cash during the
latter years of the projection period. Therefore, new equity contributions are regarded as the only final source of
financing year-end shortfalls of cash in any post construction projection period. However, since these additional equity
contributions may also not necessarily be identified or assumed at the outset of this assessment, other assumptions, such
as expanding the revenue base, are revised first in order to derive a workable solution. If, on the other hand, there is no
way to achieve this and still retain the integrity of the proposed project, it would therefore be necessary to assume
contributions of additional equity that would necessarily be agreed with the Government.
B. Significant Accounting Principles & Practices
The projections incorporate a number of accounting principles which are important for the interpretation of YRWHDC's
projected financial operations and statements. These include:
*  Accrual Accounting. Revenues and expenses are accounted on the accrual basis for which collections and payments
are governed by acceptable financial management parameters based on experiences of other similar operators in
China.
*  Construction Period. Construction is accounted as work in process until completed and made operational. During
this period, interest charges on both foreign and domestic borrowing are capitalized as are any other pre-operating
expenses and income, particularly losses arising from the revaluation of foreign denominated loans and interest

earned from short-term deposits available to the project for meeting ongoing construction requirements. Fixed assets
are then depreciated once they are placed in service. Once operational status is achieved, the fixed assets, capitalized
interest and other pre-operating expenses are amortized over a specified period based on the life of the project.
Given the large gestation construction period of the Xiaolangdi Dam close attention was given to capturing all
important cost elements.
*  Foreign Exchange Losses. YRWHDC will assume the exchange risks on foreign loans arising from the potential
depreciation of the local currency vis-a-vis the US$ and other foreign currencies. Since, YRWHDC will not earn
foreign exchange in its operations, special attention was given to the estimation of its projected foreign exchange
exposure. Losses arising from foreign loan reevaluations were estimated based on the estimated devaluation of the
Yuan given the differential in the domestic and foreign inflation rates applied in the projections and recorded in the
income statement in the projected year they are realized. Losses realized during the construction period are
capitalized in accordance with the accounting rules for Construction activities in China and amortized over a
specified period during operations, but not shorter than 5 years. For an organization that is not experienced in
dealing with long term foreign exchange transactions, it is particularly important to note that the foreign exchange
charges taken on the income statement are non cash items, the related payments of which for both interest charges
and principal are made when they are due. While no provisions have been made for this, it is prudent for
inexperienced enterprises such as YRWHDC to actually fund part of the realized foreign exchange losses when the
charge is actually taken so as not to overestimate the financial capacity of the enterprise. The treatment of the
estimated foreign exchange losses by the model does however provide a reasonable estimation of the debt service
requirements arising from foreign loans.
* Fixed Asset Revaluation. Presently the accounting rules in China do not allow for the revaluation of fixed assets that
were originally recorded at cost on the books. As such, the projections do not simulate a formal revaluation of assets.
However, given the importance of gauging total projected returns on an appropriate fixed asset base, the model does
include an off-the-books adjustment for fixed assets by applying the projected local inflation index to the fixed asset
base of the Corporation.
*  Contributions to Welfare and Enterprise Funds. YRWHDC is expected to make contributions to two social funds
out of retained earnings. Such contributions would normally be held in a restricted trust account specifically
earmarked for the purpose intended. However, the projections do not reflect the establishment of such a restricted
account as one has not yet been established by the Corporation. Rather, the funds related to the enterprise's Public
Welfare and Enterprise Funds are included in the short-term deposits accounts along with other excess funds retained
by YRWHDC.
C. Assumptions to the Financial Projections
General Projection Parameters:
*  Projection Period. The total project period is approximately 15 years, starting with the opening period at year-end
1996 through 2010 after operating activity has been stabilized.
*  Currency. Yuan in Millions. Foreign component construction costs were estimated and inputted in US dollar
equivalents.
*  Exchange Rate. Construction and operating activity for 1997 and thereafter were estimated based on the current
exchange rate of 8.30 Yuan to US$1.00.
*  Price and Cost Escalation Rates. Projected revenues and costs were adjusted for inflation at the following rates:
(a) local currency at 6.2 percent in 1997, 5.8 percent in 1998, and 5.5 percent in 1999-2010; and (b) foreign currency
at 1.7 percent in 1997, 2.2 percent in 1998, 2.5 percent in 1999-2000, and 2.4 percent in 2001-2010. Average year
inflation factors were applied to all expense and cost data while year-end factors were applied to balance sheet items
where applicable.
*  Income and Other Taxes. YRWHDC is subject to a corporate income tax rate of 33 percent as well as a value added
tax on power revenue of 17 percent. Water resource and flood and sediment control fees are presently exempt from
value added taxes. Losses can be carried forward to offset income in subsequent years. In addition, the Corporation
will be subject to an urban consumption tax and an education tax of 5 percent and 3 percent of the value added tax,

Annex 5: Financial Analysis and Assumptions
respectively bringing the total effective tax rate on income between 42 percent and 58 percent over the projection
period.
* Depreciation. The Dam and related works comprise essentially the bulk of the fixed asset base of YRWHDC, a
single depreciation rate of 2.0 percent, equivalent to 50 years was applied for projection purposes.
Revenue Assumptions:
*  Power Rates. YRWHDC has entered into an agreement with Henan Electric Power Bureau for the sale of power
generated by the plant. Installed capacity is approximately 1,800 MW with expected revenue output of 2,270 GWh
in 2,000, 3,679 GWh in 2001, and 4,231 GWh in 2002-2010. While the actual tariff charge has not been firmed up,
the current tariff rate of 52 fen ($0.063 equivalent) was applied as a constant price rate and inflated over the projected
period. This resulted in an effective tariff of 63 fen in 2,000 to Y 1.08 in 2010.
*  Water Rates. The YRWHDC and YRCC have agreed on applying a unified water resource tariff to all existing and
future customers within the Henan and Shandong Provinces. It was further agreed that a surcharge would be levied
by the YRWHDC aimed at recovering the cost associated with the investment and operation of the dam for water
supply while it was understood that full cost recovery would be attained gradually over a 10-year operating period.
*  Flood & Sediment Control Services. A tariff of 0.65 fen/m3 would be charged beginning in 2004 on the water
charges for flood and sediment control services supplied by YRWHDC.
Operating Expenses. Operating Expenses assumptions in constant terms are based on operating experiences of other
dams in China and are summarized as follows:
*  Material Expenses. Based on 1.4 Y per kW installed by the power plant.
*  Wages. Estimated total personnel of 1,600 times an average wage rate of 6,000 Y per year.
*  Other Direct Expenses. Based on 14 percent of total estimated annual wage expense.
*  Works Maintenance. Based on I percent of total fixed assets placed in service adjusted for inflation.
*  Reservoir Maintenance. Based on 0.003 Y of kWh generated by the power plant.
*  Overhead. Based on 40 percent of total annual wage expense.
*  Sales and Miscellaneous Taxes. (a) Value Added Tax at 17 percent of Power Sales: (b) City Maintenance and
Construction and Tax at 5 percent of annual value added tax expense; (c) Education Fee at 3 percent of annual value
added tax expense.
d  Administrative Expenses. Based on 150 percent of total annual wage expense.
Sources of Financing. Approximately 40 percent of the estimated investment program will be financed from a number
of foreign and local sources. The following summarizes the amounts financed and the respective terms and conditions on
foreign and domestic borrowings:
*  IBRD I Loan. A loan of $460 million has been made available by the Bank, of which $325 million has been
disbursed. The loan is made available at a variable rate (currently projected at 7.5 percent per year and a 20-year
maturity period and 7-year grace on principal repayments. Principal repayments will be made on a semiannual basis
but are shown annually for projection purposes.
*  IBRD II Loan (Proposed Loan). A loan of $430 million is being proposed for the completion of the project at a
variable interest rate of 7.5 percent per year with a 20-year maturity and 5-year grace on principal repayments.
Principal repayments will be made on a semiannual basis.
* IDA I Loan. Approximately $110 million has been committed under IDA terms for the resettlement component of
the project. The first drawdown of the loan was in 1995, and approximately $55 million has been disbursed. The
loan is made available on IDA terms at an interest rate of 0.75 percent, a commitment fee of 0.50 percent, a maturity
period of 35 years with the grace period of 10 years. The annual amortization is approximately $4 million.
*  Export Credit. A total of $155 million in export credits has been allocated to the project. This loan is estimated to
carry an interest rate of 6.7 percent and the principal will mature in 15 years with the grace period of 7 years. The
annual amortization is estimated at $19 million.

Annex 5: Financial Analysis and Assumptions
* Development Bank. The Development Bank loan is Y 2,523 million and was fully disbursed by year-end 1996. The
loan carries an interest rate is 12.42 percent with a maturity period of 16 years and a grace period of 7 years. The
annual amortization is approximately Y 280 million, with the first payment due in 2001.
* Construction Bank. This is a loan for $200 million with an interest rate of 12.42 percent. The payment for the full
loan will be in the year 2000.
* Line of Credit. It is assumed that YRWHDC management will establish a revolving line of credit in order to finance
ongoing cash and working capital requirements. This credit line is short-term in nature, will be repaid on a revolving
basis, and will carry an interest rate of 13 percent per year on any outstanding balances.
Financial Management Parameters.
It is anticipated that YRWHDC will manage working capital under different principles during the preoperating period
and after operations commence. In summary, working capital requirements for the preoperating period will be largely
driven by the annual construction program, while for the operating period, it will be more responsive to the business
cycle and the operating characteristics of YRWHDC.
* Cash Position. Cash balances are differentiated between cash on hand and cash held in interest bearing time deposits
for which a separate balance sheet account has been established. Cash on hand balances for the preoperating period
are estimated at approximately 1 percent of total annual construction. After the project becomes operational in 2000,
the cash position is estimated at two weeks of operating expenses. Excess cash balances are transferred to time
deposits earning a minimal yield.
* Accounts Receivable. Receivables are estimated at 6 percent of annual construction during the preoperating period
and relate to commitments made by lenders and sponsors but not paid. After the year 2000, the accounts receivable
are estimated at approximately I month of annual power revenues.
* Accounts Receivable-Other. These are based on water and flood control revenues and relate to only the operational
period. Although there is no precedence for such receivables, it is estimated that they will average approximately 45
days of annual water resource and flood control revenues.
*  Bad Debt Write-Off It is estimated that bad debt write-offs will be approximately 10 percent of outstanding water
and flood control receivables.
* Interest on Short-Term Deposits. Time deposits presently earn a minimal yield of 1.3 percent and will be projected
to remain at this amount.
* Inventories of Spare and Materials. Inventories during the preoperating period are estimated at 2 percent of the
annual investment program. During operations, stocks of spares inventories are estimated to equal approximately
one month of direct operating expenses.
* Prepaid Expenses. Prepaid expenses are estimated at 3 percent of the annual investment during the construction
period and 0.5 months of operating expenses when the project becomes operational.
* Short-Term Loans. Short-term loans are drawn to finance minor construction works, inventories and spares and are
estimated at 12 percent of the annual investment during the preoperating period. For the first two years after the
project is operational, approximately 50 percent of inventories will be financed through short-term loans and
thereafter about 35 percent. Working capital loans will carry an interest rate of 13 percent annually.
* Accounts Payable. Accounts payable go from 30 percent of the annual investment in 1997, to 25 percent in 1998 and
finally to 20 percent in 1999. Thereafter, at the startup of operations, they will be equal to one month of direct
operating expenses.
* Enterprise Fund Contribution. Contributions to the Enterprise Fund are estimated at 10 percent of net income after
taxes and commence in 2000.
* Welfare Fund Contribution. Contributions to the Welfare Fund are estimated at 5 percent of net income after taxes
and commence in 2000.

Annex 7: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
National Shopping: Will be accomplished by comparison from quotations from a minimum of three qualified suppliers.
Prior review is also requiredfor:
* prior review of works and goods are indicated in Table A7.2. The prior review thresholds result in over 85 percent of
the value of the contracts funded by the Bank.
Documents
*  For ICB: World Bank Standard Bidding Documents
*  For Consultants: Bank's standard contracts; samples for Letters of Invitation (LOI) and Supplementary Information
to Bidders
*  Other documents include: Bank's standard bid evaluation form and standard general and specific procurement
notices.
Disbursement
The Bank loan would be disbursed against: (a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for the ICB civil works; (b) 100
percent of foreign expenditures and 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for goods and 75 percent of local
expenditures for other goods procured locally; and (c) 100 percent for consulting services, studies and training. For
expenditures relating to training, contracts for works costing less than $5 million equivalent, contracts for goods costing
less than $400,000 equivalent, contracts for services of firms each costing less than US$200,000 equivalent, and
contracts for services of individuals costing less than $50,000 equivalent, reimbursements would be made on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting the SOEs would be retained by YRWHDC and made
available for review by Bank supervision missions. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account in US dollars, with an
authorized allocation of US$2 million, will be established in a bank and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Applications for replenishment would be submitted monthly or when the amounts withdrawn are equal to 50 percent of
the authorized allocation, whichever occurs sooner. Retroactive financing in an aggregate amount of US$5 million
would be provided under the loan to cover payments made after March 15, 1997 for expenditures on civil works ongoing
under the first loan.
The disbursement period covers the second phase of the construction period. Because of the phased financing
arrangements for this project, it is not possible to compare its disbursement with that of other projects, except to some
extent for that of the Shuikou Hydroelectric Project. The disbursement schedule is based on the detailed project
implementation program. The loan closure is delayed to correspond to the date of completion of the project, to
December 31, 2003.
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs): see above.
Special account: US$2 million.
Retroactivefinancing: US$5 million.

ANNEX 8: IMPROVING PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
1. Introduction
The Xiaolangdi Project EIA prepared in 1992 presents an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for ensuring that
implementation of the Xiaolangdi Project will be environmentally sound, including specific Environmental Protection
Measures (EPMs) and environmental monitoring programs. Responsibility for carrying out the EMP was assigned to the
Project's Environmental Monitoring Office (EMO), called the Engineering Resources Division (ERD) of the
Resettlement Office (RO) of YRWHDC, when the RO was established in 1994. The ERD has carried out its operations
by establishing its own ERD organization and staff, and by use of four subcontractors (environment consultants),
(a) Reconnaissance, Planning and Design Institute of YRCC (RPDI), (b) Yellow River Water Resources Protection
Bureau (YRWRPB), (c) Yellow River Central Hospital (YRCH), and (d) Henan and Shanxi Provincial Archeological
Institutes (HSAIs).
The ERD, together with the subcontractors, have prepared reports every six months in time for critical review of these by
the Expert Panel on Environment and Resettlement (EPER, also established in 1994). The EPER's reports every six
months have assessed the performance of the ERD and its subcontractors including recommendations for needed
improvements. At this time (February 1997), five of these EPER reports have been prepared, and the next meeting of the
Expert Panel is scheduled for April 1997.
The entire work of the EMP and Expert Panel has focused on the construction phase of the Xiaolangdi Project, with
several main activities to ensure that: (a) the work of the construction contractors is duly complying with EPMs specified
in the Project EIA completed in 1992 (EIA/92), (b) the towns/homes/facilities being built by the Xiaolangdi Project
Resettlement Program (administered by the RO) are duly complying with EPMs specified in EIA/92, (c) the program for
construction of the dam and of resettlement facilities is duly complying with the specified EPMs as related to protection
against communicable disease hazards generated by the project, to protect and preserve precious archeological relics, to
protect water quality in the Yellow River system from hazards of pollution and changes in hydrology due to the
Xiaolangdi Project, and to protect and enhance precious ecovalues in the overall Environmental Study Area (ESA)
affected by the Xiaolangdi Project.
2. Key Study Findings
Overall Environmental Performance of EMO
In general, the overall performance of the EMO is satisfactory, but there need to be some changes made to greatly
enhance their work. The following summarizes the situation for the Xiaolangdi Project in terms of environmental
performance over the period 1992 to February 1997 (date of EIA/97) for all the Significant Environmental Issues (SEIs):
*  Relative Workload for EMO: For some SELs, the primary work is to be done by the EMO including EMO
subcontractors, whereas for other SEIs (for example, Earthquake Stability) the primary work is done by other
agencies from which EMO obtains the needed information every six months.
*  Performance Adequacy, 1992-February 1997: This is based on (a) reports made available by EMO to the Expert
Panel and evaluation of these by the EPER, (b) other information obtained by the. EIA/97 team during the present
study.
* Needs for Improvements:
* The main need is for EMO and EMO subcontractors to pay strict attention to performance on all EPMs
specified in the EIA (and incorporated into the Govemment/Bank loan agreements), and to report upon this
performance in detail every six months (in April and October), with the April report prepared to be a strict
Environmental Audit for the preceding year.

Annex 8: Improving Project Environmental Management
*  The needed improvements will be achieved by (a) establishing an effective Environmental Panel,
(b) restructuring the EMO into two EMOs or sub-EMOs, one for Environment and one for RS, (c) requiring
the EMOs to follow up on all Panel recommendations, (d) requiring periodic diligent reporting by the EMOs
and EMO subcontractors, in time for critical review by the Environmental Panel every six months, and
(e) furnishing appropriate technical training to all EMP participants.
* Projected Adequacy of Performance: With the changes to the EMO under "Needs for Improvements," the
environmental performance of the Xiaolangdi Project should be satisfactory for each SEI and overall, with no
significant net losses in environmental values but with very large gains.
* Project Risks: In general, all project risks are being adequately managed.
Environmental Monitoring
Background The purpose of Environmental Monitoring is to ensure that the EPMs specified in the EIA will actually be
carried out including EPMs applicable to (a) final design; (b) construction, and (c) O&M. The EMO is responsible for
management of the overall monitoring program, including surveillance of monitoring done by various components of the
project that have their own monitoring tasks, for example, dam safety instrumentation/monitoring, resettlement
supervision/monitoring, and disease control supervision. Overall responsibility of environmental monitoring is with the
EMO, with assistance from EMO's various subcontractors and with cooperation from various other agencies.
The Xiaolangdi Project is a very large-scale and very complex project, and incorporation of environmental monitoring
into the project is a formidable job, primarily because such incorporation is a relatively new practice in China, as is the
case for virtually all developing countries.
The overall monitoring program being conducted by EMO now includes two components, one for Dam Construction and
the other for the Resettlement Program. These are discussed below.
It is important to recognize that the basic environmental monitoring at the construction camps is to be done by the
construction contractors, not by the environmental consultant inspectors, nor by other ERD subcontractors including
YRWRDB and YRCH. The role of the environmental consultant inspectors and other ERD subcontractors is to "monitor
the monitoring" by the construction contractors, and for this purpose each construction contractor must submit a detailed
monthly report on its environmental monitoring work.
Dam Construction Monitoring. EMO is its own agency with its own authorities including environmental monitoring, but
EMO's environmental supervision is also a part of overall project management. For initiating the monitoring work
relating to dam construction, the work of EMO functions through the Safety Department of the General Supervision
Office of the Xiaolangdi Engineering Consulting Company (XECC).  Hence, dam  construction environmental
supervision is carried out in collaboration with the engineering supervision. Individual environmental supervision
engineers, called "Environmental Construction Inspectors" (ECIs) are made available by RPDI in the construction areas.
Their responsibilities include:  (a) monitoring of construction contractor's activities:  to ensure the construction
contractor will comply with all requirements for EPMs during construction; (b) keeping daily and weekly records and
providing regular monthly reports on the environmental consultant inspector's work; (c) preparing drafts of notices to
construction contractors when these are needed to improve construction contractor performance, to be given to EMO for
appropriate action including delivery to the construction contractor through the Engineer Supervisor/Safety Department.
Considerable improvements are needed in the system for environmental monitoring of the construction contractors.
These include (a) recognition that the role of the environmental consultant inspectors is "monitoring of the monitoring,"
(b) recognition by XECC that responsibility for environmental supervision of construction contractors is with RO/ERD,
not with the Engineer Supervisor/Safety Department, and (c) requirement for each construction contractor to submit
detailed monthly environmental monitoring reports.

Annex 8: Improving Project Environmental Management
Resettlement Monitoring. EPMs are incorporated in the entire resettlement planning and implementation process, with
attention given to (a) availability of land resources, (b) house construction and household amenities, (c) RS village
infrastructure including water supply, power, waste management, roads, schools, and clinics, (d) improvement of
infrastructure in host areas to take care of additional needs for RS, (e) provision of EIAs for all RS-sponsored projects
including irrigation and industrial projects (including provisions for pollution control), and (f) various other
environmental needs.
The present review shows that much more attention must be given to the problem of RS environmental monitoring,
including appointment of an Environmental Chief (working-level chief) by each RS village who will do the basic RS
village monitoring with monthly reports. The funding for the Environmental Monitoring Chief should be furnished by
RO/ERO.
Other Environmental Monitoring.  In addition to the environmental monitoring described above, the overall
environmental monitoring program includes attention to all other SEIs. These include archeological relics, earthquake
stability, public health, riverine water quality, reservoir area clearing, precious ecovalues, flood control, and public
participation.
Needed Improvements. To date, ERO has not got around to giving sufficient attention to the environmental monitoring
needs described above, and it is timely now for ERO to begin doing this job.
Environmental Management
Environmental Management Related to Project Stages. The job of the EMO/ERD is to carry out the EMP as specified in
the EIA, to ensure that all EPMs and environmental monitoring will actually be carried out in the subsequent stages of
project implementation. The following summarizes the Environmental Management program up to 2001:
* For the Remaining Construction Period (1997 to 2001)
* Continuing monitoring surveillance of major SEIs:
Dam construction.
RS design/construction/operation.
Archeological relics management.
Earthquake stability evaluations.
Flood forecasting/warning/presentation system.
*  Evaluation of needs for reservoir area clearing: Special study for 1997.
*  Continuing monitoring/surveillance of other SEls.
*  Special environmental enhancement studies, 1997-99.
*  Planning by ERD for EMO functions following completion of construction of the dam and RS facilities.
* For Operation of Project Components (1997 to 2001): Continuing monitoring surveillance of completed RS villages.
Assignments to ERD and ERD Subcontractors. Review shows that EMO capabilities, including capabilities of RPDI
staff who worked on EIA/92 and are now in the ERD/RPD1 subcontractor group, are progressively increasing in terms of
skills needed for the EMO job, but that (a) considerable continuing training of these staff is highly desirable to
supplement the very limited training furnished every six months by the EPER, and (b) the ERD needs to develop/use
mechanics for making more effective use of other agencies having pertinent specialty expertise, for example, on the issue
of wildlife. It should be recognized that ERD/RPDI environmental staff are mainly generalists and when they are
confronted with problems required specialized expertise, they should bring this expertise into the picture.
The ERD-cum-Subcontractors' performance needs improvement in a number of ways, as follows:
* The performance of the RPDI team on dam construction should be much improved, assuming that each of the three
major construction contractors will prepare a detailed monthly report to ERD.



Project Appraisal Document                                                                        Page 94

Annex 8: Improving Project Environmental Management
*  The role of the RPDI team, now limited mostly to the dam construction area, should be expanded to give "equal
attention" to the Resettlement Program.
*  The work of the ERD staff and of all subcontractors should be progressively improved much faster through provision
of the extra training noted above. This will include training of ERD staff in how to make effective use of the
expertise of other agencies as needed, including local environmental protection bureaus at the county level (for
example, on precious ecoresource issues).
*  The work of the YRWRPB as now practiced for the RS program, because it is limited to visits once every six
months, is of little value. Also, it needs improvement for the dam construction program. The YRWRPB work for
the RS villages covers only water supply mineral quality, which is only one of the various parameters of concern, and
even for this visits made only every six months are hardly worthwhile. The work of environmental management of
the RS villages should be assigned totally to RPDI. The YRWRPB work should be limited to water quality
monitoring of streams in ESA, and noise/dust/air pollution monitoring in dam construction area, to be done every
three months, for monitoring of the monitoring done by the construction contractors.
ERD Reporting. ERD reporting has been geared to match the needs of the Expert Panel, with reports produced every six
months, one month ahead of Panel Meetings. However, these have given only limited attention to the recommendations
made by the EPER.
Follow-Up Special Studies. The EIA/92 report recommended that some additional follow-up studies be undertaken in
order to obtain optional enhancement benefits from the Xiaolangdi project. None of these has been needed for the dam
construction stage operation but they should be carried out before dam construction has been completed. The
recommended studies include those for (a) wetlands preservation, (b) optional water balance, (c) reservoir fisheries,
(d) forestry rehabilitation in the area around the reservoir, (e) use of the reservoir area as a regional recreational park, and
(f) enhancement of downstream agriculture. The TORs for the recommended studies are given in EIA/97 Annex 6
including tasks, skills, timeframes, and costs. All of the studies are to be done in this phase of the project by selected
Chinese experts in the specialties concerned, and all of the recommended plans should be prepared at the feasibility level.
Training of EMP Participants. It is now realized that a tailored training program is needed for Xiaolangdi for the staff of
ERD and of ERD's subcontractors, and the proposed program is as follows.
*  Tailored classroom training (combined with field observations) of selected staff of ERD and of ERD's subcontractors
(RPDI, YRWRPB, YRCH), in environmental technology for EIA for major dam/reservoir projects, with sessions of
10 calendar days every three months for a period of two years, with instruction by distinguished Chinese
Environmental Technologists.
*  Field observation training in environmental monitoring for selected ERD and other YR agency staff, say for 10
persons, for a period of one month with a selected appropriate agency in a foreign developed country.
Expert Panel Operations. With respect to Panel membership, it would be very helpful if an additional member be
appointed to the Panel, who should be a distinguished Chinese Environmental Engineer, who could serve as the EPER's
Chinese counterpart. An alternative is to reestablish the panel system to be two panels, one for Environmental and one
for RS.
With respect to the Panel's field trips, the procedure used to date has been to "piggyback" the environmental field trips
onto the RS field trips, but this has not permitted sufficient time for the needed field environmental work. Hence, it is
recommended that in the future the environmental and RS visits be separately arranged.

3. Conclusions and Recommendations
Overall Conclusion
Given the improvements listed above, it can be expected that the Xiaolangdi Project's status in terms of environmental
protection will be upgraded from its present level of "fair performance" to excellent performance. Much progress in
performance has been achieved since EIA/92, but it must be remembered that the Xiaolangdi Project is a large and
complex project and that the conceptlprogram for ensuring that the project is environmentally sound is very complex and
pioneering for a major water resource development project in China. Hence, despite the progress made to date, much
more needs to be made and, based on the "lessons learned" over the period 1992-97, the entire Xiaolangdi Project EMP
should be restructured and improved.
Responsibility for Environmental Management
The environmental management job is now assigned to RO, which has a suboffice called the Environmental Resources
Division (ERD), which is the EMO for carrying out the EMP. The work of the EMO has been reviewed every six
months by the EPER and the reports of the EPER are in effect "Environmental Audits" of the work of RO/ERD on
environment. These audits show that the EMO has been able to function with only partial effectiveness, primarily
because the resettlement job itself is huge and requires the RO's attention to such a degree that insufficient attention is
available for EMO. For this reason, the work of the EMO subcontractors has been only partially effective for
environmental control of dam construction, less for environmental control of resettlement, and lacking in other
components including attention to disease control, archeological relics, and precious ecoresources. The alternatives for
correcting this problem are either (a) strengthening RO/EMO, or (b) establishing an EMO/Dam to be managed by the
Dam Engineering Office, and leaving with RO the EMO/Resettlement.
Expert Panel Restructuring
The present situation of the EPER can be considerably improved by (a) strengthening the existing Panel by adding some
Chinese Environmental Technologists, and (b) reestablishing the Panel structure into two panels, one on " Environmental
Management" and one on "Resettlement Management." The Environmental Management Panel would be concerned
with both the EMO/Dam and the EMO/RS (see Annex 2).
Environmental Auditing
As noted above, the reports of the EPER have amounted to Environmental Auditing, but have not been officially
recognized as such, hence many of the findings and recommendations of the EPER have not been fully implemented. It
is recommended that the Panel visits continue to be made every six months, and that the Panel reports made in April each
year be classified as official Environmental Audits. There should also be understanding that Panel's recommendations
on environment, made every six months, will be acted upon by the EMOs and duly reported upon in their 6-month
reports. The Panel's meetings should be extended to a period of three weeks each, to enable comprehensive reviews and
critiquing together with training.
Environmental Management for Dam Project
Improvements Measures. The program for Environmental Management for Dam Project should include all SEIs except
those relating to RS, including dam construction, control of diseases affected by building and operating the dam, relics
control, and riverine water quality monitoring. With the proposed new EMO/Dam setup, it should be readily possible to
carry out the recommended needed improvements in EMO operations related to the dam. These will include
improvements in (a) performance of the Environmental Construction Inspectors (under RPDI control), (b) control of the
construction contractors through the requirement that each construction contractor submit a detailed monthly report on

1. Inundation Impact as Updated in 1994
Xiaolangdi Dam construction affected 40 villages in 10 townships. The total amount of land acquired is 35,503 mu,
including 21,300 mu of cultivated land. The total number of people affected is 10,574 and the total house area
demolished is 302,100 m2.
The reservoir would affect 174 villages in 29 townships in eight counties of Henan and Shanxi Province. The census and
inventory in the reservoir area was conducted in 1986 and partly updated in 1991. Due to the rapid economic growth in
the reservoir areas, a full census and inventory was conducted from April to December 1994 at the request of local
governments. As compared with 1991, the total population in the reservoir area increased by 16.93 percent, house and
caves increased by 62.07 percent while factories and mines increased by 212 percent with a 91.54 percent increase of
employees.

II. Resettlement Policy Framework
Resettlement Polices. The Chinese resettlement policies stipulate the following guiding principles for large water projects:
(a) restoring and improving current income levels of resettlers; (b) ensuring adequate household grain production;
(c) increasing net income per unit of land; (d) increasing household income through nonfarm jobs; (e) transferring people
from agricultural to nonagricultural registration; (f) minimizing social stress; and (g) ensuring acceptable living standards.
Compensation Principles. In accordance with above policies, the following compensation principles have been adhered
to in Xiaolangdi resettlement planning and implementation:
* Land. Compensation is paid to reflect the loss of use of the land rather than loss of title. The methodology stipulated
in the Land Administration Law is adopted for compensation estimation. Land compensation should be used to
restore and improve the living standard of the relocatees and host population.

Annex 9: Resettlement Progress Report
*  House and caves. Compensation should be paid at replacement costs. The replacement costs should be evaluated
and determined by technical experts.
*  Industries and mines.  Compensation should be paid at replacement cost for equipment, structures and other
facilities.
*  Infrastructure. Compensation is paid at reconstruction cost to restore its original function. The cost should be
estimated according to the reconstruction technical design.
Resettlement principles. In line with the above policies, the following principles are adopted in resettlement planning,
design and implementation:
*  The population subject to resettlement should not only maintain its current standard of living but it should also directly
share in project benefits.
*  The resettlement transition period should be minimized and adequate support for both social and economic development
should be provided during the transition period.
•  Resettlement should achieve the complete social and economic re-establishment of those dislocated, on a viable
productive basis, through the creation of project-funded new industrial, service sector and agricultural employment
activities.
*  Insofar as changes of occupation are necessary, the replacement opportunities should properly recognize the social,
communal, cultural, educational, and vocational profile of those affected, and any changes in economic activities should
be introduced on a voluntary basis.
Resettlement of the agricultural population should be land-based wherever possible.
Land sharing with host villages should be based on the principle of mutual acceptance and should be planned so as to
provide higher incomes (from all sources) for relocatees and hosts.
* The resettlement plans should have popular acceptance and the affected population should be consulted.
* Resettlement distances should be minimized and opportunities for resettling entire communities and natural groups
should be provided.
Houses and community facilities at new town and village sites should be constructed to higher standards.
The resettlement plans for towns, villages and enterprises should minimize the loss of existing agricultural lands.
* The resettlement plans should have adequate institutional arrangements to ensure effective and timely implementation
and adequate monitoring and evaluation arrangements.
* The financial resources to canry out the relocation and development proposals should be available when and where
required. Development plans should be prepared in concert with relocation plans.
* The impact of resettlement on the natural and socioeconomic host environment should be considered acceptable.
Only those enterprises that will be economically viable should be considered for relocation and the compensation for the
assets of the nonviable enterprises should be used to create new employment opportunities.
* Inundated items of infrastructure such as roads, bridges, etc., should be replaced so that the previous level of service is
maintained or improved.
* If sharing farmlands does not result in achieving target incomes, some of the labor force should be offered
nonagricultural employment opportunities.
* Family members of the employees of affected state enterprises and institutions can go into nonagricultural sectors on a
voluntary basis. The units of local governments, once compensated, shall be responsible for such employment
arrangements.
III. Resettlement Design Optimization
The preliminary technical design for Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project was conducted between 1986 and 1991 when
MWR and SPC reviewed and cleared the technical designs. The World Bank appraised the project in 1993. Rapid
economic growth in the reservoir area since 1991 has significantly increased the inundation impacts. Meanwhile, the
damsite resettlement has yielded valuable experiences for Xiaolangdi Resettlement. The technical designs have been

Annex 9: Resettlement Progress Report
under continuous consultation with local governments and the affected communities for improvement. With the above
considerations, the resettlement technical design has been modified for optimization.
Resettlement Schedule. Resettlement is planned to be carried out in four stages. Phase I is resettlement at the dam site.
It occurred between 1992 and 1994. Phase 11 is in the area below EL 180 and is planned to be implemented from 1994 to
1997. The key date during the dam construction is the completion of the cofferdam and river closure in the fall of 1997
when the reservoir will begin to fill to EL 180. The number of people to be resettled in Phase II is 25,026 rural people
and 2,600 state workers. Phase III is in the area between Elevation 180-265 and will mostly take place from 1997 to
2000. The population to be resettled in Phase III is 131,235 rural people and 3,900 state workers. The Xiaolangdi
reservoir will be operated to full supply level at 265 m for approximately 10-15 years to allow for sediment deposition.
Phase IV is resettlement between Elevation 265-275 and will mostly take place from 2010 to 2012. In the post-
deposition period, the reservoir will be raised to EL 275, requiring the resettlement of another 24,777 rural people and
500 state workers by 2011. Overall, 198,712 people will require relocation and rehabilitation on account of the creation
of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir. Table 2 shows the actual movement of people up to December 31, 1996 and the planned
movement starting from 1997 to 2001. It will be noticed since whole villages are being moved, some people in Phases
III and IV are grouped with people in Phase II to ensure that there is no social disruption of villages. For example, Phase
II requires 25,026 people to be moved, but a total of 45,500 are being moved because 17,000 people in Phase III and 900
in Phase IV have been grouped together with Phase II to preserve the integrity of the villages as people are moved.
Similarly, in Phase III, 800 people have been included from Phase IV.

Reservoir Resettlement below EL 180. The directly inundated population in Phase II is 25,026 in Jiyuan, Xinan and
Mengjin Counties. The planned population for resettlement is adjusted to include those who will be inundated in Phase
111, but will lose access to communication and power supply during Phase 11. The total number of people for resettlement
in Phase 11 is now adjusted to 46,133 in 27 villages, including 42,425 rural and 3,708 urban population. They will be
resettled in Xinan, Jiyuan, Mengjin, Wenxian, Mengxian, Yuanyang County and Yima City. According to the 1994
inventory, there are 234 industries and mines to be inundated in Phase II. After extensive market surveys and discussions
with the affected enterprises, it is agreed that 13 enterprises will be relocated, 157 enterprises will transfer into other
productive operations or be combined through technical innovations and 64 enterprises will drop out of production with
compensation.
Reservoir Resettlement at EL 180-265 & EL 265-275. The total population that needs to be resettled during Phase III and
IV is 142,005, including 118,985 in Phase III and 23,020 in Phase IV. Eleven towns and 553 factories and mines will be
inundated and need relocation. The resettlement technical designs are being optimized as detailed implementation
designs for Phase III and Phase IV. They are expected to be completed at the end of April 1997 and submitted to MWR
and SPC for review in July 1997.

Annex 9: Resettlement Progress Report
Henan will need to resettle 91,331 rural population during Phase III and IV, including 6,500 in Mengjin County, 12,816
in Mianchi County, 862 in Shanxian County, 53,148 in Xinan County and 18,005 in Jiyuan County. Mengjin, Mianchi
and Shanxian Counties will resettle the resettlers within their counties. Land carrying capacity analysis indicates that
Xinan County is only able to resettle 11,360 people within Xinan and 35,961 people will have to be resettled in
Wenmengtan, Zhongmou, Kaifeng and Yuangyang County. Jiyuan will resettle 10,754 people within the county and
7,251 in Wenmengtan.
Xiaolangdi Reservoir would affect three counties in Shanxi, i.e. Pinglu, Xiaxian and Yuanqu. Pinglu and Xiaxian have
relatively small impacts and the affected population will be resettled within their counties. Yuanqu County will resettle
its 34,701 rural population in 58 resettlement sites.
Cost Estimate. The World Bank appraised project cost at 5.1 billion yuan in 1993. With the latest inventory, price
escalation and optimization of resettlement designs, RPDI reestimated the resettlement cost of Xiaolangdi Resettlement
Project. Unit price analysis was conducted according to typical designs to determine unit price. All compensation rates
were reestimated and revised, including land, houses, structures. The appraisal mission of Xiaolangdi Multipurpose
Dam Stage II Project reviewed the resettlement cost. The total cost amounts to 8,645 million yuan, including 7,839
million yuan for the reservoir resettlement, 612 million yuan for Wenmengtan Scheme and 193 million yuan for Houhe
Scheme. The total baseline cost is 6,109 million yuan with a physical contingency of 609 million yuan and a price
contingency of 1,927 million yuan.
IV. Implementation Status
Organizational Establishment.  A complete institutional set-up has been established for the implementation and
management of Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project. The Ministry of Water Resources is the leading body in guiding the
project implementation while YRWHDCRO assumes the full responsibility of the project implementation. A contract
system has been adopted between the two provinces and MWR for the project implementation. The resettlement
institutional setup consists of leading groups and resettlement offices at different levels of government.
Leading Groups. Both the central and local governments have set up leading groups for Xiaolangdi Resettlement
Project. The leading groups are the decision making bodies at different levels of the governments dealing with major
issues in policy, financing, land, provincial coordination. The Central Leading Group is headed by a Deputy Director of
SPC and has, as its members, a Vice Minister of MWR and the vice governors of both Henan and Shanxi Provinces.
Henan and Shanxi have both set up provincial resettlement leading groups. The leading groups are headed by vice
governors and the directors of relevant departments and resettlement bureaus are the group members. All affected county
governments have set up leading groups for the project.
Resettlement Management Offices. Resettlement offices have been set up under all leading groups to coordinate and
implement the project.  The resettlement office in MWR is responsible for overall resettlement planning and
implementation coordination. The Resettlement Office of Xiaolangdi Project has been responsible for resettlement
planning, financial management, internal monitoring and supervision. Provincial and municipal resettlement offices
have been responsible for resettlement planning, management, supervision and implementation. County resettlement
offices have been working under the county leading groups with township governments and village committees to
implement the resettlement plan.
Institutional Capacity Buildup-Staffing.  Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project has been adequately staffed with an
employment of 430 people in both Henan and Shanxi Provinces. Most of the resettlement officers have received high
education and have had working experience in rural development, particularly in the water sector.
Training. YRWHDCRO has drawn up a detailed training program for resettlement staff. The training program covers
resettlement planning, project management, financial management, project monitoring and information system

management etc. Training will be conducted through seminars and study tours. YRWHDCRO has issued its "Training
Management Methodology for Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project." A training officer has been appointed to take full
charge of training programs. By the end of 1996, YRWHDCRO and the resettlement offices at different levels had
organized 18 training seminars for 1,328 people.
Development of Management Regulations. To strengthen resettlement management, MWR, YRWHDCRO and the
provinces have formulated the following regulations for resettlement management:
*  Planning And Design Guidelines For Xiaolangdi Resettlement
*  Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project Implementation Management Methodology
*  Resettlement Planning And Management Methodology
*  Resettlement Management Methodology for Industries And Mines
*  Resettlement Inspection And Acceptance Methodology
*  Financial Disbursement Regulation
Resettlement Phase I: Damsite Resettlement-Physical Relocation. Damsite construction affected 10,574 people in 12
villages, of whom 6,911 needed to be resettled. Resettlement preparation started in 1992 and completed in 1994. Twelve
resettlement villages have been established with complete community amenities of water supply, power supply', roads,
communication and broadcasting. 2,315 households have moved into new houses with a total area of 296,000 m .
Livelihood Development. 8,500 mu of cultivated land have been allocated to the resettlers and the objective of one mu of
cultivated land per capita has been achieved. Seventeen enterprises have employed 963 resettlers and the affected
villages have set up 31 rural enterprises and 408 resettlers have been employed.
Income Evaluation.  YRWHDCRO and independent monitors conducted an income survey among 82 resettler
households in the damsite area in 1995. The survey indicates that significant changes have taken place in the income
streams of the resettler households and their per capita income has increased significantly. On-farm income has dropped
from 48.4 percent of their total income before resettlement to 15.3 percent after resettlement while off-farm income
increased from 39.4 percent to 68.4 percent. Households with per capita income below 300 Y dropped from 42.7 percent
before resettlement to 23.3 percent after resettlement. Households with per capita income between 800-1000 yuan
increased from 3.7 percent to 12.2 percent while households with per capita income above 1,000 Y increased from 9.8
percent to 32.9 percent.
Public Assessment of Resettlement. The independent monitor conducted post-resettlement surveys among resettlers of
different ages at the damsite for their opinions on various aspects of resettlement including new houses, surroundings,
relations with hosting communities, safety, health etc. The surveys indicate high levels of satisfaction.
Resettlement Phase Il: Reservoir Resettlement below EL 180. Phase 11 resettlement experienced some delays during
start-up stage because of the management institutional readjustment. Phase 11 resettlement actually started in 1994 when
YRWHDCRO was established for the project implementation management.
Residential Site Development. It is planned to establish 34 resettlement villages for 42,425 resettlers in Jiyuan, Xinan
and Mengjin counties. The total planned area for the resettlement villages is 6,000 mu and has been fully allocated. Out
of the 6,000 mu, 5953 mu had been leveled by the end of 1996. 11,268 households have finished their house
2
construction with a total area of 1,011,000 m . The completion rate is 88 percent. The new houses are either self-
constructed or contracted to construction teams by the resettlers. All new houses are of brick and cement type with better
quality. By the end of 1996, 16,580 people in 4,478 households had moved into their new houses. Please note in Table 3
that although 88 percent of households have completed houses, only 40 percent have moved. The rest have moved in
part so that families can continue to work in the old villages as well as start farming in the new village. This is to
maximize their incomes in the transition period and to prevent any chance of decline in original incomes as they move.

Land allocation and on-farm  development.  It is planned to allocate 38,781 mu of cultivated  land for the resettlers, of
which 31,766 mu would be irrigated. 34,467 mu of land had already been allocated to the resettlers by the end of 1996,
including 26,654 mu of irrigated land.  Extensive on-farm  development works are underway to provide the outstanding
irrigated land to the resettlers.

After land acquisition for the resettlers, all hosting villages have redistributed their remaining farm land among the
villagers. In the meantime, they have either used the land compensation on on-farm development to raise productivity of
the remaining land or have started off-farm and side-line economic activities to restore income losses due to land

acquisition. By the end of 1996, 28 township and village enterprises have been established including seven in Jiyuan,
twelve in Mengjin, five in Xinan and four in Yima.
Resettlement of Industries and Mines. After extensive market surveys and discussions with the affected enterprises, it is
agreed that 13 enterprises will be relocated, 157 enterprises will transfer into other productive operations or be combined
through technical innovations and 64 enterprises will drop out of production with compensation. Now 14 new
enterprises have been established and 14 are still under reconstruction. Most of the 64 enterprises to be canceled are
small private mines. It is planned that they will fully utilize their compensation to tap the resources in the resettlement
area or develop sideline economic activities.
Resettlement of Industrial Population. The total number of employees in the inundated enterprises is 13,684, including
815 urban registered and 12,234 rural registered. The 815 urban employees are regular workers in the enterprises and
they will be employed in the relocated or new enterprises. The 12,869 rural registered employees are mostly daily wage
laborers. All the daily wage laborers will receive a compensation equal to 3-6 month salary.
Wenmengtan Development. It is proposed to resettle 46,172 people from Xinan and Jiyuan counties in the downstream
Wenmengtan region. To increase the farmland available and to reduce the risk of flood damage, river training works will
be carried out. The scheme would protect 200,000 mu of flood-prone farmland and create 81,000 mu cultivated land
through warping and soil improvement to 46,172 resettlers from Xinan and Jiyuan County under the project. Henan
River Bureau has been contracted to undertake the river training works and land development in Wenmengtan. The
bureau has set up Wenmengtan Project Office and has organized 18 construction companies with 1,224 staff. River
training works started in 1992 and are well underway.
Houhe Irrigation Scheme. This scheme is proposed as a compensation measure for Gucheng Town in Yuanqu county,
where most of the irrigated land would be inundated. The scheme would irrigate an area of 75,000 mu and include
completion of construction of the Houhe Dam and the irrigation schemes. Shanxi Province has set up the Houhe
Reservoir Project Office with the full responsibility to manage the construction works of both the dam and the irrigation
works.
A local hydropower bureau contractor was awarded the contract for Houhe Dam construction. Civil works have already
started and are scheduled to be completed by June 1999. Yuncheng Prefecture Survey and Design Institute completed the
technical design optimization for Houhe Irrigation District in October 1996. MWR reviewed and cleared the optimized
design in December 1996.
Resettlement Phase III & IV. Reservoir Resettlement EL 180-275. Phase II resettlement has already started in Shanxi
Province. Implementation progress includes acquisition of 18,100 mu of cultivated land, construction of four pump
stations to irrigate 720 mu of land, establishment of nine enterprises, house construction of 456 households and road
construction of 41.4 km. Land acquisition is over for the relocation of Gucheng Town. Its infrastructure construction is
basically complete for roads, water and power supply. 16,100 m2 of houses have been constructed for institutions in
Gucheng Town.
Financial Disbursement & Financing. The World Bank Credit is US$110 million and the rest of the cost is financed by
the Government. By the end of 1996, the World Bank had disbursed US$46.69 million while the local funds disbursed
amounted to 1,921 million yuan.

Preferential Policy. Both Henan and Shanxi Province stipulated their preferential policies for the resettlers under
Xiaolangdi Project in 1993. The preferential policies include priority in employment, tax exemptions, registration
transfer, training, material supply. Henan Province instructed all provincial and municipal government departments in
May 1996 to support the eight resettlement counties in their sectoral operations, investment proposals review, investment
and technical guidance. These departments proposed specific support programs. Some of them have already been
completed.
Consultation & Participation. Public participation and consultation is a continuous process for Xiaolangdi Resettlement
Project since a very early stage. All relevant departments, institutions and the affected population, including the
relocatees and host population have participated actively in the resettlement planning, designing and implementation
activities. Resettlement principles, policies and strategies were formulated in close consultation with the affected
population. The affected communities provided important input in the inventory of physical losses, optimizing and
finalizing resettlement designs for implementation. Every affected family participated in the 1994 census and inventory
updating and signed off at the household inventory record. Resettlement planning was conducted by the design institutes
based on the resource carrying capacity and local development plans. Resettlement designs were finalized after thorough
consultation and consent of local government and the affected population.
Vulnerable Groups Women participated in the resettlement planning and design. They have enjoyed equal opportunities
in agriculture land allocation and employment. They have played an important role in house economy development and
resettlement. Old people and children have been given particular support and care during resettlement. Old people living
with their children are usually taken care of by their children. Those old people living alone are mostly taken care of by
the village committees. Village committees organized support to help them during relocation, and have usually provided
for their living. They could choose to live either in the village or in the Home For the Old at the expense of the villagers.
Some villages provide pension for the old people. All resettlement villages have built up their own primary schools and
high school students attend local schools. Schooling was not interrupted during relocation. Some villages have even set
up kindergartens.
There are some disabled or impoverished resettler families. The disabled are all taken care of by the villages as with the
old. The impoverished families are provided support under the project in kind, subsidies and training on a case-by-case
basis to help them get out of poverty.
Grievances Redress. The grievance redress mechanism has been established as planned and the resettlement offices at
every administration level have been functioning well as the main redress body. The grievances filed so far are largely of
two categories i.e. compensation and resettlement. The former includes properties missed during the inventorying and

Annex 9: Resettlement Progress Report
disputed ownership. The latter covers resettlement site selection, house construction, land allocation, transfer of
teachers. Most of the grievances are redressed in a timely fashion.
Resettlement Monitoring & Supervision. Internal monitoring. YRWHDCRO has been conducting regular monitoring of
resettlement progress in both Henan and Shanxi Provinces. Both provincial and county resettlement offices have
appointed monitoring staff and set up the monitoring and reporting system. YRWHDCRO started in late 1994 to
computerize the monitoring system. YRWHDCRO has completed the development of its Resettlement Information
Management System. Five subsystems have already been put into operation including the Basic and Geographic System,
Resettlement Planning System, Resettlement Management System, Socioeconomic Monitoring System and
Administrative Management System. YRWHDCRO is now planning to conduct systematic training and computerize its
resettlement monitoring system.
External Monitoring. YRWHDCRO has engaged the Resettlement Monitoring Institute of North China Hydroelectric
University to conduct independent monitoring and evaluation of Xiaolangdi Resettlement. The institute has been
conducting semi-annual monitoring since 1993 and has submitted six monitoring and evaluation reports. The institute
has employed tracking and random sampling monitoring methodologies in resettlement monitoring. The institute made
extensive household interviews and group discussions. The institute has covered resettlement physical progress and the
socioeconomic conditions of both the resettler and hosting communities. The institute has focused on resettlement site
development, physical progress of resettlement, compensation payment, livelihood development ( land adjustment and
development, farm yields, industrial development, education, public health and incomes in new host areas), participation
and consultation, preferential policies, resettlement of the vulnerable groups and functioning of resettlement
organizations and living standard monitoring and evaluation. External monitoring has provided valuable input to
optimize resettlement design and resettlement.
Supervision. The Resettlement Bureau of Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCCRO) has been contracted as
the supervising engineer to supervise the resettlement implementation of the project. YRCCRO has started, since
September 1996, monthly supervision of resettlement implementation, focusing on the physical progress, engineering
quality, financial expenditure and disbursement. This is the first case of using supervising engineers for resettlement in
China.
International Panel. An international panel of resettlement and environment experts was organized in July 1994 for
Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project. The panel has met every six months to review and evaluate the project progress and
advise on resolving any issues that may arise during the implementation of the project. The panel's main findings have
been the following: (a) The planning and design of the resettlement programs has been undertaken very well;
(b) Consultation process with resettlers has been followed satisfactorily; (c) Compensation amounts paid to resettlers
have been adequate for almost 99 percent of the people although there are odd families where the compensation amounts
do not meet their needs. The village councils and County Resettlement Offices have made up the deficit for these poor
families; (d) The housing and infrastructure construction have generally been excellent and ahead of schedule; (e) The
transfer of people to the new locations is also smoothly undertaken so that there has been no major loss of income;
(f) Land development for farms has been slow and needs to be speeded up. However, resettlers' incomes have not been
affected due to other sources of employment, e.g., in the dam construction; (g) resettler incomes have generally increased
enormously due to employment generated in the construction sites and in industry; (h) environmental monitoring and
implementation of the environmental management plan within new villages can be improved for sanitation (solid waste
and drainage within villages) and some public health problems within villages. It has been recommended that two
Environmental Management Offices be set up one for the Resettlement project and another for the Dam Project. In this
way more focused attention can be paid to the resettlement; and (i) although resettler grievances have been adequately
addressed, there does not seem to be proper documentation of all grievances and the redress actions taken. The panel has
recommended a system to record all grievances and actions taken to resolve them.

Status of Main Civil Works Contracts for Lots 1, 2, and 3
The Bank's mission in October/November 1996 reviewed the construction for the three lots by YRWHDC. The missions
have had detailed discussions with XECC (the "Engineer") and with CIPM (the foreign consultant) who is advising
XECC. A great part of the review centered on the work of the lot 2 contractor, China-Germany International Contractors
(CGIC) and the cash flow problems of all three contractors. There was considerable discussion of how to improve the
supervision capability of XECC and the role of the owner at the site. The status of the different contracts is discussed
below and is shown in Table 1.

/a All these events are on the critical path.
The overall progress and implementation status of the three lots until November 1996, as indicated in the monthly
progress report, is as follows:
(a) Lot I completion is 47 percent in terms of costs.
(b) Lot 2 completion is 48 percent in terms of costs.
(c) Lot 3 completion is 44 percent in terms of costs.
The progress so far is on schedule and should be able to meet the diversion schedule.

Country: China                                                    Project Title: Xlaolangdl Multipurpose Project: Stage II
Annex 10: Construction Schedule
The schedule summarized in the table is generally satisfactory for all three Lots. The Lot 1 contractor has completed
all the unclassified and rock excavation and about two thirds of the concrete placement on the right bank and the
consolidation grouting. The contractor has placed 7.2 million m3 of the fill on the right bank, which is about 16 percent
more than required. The contractor has started to work on the left bank excavation of 1.28 million m3 and is well ahead
of schedule. The major problem encountered by the contractor was the consolidation grouting, which has been resolved.
There are some other issues. The first one is that the zone 3 material for the transition zone is too coarse and is
incompatible with the coarse filter. The second issue is the cutoff wall needs for the left bank, which needs to be defined
more carefully through more subsurface investigations. Presently, the subsurface rock overhang needs to be defined
more carefully so that the contractor can proceed with the cutoff wall construction. About 125 foreign workers and 1,357
local workers are at the site. The quality of works performed is outstanding, and the relationship with the client is
excellent.
All of the Lot 2 contractor's tasks still fall on the critical path. YRWHDC and CGIC agree that the river diversion
milestone date will remain as October 30, 1997. The intake and tunnel excavation are completed and concreting
schedule for the tunnels and intake are all falling on schedule, and the performance in late 1996 had considerably
improved since May 1996. The rate of concreting work of the tunnels, intake and plunge pool had already reached
80,000 m 3/month in October 1996 and 100,000 m 3/month in November. These rates are close to the peak rates that need
to be accomplished in 1997 to achieve the closure targets to complete the construction for the intake, plunge pool and
tunnels. The schedule is dependent on the completion of the mid-gate chamber, which is very large and complicated.
General quality control for shotcrete, concreting work and other works meet all the specified requirements as indicated
from most of the tests by the contractor.
The Lot 3 contractor is on schedule in the construction of all the works and has made up for all lost time. The main
issues raised on this contract are related to the divider wall in the outlet draft channels in the afterbay. The divider wall is
extremely unstable and saving the wall by anchors is delaying the concreting of the afterbay channels. The mission
suggested that the present rock divider wall be removed and replaced by a concrete wall, which would save a lot of time.
XECC/RPDI will review the designs and ensure that a decision is made on the proposed designs so that the contractor's
work will not be delayed.
Project Costs
The costs of the major civil works, which accounts for about 60 percent of the total costs, have been reestimated in the
progress reports as given in Table 2 below, which indicates that the costs of these works have not changed very much
from the appraisal estimates. The total price and physical contingencies have changed slightly but have not exceeded the
costs estimated during the appraisal. These costs do not include the duties, which could add another 10 to 15 percent
additional costs. The overall costs of the project do not seem to have changed very much compared with the original
contract prices.
Schedule of Project
A detailed schedule of the construction works has been agreed with the contractors. The schedule by Lots are attached in
Figure 10.2.
Disbursements
Disbursements were lagging behind schedule because of slow startup of the Lot 2, which had problems with unexpected
geology and due to poor performance of local contractors. However, this contractor is performing quite well and has the
project implementation well in hand. The disbursement have picked up and 70 percent of the loan has been disbursed up

Annex 12: Guidelines for Emergency Preparedness Plan
ANNEX 12: GUIDELINES FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN
A detailed Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) should be established for each dam within the drainage area or operating
system as a whole. If there is more than one system operating within the same drainage area, the EPP should be
coordinated by a joint committee on emergency operation composed of representatives of all operating organizations.
The EPP should be approved by the Government Agency.
The EPP should be reviewed at regular intervals for the need of updating and adaptation to alterations of the physical and
social environment, if necessary. Appropriate intervals for the review may be periods of five to ten years depending
upon the progress of regional development.
The EPP should deal with, but not be limited to, the following aspects:
. hydrographic observation and flood warning scheme;
* drawdown and flood control operation of reservoir;
* emergency emptying of the reservoir;
* inundation maps for flows up to the design flood, and for catastrophic conditions caused by dam failure;
* evacuation of flood-threatened areas;
. rescue operations and other emergency provisions;
e equipment, material and support available for emergency relief;
. coordination of emergency relief actions with third parties (for instance: civil defense, police, hospitals, etc.);
. emergency standby of public utilities;
. emergency operation of power plant, water supply scheme associated with the dam;
* emergency warning;
* emergency communication;
* emergency transportation;
e emergency access to the damsite;
e emergency decision-making process and procedures.
The EPP may be done for several types and modes of emergency but should include the analysis of the most severe
possibility; that is, the instantaneous failure of the dam. The possible effect of the failure of upstream dams should also
be taken into account.
The EPP should cope with emergency precautions and possible emergency repair measures at the dam site and with
warning and emergency relief action downstream of the dam.
Flood warning and emergency warning systems should be checked for reliability and efficiency before the beginning of
each flood season.
The EPP should include instructions to be followed by the local operating staff in the event of loss of communications
with the leading control agency.
In case of imminent danger or of a major accident, corrective action must be taken immediately and independently of
normal administrative procedures. Enough authority should be vested in the operator's top level technical personnel to
order emergency preventive or repair measures without asking for special authorization from management.
Clear and easily understandable emergency instructions should be issued to all operating units. These emergency
instructions, which must include a definition of the supervising units authorized or obliged to issue orders under
emergency conditions, should be easily accessible. The need for updating should be checked periodically and always
after institutional, operational and administrative changes.
10.   Operating staff should be trained and periodically retrained in emergency operations.

Annex 13: Guidelines for Dam Operation and Maintenance
ANNEX 13: GUIDELINES FOR DAM OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
The operation of a dam and reservoir needs to be understood in the context of the multiple users who are involved,
contractual agreements therewith, and best efforts possible to optimize benefits for all.
For each dam and reservoir, a reservoir capacity allocation scheme should be prepared. The scheme should usually
include the following items:
*  Reservoir capacity allocation for different uses at several elevations and a reference to the use allocations made in
planning and designing the project.
* Flood regulation criteria and flood discharges.
* Sediment regulating rules and siltation.
* Water supply for irrigation.
* Water supply for municipal and industrial uses.
* Hydropower generating operation.
To ensure the operational safety, the performance of the dam and appurtenant structures should be carefully monitored.
The monitoring should include, but not be limited to, the following items:
* Instrumentation system, including the surface and embedded devices, should be monitored at regular intervals. The
accuracy of data obtained from the readings should be checked annually for two or three years after commissioning
of the dam and later at longer intervals. The actual loads and loading combinations acting upon the structure should
be compared with those of the original design. At the same time, the original design criteria and safety strategy
should be reviewed with emphasis on the compatibility with current technology.
*  Visual examination of structures should be carried out at regular intervals.
*  The exposed surfaces of a concrete dam and appurtenant concrete structures should be visually examined for cracks,
spelling, leaching, leakage, indication of deterioration or chemical reactions and damage from erosion or cavitation,
etc. Earth rockfill embankments should be examined for cracks, leakage, saturated areas, springs, sinkholes,
evidence of piping, erosion, frost heave, crest alignment, bulging or depression of slopes and berms, animal burrows,
and the deterioration of riprap or other slope protection materials.
*  If the visual examination reveals evidence of material deterioration or unsafe structural behavior, or yields doubts
about the structural and/or operational safety, a more in-depth investigation by core drilling, excavation of
observation pits and/or other appropriate methods should be initiated immediately.
*  Underwater examination should be made periodically for those parts which are permanently submerged, such as
lower part of the upstream slope or face of a dam and stilling basins. The examination can be implemented by
sounding and/or by underwater television camera.
*  Drainage systems and uplift pressure relief devices should be examined for possible obstruction, deterioration or
damage by chemical reactions or bacterial growth. Sources of seepage should be pinpointed and flow rate and
quality (clear or muddy water) should be investigated for comparison with previous observations and the results of
permeability computations. Any anomalous changes in seepage volume shall be investigated immediately.
*  All mechanical and associated electrical equipment of the dam should be examined for proper functioning and
adequate maintenance. Besides the accuracy of operating performance, inspection should extend to lubrication and
the functional integrity of the equipment. Corroded, damaged or worn parts shall be replaced. An adequate stock of
spare parts must be maintained throughout the dam's service life.
The service and emergency power sources and transmission should be examined with special attention to the power
supply under regionwide natural catastrophic conditions.
Siltation of the reservoir should be annually monitored by sounding.
Critical areas of the reservoir rim should be inspected annually for five years and later at least every three years for
landslides and the indication of the development of problems that might affect the safety of the dam or reservoir.

Annex 13: Guidelines for Dam Operation and Maintenance
The whole reservoir and its surroundings should remain under permanent surveillance with respect to possible health
problems. If foci of waterborne or water-related diseases should develop, they must be brought under specialized
medical control immediately. Though pollution is normally not a direct consequence of reservoir or dam operation, the
operation unit should make every possible effort to detect sources of pollution in order to enable the public health and
other government authorities to enforce pollution control.
The adequacy and proper functioning of monitoring instruments and devices should be checked at least every two years.
The accuracy and correct functioning of the hydrographic observation system, inclusive of telemetering and transmission
devices, should be checked before the beginning of every flood season.
The sequence and frequency of the reading of monitoring instruments and observation devices should follow the specific
instructions given by the designer during initial stage of operation, and later on can be revised according to the variation
tendency derived from accumulated data of previous years for different instruments and devices.
The readings of monitoring system should be processed and interpreted without delay. Data and information should be
carefully identified and filed for appraisal and reference during the periodic inspections. Any substantial deviation from
previous observations or the anticipated behavior of the structure shall be brought immediately to the attention of the
inspection team.
An inspection schedule should be established jointly by the operator and the inspection team. This schedule should be
set up in accordance with the convenience and requirements of operation. It would be advantageous to schedule the
principal inspection activities to coincide with major maintenance operations to facilitate the inspection of equipment and
the dewatering of water conduits, pump pits, etc.
A description of the methods and procedures employed for inspection and the findings and resulting recommendations
should be summarized in the inspection report. Detected irregularities should be mapped for future reference and
comparison. If any remedial actions are deemed necessary, they should be proposed by clear recommendations. The
report should be prepared immediately after finishing the inspection and issued without delay.

Annex 14: Principles for Efficient Water Delivery for the Lower Yellow River
ANNEX 14: PRINCIPLES FOR EFFICIENT WATER DELIVERY FOR THE LOWER YELLOW RIVER
Contracts will be signed between YRCC's River Bureau's and the relevant Irrigation districts at each diversion point on
the Lower Yellow River. Contracts will also be signed with all irrigation areas within the dikes.
The contracts will contain the timing and quantity of water to be delivered. It will be the responsibility of YRCC's River
Bureaus to ensure that there is no siltation of the entrances to the diversion points.
Measuring devices with continuous recording instruments will be installed at each diversion point to ensure that water
delivered will be accurately measured.
Communications by computer data connections will transmit the water data diverted each week to YRCC's headquarters
for computation of charges.
Charges will be imposed on all water diverted from the river based on the following principles:
*  All charges will be on a volumetric basis. Municipal and Industrial (M&I) water will be charged much higher rates
from than for irrigation water; and water charges will recover all operation and maintenance costs and capital costs
allocated for irrigation and M&I.
*  Charges will be based on the scarcity of water according to the seasons: dry-season water will be charged much
higher than wet-season water; and discounts will be provided when water has very high silt content/
e  Penalties will be imposed for late payment by irrigation districts.
Cost recovery would cover among others flood and sediment control.
A system of rationing should be agreed between YRCC and Irrigation districts for water delivery during periods of
drought.
A monitoring system will be established to indicate water deliveries and charges collected on a real-time basis to
measure efficiency of delivery.
