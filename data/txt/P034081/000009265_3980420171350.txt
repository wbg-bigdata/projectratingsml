CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1   Purpose of Study and Terms of Reference
In 1992 a full-scale EIA report was prepared for the XLD multipurpose dam project, together
with an Executive Summary (Ref. 101, Annex 1-1). This was approved by the Government and by
the World Bank (WB) and served the EIA needs for XLD Loan Agreement No. 1 between the
Government and WB.
Loan Agreement No. 2 is now being processed, and the WB has scheduled its appraisal
mission for XLD/Loan 2 for March 1997.
The purpose of the present report is to update the 1992 EIA report to meet the EIA needs for
XLD/Loan 2, including (i) review of actual XLD project performance in carrying out the EPMs
(Environmental Protection Measures) specified in EIA/92, including environmental monitoring, with
presentation of evidence to show that adequate attention has been given to each EPM/monitoring, and
(ii) presentation on how this performance will be continued and, based on experience gained in the
Loan 1 phase, how this performance will be strengthened for the Loan 2 phase.
The TOR for the present report is included here as Annex 1-2.
The basic XLD project and the affected environmental study area (ESA) are the same as
described in the 1992 EIA, as shown in Figure 1.1-1. This shows the project location, the affected
river waterways, and resettlement areas.
1.2    Ornanization of Present Revort
The present report's organization uses the pattern and format developed by WB over the past
several years for EIA for major water resources projects in China, as follows:
Chapter 1:   Introduction
Chapter 2:    Project Description
Chapter 3:    Environmental Setting
Chapter 4:    Environmental Assessment
Chapter 5:    Environmental Monitoring
Chapter 6:    Environmental Management
Chapter 7:    Summary and Conclusions
For purpose of comparison the Table of Contents for the 1992 EIA Executive Summary is
included here as Annex 1-3.
Each chapter of the report contains its own detailed Table of Contents including (i) Text, (ii)
Figures (and where needed, Maps), (iii) Tables, (iv) Annexes, and (v) when needed, Supplemental
Annexes. The Annexes are included in the chapter, but all of the Supplemental Annexes, because of
their many pages, are presented in a separate report volume (Volume II).
1.3   Study Anproach and Strategy
The approach and strategy used for the present study is, not to repeat the detailed information
given in the 1992 EIA, but to make use of it for updating purposes, including brief re-discussion of
basic background items but with attention focused on the critical issue of evaluating adequacy of
management of EPMs delineated in the 1992 EIA, plus management of any additional EPMs
discovered by the subsequent experience as also needing attention.
The 1992 EIA included delineation of an Environmental Management Plan, for giving
attention to all of the designated EPMs. It required (i) establishment of an Environmental
Management Office (EMO) to be responsible for carrying out the EMP, and (ii) establishment of an
Expert Panel on Environment and Resettlement with responsibility for meeting every six months for
the purpose of reviewing the project's environmental performance on Environment and on
Resettlement, with a subpanel for each, with reports submitted both to the Government and the WB.
Responsibility for proceeding with construction of the project was assigned to the Yellow River
Water and Hydroelectric Development Corporation (YRWHDC), and for the Environmental and
Resettlement operation to YRWHDC's Resettlement Office (RO). The RO includes a suboffice for
Resettlement and a suboffice for the EMO, called the Environmental Resource Division or ERD, as
1- I



shown in Figure 1.3-1. The RO/ERD commenced operations in April 1994 (prior to that the RPDI
team which prepared the 1992 EIA served as the interim EMO).
The Expert Panel was established in 1994 and made its initial visit (about 2 weeks per visit)
in July 1994. Figure 1.3-2 shows the Panel members and organization. The functioning of the EMO
and Environmental subpanel are dicussed in Chapter 4.
An important aspect of the environmental assessment work done by ERD is to recognize that
this assignment given to the ERD represents a very formidable job, actually pioneering in China for
major water resource development projects, that ERD's staff and ERD's contract consultants helping
on this work have limited previous experience in this type of assignment (hence have been "learners"
to a considerable degree), and that the only Environmental Expert available to assist and train them
has been the Environmental Engineering Member of the Expert Panel. Hence it has not been possible
for the ERD staff/consultants to carry out all the needed work from the outset, rather they have been
developing this expertise as the construction period has proceeded. Moreover, because of the lessons
learned in the 1992-97 period, the ERD staff/consultants are now in a much better position to carry
out the ERD job and to achieve steady improvements over the Loan 2 period.
1.4   EIA Team
The present EIA has been prepared essentially by RDPI, by a team comprising members and
skills as shown in Figure 1.4- 1. In addition considerable assistance was given to the team by several
experts furnished by the WB.
1.5    References Utilized
Annex 1-1 lists the references which were utilized in preparing the present report, including
background references up to 1992, including the 1992 EIA and subsequent pertinent reports and
publications. There include all of the reports made over the past two years by the EMO staff and its
contractors and by the Expert Environmental Subpanel. Also included are some of the reports
prepared recently at Taiyuan on the EIA aspects of the WB's pending major Wanjiazhai Water
Transfer Project, which contain information applicable to the XLD/Loan 2 phase.
1.6    Acknowledgments
While the RPDI team has had basic responsibility for preparing the present EIA, much of the
information utilized was obtained from the cooperation of (i) other components of the overall Yellow
River Conservancy Commission complex, especially the YRWHDC/RO, (ii) the experts furnished by
the World Bank, (iii) the EPBs of Henan and Shanxi provinces, and (iv) the EIA Division of NEPA at
Beijing.

CHAPTER 2
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1    Proiect Concept and Components
The XLD Project's overall plan and its components remain essentially the same as described
in the 1992 EIA (Ref. 101). The overall project includes (i) the dam structures per se, including
power generation facilities, for which construction is underway, (ii) the resettlement component,
which is proceeding to match dam construction progress, (iii) the special environmental protection
components, such as relics protection program, disease control program, etc., and (iv) other project
engineering components such as facilities for community/industrial water supply and irrigation, for
which construction has not yet started.
Section 2.3 gives a brief description of the project's major components, which are essentially
the same as in the 1992 EIA.
2.2    Critical Need for Proiect and Proiect Alternatives
2.2.1   Need for Proiect
While the XP is multipurpose and thus will furnish many urgently needed benefits, its major
urgency is its provisions for flood control to protect some 103 million downstream population and
the associated settlements, industry, and agriculture. This problem is especially serious because of
the very heavy silt load of the river resulting in continuing downstream sedimentation so that the
downstream diking system offers protection only against I in 60 year floods and even this system is
in precarious condition. Thus the XLD Project is designed to protect downstream population
settlements, farms, and infrastructure from the hazards of disastrous floods which have plagued this
region for centuries. In addition it will achieve a major expansion in downstream irrigation, will
produce sufficient electric power and water supply for supporting urbanization/industrialization and
for enhancing estuarine ecology, will contribute significantly to expanding downstream aquaculture,
and will furnish additional selected environmental enhancement measures. In spite of the problem of
resettling approximately 181,050 people, the XLD Project will not result in any significant adverse
environmental effects provided the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) specified in the 1992
EIA and again in the present EIA is implemented as delineated in Chapter 6. The primary
beneficiaries of these improvements will be all of the people in the lower basin and particularly the
predominately rural population.
The Yellow River is the muddiest major river in the world because of the high and
continuing massive erosion of the Loess Plateau upstream of the Project area. While the Yellow
River has only 1/20 of the flow volume of the Yangtze River, it carries about three times as much silt
on an annual basis, about 37 kg/m3. In order to protect the flood plain areas in the lower river reaches
from disastrous floods, the existing dikes and training works along both banks must be maintained
and raised on a regular basis. The dike system is very precarious because the river bed is raised or
"suspended" from 3 to as much as 10 meters above the surrounding urban and agricultural areas. It is
increasingly difficult, dangerous and costly to continue raising the dikes because of foundation and
structural safety problems.
The Xiaolangdi Project is critically needed because, as noted above, the present dyke system
protects the flood plain only against floods of a 60 year magnitude. The XLD Project will offer
virtually complete protection in the downstream reaches against the I in 1,000 year flood,
representing enormous flood control benefits.
2.2.2 Proiect Alternatives
The question of project alternatives is discussed in detail in the 1992 EIA. All project
alternatives, described in Figure 2.2-1, were evaluated in detail and the project as formulated in the
1992 Feasibility Study/EIA was selected as the most feasible. Experience since 1992 confirms this
conclusion.
2.3    Summary Proiect Description
2.3.1  Overview
2 - I



The proposed site of the XLD dam is situated at the outlet of the last valley in the middle
Yellow River, 41 km north of the city of Luoyang, Henan Province. The site is 130 km downstream
from the Sanmenxia Dam, and upstream of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, with the south bank governed
by Mengjin County and the north bank by Jiyuan City. The dam location is ideal to control silt and
water flow from the main portion of the drainage area, and the dam site is the only one possible
downstream of Sanmenxia to offer sufficient reservoir and flood control capacity for meeting the
present needs. Future planning for additional dams on the Yellow River main stem are discussed in
Section 4.2.8.3.
The dam catchment area is 694,155 km2 , or 92.3% of the Yellow River basin. With the
normal pool level set at El 275 m, the reservoir will provide a total storage capacity of 12.65 billion
m3, covering a surface area of 272 km2, and involving 8 counties/cities including Mengjin, Jiyuan,
Xinan, Mianchi, and Shanxian in Henan Province, and Yuanqu, Pinglu, and Xiaxian in Shanxi
Province.
2.3.2  Functions
The XP has a number of objectives, of which the most important is flood control including
ice run prevention and reducing downstream siltation. Important secondary benefits include
improved water supply, irrigation, and power generation. The overall project is an important element
in the overall plan for achieving optimal economic-cum-environmental harnessing and management
of the water resources of the Yellow River.
2.3.3  Proiect Layout
The XP consists of the dam, flood release and silt discharge structures, and water diversion
and electricity generating structures. The dam is a rockfilled structure with inner blanket and inclined
clay core. The maximum dam height is 154 m, with a crest width of 15 m and a crest length of 1,317
m. The dam includes 3 orifice tunnels for energy dissipation, 3 sediment tunnels, and 6 power
tunnels. The hydroelectric plant is underground with an installed capacity of 1,800 MW (6 x 300
MW). A saddle dam with a clay core is placed on the north bank, and an emergency spillway is
located north of this saddle dam.
The XP requires large quantities of materials. A total of 33.49 million m3 earth and rock
excavation, and 42.84 million m3 embankment will be completed during the construction period. The
works to be completed also include 16 tunnels of various types and sizes. The overall construction
stage will last 8 years (1994 - 2001). The annual average number of construction workers will be
approximately 5,480, with a maximum of 8,540. Construction activities will be mainly completed
with mechanical equipment with the help of manual efforts. A total of 2,724 various machines will be
engaged, requiring a total of 311,830 t fuel and 31,200 t explosives. The peak work intensity will take
place in the 4th year of the construction period.
Figure 2.3-1 and 2.3-2 illustrate the project layout and key features.
2.3.4  Access to Site
The dam site enjoys easy access, with a highway on the south bank accessible to Luoyang
and the Long-Hai Railway, and a 13 km road on the north accessible to Liuzhuang Railway Station
on the Jiao-Zhi Railway. The site is relatively close to such industrial centers as Luoyang, Jiaozuo,
and Xinxiang.
2.3.5  Engineering Design Parameters
The main indices and features of XP are presented in Tables 2.3-1 and 2.3-2.
2.3.6  Proiect Economics
Table 2.3-3 summarizes the pertinent data.
2.4   Proiect Progress
Construction of the XP was approved by the 4th session of the 7th National People's
Representative Congress on April 9, 1991. Commencement of the main works was announced by
Premier Li Peng on September 24, 1994, and progress has proceeded on or ahead of schedule. By the
end of 1996, a total of 22.8 million earth and rock excavation works have been completed,
accounting for 90% of the target to be met prior to the River Diversion in October 1997. The focus of
construction has now changed from earth and rock excavation to concrete placement.
2 -2



The Yellow River Contractor, which is responsible for Lot 1 - Main Dam, has successfully
completed the right foundation excavation and treatment, and has started the dam embankment ahead
of schedule. The completed dam embankment totals 7.19 million m3, constituting 60% of the target
for River Diversion. The responsibility for Lot II is with CGIC Joint Venture, which works jointly
with Ist, 3rd, 4th and 14th Construction Bureaus under MWR, which has overcome various
geological, technical, and managerial difficulties, and has completed the excavation and high-slope
rock mass consolidation works involved in the Diversion Tunnels, Intakes, Plunge Pool, and
Powerhouse Tailrace Channel. The contract for Lot III (Power Facilities) has been awarded to the
Xiaolangdi Joint Venture, which has applied a "cross excavation" method to the Powerhouse
construction, thus effectively handling problems of excavation and rock support activities. As a
result, the Powerhouse Crown excavation and rock cable installation have been completed as
scheduled. The upper portions of all the 6 Power Tunnels and the arch of the Main Transformer
Chamber have also been completed. In addition, excavation has been finished for the LCB No. 2, 3,
and 4 Grout Tunnels.
It is now planned to complete River Diversion on October 31, 1997, and the overall project in
2001. Figure 2.4-1 shows the overall construction schedule from 1994 to 2001, including the dam
project per se and the resettlement program.
2.5    Resettlement Component
2.5.1  General Description
At the design normal pool level of 275 m, the reservoir will inundate 8 counties/cities
respectively distributed in Henan (namely Mengjin, Jiyuan, Xinan, Mianchi and Shanxian) and in
Shanxi (including Yuanqu, Pinglu and Xiaxian). The 1994 population census indicates that the total
population to be affected at that time to be 175,591. The reservoir inundation indices also include
7.4317 million m2 housing, 416,800 mu land including 200,700 mu farmland (48.2%) and 32,900
mu forestland (7.9%), 10,224 km roads, 917.3 km high-voltage power lines, 777.6 km
telecommunications lines, and 893.4 km public address lines.
Figures 2.5-1 illustrates the overall resettlement program. This shows that the resettlement
areas have been and will be available in time to match the needs for the various resettlement phases.
2.5.2 Progress of Resettlement Component
2.5.2.1 Phase I (Construction Area Resettlement)
The construction area resettlement, with a total population of 9,730, who originally lived in
Jiyuan, Mengjin, and the suburb and Jili District of Luoyang, was completed at the end of 1994. As
discussed in Chapter 4 and based on the investigation and evaluation carried out by NCWCHPI and
the Rural Investigation Teams of affected counties, both residential and living conditions at the new
sites are significantly improved, with water/power supply, clinic, school, road, and other public
facilities considerably improved as compared with the resettlers' previous situations.
2.5.2.2 Phase II
Phase II resettlement from the reservoir area involves 27 administrative villages governed by
7 xiangs (townships) in Mengjin, Jiyuan, and Xinan. The total affected population is 46,000, with a
total of 1.6170 million m2 housing and 119,000 mu land inundated. The resettlement planning was
completed in October 1994 and approved by the central government at the end of 1995. Up to the end
of 1996, the 16,580 resettlers form 4,478 families have all been moved to agricultural areas where the
new sites have easy access, fertile land, and abundant water resources, with more than 0.8 mu
irrigated land available for each of the resettlers. Both projection and livelihood are significantly
improved. All components of Phase II resettlement are scheduled to be completed by the end of June
1997.
2.5.2.3 Phase III
Phase III will involve a total population of 118,985, with 83,066 resettlers from Henan
Province and 6,682 resettlers from Shanxi Province. From the end of 1996, the resettlement had been
started. The detailed implementation plan for this phase is to be completed by the end of June 1997
and the implementation for Phase III is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1999.
2.5.2.4 Phase IV
2 - 3



In accordance with the requirement of State Planning Commission, the detailed
implementation plan for this phase should be completed by the end of June 1997 and the resettlement
from the reservoir should be completed by the end of 2003.
2.6    Environmental Protection Components
The overall XP includes, in addition to the project's engineering components and
resettlement component, a number of environmental protection components, including the
archeological relics protection program, communicable disease control program, and others.
2.6.1  Relics Protection Program
The middle reaches area of the Yellow River basin is known as the "cradle" of the Chinese
nation. There are many cultural/historical relics scattered over the region. In accordance with the
results from the investigations carried out by Henan/Shanxi Provincial Archeological Institutes
(HSAls), there are altogether 109 sites, 29 above the ground and the rest underground, below El. 275
in the area around the damsite and reservoir area.
For the purpose of cultural relics protection and salvation, a detailed drilling, evaluation, and
excavation plan has been developed and included in the overall plan of XP. The plan is delineated in
Section 4.2.4. By the end of December 1996, excavations and salvation had been carried out in a total
surface area of 7,300 m2, including 160 ancient tombs, I jar coffin, and 40 ash pits. Archeological
works completed in the reservoir area, as described in Section 4.2.4, include field surveys of ancient
roads and canals built during the period from Han to Tang Dynasties, investigation of ancient
structures in 4 villages, preparation of 156 drawings, and 500 pictures.
2.6.2  Disease Control and Other Protection Measures
2.6.2.1 Communicable Disease Control
Communicable diseases in the reservoir area and the lower reaches of the river include
malaria, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, enteric diseases, and others as discussed in Chapter 3. As
the building of the dam reservoir will change the hydrological condition in these regions, EIA/1992
included detailed assessment and proposed disease control measures. The magnitude and other
relevant parameters of such impacts are under continuing monitoring so that necessary corrective
measures can be taken to avoid any increase of incidence of these diseases because of the project.
Information on the pertinent diseases is given in Chapters 3 and 4.
2.6.2.2 Earthauake Hazards
Considering the seriousness of dam failure subsequent to seismic event, provision for dam
stability against earthquakes has been a major aspect of the project design. The proposed dam will be
able to withstand the expected maximum earthquake in the dam site area, For facilitating seismicity
prediction, a seismic network has been established, comprising of seismoscopic stations, I repeater
center, and I data processing center located in Mengjin, Xinan, Jiyuan, and Luoyang. The location of
the seismoscopic stations is shown on Figure 2.6-1. The service area of the network covers some
1,400 km2, ranging 40 km upstream to 8 km downstream of the dam site. Within this area, any
significant earthquake can be reported and the epicenter positioning accuracy can be controlled at 0.5
km. The network had been completed and put into operation from November 1, 1995. The
performance of the network over the past years shows that the design is rational, and that operation of
the network is reliable and is meeting the requirements for providing seismic protection and warning
for XP.
2.6.3  Environmental Management Plan and Office
An environmental management and implementation plan is the basis for the success of
environmental protection. The XP environmental management plan, carried out by EMO, includes
provisions for carrying out all EPMs specified in the EIA, including environmental monitoring and
reporting, and provisions for training of staff engaged in EMP operation. To ensure good
performance by the EMO, the plan includes institutional and administrative arrangements needed for
facilitating EMO performance.
2.7    Other Proiect Engineering Components
Besides the main purpose of XLD project, namely flood control, the project is also aimed to
benefit the surrounding region and the lower reaches in the respects described below.
2-4



2.7.1  Irrigation
The XLD project is planned to support the expansion of the irrigation area by 350,000 mu, in
the region surrounding the reservoir, and 30 million mu in the lower reaches.
2.7.2  Water Supply
Industrial and municipal water supply in the lower reaches will be improved year by year
when the project is put into operation. This will be possible because XP will permit much more
effective control of the river flow.
2.7.3  Power Production and Distribution
The project includes a power station, with total installed capacity of 1,800 MW, which will
supply annually 5.4 GWiH of hydropower to the Central China Power Grid. Such power generation
will greatly promote economic and local socio-economic development.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY AREA
3.1    Overall Environmental Study Area
The overall Environmental Study Area (ESA) which is subject to significant impacts from the
Xiaolangdi Project extends for approximately 1,000 km along the Yellow River, from the Sanmenxia
Darn to the estuary and delta at Bohai Bay. The ESA is described in detail in the ESA/1992 report, and
this information is briefly summarized here. The overall ESA is geographically divided into four areas
for EIA study purposes: (i) the reservoir area and surrounding region above the Xiaolangdi Dam up to
Sanmenxia Dam, (ii) the dam vicinity, (iii) the lower river reaches, and (iv) the estuary, delta, and
nearshore marine regions. The overall ESA is shown in Figure 1.1-1 of Chapter 1 and in Figure 3.1-1.
Subareas are shown in Figures 3.1-2, 3, and 4.
3.2    Reservoir and Vicinity (Figure 3.1-2)
3.2.1   Geoaraohv and Land Use
The reservoir and surrounding area cover approximately 130 km of the river valley and adjacent
hills and mountains, from the Sarumenxia Dam to the Xiaolangdi dam site (Figure 3.1-2). The main
stream of the river through this stretch follows a narrow, deeply incised valley, with little flood plain
development. Some flood plains are located at the mouths of several of the 11 tributaries that enter this
section of the river.
Land uses in the ESA are shown in Figure 3.2.1 - 1.
3.2.2  Climate
The climate is that of a warm temperate zone and continental location, with cold and dry
winters and warm and wet summers. Average annual temperature is 10 - 15C, depending on the local
geography. More than half of the 600 mm annual precipitation falls in mid and late summer, and severe
storms are common. The highest recorded rainfall was 600 mm on July 16, 1958. Flooding from runoff
in the rainy season is a major concern. The measured annual evaporation rate is twice the average
annual rainfall, so that the area is also very susceptible to droughts. In one reservoir-area, Jiyuan City,
there have been droughts in 21 years over a recent 22 year period.
3.2.3   Air Ouality
Air quality in the reservoir and surrounding area is generally within the applicable Chinese
standards. Suspended particles can be somewhat high due largely to dust blown in from the Loess
Plateau and to dust generated locally from agricultural operations. This is particularly evident in the dry
season.
3.2.4   Hydrolojz
Given the importance of flow dynamics in the Yellow River to the economy and hulmlaln
security in the lower Yellow River basin, extensive monitoring and analysis of surface water hydrology
in the main strearn and tributaries has been performed, resulting in observed and synthetic data covering
a complete time series for over 70 years.
With a total catchment of over 750,000 km2, the Yellow River discharge is approximately 43.2
billion m3, with 1.6 billion tons of silt in an average year (1919 - 1960 series). Over 60% of runoff and
80% of sediment occur in the rainy season. The runoff entering into the lower reaches is 45.59 billion
m3/year and silt is 1.5 billion t/year. The runoff and silt at Lijin hydrology station are 38.78 billion m3
and 0.987 billion t/year, respectively. The overall situation on surface water hydrology is discussed in
Chapter 4 Section 4.2.8.1. Information on low and zero flows in the lower river reaches is river here in
Table 3.2.4- 1.
The catchment of the river above the upstream end of the proposed reservoir is approximately
688,000 km2, or 91.5% of the total Yellow River watershed. At this point, the river still has over 1,000
km to travel to the sea. The river and tributaries in the reservoir area contribute some 5,800 m3 of
catchment with a mean annual runoff of 0.56 billion m3. The ratio of peak to minimum river flow over
the year is approximately 3.2. Extended periods have occurred when the annual river flow has been
approximately 20 - 25% higher or lower than the norrn.
3 - I



Flooding is related primarily to rainstorms. Sediment load is highest in flood season and has
been increasing with average height of 45 kg/m3. Its long-term average is 45 kg/m3. The maximum
sediment content recorded was 941 kg/m3 (flood peak amount 9,870 m3/s, Xiaolangdi hydrology
station, August 7, 1977). The dynamics of erosion and sedimentation in the entire Yellow River
watershed have been studied carefully, and are detailed in the EIAJ1992 report.
3.2.5   Geologv. Topographv. and Earthquake Hazard
3.2.5.1 General Geologv and To2ograohv
The reservoir and its surrounding area are bounded by mountainous regions to the north, west
and south, which change gradually to hills to the broad flood plain of the lower Yellow River to the east.
The east-west axis of the Kuangkou anticline passes through the damsite. The northern dam abutrnent
and hydraulic structures will be located on the northem flank of the anticline, while the southern
abutment will be on the anticline's south flank. Less than 5% of the reservoir and surrounding area is
relatively flat, and only 14% has a gradient between 3 - 15. Almost half of the area has a gradient over
250, as shown in Table 3.2.5-1. Figure 3.2.6-1 shows geological features in the reservoir region.
3.2.5.2 Earthauake Hazard
In the Cenozoic era a number of major and minor faults occurred in the project area. Seismic
zones have been identified for the area and earthquakes of magnitude 5 have occurred in the reservoir
area. The damsite area has a seismic intensity level of class 7. The location of earthquake observation in
the reservoir region is shown Figure 2.6-1 of Chapter 2.
3.2.6  Soils and Soil Stability
Loess with a relatively high clay content makes up the majority of the soils found below 1,000
m elevation. These very important agricultural soils are commonly slightly alkaline with only 0.5 - 1%
organic matter. Study of surface geology has enabled potential bank collapse and landslide areas to be
identified, as shown in Figure 3.2.6-1. The most serious of these are located between Hedi and
Lingshang villages near the Banjian river.
3.2.7   Water Ouality
3.2.7.1 Groundwater
The shallow and artesian groundwater in the reservoir area and surrounding area is recharged
by rainfall, and is generally suitable for drinking. The groundwater resources are illustrated in the
hydrogeology date shown in Figure 3.2.7-1.
3.2.7.2 Surface Water
Surface mineral water quality of the Yellow River and its tributaries is generally very good,
even though it has an exceptionally high silt load, and it generally meets the first grade of China's water
use standard at most locations in the ESA. Specifics are given in Section 4.2.7.3 of Chapter 4. Local
pollution is mainly from mining enterprises, with minor contributions from agricultural runoff and
domestic sewage. These result in some localized areas of high BOD, COD, phenols and zinc, mostly
near the tributaries.
3.2.8   Vegetation and Asriculture
The Xiaolangdi area is near the southern edge of the warm temperate zone. This, in
combination with the area's variable geography, results in terrestrial plant communities which can be
relatively complex and diverse. In the reservoir area itself (Figure 3.2.8-1), however, there has been a
long history of settlement and cultivation, and the natural vegetation and diversity have been greatly
diminished.
Crops in the ESA are predominantly wheat, corn, cotton, and oil crops.
3.2.9  Natural Ecological Resources
3.2.9.1 Terrestrial Forests and Wildlife
The situation on terrestrial forests and wildlife is shown in Figure 3.2-5, including location of
protected habitats, and of wild animals, represented in the reservoir area by mostly northern species, are
very low throughout the region (Figure 3.2.9-1). Waterfowl are diverse, but populations are low.
Vegetation and fauna have been studied for the EIA with particular attention to rare and commercial
species. This information is summarized in Table 3.2.9-1.
3.2.9.2 Aquatic Wildlife
3 -2



Due to the exceptional silt content, aquatic communities are marginal in the Yellow River main
stem, hence there are no significant fisheries.
Significant fishery habitat is predominantly located in the tributaries, with some corresponding
contamination of fish from the industrial pollution sources located there. The information on natural
fisheries is summarized in Figure 3.2.9-2 and Table 3.2.9-2.
3.2.10 Mineral Resources
The mineral resources of the region are significant and include valuable reserves of coal,
bauxite, copper, iron and building materials. The reserves most affected by the reservoir will be coal,
bauxite and sulfur-iron. It may be possible to recover the coal, since it is covered by a thick
impermeable layer of shale, and could be mined beneath the reservoir. This information is summarized
in Figure 3.2.10-1.
3.2.11 Demoaraphv and Socio-Economies
The population of the reservoir and surrounding area is about 2.4 million people, approximately
181,050 of which live in the area to be flooded. Agricultural families comprise 90% of the population of
the study area, and over 92% in the area to be flooded. The flat valley lands and hills up to 200 m
elevation are almost entirely devoted to agriculture, the main agricultural types being cereal crops and
cotton. Despite the importance of agricultural enterprises to the regional economy, overall productivity
is not high, and annual per capita agricultural income in the region is 346 yuan.
The total area to be submerged is approximately 272 km2, of which 44% is cultivated. This
represents just over 4% of the cultivated land of the overall study area, but includes the most fertile and
productive areas. With the proposed maximum water level at 275 m elevation, the Xiaolangdi Reservoir
will flood 179 villages, 11 government towns, 93 industrial and mining enterprises, 250 commercial
enterprises and other institutions, 12 power stations, 267 irrigation pumps, 658 km of irrigation canals,
688 km of roads, and 548 km of communication lines.
3.2.12 Public Health
Because of the need to relocate a significant number of people affected by inundation, a careful
study was done of the public health dynamics within the reservoir and study areas. The main public
health problems identified include malaria, diseases related to agricultural practices (such as
Brucellosis), encephalitis B, diseases carried by rats, waterborne diseases, and endemic fluorosis caused
by cooking with the high-fluoride local coal. This picture is summarized in Figure 3.2.12- 1.
3.2.13 Archeological Relics
In view of the importance of the Yellow River basin in the development of Chinese civilization,
a detailed archaeological survey has been completed as described in Section 4.2.4. While none of these
are classified as protected by either the State or the Provinces, many of them are regarded as precious
resources for research on architectural and art history. There are also many important cultural resources
in the area surrounding the reservoir. The picture is summarized in Figure 3.2.13- 1.
3.3    Dam Vicinity
3.3.1  Construction Zone
The construction zone (see Figure 2.3-2 of Chapter 2) covers a surface area approximately 23.7
km2, 18 km in length, extending from Chihetan in the west and reaching Liuzhuang Railway Transfer
Platform, and 8 km in width starting from Dongguanzhuang in the south and ending at the foot of
Wangling mountain in the north. It involves 29 villages distributed in 7 townships governed by Mengjin
County, Luoyang outskirts, Jili District and Jiyuan.
3.3.2   Construction Zone Uses by Topography
In order to match construction according to the project's major features. The main works are
divided into 3 lots: Lot I--Main Dam; Lot II--Intakes, Tunnels and Spillway; Lot III--Power Facilities,
with a separate international contractor responsible for each lot.
In view of the local topography, the construction area is subdivided into the following areas:
(a) Liaowu Area: This area includes floodland and mountain regions. The 35 km2 floodlands
are used as work areas for Lot II and Lot III. Lot II is located in the west portion, covering
about 100,000 m2, and Lot III is arranged in the east portion, covering approximately 160,000
3 -3



m2. The mountain region is occupied by Lot H and Lot III local labor camps which are
separated by a road.
(b) Qiaogou Floodland Area: This part of floodland is divided into left and right regions, with
the right region further subdivided into upper, middle and lower parts. The upper part is used
for expatriate camps and office areas of Lots I, II, and III, while and middle and lower parts are
respectively occupied by YRWHDC Hospital and Lot III spoil areas. In the left region, the
upper part is covered by YRWHDC living quarters and office facilities. The lower part is used
for YRWHDC's parking area and multipurpose service building.
(c) Xiaondnzhuang-Tongshuling Area: This area is used for Lot II local labor camp.
(d) Xiaolangdi Area: Covering a total land area of 230,000 m2, this area includes a concrete
batching plant, a complex processing plant, and some associated facilities.
(e) Siyuanpo Area: This area includes mainly borrow areas and quarries.
(f) Other Areas: These include Huaishuzhuang floodland spoil area, Liandi aggregate
processing plant, and Liuzhuang Railway Transfer Platform.
3.3.3  Transportation
The construction area has convenient transportation conditions. On the south bank are 1#
Access Road, and 2#-5# Access Roads for use of Lot I Contractor. On the north bank are 6#-9# Roads
on Site mainly for use of Lot II and Lot III Contractors. All the Roads on Site have macadam pavement.
These roads are regularly watered to avoid fugitive dust. Also, macadam is spread on a regular basis for
the purpose of road maintenance.
3.3.4  Other Conditions
The meteorology, hydrology, flora, fauna and other physical and social environmental
components are the same as those in the reservoir area and surrounding region.
3.4    Downstream Riverine Area (Figure 3.1-3)
3.4.1  Generl Situation
The area downstream of Xiaolangdi (Figure 3.1-3) includes irrigated areas within and adjacent
to the Yellow River stretching approximately 870 km from the proposed darn to the estuary. Between
Xiaolangdi and the start of the dikes, over some 70 km, the river is broad and flows past Mangshen
mountain to the south. At this point, there are approximately 330 km2 of flood plain to the north. For the
remaining 800 km to the estuary, the river is "suspended" in a raised bed about 3 meters above ground
level, with dikes on both sides except for about 100 km at and downstream of the mouth of the tributary
Dawen River, where there is no dike on the southern bank (roughly 390-290 km from the estuary).
In the reach 128 km from Xiaolangdi downsnteam to the Huayuankou monitoring station, the
Yellow River receives two major tributary systems, the Yiluo and the Qinhe, which together contribute
approximately 36,000 km2 of catchment The quality of the water in these systems is relatively polluted
as indicated by the presence of significant levels of COD and phenols. Water quality in the main river is
thus degraded to the second grade of the Chinese standard, until natural purification restores a first
grade quality at Gaocun station, 579 km from the estuary. Water quality remains good for the rest of the
main stream. Downstream of Huayuankou there is relatively little further addition of catchmnent area
until the final 20,000 km2 is contributed by the Dawen River and the Beijindi detention basin, about 395
km from the estuary. Outside the catchment areas related to tributaries, there is very little runoff, and
essentially no urban waste discharges enter the Yellow River downstream of Zhengzhou due to the
dikes.
The downstream area has a similar general climate to that of the reservoir area, except that it
becomes both warmer (average temperature ranging from 120 - 29C) and wetter (precipitation up to
700 mm/yr from west to east). Precipitation is seasonal, and hence there is the same seasonallity in flow
pattems in the downstream tributaries.
Most of the downstream riverine area falls within the arid and semi-arid zone. The long-term
annual precipitation is 450 mm, only 44% of that in the Yangtze River basin. Moreover, the
precipitation here is unevenly distributed in time and space, which results in the innate water
inadequacy of the Yellow River. On the other hand, more and more water is consumed by the people
living on both banks as a result of social progress, thus significantly reducing the downstream runoff.
3 -4



Natural hazards plus human activities have resulted in frequent zero flow events in the lower river
reaches since 1972, and more importantly the frequency, duration and length of zero flow events have
been continuously increased. At Lijin Hydrometric Station in Shandong Province, for instance, such
events occurred in 18 of the 24-year period starting 1972 and ending 1995, i.e. 3 in each 4 years. In this
period, a total of 49 zero flow events occurred with a total duration of 546 days. Details are described in
Table 3.4.1-1.
Groundwater throughout the downstream area is generally abundant and of good quality.
Figure 3.4.1-1 shows main infrastructure and mineral resources in the downstream region.
The situation on public health/diseases in the downstream area is shown in Figure 3.2.12- 1.
3.4.2  Siltation
Over millennia, the huge quantities of sediment carried and deposited by the Yellow River have
created the Great Northern China Plains, also known as the Hung-Huai-Hai Plains. The course of the
river has changed some 26 times in recorded history (2,500 yrs), sometimes quite drastically. The
present course downstream of Jiahetan was established in 1855, following a major breaching of a dike.
The valley area is broad and relatively flat, though it is constrained to the south in the area of the Tai
Mountains, the source of the Dawen River. The high silt-laden water of the Yellow River has
continuously raised the downstream river bed, thus obstacling flood discharge.
Sedimentation and scouring in the Yellow River have recently undergone some major changes.
Prior to 1950, breaches in the dikes were common resulting in frequent sedimentation outside the dikes.
Since 1950, such events have become less common, and the silt load is now maintained between the
dikes. The Sanmenxia Dam, which began to fill in 1960, has altered sedimentation dynamics
considerably; it has enabled some control to be exerted over deposition and scouring both in the
reservoir and in the downstream reaches. The effects of different operating regimes of the Sanmenxia
Dam have been studied, its basic operating principles have been evaluated, and several successful
alterations made to the damn enable better sediment control.
3.4.3   Natural Ecologv
3.4.3.1 General
The overall flood protection region downstream of Xiaolangdi supports approximately 70
million people. Agriculture is intensive, and the area is the main cotton and wheat production region in
China. Gross agricultural output is valued at 29 billion yuan annually. Industry has been developing
rapidly in the area. Whereas agriculture formerly represented 70% of the region's contribution to the
national economy, industry now contributes 60%. The abundant coal, oil and natural gas reserves in this
region are significant for economic development and urban growth.
3.4.3.2 Wetlands and Forests (Figure 3.2.9-1)
Many wetlands exist in the flood areas between the dikes and are important for aquatic animals
and waterfowl. The wetland in the old course of the river 100 km to the north in Henan Province has
been made into a nature preserve. Such areas support large and diverse bird populations and are
important for migration.
The downstream area has been heavily populated and cultivated for many centuries, and the
natural environment has therefore been replaced by intensive agriculture throughout. There are a few
remaining natural forested areas, especially in the hilly and mountainous Dawen and Taishan areas to
the south. Wildlife animal communities are somewhat more complex than in the Xiaolangdi area,
though northern species still dominate. In the cultivated areas, agricultural pest species such as mice,
rats, and pigeons are prolific.
3.4.3.3 Taishan Mountain
Taishan Mountain in Shandong Province, has been designated a world heritage site by
UNESCO.
3.4.3.4 Fisheries
Because of the river's high silt content there are no significant fisheries in the downstream river
reaches.
3.4.3.5 Rare and Endangered Species
3-5



In the natural reserve, announced by the government in 1995, in the downstreamn areas, there
live such protective animals as waterfowl, Grus japonensis , gray crane, white stork, giant swan, golden
eagle, giant bustard, Accipitridae, tattle, wild goose, gull, and mandarin duck. The protective plants
include wild bean, natural Robinia pseudoacacia forests, natural willow forests, natural reed marshes,
and seepweed. The distribution of some rare and endangered species is shown on Figure 3.2.9-1.
3.5    Estuary, Delta, and Nearshore Marine Areas (Figure 3.1-4)
3.5.1   General Conditions
The estuary and delta comprise approximately 6,000 km2 of flat, lowlying land (Figure 3.1-4).
They have increased by some 2,200 km2 since the Yellow River began discharging here in 1855. Over
700 km2 were added between 1954 and 1984; and over the last 40 years, some 25 - 30 km2/yr have
been added.
Average annual outflow at Lijin hydrology station is approximately 38.78 billion m31yr and
average discharge of silt is 987 million tons/yr, representing 87% and 75.4% of the inflow, respectively.
Siltation of the river channel in the lower reaches is govemed mainly by upstream runoff and sediment
load. Influence on siltation in the river exerted by the extension of the delta has not been significant in
the last 40 years. Water level for equivalent runoff (3,000 m3/s) at the Lijin station (at the head of the
estuary) has risen 1.55 m between 1950 and 1989, which is less than farther upstream.
The climate of the delta is partly moderated by the sea with a 12C average temperature. Winds
are high and storms serious. The area experiences the same cyclic precipitation and runoff patterns as
upstream areas. The low flow period is more frequently exacerbated by increasing water use, with
periods of zero flow being recorded. Such periods adversely affect the estuarine fishery and water use in
the delta, for example for domestic consumption, aquaculture, irrigation, and industrial uses such as
power plants and oil fields in the delta.
Except for the silt content, the water quality is fairly good due to the relatively small amounts of
contamination, and the long run of the lower reaches, which promotes effective natural purification.
The major economic activity in the delta is provided by the Victory Oil Field, which is the
second largest in China, and is undergoing continuing development.
3.5.2 Natural Ecologv
3.5.2.1 Vegetation
Vegetation is typical of the deltaic areas with meadows, marsh plants and hydrophytes
predominating, including halophytic salt tolerant species in coastal and low lying locations. There are
some small wooded areas and cultivated lands along the coast. Even with the relatively small tidal range
(I - 2 m), there are extensive salt marshes and intertidal areas.
3.5.2.2 Aquatic Production
The aquatic production at the estuary and in adjacent sea area is relatively high. Both plankton
and benthos are diverse and abundant in these areas. The estuary is an important spawning and nursery
area for both river and oceanic species of fish, crustaceans and shellfish, which are a valuable and
renewable economic resource.
3.5.2.3 Wetlands
Many wetlands are situated in the coastal depressions where there is abundant natural
precipitation and groundwater. They are noted for aquatic migrants and waterfowl, and some have been
made into natural reserves such as the Wuli, Shouguang, and Weifang natural reserves. Such areas are
important for migrating birds, and a number of species including herons, egrets, swans, geese and
ducks, which winter there in large numbers.

CHAPTER 4
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.1    Assessment Methodology
4.1.1  Approach and Strategy
The EIA/1991 report delineated the SEIs and prioritized these according to the inforrnation
available at that time. The ERD, established as the EMO suboffice of YRWHDCRO in 1994, has
over the past two years been busy in getting itself established and getting into operation for carrying
out its job of ensuring that the EPMs specified in EIA/1992, including environmental monitoring, are
actually being carried out in the continuing steps of implementation of the project's components.
These steps comprise (i) final design (detailed plans and specifications and contract documents), (ii)
construction, and (iii) O&M following completion of construction. Thus far Steps (i) and (ii) are
applicable to all project components, but Step (iii) applies only to those RS villages which have been
actually occupied and lived in for a sufficient period to check on environmental adequacy of the
homes and community facilities.
The approach used here is illustrated by Figure 4.1.1-1 which lists each of the SEIs identified
in EIA/92 with prioritization, which shows the status of progress in implementing each of these with
identification of which of the Steps (i), (ii), (iii) above have been subject to evaluation since
establishment of EMO, plus a relisting of these issues/priorities as now seen in 1997. Then each of
these SEls is discussed as a separate section of this chapter, to evaluate the adequacy both of the
work of the EMO and of the actual management of the SEI, and to indicate improvements needed in
performance of the EMO and of the other organizations involved to achieve the needed level of
performance for the XLD/Loan 2 period.
4.1.2  Data Utilized in Evaluation
The data utilized for making the evaluations noted above are shown in Annex 1-1,
References. Of primary use are the periodic reports prepared by EMO staff and subcontractors
(Reference 203) and the periodic reports prepared by Environmental Engineer member of the Expert
Panel (H. Ludwig) (Reference 201), plus various related special reports as listed in the "200 Series"
of references. The EMO reports reflect the EMO's accounts on progress in its work of implementing
the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) stipulated in EIA/92 (and included in the XLD/Loan I
Agreement). The reports of the EEMEP contain periodic evaluations of the performance of EMO
staff/subcontractors and of the adequacy of implementative of the EMP.
Included here as Annex 4.1.2-1 is information taken from the latest report of the Panel's
Environmental Engineer of October 1996, including its Table of Contents and its Chapter
I/Introduction and Chapter 6/Summary and Conclusions. These illustrate the scope of activities
discussed above.
4.1.3  Progressive Development of EMO
Figure 4.1.3-1 shows the institutional set up for YRWHDCRO with its two suboffices, one
the EMO (termed the ERD) and the other the RS operations. Figure 4.1.3-2 gives details on ERD and
its staff and subcontractors as of Feb. 1997.
It is important to note here that the RO "started from scratch" in 1994, and over the period
since then has steadily and progressively built up its ERD staffing and operating mechanics including
use of the several subcontractors, beginning with ERD staff with limited experience in how to plan
and carry out EMO operations. One of the salient roles of the Panel's EEMEP has been, not only to
make the evaluations noted above, but to carry out continuing training/technology transfer for the
ETD staff, and details of this work are given in the References 201 reports. In theory the RO/ERD
should of course be carrying out its EMO functions beginning at time of its establishment in 1994,
but because the EMO job is of large magnitude both in scope and complexity, and is pioneering for a
major dam/reservoir project in China, the procedure has been one of learning-how-to-do-on-the-job
with periodic training inputs from the EEMEP and other members of the Expert Environmental
Subpanel during the meetings of about two weeks held every six months. This has been a difficult
process, and if more training expertise had been furnished (as is now being proposed for the EMO to
4 - I



be established for the pending major Wanjiazhai project), the progress of development of ERD would
of course have been expedited. Considering all of the difficulties and limitations involved, the ERD
has been making meaningful progress and, as will be noted in the detailed discussions of SEIs below,
the ERD is learning how to do its job, but of course more and more is to be learned in the years
ahead. The conclusion here is that consideration should be given to provision of some continuing
training expertise as part of the Loan 2 provisions, following the pattern proposed for the pending
Wanjiazhai Project (Reference 303). This would include training in all steps (i) (ii) (iii) noted in
Section 4.1.1 above. A copy of this proposed Wanjiazhai training is included here as Annex 4.1.3-2.
To sum up, much has been expected of the ERD staff and the staff has worked hard to
endeavor to comply with the Panel's Environmental Engineer's recommendations, but because of
their limited experience, the surveillance program exercised by EMO needed for implementing the
ENT has been only partial, but nevertheless meaningful. As indicated in Reference 201.5 on the
Enviromnental Subpanel's visit of October 1996, the ERD is just about now beginning to round into
shape and this can be regarded as a meaningful accomplishment.
4.2    Assessment of Individual SEIs
4.2.1  Introduction
Figure 4.1.1-1 compares the SEIs for EIA as perceived in ELA192 with EIA/97. This shows
essentially no change in SEI delineation/prioritization except for the addition of the issue of Risk
Management. The order of discussion in the preset report is as shown in the final column of the
figure.
4.2.2  Environmental Mana;erent of Dam Construction
4.2.2.1 Introduction
This is the 'No. I SEr' for XLD for the construction period, to ensure that the activities of
the Construction Contractors (CCs) do include provision of all EPMs specified in EIA/92. Pursuant
to the EIA, the contract documents include EPMs as specified in the EIA as shown in Supplemental
Annex 4.2.2-1. This has been the primary focus of effort by the ERD since its establishment in 1994,
with the actual work carried out by RPDI as subcontractor. This has also been the primary focus of
effort of the EEMEP in the five Panel visits since July 1994. The RPDI work has been carried out at
the CC sites (Lots I, II, III) by an RPDI team headed by Mme. Xie Xinfang.
4.2.2.2 Applicable Parameters and Performance
Based on all of the pertinent reports (References 200 Series) Figure 4.2.2 -1 has been
prepared to summarize the appropriate SEIs for the construction operations with information on
adequacy of attention by the RPDI team and by the CCs. Examination of this information indicates
the following:
(a) The primary problem which has limited performance by the EMO field staff to date has
been the fact that these staff are in process of developing the capabilities needed for their work,
which is technically complicated and institutionally difficult. This limited the work of the staff
including their reporting, and this in turn has limited their ability to keep EMO/HQ duly informed
and to exercise proper control over the CC, that is, monitoring of the CC operations have been only
partial. However, the staff capabilities have been steadily improving with experience and training
being obtained.
(b) Because of (a), and of limited capabilities of EMOIHQ staff (also in process of training),
plus institutional problems in having to function in an organization with primary focus on
resettlement, the EMO/HQ office has been only partially effective in terrns of (b. 1) obtaining a
definitive picture of CC inadequacies and (b.2) follow-up measures for requiring better performance
by CCs.
(c) The CC staffs have or can furnish all the needed technical capabilities to do their job but,
like most humans, they tend not to do as much as they should when surveillance of their
performance and follow-up pressures from EMO/HQ are lacking. For this reason CC performance
has not been generally sufficient (c. 1) in treatment and disposal of sanitary and industrial wastewater,
especially in terms of their own monitoring related to environmental protection from discharge of
4-2



wastewater effluent, (c.2) in dust control, and (c.3) erosion silt runoff and resurfacing of disturbed
areas.
(d) The principal conclusion of the EEMEP is that the CCs should themselves contribute
much more to assisting EMO in achieving better control by requiring the CCs themselves to submit
monthly reports covering all aspects of their environmental performance, and this program was
recommended by the EEMEP in Oct., 96 and initiated partially by the CCs for the month of January
1997 following the EEMEP's detailed guidelines shown in Supplemental Annex 4.2.2-2. Such
monthly reports include detailed attention to all significant parameters (including water supply,
wastewater management, solid waste management, air pollution and dust management, drainage,
toilet and other sanitation facilities in the residential and working areas, mosquito vector control, rat
control, medical examinations, occupational health, emergency management plans, etc.) plus
attention to (i) any environmental problems experienced during the month and how these were
resolved, and (ii) any notices from EMO received during the month and how these were acted upon.
The system recommended above should be implemented in full as part of the Loan 2
Agreement. This is the system commonly utilized in the USA and other ICs for such monitoring. The
project does the bulk of the monitoring and the role of the government environmental regulators is to
"monitor the monitoring".
Supplemental Annexes 4.2.2-7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 are the reports produced by the three lots for
the month of January. This is the beginning effort. Full-scale reports from all three CCs should
commence with the reports for February. Each of the CCs should appoint an Environmental Officer
to have responsibility for the monthly reporting. This should not be expected of the Safety Officer
because the Environmental and Safety work represent two different fields of expertise.
4.2.2.3 Role of EMO versus XECC Safety Department
Major improvement is needed in how EMO instructions (notices) are given to the CCs. Up to
now, EMO prepares notices (including those prepared for EMO by EEMEP in October 1996 for
starting off the monthly reporting program) and sends these to the XECC Safety Department for
transmittal to the CCs. But it seems that, instead of doing such transmitting, the Safety Department
has assumed the authority to rewrite and sign the notices and has thus watered them down from
precise instructions to virtually meaningless generalities. This in effect makes the Safety Department
responsible for environmental monitoring, but the Safety Department does not have the expertise
needed for this. Responsibility is and should remain with EMO. The Loan 2 Agreement must make it
clear that the role of the Safety Department is simply as a transmission channel, or let EMO
communicate directly with the CCs. The present situation is most unsatisfactory and serves to negate
much of the efforts of EMO/EEMEP.
4.2.2.4 Laws and Regulations
A "Environmental Management Handbook for XLD Construction" was prepared in English
and in Chinese in Feb. 1995 by EMO/RPDI to be distributed for guiding the activities of the CCs and
others concerned with XLD construction. This is included here as Supplemental Annex 4.2.2.4-1,
which includes detailed discussion of all laws and regulations applicable to the construction
operations. This was updated in Dec. 95 (Supplemental Annex 4.2.2.4-2).
Additional information on these same subjects are given in Supplemental Annexes 4.2.2-1, 2,
and 3 respectively on "Environmental Requirements in Construction Contracts", "Guidelines for
Monthly Environmental Reporting by CCs", and "Applicable Laws and Regulations on Environment
for CCs".
4.2.2.5 Occupational Health and Safetv
(a) Introduction
The environmental monitoring program for dam construction includes the necessary
parameters for occupational health including medical examinations, provision of adequate and safe
water supply, work arrangement facilities, insect and rat control, and others as discussed in Section
4.2.2.2. Occupational safety measures are discussed below.
(b) Monthly Reoorting
4-3



The CCs have routinely submitted monthly detailed reports on Occupational Safety, and a
typical example, submitted by the CGIC Construction Contractor for the month of December 1996, is
included here as Supplemental Annex 4.2.2-5.
It is noted that the monthly safety reports include some attention to environmental matters,
particularly pollution control, but this is not at all adequate for meeting ERD needs.
(c) Special Meeting of January 1997
On 13 Jan. 1997 the XECC held a special meeting with representatives of the Safety
Departments of the three CCs to review safety performance at XLD over the past two years, in order
to improve safety performance. The results of this meeting, expressed in a series of four guidelines,
are included here as Supplemental Annex 4.2.2-6. A typical monthly safety report is given in
Supplemental Annex 4.2.24.
The needs for improvement are very briefly summarized as follows:
(c. 1) Safety Re-Examination
Reforming of lightning rods for explosive store.
Safety use of gas bottles.
Quality of fire fighting material and equipment.
Water supply piping for fire hydrants.
Covering of motorized equipment.
Management of store fragments.
Cleanliness in explosive store and working area.
Diversion tunnels illumination, water supply, drainage.
Unauthorized fires for keeping warm..
Wearing of safety helmets.
Dry drilling in sediment tunnels.
Tower crane regulation and noise control.
Road traffic management.
(c.2) Safety Work Emphasis for 1997: Indices for injuries and fatalities were established
for 1997 as follows:
Death rate per thousand persons   0.4
Serious injury per thousand persons    1.0
Light injury per thousand persons  17
(c.3) Soecial Safety Problems
Need improved system for understanding of responsibilities.
Monitoring needs improvement, including use of enforcement.
Control of negligent or troublesome personnel and of theft.
(c.4) Fire-Fighting
Each lot must set up a Fire-Fighting Committee in order to improve coordinated
performance. Monitoring must be employed including enforcement.
(d) Summary
The overall safety program seems to have been functioning fairly effectively, but the job is
large-scale and complex so more attention is needed. This responsibility is essentially with XECC's
Safety Department.
4.2.3 Environmental Review of XP Resettlement
4.2.3.1 Introduction
4.2.3.1.1 Basic Principles
In most major dam and reservoir projects in China and other developing counties, the issue
of involuntary resettlement of displaced people is one of the most difficult and sensitive
environmental issues. This is due to the inherent complexities involved, and to inadequate planning
and implementation efforts traditionally applied to addressing resettlement issues in the past. There
are numerous examples of involuntary resettlement with inadequate planning, funding, and follow-
up, producing unacceptable impacts on the quality of life of both resettled and host population.
4-4



Increasingly effective communication and growing national and international concerns for
environmental and social issues are requiring that all major projects ensure the equitable distribution
of benefits, so that no segment of society benefits at the expense of others. In the Xiaolangdi project,
the resettled population, currently established in areas of generally high fertility are likely to be
disadvantaged unless protected by proper planning, while others living downstream benefit
significantly from improved flood protection, water supply, irrigation, and power.
The first criterion in the Xiaolangdi resettlement program is that the resettled population
should not only maintain its current standard of living but should also share in project benefits.
YRCC, in cooperation with the provincial and central government agencies concerned, is committed
to achieving this objective. The population affected by the project includes the resettlers displaced by
inundating and the population in the areas receiving resettlers (the host population). Both resettlers
and host should thus share in project benefits.
Because of its significance and sensitivity, the resettlement issue is the project's most
complex, difficult, and costly environmental problem to resolve. Accordingly YRCC's approach has
been to plan and implement a RS program which meets the essential criteria noted above.
4.2.3.1.2 Assignment of Responsibilities
The work of planning the RS program was assigned by YRCC to RPDI as reported in
ESA/92, and RPDI has continued in this role. Since establishment of RO in 1994, RPDI's work on
RS has been on behalf of RO. Planning at the local level has been done by RO/RPDI together with
the various PROs (Provincial RS Offices) and CROs (County RS Offices). The construction of the
RS villages including village infrastructure has been carried out mainly by the CROs. Evaluation of
progress in planning, construction, and operation has been carried out by YRCC/RO together with the
North China Institute of Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power (NCIWCHP).    The  MWR
Resettlement Office is responsible overall for monitoring resettlement implementation.
The RS program is being carried out in four phases, representing people moved as follows:
(i) Phase I, from construction zone, (ii) Phase II, from reservoir area for elevation below El 180 m,
(iii) Phase III, from reservoir area for El 180 to 265 m, and (iv) Phase IV, from reservoir are for El
265 to 276 m.
A summary of the entire program, as envisioned in 1992 compared to what has happened
since, up to Feb. 1997, is shown in Figure 4.2.3.1.2-1.
4.2.3.2 Resettlement Planing
4.2.3.2.1 Planning Prior to 1994
Because the RS issue is an extremely sensitive issue from the environmental point of view,
YRCC has allocated a very sizable portion of the total XP feasibility study to RS planning. For this
reason, the RS planning report is voluminous. For the purpose of the present report the essential features
of the RS planning/program are briefly described below. Historically YRCC started its RS planning
more then 20 years ago. This resettlement planning has involved 13 counties (county-level cities) in
Henan and Shanxi Provinces, with 8 located in reservoir area, and 5 host counties located adjacent to the
Yellow River, downstream of the damsite. The planning involved the active participation of YRCC and
of the leaders and agencies at the provincial, municipal, and county levels.
Several surveys of the population, land, and structures to be inundated were undertaken by
RPDI in 1959, 1970, 1980, 1982, 1985, and 1989; and the latest revisions were carried out in September
1991. Preliminary resettlement plans were prepared in 1985 and 1989. The 1991 population census
indicates that the total population to be affected by the Xiaolangdi Project is 159,971, composed of
9,799 at the damsite construction area and 150,172 in the area to be inundated (El. 275 m). Of this,
144,759 people have an agricultural registration and 15,212 have non-agricultural registration. The
resettlement was planned to be carried out on a staggered basis, the number of people to be relocated
takes account of population growth from the base year to the year of moving. The directly affected
population to be moved numbers 181,050, of which 163,762 are agricultural and 17,288 non-
agricultural. The farmland to be inundated or affected will be 366 thousand mu, and the area of houses
and caves to be inundated will be 4.862 million m2, 87% located in rural villages and 13% in towns.
4-5



As the majority of the resettlers are registered as agricultural, most will be resettled in
agriculture. Since there is little suitable land that is not already cultivated, "host" areas will share the
existing cultivated land with the newcomers through provision of additional water by irrigation or other
earning opportunities. As far as is possible, resettlers will be resettled in their own county, except where
their number exceeds the capacity of a county to accept the resettlers.
The area to be inundated is essentially a rural agricultural area composed of small groupings of
rural residences, housing 100-400 people each. Several of these residential clusters ("natural villages")
lie within the boundaries of an administrative village. An administrative village is the smallest unit in
the Chinese administrative hierarchy of land use. The next level is the township or "xiang", which
groups together several administrative villages.
4.2.3.2.2 Continuine Planninm
To meet the requirements of Henan and Shanxi provinces, RPDI conducted as survey in March-
December 1994 to obtain updated information on RS progress. According to these data, the XP/RS
program is described as follows:
(a) Area to be Inundated
The inundated area is below level 276 m. The total land area affected by inundation is 278 km2
in Henan and Shanxi provinces including 8 counties, 29 townships, and 174 villages. Some 48% of the
inundated land is fannland, 9% is timber forest, 12% is firewood forest, 16% is hill land, and 15% is for
other purpose usage.
(b) PoDulation Impact
For the survey baseline year (1994), the total population affected by inundation was 175,591
person. By time the dam is completed, the affected people will reach to 188,138, of which 169,640 are
farmers, 11,752 are government employees, 4,948 are enterprise employees, and 1,798 are retired
persons or others.
(c) Housing
The total housing space to be impacted by inundation is 7.43 million m2, of which 6.87 million
m2 (92.5%) is in rural area, 6.7% in township, 0.8% belongs to enterprises. Of the rural housing, 23.9%
is brick house or cave, 3 1.1% is earth cave. Average house space per capita is 37.6 m2.
(d) Industries
Some 787 enterprises will be affected by inundation, of which 69% are mines and 31% are
factories. The total employee number 54,499 person, of which 49,551 are employed by township
enterprises with seasonal contracts. Their salary is the main sources of their family income. These
people expect to be transfenred to be permanent employees by the RS program.
(e) Others
The XP will also have impacts on other aspects including:
schools                                186
agriculture training centers           I
hospitals                              14
epidemic prevention stations           200
entertainment centers                  177
as well as some infrastructures such as, road 1,022 km, cannel 1,652 km, small hydro-power stations
13, pumping stations 587, transmission line (10 kv) 917 km, and communication line 778 km.
The situation on RS Planning shown in Figure 4.2.3.1.2-1 includes planning before and after
1994. As noted above, responsibility for RS planning at the YRCC level was assigned in 1994 to the
new RO in YRWHDC established that year. It also shows the key questions involved in the planning
operation for all four RS phases with scheduling of the planning and construction of the RS investment
components.
4.2.3.2.3 Laws and Eauitv PrinciWles Relating to Resettlement
(a) Laws Relating to RS: The RS planning observed all laws and regulations relating to RS.
These are summarized in Tables 4.2.9.2-1 and 2 of Section 4.2.9.
(b) Equitv Principles: Based on the principle of the laws, regulations and other relevant rules,
and knowledge gained from resettlement experience at completed reservoirs elsewhere in China, 17
4-6



resettlement criteria were developed by YRCC in conjunction with local governments for the
Xiaolangdi Project. These are listed in Figure 4.2.3.2.3-1
4.2.3.2.4 Planning Criteria
Resettlement planning for the Xiaolangdi Project focuses on the siting and construction of new
residential clusters (RS villages) within existing host administrative areas. The new sites include both
housing and adjacent agricultural land as described below.
(a) Basic Agricultural Production Scenarios
There are two basic production models proposed for agricultural resettlement: (i) dry land
(rained) farming, and (ii) partially irrigated farmiing scenario. The minimum per-capita requirement for
household consumption is considered to be 225 kg grain per year, and these are maintained in both
scenarios. In this way, both the resettlers and host population will be self-sufficient in grains, so that
they may go on to grow multiple cash crops or set up other small business activities.
The amount of land requisitioned for the resettlers differs according to conditions in each host
area. For example, to allow for population increases before resettlement takes place, a minimum area of
1.7 mu/resettler is recommended for rain-fed agricultural situations where small business activities,
referred to as "sideline" income, can supplement land based farm income. Where sideline income
possibilities are limited, more land is required to provide the necessary per capita income. For areas
irrigated, 0.8 mu/resettler is the minimum provided.
The basic objective of agricultural resettlement planning is to increase per capita income of
both the resettlers and the host people by 5-15% in real terms compared with that before resettlement.
Considerable amounts of money and land must be provided, and diversification developed, so that the
previous individual income levels are maintained and increased. The overall agricultural planning for
the reservoir area shows that the requisitioned land totals 183,281 mu; the people to be resettled total
153,906; the agricultural jobs total 63,601; and the investment needed totals 670 million yuan. On
average, the cultivated land allocation will be 1.2 mu per resettler and investment 10,534 yuan per
agricultural job.
(b) Non-Agricultuml Production
With the large number of resettlers created by the Xiaolangdi Project, it is not possible for all
resettlers to continue their livelihoods in agriculture. To provide enough jobs for the relocatees and to
increase their incomes, 8,973 resettlers are to work in 8 enterprises. Their planned investment totals 107
million yuan, representing 12,224 yuan per worker. So one out of each 15 resettlers is to resettled in
non-agricultural activities. In addition, it is planned to transfer the agricultural status of 17,210 family
members of government employees relocated into the non-agricultural status. These family members
are to employed by the government unit where their family member works, by the local labour
department, or by private businesses. Investment for this will total 72.74 million yuan. About one out of
each 15 resettlers is to be provided with a non-agricultural job.
(c) Residential Planning for Villages
Currently the rural village housing occupies 14,912 mu, or 0.12 mu per capita. The residences
and cave dwellings have adequate floor space, per capita of 26.7 m2, but the construction quality is
older and the sanitary conditions are poor. The caves account for about 30% of the floor space of
residences.
The new residential areas were selected jointly by the Research Planning and Design Institute
of YRCC, together with the counties, townships (xiangs), and affected villages. A total of 267 host sites
were selected. Some 53,787 people from 12,205 families will be moved downstream to 39 host sites on
the Wenmengtan plain; 55,386 people will move to new xiangs within the same county at 117 host sites;
and 29,886 people will "move-back" within the same xiang to 91 host areas. Most of the selected areas
are located along the boundaries between two or more administrative villages, so that the land sharing
problem between resettlers and hosts villagers is minimized. The new sites provide suitable agricultural
land and adequate drinking water for both people and livestock, roads access, power and
communications, and other community facilities. Based on present water consumption for human and
livestock use, it is calculated that the water use lever is about 60 litres per capita per day. Water supply
sources include groundwater and surface water from small reservoirs.
4 -7



(d) Planning for Towns
The largest affected population centres are referred to as towns, which serve as governnment
service centres for xiangs and large administrative villages. Most of the 11 towns inundated are situated
in valleys or plains where the natural soil conditions are favorable for agriculture, and where transport
facilities are available. These places are the political, economic and cultural centres in the local regions,
and play an important part in the local economy.
Of the 11 towns, 10 towns have average populations of 1-2,000 people and 1 town contains
approximately 5,000 people. The total town population inundated is 24,865 people with 17,413 having
an agricultural status and 7,452 having non-agricultural status. The population of one town is to be
dispersed among the other towns; a second town is to be a xiang seat; and the remaining 9 towns are to
be relocated but will retain their present administrative function.
The average basic town population size is to remain the same, and the floor space per capita for
buildings at the new site is to be the same as for the old site. Infrastructure is being somewhat improved
including such items as streets, power supply, water supply and sewers, etc.
(e) Infrastructure Planning
Infrastructure to be inundated includes roads, transmission lines, communication lines,
broadcasting facilities, factories, mines, water supply works, and other community facilities.
Factories and mines and the special facilities are to be compensated and rebuilt according to
their original standards. Among the 93 factories and mines, 65 are to be transferred to other products, 26
will be rebuilt in new places, and 2 will cease to exist. All RS-sponsored factories and mines are to be
required to comply with PRC laws and regulations on pollution emissions. This is one aspect of
environmental monitoring by EMO, to check on such performance, which will be implemented in 1997.
The arterial highways are to be rebuilt to the same grade with the same quality of materials.
New residential areas are to be serviced with simple highways. Wharves and ferries around the reservoir
are to be rebuilt, enlarged or removed, as each location warrants. Every village is to be serviced by
electrical distribution lines. Telephone lines and broadcasting facilities are also guaranteed to every
village. Water supply, drainage, and solid waste management facilities are also to be provided for every
village.
4.2.3.2.5 Implementation of Resettlement
The resettlement bureaus at the provincial level in Shanxi and Henan Provinces, together with
the CROs, have primary responsibility for the implementation and management of all resettlement
activities. Resettlement offices have been established in the affected counties and county-level cities.
Funds for resettlement are distributed to the two Provincial Resettlement Bureaus directly from the
Construction Bank of China, and then from the province to the local govermment departments of the
host counties and xiangs. All the resettlement activities are monitored by YRWRHDC/RO, including
RO's EMO.
4.2.3.2.6 Summary Tabulation of RS Plan
For purposes of the present EIA report it is considered helpful to list the main topics now
included in the overall RS plan, as follows:
(a)  Xiaolangdi Reservoir Impacts

(n)  Host Impacts
(o)  Compensation to Households
(p)  Reservoir Resettlement Cost Estimates
(q)  Resettlement Financing
(r)  Next Steps for Resettlement

4.2.3.2.7 Illustrative Maps
The RS task of 1992 included preparation of a series of some 63 maps illustrating various
aspects of the RS plan and the entire series is listed in Figure 4.2.3.2.7-1. Of the series the following
seven (called "maps") have been selected for inclusion here for purposes of environmental review:
(a) Map 17, "Main Inundated Components of RS Plan of Xiaolangdi, Index Map".
(b) Map 18, "Main Components to Be Inundated and Resettlement Plan Layout in Yuanqu
County", selected to illustrate typical RS plan utilizing host villages.
(c) Map 19, "Layout of Resettlement Plan in Wenmengtan Floodplain" selected to illustrate RS
planning in new reclaimed lands along the river.
(d) Map 20, "Typical Planning Arrangement of New Site for Original Shimen Village of
Matun Xiang, Mengjin County", selected to illustrate planning for new RS village site.
(e) Map 21, "Plan Layout for New Host Site of Meiyao Township, Menglin County", selected
to illustrate new host site.
(f) Map 22 "New Village Site Planning for Xiaolangdi Village".
(g) Map 23, "New Village Site Design and Residence Model Drawings for Xiaolangdi Trial
Village", selected to illustrate proposed model housing.
These seven maps included as supplemental Annex 4.2.3-1 in Volume II of the present report.
4.2.3.3 Resettlement Progress
4.2.3.3.1 Phase I (Damsite Construction Zone Resettlement)
The land requisitioned for the damsite construction area includes land occupied by the main
works of the dam project, borrow areas, disposal areas, work areas, and camp areas for housing
construction personnel. Investigations carried out in 1990 show that the construction sites cover a total
area of 33,500 mu of which 20,083 mu had been farmland. A total population of 9,798 people are
affected as a result of the construction of the project. The resettlement planning shows that 75% of the
total 9,978 resettlers from the damsite construction zone remained in agriculture and 25% went to non-
agricultural employment. Roughly one of each 2 labor forces went to non-agricultural activities.
Figure 4.2.3.3.1- 1 shows the host site for XP/RS Phase I.
4.2.3.3.2 Phase 11 Resettlement Program
Phase II resettlement from the reservoir area (below El 180 m) involves a total population of
46,000 in 27 administration villages, including 42000 rural people. In the Phase II resettlement
planning, it was previously planned to provide 45 new sites, but this total number has been reduced to
34 through optimization during implementation. House construction for 25,000 people was completed
in 1995 as scheduled. The work quantities completed in 1996 included new houses for 17,000 people
plus corresponding infrastructures. Out of the total resettlement population, 4,000 people are being
relocated together with industries and institutions. By the end of 1996 settlement has been completed for
11,268 families (about 40,000 people), including 6,000 mu land for new sites, 1.011 million m2 houses,
35,1596 mu land for production use, 36 wells, 97 km high-voltage power lines, 45 substations, and 65
km xiang-village roads. The total number of moved families is 4,478, together 16,580 people. The sites
for Phase II RS villages are shown in Figure 4.2.3.3.2- 1.
4.2.3.3.3 Phase III
Phase III resettlement from the reservoir area (El 180-265 m) has been initiated. The completed
work quantities will include 18,100 mu land for production use, 4 pump stations, 9 new enterprises, new
housing for 456 families, and 41.4 km roads. Construction of basic facilities for Gucheng Township has
been essentially completed, including land acquisition, water/power supply provision, and road
construction. A total of 16,100 m2 buildings have been completed for the township government.
River training and warping works completed at Wenmengtan in December 1996 include:
4-9



(a) Land accretion: 10.62 million m3 soil works, accounting for 85% of the total design
quantity (12.54 million m3);
(b) Warping: 1.66 million mu, taking up 25% of the total design quantities (6.44 million mu);
(c) Training works: 63 spurs, or 53% of the total design quantities (118);
(d) Dyke: 150,000 m3.
Regarding Houhe reservoir and irrigation area project, the reservoir design has been reviewed
but not yet approved by MWR. The preparatory works include provision of access roads, buildings,
water/power supply facilities, telecommunications, and land for construction use. Tendering for the
main works of the dam component was started December 5, 1996.
Optimization of the irrigation area component has been completed, and jointly appraised by the
MWR River Conservancy Engineering Consultative Center and the China International Engineering
Consultative Company on December 27, 1996.
4.2.3.3.4 Phase IV
Phase IV resettlement refers to people move from elevations up to 275 m, the reservoir level
when the reservoir is full. At 265-275 m, the affected population will be 23,000 person (17,000 in
Henan, 6,000 in Shanxi), with 95,000 mu of affected land (17,000 in Henan, 30,000 in Shanxi). Phase
IV planning is to be finished in 1997 and construction completed in 2010-2015.
4.2.3.3.5 Combining Phases m and IV
Consideration is being given at the present time (Feb. 1997) to combine Phases m and IV into a
single phase, with overall planning to be completed in 1997.
4.2.3.4 Review of Resettlement Ooeration by RS ALencies
4.2.3.4.1 Effects on RS Families
(a) Economic Effects
Figure 4.2.3.4.1-1 has been prepared to summarize the compensation provided for the 18
various types of RS population involved including (i) compensation costs for housing/yard/amenities (in
favor of replacement of these), and (ii) compensation for lost income and compensation for any training
needs and including compensation of income level before and after resettlement. These data indicate
that the RS families will not suffer economic losses because of XLD Project. However, with respect to
agricultural resettlement, the RS report notes the need for continuing work and attention to some
outstanding issues, as follows:
(i) Farn incomes constitute less than half the household incomes of both the affected
population and the hosts. The projected farm incomes of relocatees are unlikely to be much
higher than current levels, although there is some scope to increase incomes by diversifying
cropping patterns, if grain quota requirements are waived. Therefore, agriculture is an unlikely
source to improve living standards.
(ii) Non-farm income sources deserve at least the same level of study and planning to ensure
that rural resettlers living standards do not decline. The Wenmengtan Scheme, for example, has
agricultural development costs of 5,500 yuan per capita or 24,200 yuan per household.
Altemative non-agricultural employment opportunities could be explored at this level of
investment per capita.
(iii) The successful relocation of rural people from the three most affected counties (Xin'an,
Jiyuan and Yuanqu) is dependent on timely completion of the Wenmengtan and Houhe
schemes. Early construction of these projects is important.
(iv) Counties should be careful not to overestimate potential crop yields, since this will tend
to reduce the areas of land allocated to relocatees. Similarly, variations in the quality of land
should also be taken into account.
(v) Early action is required to complete agreements between resettler and host villages. More
staff and resources are required at the County level to undertake this, and other planning tasks at
the village level.
(vi) Serious consideration must be given to introducing preferential policies for rural
relocatees and hosts. This matter is already under consideration and includes, among others,
special status for scarce farm inputs, direct sales of farm products, training,
4 -10



exemption/reduction of grain quotas, priority for jobs in rural enterprises, subsidies and tax
exemptions.
(b) Housine/Amenities/Public Services
Table 4.2.3.4.1-1 summarizes the before and after situation on housing/ amenities and public
services for the various type of RS populations. These data indicate the RS farnilies will generally be
better off than before moving. Figures 4.2.3.4.1-2 to 5 illustrate the typical before and after situation on
housing. It is of interest to note that 60% of the floor space of existing housing of the resettlers (total
population 181,050) is in caves, and that such caves are characteristically damp and commonly
inadequately ventilated.
(c) Social/Cultural Impacts
Because virtually all of the RS and host families are Han Chinese, there should be no ethnic
conflict problems. The social/cultural summary made by the RS team have indicted that most RS
families are aware that they will have to move, but few have any firm concept of the specifics to be
involved. As would be expected, the minority do not much like the idea of moving, but, if required to
move, they would prefer not to be separated from their villager neighbors. However, their main concern
is that the move would hopefully result in an improved standard of living, especially if given the
opportunity to switch from agricultural to non-agricultural livelihoods.
4.2.3.4.2 Effects on Hosts
(a) Host Family Economics
Table 4.2.3.4.2-1 summarizes the information on economic impacts on host families.
(b) Host Community Infrastructure/Public Services
Table 4.2.3.4.2-2 shows the situation on community infrastructure/public services, namely to
show that the RS program will supplement the existing infrastructure/services to accommodate the
increased loading without loss in level of service.
(c) Socio-Cultural Impacts
The RS task surveys indicate that about 70% of the host population is aware of the proposed RS
program; the majority of these believe that the RS program will have significant effects on their
livelihoods; and about two-thirds seem willing to accommodate the RS families. The indication is that
the "proof of the pudding will be in the eating ", that is, the socio-cultural problems will be acceptable
provided that the host villagers are not made worse off economically by the RS program.
4.2.3.4.3 Grievances/Complaints
(a) Mechanics for Grievances/Complaints
The Village Committees, which represent the villagers independently of the regular government
structure, are expected to be the main mechanics for receiving grievances/complaints from RS families
or host families. The village committees, if unable to resolve the problems, will refer them to the local
government and then to higher government levels as needed up to the provincial levels. Grievances are
expected to be of three types, (i) psychological/socio-cultural, (ii) physiological/services, and (iii)
economics. Table 4.2.3.4.3-1 summarizes the avenues for resolution of grievances.
Experience in using the EIA process in various provinces of China has shown that the Village
Committees (also called Residential Community Associations) have been quite effective in gaining
support from the local and provincial governmental agencies, including the Environmental Protection
Bureaus, for solving unfair treatment of the villagers/residents (See "Evaluation of EIA in PRC, Asian
Development Bank, 1991).
(b) Safety Nets
If resettlers or hosts are unsuccessful in achieving satisfactory income levels, they will have
recourse to a special Reservoir Area Support Fund which guarantees minimum incomes should farm or
non-farm livelihoods fail to meet their minimum needs. Applicants to the Fund will be referred through
their village leader to the CRO. This Fund will remain in place until the MWR deems that the
Xiaolangdi relocatees and affected hosts are no longer at risk. This Fund will also support entire villages
should that be necessary. The Ministry of Water Resources' "Reservoir Area Support Fund" will
underwrite the liabilities of the income protection plan.
4- 11



For non-farm workers, employment and income risks will be covered by their units. Where
units go bankrupt, the agreements signed in advance for resettlers to be compensated or integrated into
other units.
4.2.3.4.4 Trans2ort Capacity
The early experience in managing RS for construction camp resettlers indicated some problems
in furnishing adequate transport capacity for moving RS families from existing to new sites. Table
4.2.3.4.4-1 has been prepared to show the updated RS plan for managing this problem.
4.2.3.4.5 Monitoring Provisions in Resettlement Plan
The construction of all Xiaolangdi Project components requires proper supervision and
monitoring. The resettlement component is thus being implemented to ensure the quality and schedule
of resettlement programs, to control costs, to ensure cost effectiveness, and to augment economic
benefits for resettlers and hosts. Special forms are completed by resettlement personnel at xiang or
village level, and submitted to provincial and municipal resettlement bureaus. Copies of these are
submitted to the YRCC Resettlement Office by the CRO, and then enclosed in the construction progress
reports submitted by supervising engineers. Only in this way can resettlement operations be monitored,
and problems identified and quickly resolved. These forms and corresponding written materials are
submitted on a quarterly basis.
YRCC has engaged qualified social institute scientist experts from Hehai University and
NCIWCHP to conduct independent evaluations of socio-economic progress of the resettlers. This
service aims at evaluating and reporting on the level of living conditions and social services of the
affected population, both before and after resettlement. The evaluation are being done every year and
cover (i) farm yields, employment, education, public healt, and incomes in new host areas, (ii) ideas of
the resettlers on organizations, services, and social progress in new sites, and (iii) samples of
inforrnation on effects on host comununities. Socio-economic evaluations are based on a number of key
indices for selected households. The budget for RS monitoring is estimated to be Yuan 14 million, and
will be financed from the resettlement compensation budget The monitoring program described above
is reviewed periodically by the EMO, to ensure that it is proceeding satisfactorily. This is explained in
Section 5 of this report (See Section 5 of the present report).
4.2.3.4.6 Infrastructure and Industry
(a) Infrastructure
The RS infrastructure program has been planned to ensure that the various public services to be
furnished in the new communities and host communities will give levels of service to both RS families
and affected host families at least as good as previously, and so that host communities will be furnished
with funding to finance needed public service improvements.
Some questions have been raised about the economic viability of some of the infrastructure
aspects of the overall RS program including the Houhe reservoir schemes, the Xiping reservoir scheme,
and terracing of steep hillsides. Each of these is being further evaluated, but all are relatively minor
aspects of the overall RS plan and these questions will hardly affect the soundness of the overall
economic RS plan evaluation. Questions have been raised also about the reliability of the land
reclamation schemes along the river below the dam. In this connection, the YRCC Design Institute is
believed to have the needed expertise in this field of work. The land reclamation program is already
well underway (being financed separately from the XLD Project).
(b) Industries
One of the RS problems involves industries which are established to create jobs for resettlers,
i.e., are these industries in compliance with environmental laws and regulations, particularly with
respect to management of waste emissions (liquid, solid, gaseous)? Part of the ERD's program is to
ensure that industries established for RS purposes do comply with the laws and regulations. This then is
another assignment for the ERDIRPDI field inspector team.
4.2.3.4.7 Natural Resources and Archeological Relics
Field visits to the various RS sites have not indicated problems of adverse effects on existing
forests, wildlife, or other natural resources. This is because the areas involved are already "people-ized".
4 -12



The field visits and consultation with archeological experts have not found evidence of any
archeological relics which would be effected by the RS plan.
4.23.4.8 Aereements between RS Program Participants
A critical aspect of the overall RS program is timely procurement of written agreements
between the various agencies participating in the program, from highest to lowest levels. This program
is underway as discussed in Section 4.2.3.4-3.
4.2.3.4.9 Overview and Risks
The situation on risks may be summarized as follows:
(a) Resettlement Planning: All general planning activities have been completed, but some
improvements are needed as follows:
(i)   Develop detailed implementation plans and schedules for RS program for Phases III and
IV (for El 180-276 m).
(ii) Increase the level of public consultation and integration with the planning decision
process.
(b) Resettlement Feasibility
(i)  Implementation of RS Phase I for the damsite construction zone is already completed.
Income situation of resettlers is being investigated and monitored by CRO and institutes.
(ii) Resettlement Implementation Planning for phase II (below El 180) is completed, and
moving of the resettlers will be completed in October, 1997.
(iii) Resettlement Feasibility Planning for Phase III and IV (El 180 to El 276) is completed,
and detailed village planning is underway.
(iv) Xinan recommended a resettlement scheme in which 20% relocatees were to be resettled
within the county and 80% moved to Wenmengtan and the three downstream counties. This
scheme is feasible technically, socially, and economically. However, its successful
implementation requires that YRCC fumish the river training works ready ahead of schedule,
that provincial government properly coordinates the socio-economic relations between
resettlers and host counties, and that county resettlement offices undertake detailed work among
both resettlement and host communities.
(v)  According to Jiyuan resettlement scheme, 70% resettlers will be moved near or back
within the county, and 30% will be moved to Wenmengtan. Apart from this, a potential exists
for industrial and agricultural resettlement. The scheme is technically, socially, and
economically feasible.
(vi) Yuanqu proposes to resettle all the resettlers within its boundary, and most will go to the
Houhe Irrigation Zone. As listed in the capital construction plan of the MWR, this reservoir is
ensured for investments. So success of the scheme depends upon the execution of the reservoir
and development of its benefits as planned. Because the feasibility design indicates the project
benefits will be realized as intended, the resettlement scheme is considered to be feasible from
the technical, social, and economic point of view.
(vii) With more farmland from which more land can be shared by relocatees, Mianchi and
Mengjin provide land for all resettlers.
(viii) With less than 1% of their county total populations affected, Shanxian, Pinglu, and
Xiaxian will arrange for their resettlers intemally by moving back within the same xiang or
village.
(c) Risks
The following resettlement risks have been identified and should be considered during
resettlement planning and implementation decisions:
(i)   Timing of land development of Wenrnengtan should be further considered after the dam
project is completed. Certain schedules for downstream works have to be further determined,
and local governments need to arrange boundaries between shared land. It is critically
significant to make sure that this site will be adequate to support resettlement El 180 to 265.
4- 13



(ii) Local government funding may not be available in time for investing in industrial
enterprises. Whether these enterprises can be made available in time will affect resettlers
employment and economic incomes.
(iii) The downstream RS Planning for Kaifeng, Zhongmu, and Yuanyang proposes to utilize
marginal lands that would be brought up to agronomic standards through deposition of river silt.
While the technical and economic rationale of this land improvement technique has been
established in other situations, the social acceptability of relocating up to 200 km distance away
from the reservoir needs further evaluation.
(iv) At present, fifty percent or more of household income may come from non-agricultural
sources. The ability of proposed non-agricultural employment to sustain this income level must
still be demonstrated.
(v)  If the resettlement cost estimate is found to be too low during implementation (on
account of quantities, unit values, or compensation funds for purchasing power), the cost
estimate will be required to be readjusted quickly. If the government cannot guarantee
resettlement financing, project activities will have to be suspended.
(vi) Offsetting the many negative risks is a positive one: A high proportion ( in excess of 50
percent ) of the resettlement task is carried out by local manpower. This manpower is available,
and is priced low.
4.2.3.4.10 Compliance with Environmental Laws
This subject is discussed in Section 4.2.3.2.3 (a).
4.2.3.5 Summary Environmental Evaluation
(a) Discussion
The overall RS project accomplishments to date are believed to represent a remarkable effort
for planning and implementing developing an effective RS program for a major dam/reservoir project in
China, a truly pioneering effort involving a multitude of details and complexities. Considering that the
RS planning and preparations seem well underway and in hand, and assuming support from YRCC and
the other governmental agency participants will continue to be furnished as planned, it is concluded that
the overall RS program is quite well in hand. Nothing of this complexity will ever be perfect, but it is
concluded that the RS planning progress and future expectations will meet EIA requirements of both
government and WB provided that the recommended improvements made by the Environmental
Engineer Member and Sociologist Member of the Expert Panel on Environment and Resettlement will
be duly implemented. These recommendations may be briefly summarized as follows:
(al) Environmental Enaineeriny Asnects of RS: This will require implementation of the
EEMEP's recommendation that the operations of the ERD/RPDI field environmental inspector team be
expanded to give "equal attention" to RS as for the dam construction operation, and the field visits made
by the EEMEP during Expert Panel meetings will allow sufficient time for Panel surveillance of the
facilities being furnished. This includes attention to environmental conditions at factories especially oi1
waste emissions, as discussed in Item (d) below.
(a2) Sociologist Asvects of RS: This requires implementation of the recommendation of the
Sociologist Member of the Expert Panel to allow more time during Panel field visits for direct contacts
with resettlement families who have moved and lived in their new quarters for significant periods, and
that the RS/MIS system be effectively implemented by RO, including recommendations made by the
Sociologist Panel Member.
(b) Evaluation
Figure 4.2.3.5-1 summarizes the Environmental Evaluation of the RS program to date. This
information confirms that the YRWHDC/RO has indeed done a remarkable job, in solving the
numerous difficult problems involved in a complex pioneering program of this type, in achieving the
primary goal of getting the RS village housing, housing amenities, and village infrastructure built on
time and at good quality levels, and in arranging for moving and for new working arrangements so the
RS families and hosts are not economically disadvantaged but actually do gain from the RS operations.
The only tiing lacking has been sufficient monitoring and surveillance to ensure that the physical
facilities built are built to acceptable standards and will be corrected when needed and will be operated
4 - 14



and maintained so that the investment in building these facilities will actually realize the planned
benefits for the health and welfare of the RS families and villages. Moreover the recommended
monitoring/surveillance program will cost only a tiny fraction of the investment cost for building the
facilities.
(c) Recommendations for Phvsical Facilities of RS Villages
The recommended monitoring/surveillance program comprises the following components in the
physical facilities program:
(i)   Expansion of the ERD/RPDI field operations to include visits to each village every 3
months, to check on adequacy of facilities built and of the status of O&M.
(ii)  Appointment of a "Working Level Environmental Officer" at each RS village, with
suitable pay, who will ensure that O&M is satisfactory and who will keep adequate records on
this, for all pertinent environmental issues.
(iii) Visits by the EEMEP to selected RS villages every six months to check on the above.
For example, on (ii), the most important single need is for chlorine residual testing at a number
of home water taps on a weekly basis, with a written record of these, to ensure safety of the
water supply for drinking. If there were to be a waterborne disease epidemic at any RS village,
the absence of such records would per se represent an indictment of performance of all
responsible parties including the Bank. Another example, the EEMEP's visits indicate lack of
attention to keeping the excellent village storm drainage channels from getting filled with trash,
hence if a serious storm occurs the system will not furnish the intended protection. Again, some
continuing guidance is needed to ensure that the RS village sanitary landfills are actually
operated in a sanitary manner, to avoid serious public health hazards from insect and rodent
disease vectors. Again, some hand washing facilities are needed in the toilet rooms of schools
where dry toilet systems are used.
In addition to the above, some periodic technical guidance is needed during the
construction phase for RS facilities for RS facilities to ensure that the facilities as built are
adequate. Generally they are but sometimes some technical guidance input is needed, for
example, to determine whether the mineral quality of well water supplies is adequate when it
appears if nay not be, due to color, iron, excessive dissolved solids, etc. In addition periodic
checking is needed on pollution control performance of factories built for RS purposes.
(d) Summary
To sum up, it appear that an excellent job is being generally done in provision of the physical
facilities, and all that is needed to "perfect" the overall program is an appropriate monitoring and
surveillance program (which involves only a tiny fraction of the total investment cost). This will require
major upgrading of the environmental monitoring as practical up to now.
4.2.4   Archeological Relics
4.2.4.1 Relics Protection Plan
As noted in Section 3.2.13 of Chapter 3, the XLD reservoir area is within the region where
the Chinese Han peoples originated, hence the area contains numerous archeological relics,
especially in the main population/farning areas of the middle and lower Yellow River reaches.
Although the density of cultural relics is much lower in the gorge area where the dam and reservoir
will be located, a detailed archaeological exploration, classification, and salvage program has been
undertaken to locate, recover, and protect important underground and surface relics and cultural
treasures in the area to be inundated. This program is delineated in Figure 4.2.4-1. This program is
summarized in Table 4.2.4.3-1. It is in compliance with the Archeological Law of China, which
requires that all important relics are to be excavated, protected, and where appropriate, preserved or
reconstructed.
4.2.4.2 Relics Program
(a) Underground relics program: It includes two stages: (a.l) Drilling, excavation, and
salvage; (a.2) clearing.
(a. 1) Drilling, excavation, and salvage: The underground archeological relics in XLD
project reservoir zone are distributed in about 5.34 million m2. The HSAIs decided that 80-100% of
4 - 15



the area is to be drilled, and 10-15% be excavated. After excavation, the objects with values like
earthware, stoneware, etc. will be repaired and stored in museums. For the rest, like tomb, ash pit,
etc., these will be recorded in writing and photos for further study.
(a.2) Clearing: Those with less value and/or are seriously damaged will not be stored and
studied further. These relics will be selected on the basis of estimated value.
(b) Relics above ground: According to the evaluation, the main components of those with
historical values will be removed and relocated, if possible, and those which cannot be removed will
be sampled and recorded.
4.2.4.3 Program Costs
The overall budget for the archaeological protection plan was 17.20 million yuan on the base
price of 1991, including exploration boring, excavation, temporary storage, repair, relocation, and
reconstruction. After the meeting (presided by MWR) of December 1995 for planning the relics
protection program, the HSAIs re-categorized the cultural relics and historical sites in the
construction and reservoir areas into three categories: major importance, relatively importance, and
general. Considering the price inflation (based on 1994), the original cost for relics program was
adjusted to 22.50 million yuan. Also, an extra investment of 4.87 million yuan was found to be
required by the two provincial relics bureaus to salvage the two most important relics, Xiwo Grottos
of the North Wei Dynasty in Henan Province and Yuanqu culture remains of the Shang Dynasty in
Shanxi Province. The Xiwo Grottos will be relocated and reconstructed, which costs about 3.00
million yuan. The Yuanqu historical site will be unearthed completely, which will cost 1.87 million
yuan. Table 4.2.4.3-1 shows the yearly investment in the relics program.
4.2.4.4 Program Proeress
At the meeting in Dec. 1995, an understanding was reached on needs for to the effect of
archeological protection in the XLD reservoir area between the provincial archeological agencies,
related departments, and experts. Subsequently the HSAIs, entrusted by YRWHDCRO, undertook
investigation and evaluation of cultural relics and historical sites in the construction and reservoir
areas. In the reservoir area there are altogether 109 cultural relics and historical sites below El 275 m,
including 80 from the New Stone Age to the Tang Dynasty period. In Shanxi Province, 3 above-
ground ancient structures and 55 stales from the Ming and Tang Dynasties have been discovered. The
relics discovered in Henan Province include Xiwo Grottos of the North Wei Dynasty, the Emperor
Tang Temple of the Yuan Dynasty, as well as other ancient structures and carved stones. All these
are valuable for architectural and artistic studies of ancient China. They will be excavated and
salvaged at different times prior to creation of the reservoir.
Some examples to illustrate progress on the relics program are given here:
(a) Xiwo stone cave: It is located at Xiwo township, south bank of east Yellow River, 40 km
from Xinan county. The Xiwo Grottos are located on the cliff of the south bank of the Yellow River,
8 m to the upper road and 10 m to the river edge. The actual elevation of the Grottos is 168 m, which
is 12 m lower than the water level in the reservoir (180 m) in first stage. The Grottos include 171
niches, 4 Buddha towers, and about 200 statues. It is about 1,400 year old. It is the only relic which is
classified at the "Provincial Protection Level" in the inundated area. It will be the first time in China
to relocate and reconstruct a stone cave as a whole. A series of procedures including evaluation,
historic change, collection of related informnation, investigation of environmental problems such as
presence of un-steady surrounding rock, etc. has been set and approved by experts and government
agencies. The new location for the Grottos, Qiantangzhizhai museum in Xinan county, has been
selected. Cutting and moving the Grottos will be completed by the end of 1997, and reconstruction
will be carried out in 1998. Photos of the Grottos are attached (See Figure 4.2.4.4-1).
(b) Zhouli site: It is a historical site of Longshan early age, located at Zhouli village, Mengjin
county in Henan Province. It is one of the ten important archaeological relics classified as the "China
State Protection Level". Some 12 house foundations, 120 ash pits, and 16 tombs have been
excavated, as well as some potterie, stonewares, etc. It is valuable to study the Chinese origins.
Figure 4.2.4.4-2 shows some photos of Zhouli site.
4 - 16



Progress on the relics program to date is summarized in Table 4.2.4.4-1 for Henan and Table
4.2.4.4-2 for Shanxi.
4.2.4.5 Program Evaluation
The progress of the relics program was reviewed by the Expert Panel on Environment and RS
at its meeting in October 1996 and Annex 4.2.4-1 gives the notes of this meeting. The findings of the
meeting indicate that funding of the relics work has been a continuing problem. In addition the
reporting on the work needs to be done more systematically and a suggested format for this is given
in Annex 4.2.4- 1.
Table 4.2.4.3-1 shows the planning for the continuing relics program from 1997 up to time of
inundation.
4.2.5   Dam Stability against Earthauakes
4.2.5.1 Analysis of Dam Stability against Earthquakes
The Xiaolangdi Project will result in a deep and relatively large reservoir whose mass may
result in induced earthquakes in or near the reservoir area. Of the 200 large reservoirs built around the
world, four have caused earthquakes with an intensity of class 5.5 or more on the Richter scale.
Because the dam is located in a region with a history of serious earthquakes, and there are large faults
passing through the dam/reservoir site, the issue of dam safety is very important.
YRCC has attached great importance to dam stability and has carried out extensive program of
studies on this subject as applied to XP. Between 1978 and 1983, geologic mapping and a systematic
survey of the reservoir area produced the first estimates of the distribution, length, and attitude of active
faults in the area. A thorough review of reservoir induced earthquakes within China and abroad was
carried out in 1984 and 1985. Based on this initial work, a detailed study of the probability of
reservoir-induced earthquakes subsequent to the construction of Xiaolangdi was carried out from 1986
to 1987. This included extensive and detailed field studies required to assess the active Quaternary
faults in the reservoir area.   Techniques included   stripping and testing of samples by
thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance methods to furnish the dates of the most recent
activity. Finally detailed studies were made of the Xinfengjiang, Danjiang, Longyangxia, Senwo,
Wuxijiang, Nanchong, and Shengjiaxia reservoirs, which have triggered earthquakes after
impoundment. Based on these investigations and studies, the potential magnitude of induced
earthquakes subsequent to flooding of the Xiaolangdi reservoir is estimated to be between 5.5 and 5.6
on the Richter scale. A magnitude of 5.6 was recommended for design purposes in the document
entitled "Special Report on Reservoir Induced Earthquake Study of Xiaolangdi Project" (February
1988).
During the project appraisal for Phase I loan, both the Panel of Experts on XLD planning and
YRWHHDC attached great importance to the possibility of reservoir-induced earthquakes. Based on the
Panel's recommendations, the seismic stability of the dam, embankments, and the intake towers have
been tested for a simulated magnitude of 6.25 at corresponding horizontal peak acceleration of 0.5 g.
The results indicate that the dam, embankment, and the intake towers would not be endangered under
these conditions. In conclusion, the present seismic design of the dam is considered to be fully
consistent with the best state of the scientific knowledge on this aspect.
4.2.5.2 General Design of Seicmoscopic Network
(a) Need for Network
As above stated, the XLD reservoir is located in a region with a history of frequent serious
earthquakes. The reservoir area is subject to a number of Quaternary faults with the possibility of
reservoir seepage. As a result, there is probability of induced earthquakes. As compared with natural
earthquakes, induced ones have such characteristics as higher frequency, shallower focus, and higher
epicenter intensity. Generally an earthquake less than class 1 is sensible, and an earthquake of class 3
may cause damages. The XLD is a typical high dam with a large reservoir, with all the 16 flood release,
sediment discharge, power generation, and irrigation tunnels arranged on the left bank. The project also
includes a large span powerhouse. In particular, the dam, the deep foundation overburden, and the 100
m high intake tower are sensitive to earthquakes. Therefore, it very necessary to have a special
seismoscopic network for carrying out seismic monitoring, allowing information feedback, probing the
4- 17



rules of seismic occurrence, and providing proper earthquake prediction for the sake of safe construction
and operation of the project and also safety of the people living in and below the damsite area.
(b) General Design
(b.1) Lavout
The XLD seismic monitoring network consists of 9 seismoscopic stations, 1 repeater center,
and I data processing center. The stations are respectively distributed in Mengjin, Xinan, and Jiyuan,
while the processing center is located in Luoyang. Out of the 9 stations, the Donggou, Qiaoling,
Shangmengzhuang, Dangyao, and Nanguanlangtai stations are single directional, with the others located
at Lang, Pangxiejiao, Qingshigeta, and the low-gain active line station at the processing center. As
illustrated in Figure 4.2.5-1, the station at Lang and the active-line station are located upstream of the
dam, but all the others are located downstream.
(b.2) Establishment of Network and Freguencv Response
The network is established using telemetry module-module antenna transmission, visible and
magnetic-medium recording, man-machine interaction, and computer real-time data processing. The
frequency response adopted for the network is displacement flat-type response in which the high-gain
telemetry station is designed to have vertical speed flat-type response in addition to displacement flat-
type response. Displacement flat-type response is also built into the three-directional low gain station
located at the data processing center, allowing complete recording of any earthquake at ML>3.5 within
the network and the inner edge.
(b.3) Recordin2z and Data Processing
Recording is designed to be accomplished with visible analog recording and magnetic-medium
digital recording with seismic event trigger. The latter is used as the principal data recording approach,
with all seismic events (especially those at ML=1.5) transmitted by different stations recorded in
magnetic media in the digital format. The digital sampling rate is 200 times/s.
The data processing system comprises a real-time monitoring data processing subsystem and an
off-line processing subsystem. The former is responsible for identifying and testing seismic event,
calculating epicenter, magnitude, time and focus depth of earthquake events, and subsequently giving
preliminary analysis results. Also, it keeps digital records on permanent and reusable floppy disks. The
latter carries out further data processing of seismic data by man-machine interaction, and also provides
seismic distance, spectrum and focus mechanisms as routine parameters. Any seismic event occurring in
the specified range is reported to responsible departments as early as possible, and a database is
established for the submission of ten-day reports and seismological observation reports. In addition,
such data is also utilized to carry out special studies on seismicity, focus mechanism, induced
earthquake, and damsite stress status.
4.2.5.3 Network Construction and Operation
As required in the general design, the network construction was started in December 1994, with
equipment installation and debugging completed by October 1995. The overall network was put into
operation in November 1995. The service area is focused on the area 40 km upstream and 8 km
downstream, covering a total land area of 1,400 km2. Within this range, any seismic event at ML=0.5
will not be missed, and the epicenter positioning accuracy can be controlled at 0.5 km.
The network was formally put into operation on January 1, 1995. After the checkout operation
from March 1 to May 31, 1996, the network was put into normal operation on June 1, 1996. The results
from the 3-month checkout period included 2,470 pages of medium record printouts, 1,142 magnetic
medium sampling events, 104 floppy disks, 15 processed seismic events, and 3 monthly reports.
According to statistical data, the signal continuity rate is 99.31%, providing an overall score of 98.84
points. During the period starting November 1, 1995 and ending May 31, 1996, a total of 26 seismic
events were measured in the network, the edge, and the vicinity. The positioning results of earthquakes
within the network and its edge are generally consistent with the national catalogue. A ML 6.4
earthquake occurring in Baotou City, Inner Mongolia was recorded by the low-gain station on May 3,
1996. The XLD network was reviewed and accepted by responsible authorities and specialists in July
1996. Altogether 23 earthquakes (including 18 in the network and its edge) were processed during the
recent normal operation period from June 1 to December 31, 1996, resulting in 8,578-page printouts,
4 - 18



more than 1,000 magnetic medium sampling events, 23 disks, 95.29% signal continuity rate, and 7
monthly reports.
The above mentioned operation practice indicates stable and reliable operation results from the
rational design of the network, thus completely satisfying the XP earthquake warning requirements.
4.2.6  Public Health
4.2.6.1 Situation in ESA
The Environmental Study Area has a number of serious public health concerns, especially
communicable diseases, which pose significant problems if protective measures are not undertaken.
A summary of the existing situation with respect to communicable diseases in the Xiaolangdi
Reservoir vicinity is given in Figure 3.2.12-1 of Chapter 3. The prevalent communicable diseases
common in the study area include (a) malaria, (b) encephalitis, (c) hemorrhagic fever, (d) brucellosis,
(e) paragonimiasis, and (f) sanitation-related enteric diseases including dysentery, hepatitis, and
typhoid. The Xiaolangdi Project could significantly increase the hazards of malaria, encephalitis,
hemorrhagic fever, and enteric diseases.
4.2.6.2 Health Effects of XP
The XP will markedly change the hydrology of the Yellow River by creation of a reservoir,
and by providing an opportunity for increased irrigation of the surrounding and downstream
agricultural areas. These changes may increase the hazards for vector-borne diseases such as malaria
and encephalitis, and for communicable diseases such as dysentery, hepatitis, and typhoid. This is
particularly true for the area around the reservoir, and newly irrigated agricultural lands. Inundation
of the reservoir area will also force mass out-migration of disease-bearing rats, almost certainly
resulting in an increased hazard of hemorrhagic fever in the surrounding area. Furthermore, the influx
of construction workers will increase the risk of both vector-borne and sanitation-related enteric
diseases in the vicinity if the construction areas. It is essential therefore to ensure that public health
programs, including vector control and sanitation, are well planned, adequately funded, and
effectively implemented. The public health vector control and sanitation programs to be implemented
by XP, for controlling the with-project hazards which would not exist without the Project, are
summarized in Figures 4.2.6.2-1. The cost estimates for XP diseases control program are shown in
Figure 4.2.6.2-2. Details are described below.
4.2.6.3 Vector Disease Control in Construction Zone
4.2.6.3.1 Medical Screening/Examinations of Workers
As required by the construction contracts, before entering into the construction sites all the
foreign and Chinese staff have to submit their health certificates and are physically examined on the
yearly basis beginning with commencement of the main works. As entrusted by YRWHDC, Luoyang
Anti-epidemic Bureau conducted these examinations for the construction workers prior to their
mobilization at the Site in 1994. On the basis of the examination results, some disqualified workers
were replaced and rejected. However, no communicable disease cases were found. A total number of
930 workers from Lot III received physical examination in 1994, with no communicable diseases
being detected excepting a few enteric disease cases in the summer. No unusual diseases were found
amnong Lot II workers included in the examination. As for Lot III, 296 workers were covered in the
examination, 7 were found suffering from hepatitis B and were all rejected. A considerable number
of cases of enteric disease were found but no cases were reported in YRWHDC Hospital. Three cases
of encephalitis were found in 1996 and provided with prompt treatment. Table 4.2.6.3.1-1 shows the
medical screening schedule and results in construction camps for 1994 to 1996.
A health safety network has been established in the construction area. Each of the three CCs has
established its own clinic. The YRWHDC has also set up its own hospital of considerable size. In the
event of any disease cases beyond the capability of these facilities, access is available to Luoyang city
hospitals. The safety network at the Site is as illustrated in Figure 4.2.6.3.1 -1.
4.2.6.3.2 Malaria and Encephalitis
The measures for control of mosquito vector diseases in the construction zone are the
following:
4- 19



(a)  Medical screening of all workers at time of employment, and annual medical
examinations of all personnel, carried out by the Construction Contractors (See Table 4.2.6.3. 1-1).
(b) Periodic spraying of all buildings in construction work areas and camps:
(b.1) To prevent insect-borne diseases, mosquito/fly density monitoring and killing activities
have been conducted in all camps and work areas at the Site by Yellow River Central Hospital (YRCH)
and Henan Anti-epidemic Station since 1995. Insecticides made in Germany and Britain were sprayed
indoors, especially inner walls, lobbies, toilets, and rubbish heaps, and quick-acting compound
insecticides were applied outdoors, in particular gardens, places overgrown with grass and weeds,
sewage ditches, drainage ditches, vicinity of dinning halls, open rubbish heaps, and any other external
habitats. Table 4.2.6.3.2-1 shows the activities of monitoring and killing of mosquito larvae in the
construction area in 1995-96. However, this work is done only once per year.
(b.2) The EEMEP's visits to the construction sites in October 1996 showed that the buildings
in these sites were not being sprayed periodically to control mosquito biting, apparently because
YRCH/Anti-Epidemic Stations have not recognized this need. However, this is an important prevention
measure for control of malaria and encephilitis, and one of the present report's recommendations is that
the CCs must do such spraying, sufficiently to control mosquito biting for persons in the buildings, for
example, as least monthly using a persistent pesticide. This need is discussed in Sections 4.2.2 and 7.2.
In summary, to date the data indicate that XP has not resulted in any increase in malaria or
encephalitis incidence in the areas in the construction camps.
4.2.6.3.3 Hemorrhagic Fever
The hemorrhagic fever control program is based on (a) control of density of rats (including
mice) in the control areas, as shown in Figure 4.2.6.3.3-1. In addition to (a) medical provisions by the
CCs (medical screening examination and annual additional examinations for all construction workers
with treatment if needed), the control program includes (b) killing of rats in the construction areas by
YRCH (where the rats are attracted by the food supplies) to maintain rat densities within standards
levels.
Details for (a) (b) are discussed as follows:
(a) Medical Checking: This is carried out once a year on behalf of the CCs by YRCH (See
Table 4.2.6.3.1-1).
(b) Rat Killing in Construction Zone: Monitoring of rat density was conducted by Yellow
River Central Hospital and Henan Anti-epidemic Station in the construction area in 1993. The results
indicated that the density was as high as 30.8%, which was not only higher than the rat hazard-free
standard (3%) in rural China, but also higher than the background value of 16.7% without the project.
The hazard of outbreak of rat-borne diseases is high at such a high density. In this case, a health and
anti-epidemic team, jointly established by Yellow River Central Hospital and Henan Anti-epidemic
Station, carried out a rat killing catnpaign with rat poison in May 1995, which covered all camps at the
Site. The density was monitored and measured at 1.4% thereafter. Rat killing campaigns were again
conducted in November 1995 and May 1996, when the rat density was measured at 0.8% and 0.68%,
both meeting the rat hazard-free standard for rural China. History of rat density variations is as shown
in Figure 4.2.6.3.3-1. Rat killing in the construction zone will be undertaken again in April 1997 by
YRCH.
Inspection of Figure 4.2.6.3.3-1 indicates that the rat killing by YRCH does reduces the rat
density to levels below without project conditions, but it also indicates that not long after each rat killing
campaign the rat density moves upward to levels above the standard, and remains above until the next
rat killing, and indeed is above the standard at this time (Feb. 97). The indication is that the rat killing
must be conducted more frequently than now being practiced by YRCH.
4.2.6.4 Enteric and Other Diseases Control in Construction Zone
The control program here is to maintain sanitary conditions in the construction work and
living areas, including adequate/safe water supply and adequate management of wastes including
liquid wastes (sanitary and industrial) and solid waste (sanitary and industrial). In addition air
pollution must be duly controlled. All of these controls are discussed in Section 4.2.2 on
Environmental Management of Dam Construction.
4-20



4.2.6.5 Diseases Control in Reservoir Region Around Reservoir/ESA
4.2.6.5.1 Diseases Statistics for Region
In 1985 YRCH, in cooperation with related agencies, investigated communicable diseases in
the reservoir area and vicinity, including malaria, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and enteric
diseases, including 53 townships in 8 counties of Shanxi and Henan provinces. Figure 4.2.6.5.1-1
shows investigated counties and townships in the two provinces. Ten years later, in 1995, this activity
was conducted again to see if changes had occurred. As illustrated in Table 4.2.6.5.1- 1, the incidence
of communicable diseases did not change very much and is lower now because of improved sanitary
conditions.
4.2.6.5.2 Malaria and Encephalitis
As noted earlier, if mosquito larval monitoring and disease statistics indicate any increases of
incidence of malaria and/or encephalitis in the region, then ERD/YRCH must investigate whether
this may be due to the hydrologic changes caused by XP and if so, to plan and implement the needed
control measures in cooperation with provincial health departments.
One of the key measures for controlling mosquito bone diseases is periodic monitoring of the
pertinent mosquito species larvae. If the larvae incidence for any of these species is increased, or if
larvae are found for other diseases vector mosquito not formerly found in the area, then monitoring
control measures must be undertaken. The EMO plan to start this larvae monitoring within the next
three months.
The program for control of the mosquito bone diseases in the ESA is shown in Figure
4.2.6.5.2-1.
4.2.6.5.3 Hemorrhagic Fever
The problem is that the XP, unless there are suitable controls, will increase the rat density
and thus the hazard of hemorrhagic fever, in the peripheral zone around the reservoir estimated at 5
kmn from the reservoir. The rat density can be expected to increase in this zone due to (i) the available
of food in the construction zone greatly increases rat density in the zone, and some of these rats will
find their way uphill, and (ii) reservoir inundation will force the rats uphill. It is necessary to protect
families living in the peripheral area, by monitoring the rat density to see whether there are any
significant increases, and if so, to undertake rat killing to reduce the rat density to without project
condition. This measure, as shown in Figure 4.2.6.5.3-1, will be started by EMO within the next three
months.
4.2.6.5.4 Enteric Diseases in RS Villa,ees
The control program here is to maintain sanitary conditions in the RS villages as discussed in
Section 4.2.3. As pointed out in Chapter 5, the Role of the RPDI team of ECIs should be expanded to
cover compliance with EIA stipulations for design, construction, and operation of water supply,
waste management, drainage, and other facilities in RS villages and/or host areas which house
resettler families. This is considered to be the only practicable way to achieve control of this
problem. The enteric diseases control program is described in Section 4.2.3.
4.2.7   Other SEIs
4.2.7.1 Fisheries
Because of its very high silt content, the Yellow River has never had a significant natural
fishery in its freshwater reaches downstream of the Loess Plateau. In the past there has been a valuable
fishery in the estuary and coastal areas which was dependent on fresh water and nutrients provided by
the river. Although there are little available data on this fishery, the available information suggests that
its importance has declined over the past several decades. The present situation is summarized below.
4.2.7.1.1 Riverine Fishery
(a) Capture Fishery
Although the Yellow River is a major watercourse it has never been of significance as a fishery
resource simply because the river is much too muddy to support any significant commercial populations
of fish. Additional problems include extremely low flows in some years, increasing levels of pollution,
and changes in flows and scouring subsequent to construction of Sanmenxia. As a result the numbers of
families depending on the riverine fishery livelihood in the reaches below Xiaolangdi dam has been
4-21



relatively small and the catch per unit effort appears to have declined steadily since the 1950s (Table
4.2.7.1-1). Even in the towns and cities along the river the large majority of the population are occupied
in full time agriculture and other landbased pursuits. Only 2% of the population engages in fishing and
this is on a part time basis. The productivity of the natural fishery is so small that official statistics are
not kept.
The Xiaolangdi project will result in some increases in low flows and in less turbid water
during the dry season of the year (Tables 4.2.7.1-2, 3 and 4), but is not likely to have a significant
adverse impact on the existing freshwater fishery. The impact, if any, should be positive.
(b) Aquaculture
Aquaculture, on the other hand, is relatively well developed on both banks of the river and is
much more important to the economy than the natural fishery. According to unofficial statistics there
are 441,000 mu of fish ponds along the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the annual yield is
approximately 6.6 million kg. This is some 5% of the agricultural output for the same area.
The Xiaolangdi Project has the potential of significantly improving opportunities for fish pond
aquaculture by ensuring a firm water supply during the dry season. There is particular potential for
expansion of this important activity in the areas near the river where land elevation is below that of the
river, where water could be easily supplied to the ponds by gravity. An alternative is for improved use
of groundwater. Evaluation of the potentials for such increased aquaculture production would require an
investment in the order of 150,00 yuan for the planning study at the feasibility level as noted in Section
5.3. It is now estimated that an investmnent of approximately 8,000 yuan per mu of pond would be
required for pond development, which could result in a meaningful benefit both in economic (a net
return of 1,500 yuan/mu/year) and social terms.
4.2.7.1.2 Estuarine Fishery
While in the past the estuary reportedly supported an important fishery, it has been greatly
depreciated over the past century because of decreasing river flows into the estuary, even zero flows
sometimes in the dry season, as irrigation and urban/industrial withdrawals and levels of pollution have
steadily increased. There can be little doubt this has resulted in serious impairment of the estuarine
fishery potential. The impact of XP is not expected to be significant. It will be positive to the extent that
river fresh water flow actually reaches the estuary. This may be small, however, because of steadily
increasing demands for abstraction/use of the river water for other purposes.
4.2.7.1.3 Coastal Fishery
For the same reasons noted above the fishery in the coastal waters off the mouth of the Yellow
River should not be significantly affected by the Xiaolangdi Project. Although there will be a
considerable reduction in flow volume to the sea during the month of October, the spawning period for
most important commercial species is between April and July when flows will not be less than under
natural conditions and may possibly be higher.
4.2.7.1.4 New Reservoir Fisherv
The Xiaolangdi reservoir will be operated in a manner which will permit settling out of silt and
formation of a relatively clear water body during the period from October to June. Possibilities for fish
production in the clear water zone are currently being investigated. Because the relatively cold water
temperature throughout much of the October through June period, however, it is unlikely that any
valuable commercial fishery will be possible. It may be possible, with special management methods, to
introduce/utilize species which would support sport fishing. If so this could contribute to the
development of the recreation/tourism potential in the area. This potential is to be explored in the
proposed follow-up study on the feasibility of establishing a recreational operation in and around the
new reservoir (See Section 5.3).
4.2.7.2 Liandi Cofferdam
The overall XP plan includes the Liandi cofferdam, which is located 5 km downsteam from the
Main Dam. This cofferdam was completed in March 1993 and resulted in changes in the flow in the
Liandi river (a branch of the Yellow River), particularly a decrease in flow volume north of the
cofferdam. This resulted in (i) reduction in the valuable riverine fishery at Jiyuan, (ii) impairment of
drinking water supply, and (iii) reduction in irrigation water supply causing a 20% decrease in summer
4 - 22



wheat yield in the Potou Xiang and Jili District south of the cofferdam. To compensate for these losses
YRWHDC utilized special measures to increase the water supply for the fishery and provided funds for
compensating for cropping losses.
4.2.7.3 Water Ouality
4.2.7.3.1 Downstream Water Quality Effects by Construction
River water monitoring results from the Mengjin Bridge, Huayuankou, Gaocun, and Lijin
Hydrometric Stations during 1992 to 1996 are shown in Table 4.2.7.3.3-1. These indicate that all the
parameters meet the Category III surface water quality standards as included in national standards
(Table 4.2.7.3.1-1), except that nitrite and BOD sometimes exceed the standards, and that cadmium
exceeds the standard during the wet season. These data indicate that the project construction has not
caused any adverse effects on river water quality. When the reservoir is created, the flow discharge will
be enlarged during the dry season, which will improve the water quality in the lower reaches.
4.2.7.3.2 Downstream Water Ouality Effects of Reservoir
The results of the water quality study show that the only significant changes in water quality
parameters due to impoundment will be (i) reduction in downstream silt content (turbidity) in the dry
season discharges, and (ii) decrease in downstream water temperature due to storage of water during the
winter period (Table 4.2.7.3.2-1). The first of these will be very beneficial in controlling river bed
siltation in the lower reaches. The predicted decrease in water temperature of approximately 4.1
degrees C is not expected to have any adverse effect on crops during the irrigation season. This is
because experience in the area in irrigation of crops with groundwater, which has temperatures about
40C lower than the surface water, has not shown any adverse effect on crop yield.
A special study will be completed to determnine the extent and scope of reservoir clearing which
might be required to prevent contamination of reservoir waters subsequent to the flooding of
contaminated areas such as sanitary, hospital, and industrial waste disposal sites.
4.2.7.3.3 Water Ouality Monitoring in Lower Reaches
Taking account of the study findings on water quality, the necessary monitoring program
(Figure 4.2.7.3.3-1) includes periodic monitoring for temperature changes (once per month) and
periodic complete mineral analysis of the downstream river water at several existing downstream
stations. Monitoring of these is done three times per year, once during each of the periods of minimum,
average, and maximum river flow. Analysis should include Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), all major
cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K) and all major anions (HCO3, S04, Cl, NO3) as well as pH, temperature, and
silt content/turbidity, plus any other parameters required by MWR. In addition once yearly analysis will
be made of sediments of the reservoir, river bed, and estuary to monitor accumulations of non-
degradable pesticides and of any toxic heavy metals being mined in the upper river basin. Table
4.2.7.3.3-1 summarizes water quality monitoring by YRWRPB for 1992-1996. This is still the pre-
EIA/92 monitoring without adjustment to meet EIA/92 requirements. This modification should be made
immediately.
4.2.7.4 Land Accretion in Coastal Area
Due to the deposition of sediments at the mouth of the river the delta increases in extent by
some 25 to 30 square kilometers each year. With the construction of the dam and the trapping of
sediments this process will be slowed to some extent. The Expert Panel for XP Design has evaluated
this impact as follows: "The rate of land creation at the river mouth area depends mainly on the
sediment volumes passing through Lijin. Before construction of the Xiaolangdi Project, the annual
sediment load would be about 0.8 x 109 tons at Lijin in the year 2000. After completion of the
Xiaolangdi Project, the reservoir will retain 10 x 109 tons of sediment and get a benefit of deposition
reduction of 7.8 x 109 tons at lower reaches in 50 years, that will result in a reduction of sediment load
of 2.2 x 109 tons coming to the estuarine area. But in the period of sediment detention of Xiaolangdi
Reservoir, the sediment concentration of diverted flow along the lower reaches will be less than that in
the natural condition. So, reducing sediment load at river mouth in 50 years only amounts 2 x 109 tons,
about 5% of total sediment load running to the estuary area without Xiaolangdi project. The influence
on the sedimentation at river mouth due to Xiaolangdi Project is quite small."
4.2.7.5 Resources to be Inundated
4-23



The area to be inundated covers approximately 278 km2 and will affect downstream land
uses approximately as follows: About 185,100 mu of farmland (4.1 percent of the total cultivated
land), 9.7 percent of the forest land. 12 percent of the forage land, 13 percent of the barren lands, and
10.6 percent of the ponds. The towns, industries, and infrastructure to be displaced include 173
villages, numerous small industrial and mining enterprises. 12 small power station, 267 irrigation
pumping stations, 658 km of irrigation canals, 688 km of highways, 548 km of communication lines,
and 4.59 million m2 of housing.
Reservoir formation will inundate sizable deposits of mineral resources including coal,
bauxite, iron, sulfur, gypsum, phosphorus, and cobalt. The locations of these are shown in Figure
3.2.10-1 of Chapter 3. The only potentially significant loss would be coal since some 332 million
tons will be submerged under the reservoir. However, because the coal lies beneath impermeable
shale strata, some mining of it will remain feasible after inundation.
4.2.7.6 Landslides in Reservoir
Bank slumps and landslides are not numerous in the reservoir areas. The total volume of
earth subject to sliding or caving-in the reservoir area is relatively small, about 105 million tons over
an area of about 5.6 km2. The principal areas of concem are between Hedi and Lingshang villages
near the Banjian River, as well as on the south bank of the river approximately 4 km upstream of the
dam. Although bank slumps and slides are expected to occur from time to time in these areas, no
significant impacts are foreseen because the danger areas have been well identified, and there will be
no villages close enough to be affected.
The freeboard height of the dam has been designed to resist the range of wave heights that
would be generated by the maximum predicted landslide into the reservoir. The design was based on
surge tests performed to simulate slump/slide conditions. The results indicate that (a) the maximum
height of surge due to landslides at 180 m cofferdam water level is 4 m, the cofferdam crest level is
set at 185 m in the present design, thus meeting the safety requirements; (b) when the reservoir water
level is at 275 m, the maximum height of surge is I m, the dam crest level is set at 281 m, which,
plus a 1.2 m breast wall, will prevent dam flooding by surge; (c) the maximum height of surge will
be 4 m at 275 m along the full length of the reservoir, considering that the dangerous areas have been
identified and that there are no settlements in the affected areas, no significant effects should result
from any bank slumps or landslides.
4.2.7.7 Reservoir Seepage
The project design includes a rigid concrete cutoff wall and single-row grouting curtains
which are intended to cut off possible reservoir seepage. The main dam cutoff wall is 80 m upstream
of the dam axis. This wall is 438.6 m long and 1.2 m wide, covering a total surface area of 21,800
m2. The maximum depth is 82 m. The wall body penetrates into the core by 12 m, with 20 m at the
ends connected with the core. Reinforcing cages are arranged in the upper 18 m partion of the wall.
The curtain line is placed 80 m upstream of the dam axis, and connected with the cutoff wall in the
river course. Because the foundation level of the declined core tends to increase toward the river
banks and transits to the vertical core, the curtain line approaches and finally goes in parallel with the
dam axis before it extends 4 m further upstream.
The left rock mass is thin and weak, where the water release and power generation structures
are located. This is the critical location for seepage around the dam. To achieve effective seepage
control, grouting holes are used which penetrate sufficiently deep into the bedrock to prevent any
significant seepage. Also, water release and power generation structures are concentrated in the area
between the left abutment and the saddle dam. To control the seepage water pressure in the vicinity
of tunnels downstream of the curtain line, the curtain is designed to be as deep as 150 m.
The massive right rock mass is not susceptible to seepage around the dam. However, there
are many faults on the right bank, and there are zones of high permeability of considerable depth on
both sides of the faults. All these require special curtain treatment. To plug the fissures in the rock
surface of the core foundation, to achieve better curtain grouting performance, and to avoid seepage
failure in line with the surface of the core foundation, consolidation grouting holes are arranged in
the full bottom width of the core. These holes are vertical to the bed rock surface.
4 - 24



The above mentioned treatment measures will ensure that seepage from the reservoir will not
be a problem.
4.2.7.8 Reservoir Area Clearing
4.2.7.8.1 Scope of Work
For ensuring safe operation of the reservoir, controlling water quality pollution, protecting
public health of the downstream population, and making full use of the multipurpose benefits of the
project, necessary reservoir clearing will be carried out prior to reservoir filling. According to the
project construction schedule, reservoir clearing activities will be completed in three phases, as follows:
Phase I involves the areas to be inundated below El 180, covering a total of 79.29 km2, including 35.06
km2 in Jiyuan, 10.57 km2 in Mengjin, and 33.66 km2 in Xinan. Phases II and III cover the areas to be
inundated at El 180-275 m.
4.2.7.8.2 Clearing for Usual Dam Proiect
The usual clearing program for reservoirs in China, following government regulations, includes
the following components:
(a) Removal of Structures: All houses/dwelling caves and living amenities in the reservoir area
will be removed down to ground level. Any unsalvageable but floatable materials will be incinerated in
situ. Any power supply, telecommunications and public address line poles will be removed. Dykes and
dams obstacling navigation will be destroyed by blasting or removal, with the any remainder not being
higher than 0.5 m above the ground.
(b) Sanitary Clearing: Any wastes in toilets, septic tanks, livestock houses, rubbish heaps and
methane pits will be removed out of the reservoir area, or otherwise deeply buried after solarization for
50 days in the event of failure due to one reason or another. Any tombs made in the past 15 years will be
relocated out of the reservoir area or bumed in situ. Each will be disinfected using 0.5-1 km quicklime.
Those made more than 15 years ago will be handled as agreed with the owner. Such places as hospitals
and veterinary stations, which cause toxicity or serious pollution, will be managed as required by
health/epidemic and environmental protection authorities.
(c) Clearing of Forest: This part of clearing mainly involves continuous forestlands or sparse
trees. Trees will all be cut and removed out of the reservoir area. Any remaining stumps will not be 0.3
m higher than above the ground. Any floatable materials such as unusable straw and branch will be
incinerated in situ prior to the reservoir filling.
The estimated costs for clearing for Phases I, II, III, assuming the usual program as described
above, are shown in Table 4.2.7.8.2-1.
4.2.7.8.3 Clearing for XP
The clearing problem for XP is quite different from usual because of the fact that the Yellow
River is heavily silt laden (highest in world), hence much if not most of the reservoir area will quickly
be covered with a thick layer of mud which should completely protect the water above from
contamination from ground sources. Accordingly the XP Expert Panel on Environment and
Resettlement (Ref. 201.5) recommended that a special study be carried out to determine the clearing
program which will be appropriate for XP because in the judgment of the EEMEP, it is very likely that
such study will show that the clearing program costs can be greatly reduced. The TOR for the proposed
special study are given in Section 6.3.
4.2.7.9 Rare S2ecies and Special Habitats
4.2.7.9.1 Introduction
Figure 3.2.9-1 of Chapter 3 shows the existing situation in the reservoir region on precious eco-
resources in the reservoir region.
4.2.7.9.2 Rare Species and Special Habitas
There are a number of rare and protected species in the reservoir and surrounding area. These
include the giant swan, cygnet, mandarin duck, giant salamander, otter, and musk deer as well as golden
vulture and other birds of prey.
Waterfowl will be the only species of birds affected directly by the reservoir and depending
upon reservoir regulation. Suitable habitats should become established around the reservoir similar to
those presently existing along the river banks. Some increase in waterfowl populations may be possible
4-25



provided pressure from hunting or habitat destruction does not increase. Giant salamander, otter, and
musk deer are found in relatively remote habitats in the headwaters of small streams and forested
rugged terrain outside of the area to be flooded, and will not be affected directly by the project.
Resettlement is planned in urban areas and areas which are already dedicated to agriculture.
Intensification of development in such areas should not affect areas critical to these species. The
reservoir will not flood any nesting sites of raptors as these are mostly in high cliffs above the reservoir.
4.2.7.9.3 Eco-SwanRs
(a) Existing Situation
All valuable wetlands and wildlife reserves are beyond the area affected by the reservoir. A
number of them however are found along the downstrem reaches and in the delta of the Yellow River
(Figure 3.2.9-1 of Chapter 3). The marshlands in the old course of the Yellow river and those near
Liuyuankou are internationally recognized and important for large numbers of migrating waterbirds. As
these are not contiguous with the river and do not depend upon it for their water supply or regulation,
they should not be adversely affected.
The downstream areas and estuary delta were included in the first group of national protection
wetlands as announced in 1995. The total surface area is 153,000 ha, including 113,720 ha land (74.3%)
and 39,280 ha water (25.7%, including shallow sea and fresh waters). In this natural reserve there live
such protected animals as grus japonensis, gray crane, white stork, giant swan, golden eagle, giant
bustard, accipitridae, tattle, wild goose, gull, and mandarin duck.. The protected plants include wild
bean, natural robinia pseudoacacia forests, natural willow forests, natural reed marshes, and seepweed.
Distribution of these plants is as shown in Figure 3.2.9-1 of Chapter 3.
As noted in Chapter 3, zero flow events occurred in the lower reaches during 18 of the 24-year
period from 1972 to 1995, with a total duration of 499 days or 27.7 days per year. The maximum
duration lasted 122 days. Such events are seasonal, generally occurring during the February to May dry
season. In the case of such an event, there is no vertical groundwater recharge, resulting in local water
table reduction. However, some river runoff and rain are retained in the river course, and in the low-
lying ponds and depressions on both banks. Hence zero river flow causes little effect on the wetlands in
the delta. Plants in this reserve are predominantly salt-resistant species. The mineral concentration of the
groundwater will be increased in the short run, but the increase will not be adequate to pose significant
effects on the plants here. No adverse impacts will be subsequently caused on the habitats and migration
zones of birds.
The reservoir will increase the water discharge during dry seasons, mitigate the zero flow
instances in the lower reaches, and result in improved water availability in the estuarine delta. Thus the
XP will be helpful to some extent for the existence and development of the wetlands here.
The existing wetland reserves in Wuli, Weifang, and Shouguang counties in the delta will not
be threatened as the dam will release more water in periods when flows are typically low. The impact on
water levels, water availability, and coastal habitats is not likely to be significant, and any such impacts
will be positive.
(b) Proposed SRecial Study
A number of special studies are proposal for evaluating attractive potentials whereby the XP
can effectively contribute to enhancement of environmental values in the region. One of these is a
proposed study, discussed in Section 5.3, to evaluate the potentials for including in XP a component
for improving the wetlands in the lower basin region.
4.2.7.9.4 Forest Eco-Values
The reservoir area and the construction zone are both located in hillyland where there is a
long history of cultivation. Original forests have been all destroyed, without little meaningful forest
remaining. The affected lower reaches belong to the North China Plain most of which is cultivated
land. Vegetation is secondary shrubs even in the limited low-mountain and hillyland areas, without
any significant natural forests. However, as noted in Section 6.3, a special study is recommended for
evaluating the feasibility of reestablishing some forest over the reservoir as part of a purposed
recreational park.
4.2.7.10 Global Environmental Issues
4 -26



4.2.7.10.1 Salient Issues
The salient issues are earthwarming ozone depletion, and biodiversity. These are discussed as
follows:
(a) Earthwarminz
The XP will have a significant effect on the global warming situation in that the hydropower
generated will significantly reduce the national need for generating electricity from coal. This is
especially important in view of China's position as the leading coal-burning country in the world.
The generation of hydroelectricity by Xiaolangdi will be equivalent to the use of 1.9 million tons of
coal per annum, which would otherwise be burned. This is equivalent to saving emission of 4.6
million tons of carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming, of 33,000 tons of sulfur dioxide
which contribute to acid precipitation on a regional scale, and of 18,700 tons nitrogen oxide which
contribute to photochemical smog in the region. It will eliminate the management of 534,000 tons of
waste residues per year. China presently produces 1,900 million tons of carbon dioxide per annum
(10 percent of the global emissions). The XP hydropower generation will amount to about 0.4 percent
of total national electricity needs, and will reduce use of coal for generating power on a national basis
by about 0.6 percent.
(b) Ozone Deletion
The XP should not result in any significant effect on the global ozone depletion problem.
(c) Biodiversity
The XP will not result in impairment of any precious ecological resources in the EIA, hence
will not result in any adverse effect on biodiversity. All of the ESA is a "humanized" area with little
remaining precious ecology except for some wetlands in the lower portion of the lower basin. The XP
is not expected to result in any changes in these (See Section 4.2.9.3) except that a special study is
proposed (Section 6.3) for evaluating the wetlands situation and for determining whether XP should
include an extra component for enhancing the wetlands.
4.2.7.10.2 International Environmental Azreements
Annex 4.2.7.10-1 is a listing of some 20 international environmental agreements in which
China is participating. Review of these with respect to effects of XP indicates that the XP will not
result in any effects which are inconsistent with these agreements. In particular the XP will contribute
to lessening earthwarming inputs from China by reducing China's use of coal for power production.
4.2.8  Proiect Benefits
4.2.8.1 Flood Control
4.2.8.1.1 Changes in River Hvdrologv
Changes in the River hydrology resulting from the Project are shown in Figure 4.2.8.1.1-1.
This shows the monthly variation in level of Xiaolangdi Reservoir, and Figure 4.2.8.1.1-2 shows the
monthly discharge from the Dam at Xiaolangdi for average and design conditions. The significance
of the XP is that it will, for the first time in history, enable effective control (in combined operation
with Sanmenxia and other control works already built) of the Yellow River in its lower reaches and
thus make possible the great benefits which are discussed below and summarized in Section 4.2.9.1.
4.2.8.1.2 Effectiveness of Flood Control
The XP, above all else, has the objective of achieving effective control of frequent serious
and dangerous flooding of the entire lower basin occupied by some 80 million people and associated
agriculture and industry. This critical need has existed for centuries, and has progressively become
more and more critical as population, urbanization, agriculture, and industry have all markedly
increased in recent decades and as the lower basin's levee protection system has been made
increasingly vulnerable by river siltation. The Samnenxia Project was intended to fill this gap, but the
record shows that Sanmenxia is far from enough and that XP is critically needed.
The combined flood regulating operation of Xiaolangdi Reservoir with Sanmenxia, Luhun,
and Guxian reservoirs will lower the 1: 1,000 year flood peak to 22.500 m3/s at Huayuankou, and
enable control without using the Beijindi Detention Basin (See Figure 4.2.8.1.2-1). Floods of 22.000
m3/s at Huayuankou can be reduced to less than 10.000 m3/s, which greatly increases flood control
safety along the lower reaches and mitigates losses on flooded land. The Xiaolangdi Reservoir can
4 -27



also effectively cut down the flood peak of one in 10,000 years to less than 27.350 m31s at
Huayuangkou, which mitigates the menace of flood in the lower reaches and reduces the probability
of flood storage operation of Sanmenxia Reservoir from once in 10 years to once in 100 years.
In summary, the XP will change the overall existing system of flood protection in the lower
basin from a once/60 year flood to a once/1,000 year flood.
4.2.8.1.3 Flood Forecasting and Emergency Response (See Figures 4.2.8.1.3-1 and 2)
A properly planned flood control system includes not only construction and operation of
physical flood control works, but also a system for Flood Forecasting and an Emergency Response on
what to do in the event of an actual flooding emergency. These are discussed below.
(a) Flood Forecasting
The YRCC Flood Forecasting System (FFS) is believed to be among the most advanced for
major rivers in the world. Such forecasting is especially important for the Yellow River because the
rapid confluence time of flows which create floods in the lower basin. The Hydrological Bureau of
YRCC is responsible for managing the hydrometric station network in the Yellow River basin,
including hydrometry, flood condition reporting, and flood forecasting. The overall basin is divided
into five survey area offices operated by the Hydrological Bureau, which, supported by prefectural
and provincial agencies, furnish the salient information for computer processing by the Hygrological
Bureau. At the present time these communications are carried out by use of (i) the national
telecommunications system, (ii) short-wave radio transmitters and receivers at the key hydrological
stations, and (iii) a three-level radio network for the survey area along the middle reaches, for
supporting the above-mentioned communications.
The flood forecasting procedure comprises two components, namely (i) hydrological
forecasting and (ii) meteorological forecasting (including long-, medium-, and short-term forecasting.
The medium-term forecasting predicts rainfall for the coming 10 days, and the short-term forecasting
for the coming 3 days. The flood forecasting, based on the meteorological forecasting, is focused on
the lower basin region below Sanmenxia and also on floods in the north section of the main stem and
the tributary Weihe River. The predictions are for peak flows, time of their occurrence, flood
hydrograph, volume, and water level. The forecasting procedures for the lower basin include warning
forecasting, rainfall runoff forecasting, and flood forecasting. All of these make optimal use of
computer technology.
(b) Flood Emereencv Response System.
Figure 4.2.8.1.3-1 shows the organization of YRCC's Flood Emergency Response System
(F/ERS), which has been developed over the past 40 years. This is the result of much experience over
the past several hundred years in protecting against flows in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.
This has focused on the salient problem of organizing the population at risk into "shock brigades" to
combat flood emergencies. The saying along the channel of the Yellow River is that "dikes are
valueless without people to take care of them" The achievement made in past decades in combating
many flood emergencies not only owes much to the engineering contribution in dikes and control
gates, but equally to the people-based forces for flood protection, which have developed the
capability for organizing swifty and knowing what to do. YRCC records indicated that a complete
setup has been formed for organizations at all levels to carry out the emergency work, including a
system of command posts and specialized units needed for coordinating the inputs of all combat
mechanisms.
Figure 4.2.8.1.3-2 furnishes additional details, including information on flood forecasting and
public warning activities related to emergency flood combat operations. At present, as part of the
planning for the Xiaolangdi Project, YRCC is working on further strengthening the F/ERS by
reorienting the entire system to be computer-based. This computerization is of great importance
because of the need for obtaining prompt decision from the higher authority, including the State
Council, on making the kinds of difficult and painful decisions that must be urgently made at critical
moments for optional flood combat operation, including "which areas to let flood in order to protect
other areas with higher priority protection need." This instant availability of a unified coordinated
command center is of most importance for ensuring that all agencies and all people will be willing to
4 28



work together effectively, taking into account their divergence of interests that have become
increasingly apparent over the past several decades due to profound social changes, including
intensive urbanization and industrialization.
4.2.8.2 Ice-Run Control
Ice jams in the river frequently cause flooding and result in loss of life and property damage.
The situation is managed now mainly by releasing water from Sanmenxia Reservoir to break the
jams, but the capacity of Sanmenxia Reservoir is only 1.8 billion m3, limiting the ability to control
the ice run hazard.
The combined operation of Xiaolangdi and Sannenxia Reservoirs will relieve, if not
eliminate, the ice-jam and flood menace along the lower reaches. The combined operation will make
it unnecessary to store water for ice run control in Sanmenxia Reservoir in 70 percent of the years
because this role can be undertaken by Xiaolangdi Reservoir. This will reduce siltation in Saumnenxia
Reservoir and increase winter energy output of the Sarmenxia hydroelectric plant,
4.2.8.3 Silt Regulation
The lower reaches of Yellow River have been continuing to accumulate silt, requiring higher
and higher dikes with increased hazards of breaching each year. The effect of Xiaolangdi will be to
stabilized the downstream riverbed for a period of at least 20 years. This would defer the cost of
raising the dikes, and allow other solutions to be developed. The economic benefit (at 1991 prices)
has been estimated at Y 1.06 billion.   With respect to downstream siltation, it should be noted that
XP will control this problem for a period of some 20 to 25 years following completion of XP
construction. However, XP is only the first of three additional major dams to be built on the main
Yellow River stem, with the second at Quikou, upstream of XLD, and the third in-between at
Longmen, and the three together will control siltation for about 100 years from 2001. In this 100-year
period it is expected that the upstream soil erosion in the Loess Plateau will been put under control so
that the overall situation will become stabilized.
4.2.8.4 Water SuRDlv
(a) Irrigation
The irrigation areas to be supplied by the Xiaolangdi Reservoir are both around the reservoir
itself and downstream along the course of the River. The areas around the reservoir totaling
approximately 330,000 mu, will help solve the resettlement problem. The irrigated areas downstream
will total 33 million mu, representing a large increase over the 5-10 million mu that can be irrigated
with the water presently available. Xiaolangdi will remarkable improve irrigation water supply and
economic conditions for thousands of farm families.
(b) Municipal and Industrial Demand
The municipal and industrial demand for water in the lower reaches is expected to reach
about 3 billion m3 by the year 2000. This can be fully satisfied by the XP.
4.2.8.5 Surface and Groundwater Balance
At present, industry and agriculture in some of the downstream areas depend on
groundwater. Excessive groundwater pumping is resulting in serious reduction of groundwater levels.
Without Xiaolangdi, the situation can be expected to get worse as the river flow continues to decline
with increasing demand in the irrigation season. The XP presents the opportunity to reduce the
pressure on the groundwater resources. A special study is proposed to evaluate this problem in order
to prepare a program for overall water utilization which will represent an optimal balance in use of
these two water supply sources. This is described in Section 6.3.
4.2.8.6 Electricity Generation
The total installed capacity of the Xiaolangdi hydroelectric plant is 1,800 MW, with an
annual average energy output of 5.4 billion kWh. The plant location is central among the cities that
would be served, including Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xinxiang, and Sanmenxia. This will be a new
power source for Henan Province and will enhance economic and socioeconomic development in the
region.
4 - 29



Hydropower is a renewable energy resource and the plant will not pollute the environment.
An equivalent thermal plant would use 1.9 million tons of coal annually and release 33,000 tons of
sulfur dioxide, 18,700 tons of nitrogen oxide, and 534,000 tons of residue.
4.2.9  Other Evaluations
4.2.9.1 Environmental Economics
The purposes of the Environmental Economic Analysis are three, (i) to ensure that all
environmental losses to result from the project are included in the benefit/cost analysis, (ii) to review
the distribution of benefits between different groups of people as related to relative affluence (will
the project make "the rich richer and the poor poorer"?), and (iii) to assess the impact on the project's
overall benefit and cost ratios, which result from including EPMs in the overall project as compared
to not including the EPMs, in order to show that including the EPMs does not impair the project
benefit and cost relationship.
(a) Inclusion of Environmental Losses in Economic Analysis: Review of the XP Economic
Analysis by the EIA Team indicates that all known environmental losses (and/or gains) have been
included in the analysis, including costs for resettlement, value of inundated properties and mineral
resources, etc.
(b) Proiect Beneficiaries: As emphasized, XP is, first and primarily, a flood protection
project with the objective, for the first time, in history, of protecting the lower basin people and
related agriculture, settlements, and industry from frequent devastating flooding. This protection
applies equally to all people in the lower basin.
The second main benefit of XP is irrigation. This is focused on improving the livelihoods of
the rural population. The third major benefit is hydropower, and while this will go mainly for urban
and industrial uses, these uses are widely distributed among all population affluence levels in the
sense that he rural poor who move to cities need jobs in industry and need electrification of their
homes.
The total XP benefits will therefore be well shared by the nonaffluent population in the lower
basin.
(c) Imoact of EPMs on Proiect Benefit and Cost: The EIA/92 report included a comparison
of project costs versus benefits for two conditions, with and without inclusion of costs of the
specified EPMs (meaning environmental protection measures beyond what is included in
conventional/pre-EIA project planning). This indicated that the overall benefit/cost ratio with EPMs
included was approximately 1.44, and without the EPMs approximately 1.33, representing and
improvement of about 8 percent gain in the benefit/cost ratio. The RPDI is now updating the project's
economic analysis including reestimation of the information presented above.
4.2.9.2 Environmental Laws
Table 4.2.9.2-1 has been prepared to summarize the environmental laws and regulations of
PRC that apply to XP, and to indicate how these have been duly considered and complied with in
planning and implementation of XP. In addition, Table 4.2.9.2-2 shows the applicable laws and
regulations for the XLD/RS program and how these have been complied with.
4.2.9.3 Public Participation
4.2.9.3.1 Introduction
Public participation has become an important part of the EIA. The purpose of public
participation is to allow due and objective consideration of public opinions on the project planning and
implementation, and to improve environmental decision making by making full use the public
judgment. Public participation is a two-way information transmission system which should be
incorporated into the project planning from the very beginning. This provides the best way for
managing problems with which the public is seriously concerned.
Of the various environmental issues included in the XP/EIA, the question of Public
Participation is most important for the issue of Resettlement (RS). For this reason, the RS Team, in
developing the RS plan, has given particular attention to considering the opinions/wishes of the affected
resettler families and of the affected host communities. In most developing countries (DCs) the RS
planning is carried out by the Project Proponent together with the responsible governmental agencies
4-30



with the assumption that government officials give adequate consideration to the real needs of the
affected villagers. The experience of the DCs in general has shown that this is not enough, and that the
RS planning process must include some direct consultation with the affected villagers.
4.2.9.3.2 Overall Public Participation Program
Public participation of the affected people has been carried out included mainly by means of
media propagation, public lectures, consultation with government officials including grass roots
officials and with local residents, distribution of questionnaires, and direct interview with villagers. The
detailed tabulation on all this work is included in the present report as Supplemental Annex 4.2.9.3-1.
This is part of Volume II which comprises all of the supplemental annexes prepared for ElA/97.
The information given in Supplemental Annex 4.2.9.3-1 is summarized here in Figure 4.2.9.3- 1.
This shows that the overall Public Participation program, carried out over the period 1986 to 1997, has
been intensive, with a total of some 480 activities comprising meetings, reporting, consultations, field
visits, field surveys, and interviews with local villages.
4.2.9.3.3 Public Participation in RS
The public is of course generally concemed about all significant many issues involved in
planning/implementing major projects. For major dam/reservoir projects, as noted above, the major
concern is usually that of Resettlement. For this reason, the RS Team, in developing the RS plan, has
given particular attention to considering the opinions/wishes of the affected resettler families and of the
affected host communities. For these reasons the RS Team's work plan included direct consultation with
the affected villagers, as summarized in Figure 4.2.9.3-2. This included asking resettlers from household
to household for their opinions on resettlement destinations and resettlement programs. This part of
pubic participation involved some 173 village committees, 30 xiangs (townships) in the flooded 8
counties, including such activities as 152 public lectures, 500 interviews with villagers, and 50,000
questionnaires (80% return rate). These activities have allowed resettlers to understand the overall
project and its resettlement components, and also to express their opinions, recommendations, and
requirements. The results indicate that most resettlers are willing to move and are satisfied with the
resettlement planning. These recommendations and requirements served as a valuable guide in
formulating the detailed RS plan.
The work plan also included numerous discussions with government officials at the village
level as well as with officials at the higher township, county, prefecture, provincial, and national levels.
Thus the RS plan as developed is considered to be a "mix" of inputs from all levels, bottom to top and
top to bottom. including adequate consideration of resettler family wishes. In preparing the RS plan, the
guiding principle has been to ensure the resettlers that their new housing facilities and work place
facilities are planned to give a standard of living at least equal to their without-project conditions and in
addition to enable them to share in the overall project benefits. To ensure that the levels of
improvements/compensation to be carried out in project implementation are fair and adequate, the RS
plan includes formulation and execution of written agreements with the local officials concemed,
including the village level. Also continuing monitoring is carried out to check on this, including periodic
surveys and interviews directly with the affected population. In addition resettlers hove access to the
local RS offices for inquiring into any subjects of interest, including problems of grievances and
complaints. Also, resettlers can go to the court pursuant to the "Administrative Law of Suit" when they
think the decisions made by resettlement offices or govemment at various levels are unacceptable.
More detailed infornation on Public Participation in RS planning and implementation is given
in Section 4.2.3 ("Environmental Review of Resettlement").
4.2.9.3.4 Public Particivation by EIA Team/EMO
The work of the EIA team which prepared EIA/1992 included a large number of
consultations with government officials and individuals throughout the ESA, covering all of the
ElA/SEIs including natural resources, agriculture, urban settlements, industries, water supply, waste
management and pollution, etc., as well as resettlement. Thus the EIA team members were able
themselves to contribute significantly to the overall public participation process. This effort has been
continued by the EMO, established in 1994 and moreover the Expert Panel has reviewed the issue of
4 -31



public participation with the EMO and other XP officials concerned at the Panel's meetings held
every six months since October 1994.
4.2.9.4 Risk Management
The very detailed planning for XP covering a period of several decades, included preparation
of a comprehensive EIA in 1992 which delineated the various SEIs involved with XP and the various
specific EPMs which must be incorporated into the subsequent steps of detailed project design,
project construction. and project operations. Accordingly it is concluded that the overall project has
given due attention for the Risk Parameter in project planning and implementation to date. This is
shown in Figure 7.1-1, which presents a summary of EIA/97 with respect to all SEIs, and these SEIs
do also cover all significant risk issues. Figure 7.1-1 shows that due diligence has been given to
evaluation of and protecting against all significant risk issues, so that, assuming all of the EPMs
given in the EIA are duly carried out, the XP is in good shape in terms of risk management.
The assessment made in the present report, on how well the EIA/92/EPMs have been carried
out by XECC, shows, because of the pioneering nature of XP in term of incorporating such EPMs
into major dam project planning and implementation, that the XECC's environmental performance
has been getting underway and established during the Loan I period, and that considerably move
attention must be given to certain EPMs including those applicable for controlling dam construction
operations and for ensuring a sound RS program. Section 7.2 gives recommendations on
improvements which should be made as part of the Loan 2 Agreement. Assuming this is done, it is
believed fair to say that XP Risk Management will be quite adequate.
4.2.9.5 Environmental MIS
4.2.9.5.1 Review of Overall MIS in Oct. 96
The overall MIS is under development by RO. A recent evaluation of this by the Sociologist
Member of the Expert panel (Dr. K. Connor) (Ref. 203.5) prepared the following summary:
(a) The system (software and hardware) itself is good, but is probably overly complex for the
tasks it performs, largely data storage (mostly a one way flow into the system), display, and budget
management. These are certainly valuable applications, but the system itself is able support more
complex decision making and monitoring activities. The main weaknesses are (i) potential users are
unaware of ways the system (MS and GIS) can facilitate their work, (ii) no progress for sharing
information within and between agencies has been developed, and (iii) system development at
prefecture, province, and county RO offices seems overly ambitious given time, staff and financial
constraints.
(b) Monitorini Systems: A large body of monitoring data is being collected, but little
analysis is done. Competent analysis is critical for the system to serve its early warning function.
Both the monitoring processes, as well as ways the MIS can expedite the work of the responsible
agencies, need much more attention. In addition, it is unclear how the Project plans to use monitoring
data, for example, what will the Project actually do if incomes decline or complaints go unresolved?
(c) Environmental Parameters
The MIS can assist the EMO be a sub-system to manage environmental monitoring field
data. The system would handle the categories of data such as following:
Location                                  Data
Resettlement sites    Water supply, solid waste management, toilets and excreta
management, drainage channels, roads, power supply, clinics,
schools, ect.
Construction sites    Living areas (including water supply, sewage management, solid
waste, drainage); dust control on roads; production areas wastewater
management, noise control, occupation related health and safety
issues, ect.
Details on the environmental information to be included in the sub-system are given in the
Oct. 1996 report of the EEMEP (Ref. 201.5)
4.2.9.5.2 Present Assessment
4-32



One of the most important tasks in the present report or EIA/97 is the Environmental Review
of Resettlement as discussed in Section 4.2.3. To prepare this review if was necessary to obtain
updated information on the RS program, but much of the information now available from RO is not
yet updated despite the fact that RO has an RSJMIS system in use. The recommendation here is that
the RS/MIS group should be given technical assistance is how to use their MIS equipment effectively
for its intended purpose, namely to have reliable updating information available at all times.

Report of Environmental Engineering Member of Expert Panel (EEMEP)
on Resettlement and Environment for YRWHDC/RO
for Panel's Fifth Meeting on 3-15 October 1996
I INTRODUCTION
1.1 Work Program
On 3 October the EEMEP met with Mme. Xi Meihua for Preliminary discussions on
planning and scheduling of the work of the Environment Subpanel. On 4 October the scheduling was
set as given in Annex A, and this schedule was subsequently essentially followed. This included
provisions for the Panel's field visits on 7-9 October also shown in Annex A.
In these discussions the EEMEP recommended that the field visits for the Subpanel on
Environment (SP/E) be separated -from and be longer than the 3-day period allowed for the Subpanel
on RS (SP/RS), but is was fixed that both Sps would cover 3 days but with the Sps separated for the
second and third days.
The work done by the EEMEP included (a) review of the separate reports prepared on
ERD subcontractor prograrns, for RPDI, WRPB, and a brief report on Relics, plus ERD's overall
report, including comments and suggestions (b) participation in Panel and SP/E meetings on 4 to 15
October, with detailed notes and suggestions, (c) participation on the field visits on 7-9 October with
detailed notes and suggestions, (d) on 15-17 October to supplement the work of 3-15 October on
special tasks to assist World Bank/Dr. Daniel Gunaratnam in preparation for this visit to Zhengzhou
in November 1996 on XLD/Loan I. The EEMEP's notes on the Panel/Subpanel work are given in
Anmex B and the notes for the follow-up work by THE EEMEP in Annex F.
1.2  Teclnologv Transfer
The approach used by the EEMEP is intended, inter-alia, to transfer technology in
environmental monitoring to the RO/ERD staff, in recognition that such teclnology involves many
complex technical specialties in the field of environmental engineering. This approach is likc that of
a professor in a university class in which the professor not only lectures but gives homework
assignments and examinations which are graded. The approach has been limited to lecturing (office
and field) and to preparing detailed daily notes which are translated into Chinese the next day and
given to the ERD staff and to Environmental Subpanel members. However, The EEMEP does not
know the extent to which these notes are actually read/studied by the Chinese. Also, for optimal
technology transfer it would be helpful if each ERD/RPDI/WRPB/CYPH participant would prepare
something in writing, to be translated into English, for THE EEMEP to review and comment upon.
If ERD is to achieve its goal of proper monitoring, the business of technology transfer is essential
and The EEMEP recommends that RO/ERD give consideration to the question of how the services
of The EEMEP can best be used for this purpose in future Panel meetings.
1.3  Significance of Fifth Panel Meeting
The Fifth Panel meeting and its reports on RS and Environment are especially significant
in that WB will begin discussions with the Government in November 1996 on XLD/Loan 11 For
this purpose WB/Guna will be looking to the Fifth Panel report to finish him with a summarization
of the overall findings/conclusions/recormmendations of the Panel covering the entire period of the
Panel's operations from the First to the Fifth meeting.

6.   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The work of the RO/ETD is believed to be pioneering for the construction period for major
water resource development projects in China, hence this experience represents valuable guidelines for
use for other projects in China. Some of the "lessons learned" here are already being utilized by
WB/Guna in planning for the Environmental Management Office for the pending Wanjiazhai Water
Transfer Project.
A great deal of progress has been made by the RO/ERD group over the past two years
(since the first Panel meeting) in getting organized and into gear for actual opemtions. Much has been
learned and, now that the WB/XLD/Loan II mission will be visiting in November 1996, it is time now
for RO/ERM to assess its entire experience since the beginning of the RO and to prepare a plan for
achieving needed improvements including improved use of the Environmental Subpanel. The salient
improvements recommended are the following:
(a)   Chanze in Procedure for Manaaement of Construction Zone. Operations, including
(i) requiring the CCs to submit basic drawings and monthly reports, (ii) including the specifics in all
Complaints Notices, (iii) fumishing the CCs with the specific requirements to be carried out by them for
the Chinese Worker Villages in their areas.
(b)    Upgrading of RPDI Surveillance of RS Villages, including (i) delineating RS
house/facilities design criteria to use for checking to see if houses/facilities are being properly built, (ii)
requiring village to appoint a full-time "Village Environmental Management Officer", (iii) preparation
of a manual of guidelines for telling the Officer how to do his work, including monthly reporting, (iv)
training of the Officer in this work (including making and recording weekly CR tests), and (v)
monitoring visits to the village every 2 months for the first year after moving in, then every 4 months.
(c)    Compilation of ApproRriate Standards for Construction Zones and RS Villages, by ERD
et al, to obtain a manual of guidelines on appropriate standards to be utilized in ERD's prograr.,
including and "norms" all pertinent environmental issues. This could be done by for ERD by RPDI. To

CHAPTER 8
TRAINING
8.1    Need for Training
Implementation of WWTP will be a pioneering project for Shanxi Province (and for all of
China) in transbasin diversion of water on a massive scale, for meeting the critical needs for
more water to support continuing growth and development of parched areas of northern
China. Because of the restively high cost of such imported water, it is essential that
conventional practices on water use, waste treatment, water pollution control, and water reuse
be reoriented to achieve an integrated comprehensive program which makes
maximum/optimal use of the precious water for all essential water uses in the service areas
(Taiyuan Service Area for Phase I) including domestic, commercial, industrial, and
agricultural needs, including balanced use of all freshwater resources (local surface water,
local groundwater, and imported water), and including institutional, legal, economic, and
financing as well as engineering aspects. The proposed plan for achieving this is discussed in
ES Chapter 5.
8.2      Recommended Training
In order to achieve this goal a training program is needed to strengthen the capabilities of the
officials involved in WWTP including YRDP, Shanxi Province, and Local Agencies, in the
various new approaches and methodologies which will be utilized. The recommended
training program inlcudes two components:
(a) A specialized training program to be an integral part of the WWTP/Phase I project,
described in the EIA Main Report Chapter 8, for training of selected staff of
participating Provincial and City agencies.
(b) A training program especially for TEPB, because of the many assignments for which
TEPB will have the lead role in preparing/implementing the recommended integrated
plan, to be financed by Technical Assistance grant of $ 2 million (to be piggy-backed
onto the WB Phase I Loan).
8.2.1 Specialized Training for participating Agencies
This program, to cost an estimated $ 438,500, will include training by foreign experts of
selected Chinese personnel who will then conduct training courses at Taiyuan for stuff of
participating agencies, plus a visit by one team to Southern California to study integrated
water use technologies developed there over the past four decades and a visit by another tearn
to the Communicable Disease Center of the USA in Atlanta, Geogia. Details are given in
Figures ES.8-1 and 2.
8.2.2 TEPB Training Program
This prograrn is described in detail in Annex H of the EIA Main Report, and is summarized
here in Figure ES.8-3. This includes provision for establishing a Revolving Fund for assisting
A/4.1.3-2/3



local industries in moving ahead with their own initiative to plan/build/operate more effective
production methods which incorporate water recycling, water reuse, and waste
minimization/clean technologies.
8.3    Value of Training Program
The proposed training program should prove to be one of the most cost-effective components
of the entire WWTP. Its total cost is small, only a very small percentage of total first-phase
investment cost, but this small investment is essential if the precious imported water is to be
wisely used. It is expected that the training program will result in more appropriate planning
decisions on investments in facilities and thus result in savings of tens of millions of dollars
over the Phase I project design life period.

NOTES ON REVIEW OF CULTURAL RELICS PROGRAM
BY EXPERTS PANEL IN OCTOBER 1996
(Notes by Dr. K. Connor) (Ref. 201.5)
1.    Organization
To date, preservation of cultural relics has been confined mostly areas on Henan
province below elevation 180 meters. The panel was unable to get a report from Shanxi
province.
The work of is carried out under the direction of the Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau,
supported by the Archeological Institute, Ancient Buildings Studies, Luoyang Archeological
teams, the Social Science Institute, and teams of university students. The Ancient Buildings
group handles movement and preservation of surface relics, while the Archeological Institute
and university students manage underground relics. Progress and quality monitoring is
supervised by the National Cultural Relics Bureau, with assistance form the Environmental
Resources Office and the Henan Province Social Science Institute.
2.    Progress
2.1    Underaround Relics
The most important relics will be moved, but experts stated that there is neither the
time nor the money to move all the underground relics. Relics are being classified into 3
categories. At present, the budget only cover preservation of the two highest categories. Other
experts currently are evaluating the reports prepared by the project teams to make a final
selection of relics to be moved to a new site. The preservation process for other relics will
focus on classifying, studying, and videotaping relics for future study. They are selecting some
of the more important relics for detailed study.
In Henan province, excavation of underground relics has been completed.
Classification and study are in progress. A progress report has been prepared. Annex 3 contains
a recommended outline and schedule for future reports. the following sites in Henan province
have been excavated:
Location                   Description                Age

Xin'an County
Zhongziping         150 m2                     upper = 4,200
lower = 5000
2.2    Above Ground Relics
The main site of surface relics in Henan province is the approximately 1,000 year old
Xiwo grottos, located on the north bank in Xin'an County. The grottos will be moved to the
A/4.2.4- 1/2



Luoyang Museum. Preparation work has initiated in 1994. Cutting and moving will be
completed by the end of June 1997 and reconstruction by the end of 1997.
3.     Sueeested Outline and Schedule for Future Cultural Relics Preservation Reports
3.1    Comments on Presentation at Panel Meetine
(a) The table "Investment by Year" should show progress for each year since the
beginning of work (1995 is missing) and should indicate cost items (are, for example, costs for
grottos separate from costs for other work/sites?)
(b) The table "cultural relics" should cover all tasks for all sites, all costs, and include
a schedule.
3.2    Report Schedule
A separate report should be prepared by each province. A recommended report
preparation schedule is:
(a) A report should be for Dr. Gunaratnam's visit in November 1996. This report
should cover all the work undertaken to date.
(b) Following the report for Dr. Gunaratuam, reports should be prepared every six
months, for example, 31 July 1997, 30 December 1997, and so on for the life of the project.

CHAPTER 5
ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
5.1   Introduction
51.1   Background
Environmental monitoring is an essential part of the overall environmental program of
the project including its various components. The purpose is to ensure that the EPMs specified in
the EIA will actually be carried out including EPMs applicable to (i) final design; (ii)
construction, and (iii) O&M. The EMO is responsible for management of the overall monitoring
program, including surveillance of monitoring done by various components of the project which
have their own monitoring tasks, for example, dam safety instrumentation/monitoring,
resettlement supervision/monitoring, and disease control supervision. Overall responsibility of
environmental monitoring is with the EMO with assistance from EMO's various subcontractors
and with cooperation from various other agencies. The relationships are as shown in Figure 5. 1- 1.
The XP is a very large scale and very complex project, and incorporation of
environmental monitoring into the project is a formidable job, primarily because such
incorporation is a relatively new practice in China as in virtually all developing countries. In
many respects the environmental monitoring work being done at Xiaolangdi is pioneering for
major water research development projects in China.
The overall monitoring program being conducted by EMO now includes two
components, one for Dam Construction and the other for the Resettlement Program.
5.1.2 Monitoring of the Monitoring
It is important to recognize that the basic environmental monitoring at the construction
camps is to be done by the CCs, not by the ECIs, nor by other ERD subcontractors including
YRWRDB and YRCH. The role of the ECIs and other ERO subcontractors is to "monitoring the
monitoring" by the CCs, and for this purpose each CC must submit a detailed monthly report on
its environmental monitoring work. Similarly, each RS village should appoint an Environmental
Chief, at the working level, to be the day-to-day environmental monitoring and to prepare
appropriate monthly reports.
5.2    Dam Construction Monitoring
5.2.1  Relationship to Enzineering Supervision
EMO is its own agency with its own authorities including environmental monitoring, but
EMO's environmental supervision is also a part of overall project management. For initiating the
monitoring work relating to dam construction, the work of EMO functions through the General
Supervision Office of XECC. This relationship is shown in Figure 5.2-1.
5.2.2  Monitoring Activities
Environmental monitoring for dam construction involves three aspects or "Ms", namely
"Man", "Machine", and "Method".
"Man" means the organizers, commanders, and operators involved in project
construction activities. As the control target, "man" avoids environmental pollution and
deterioration due to inappropriate human activities such as the use of construction authority.
"Man" means fully developing people's initiatives and always maintaining a sense of "protecting
the environment at the Site."
"Machine" includes construction equipment and other facilities. These can pose many
environmental hazards, especially pollution emissions and occupation heath hazards. For
ensuring good environmental quality in the construction area, the Environmental Construction
Inspections need to exercise control of construction equipment in respect of equipment sizing,
adequacy, and operation.
"Method" means the construction organization's construction schemes and methods
adopted during construction. Proper construction organization planning and implementation can
avoid or mitigate environmental pollution and deterioration due to construction activities.
5-1



Therefore one of the monitoring tasks is to help correct construction organization schemes as
needed.
5.2.3  Environmental Construction Inspectors
Dam construction environmental supervision must be carried out in collaboration with
the engineering supervision. Individual environmental supervision engineers, called
"Environmental Construction Inspectors" (ECIs) are made available at the Site. Their
responsibilities include:
(a) Monitoring of CC's Activities: To ensure the CC will comply with all requirements
for EPMs during construction (See Section 4.2.2 for details).
(b) Keeping daily and weekly records and providing regular monthly reports on the
ECI's work.
(c) Preparing drafts of notice to CCs when these are needed to improve CC performance,
to be given to EMO for appropriate action including delivery to the CC through the Engineer
Supervision/Safety Department. Taking part in interim and completion acceptance of any part,
component, or entirety of the works, with focus on checking and seeing to it that the completed.
areas are clean and in good order, that any remaining equipment/materials/rubbish have been
properly removed, and that the ground areas that have been disturbed are properly resurfaced,
and that other needed finalization activities have been duly performed.
Additional details on the work of the work of the ECIs is given in Section 4.2.2.
5.2.4 Recommended Improvements
As noted in Section 4.2.2, considerable improvements are needed in the system for
environmental monitoring of the CCs. These include (i) recognition that the role of the EC[s is
"monitoring of the monitoring", (ii) recognition by XECC that responsibility for environmental
supervision of CCs is with RO/ERO, not with the Engineer Supervisor/Safety Department, and
(iii) requirement for each CC to submit detailed monthly environmental monitoring report.
5.3    Resettlement Monitorinf
5.3.1  Environmental Review of Resettlement (RS)
Section 4.2.3 on Environmental Review of Resettlement describes the salient parameters
involved in environmental monitoring of Resettlement. EPMs are incorporated in the entire
resettlement planning and implementation process, with attention given to land resources, house
construction and household amenities, and community infrastructures including water supply,
power, waste management, roads, schools, and clinics.
5.3.2 Overall Environmental Monitoring
The overall RS environmental monitoring program is intended to include, together with
the provisions of Section 5.3. 1, the following tasks:
(a) Provision of Water Supply for Host Sites: The host village community water supply
system, if utilized, must be strengthened to provide for additional RS needs. Water quality must
meet the sanitary standard for drinking water supply (GB5749-85) as issued by the Ministry of
Health, and water supply quantity must satisfy water demands for population growth and
economic development. Water source protection includes water quality monitoring on regular
basis.
(b) Investigation of Communicable Diseases at Host Sites: To evaluate impacts of RS
on disease incidence, and to plan and arrange for implementation of needed corrective measures.
Also, health and disease control measures are made during transfer of people.
(c)  EIA is required for any resettlement-related projects including water supply
developments, floodplain improvement works, and other facilities, and appropriate
environmental protection measures should be accordingly prepared.
(d) Eco-environmental monitoring is to be carried out in host sites on a regular basis,
ensuring appropriate ecological evolution.
(e) EIA is required for any resettlement-related industries and mines to be newly built or
expanded. All wastes produced by industries and mines must be properly managed in compliance
with relevant standards.
5-2



(f) Protective measures are to be provided for spoil excavation materials resulting from
construction of all buildings and community facilities, house and roads, avoiding additional soil
erosion. Steep slope land reclamation and deforestation are forbidden.
(g) All industries/mines and new residential sites are to be selected to avoid cultural
sites, ancient tombs, and other sensitive points. Otherwise, protective measures are taken to
excavate and protect cultural relics.
(h) Resettlement agencies are to arrange environmental education for resettlers to
understand EPMs and resettlers' role and function in public consultation. Education and
distribution of laws/regulations are to be arranged, including "Law of Environment", "Law of
Water and Soil Conservation", "Law of Wildlife Protection", and "Law of Cultural Relics
Protection", so as to raise the environmental awareness of the public.
(i) Special reports are to be made by xiang and village resettlement staff, mainly
describing any environmental improvements and problems during and after resettlement (see
Table 3.18 for details), and routine reports are prepared to describe the socio-economic
development and environmental effects after resettlement. These are collected and furnished to
provincial/municipal and YRCC resettlement offices by CROs. Also, they are to be included in
the environmental progress reports submitted by the ECIs. Such reports and corresponding
written materials are prepared on a quarterly basis.
5.3.3  Recommended [mprovements
As noted in Section 4.2.3, much more attention must be given to the problem of RS
environmental monitoring. Specific recommendations are made in Section 4.2.3 on what should
be done under Loan 2 provisions so that the monitoring will achieve the goals noted above,
including appointment of an Environmental Chief (working level chief) by each RS village who
will do the basic RS village monitoring with monthly reports. The recommended monitoring
system is shown in Figure 5.2-2. The funding for the Environmental Monitoring Chief should be
furnished by RO/ERO.
5.4    Other Environmental Monitorina
5.4.1  Introduction
In addition to the environmental monitoring described in Section 5.2 and 5.3, the overall
environmental monitoring program includes attention to all other SEIs. These are discussed
below.
5.4.2  Archeological Relics: See Section 4.2.4.
5.4.3  Earthauake Stability
As noted in Section 4.2.5, the Earthquake Stability Design Team has this subject under
continuing evaluation, and the current report of this Team is included in Section 4.2.3. The EMO
should obtain updated reports every six months.
5.4.4  Public Health: See Section 4.2.6.
5.4.5 Riverine Water Oualitv
The recommended cost-effective water quality monitoring program is described in
Section 4.2.7.3, and EMO should ask its subcontractor, YRWRPB, to modify its ongoing
monitoring program to match the Section 4.2.7.3 requirements, or make other arrangements so
this will be done.
5.4.6  Reservoir Area Clearing
A special study is recommended for evaluating this issue, as discussed in Section 4.2.7.8.
5.4.7  Precious Eco-Values
According to the Law of Environment of China, the responsibility for protection of the
wetlands in the lower reaches is with the Physical Resources Protection Department of
Henan/Shandong Environmental Protection Agencies, but monitoring is the responsibility of the
local environmental monitoring stations. Monitoring costs are included in the budget of the local
government, so no additional costs will be required to be supported by the XP. However, EMO
will furnish "monitoring of the monitoring". EMO will get annual monitoring reports from the
local environmental protection agencies in Henan and Shandong. Also, as noted in Section 6.3, a
5-3



special study for evaluation of wetlands is proposed, and this will include assessment of the
wetlands monitoring program.
5.4.8 Flood Control
The current flood control evaluation is given in Section 4.2.8.1. EMO should have this
updated every six months.
5.4.9  Public Participation
Public participation is a continuing process, and Section 4.2.9.3 includes a current
updated report on this task. The EMO should arrange for further updating every six months.
5.4.10 Other SEls
These include subjects not discussed above. These are listed under Section 4.2.7 ("Other
SEIs") and under Section 4.2.8 ("Project Benefits"). These should be reviewed annually.
5.4.11 Recommended Improvements
To date ERO has not got around to giving sufficient attention to the environmental
monitoring needs described in Section 5.4. It is timely now for ERO to begin doing this job.
5.5   Summarized Environmental Monitoring Proaram
The overall Environmental Monitoring Program is summarized in Figure 5.5-1, including
estimated costs.

Environmental Manazement
6.1   Environmental Management Related to Project Stages
The job of the EMO/ERD is to carry out the EMP as specified in the EIA, to
ensure that all EPMs and environmental monitoring will actually be carried out in the
subsequent stages of project implementation. Figure 6.1-1 shows the overall
environmental management job for a project such as XP. Figure 6.1-2 shows the
application of the Figure 6. 1-1 concept for the XP Loan 1 period including evaluation of
performance. Figure 6.1-3 shows needs for continuing EMO attention for the Loan 2
period.
The following summarizes the Environrnental Management program up to 2001:
(a) For the Remaining Construction Period (1997 to 200l
(a. 1) Continuing monitoring surveillance of major SEIS:
Dam construction.
RS design/construction/operation.
Archeological relics management.
Earthquake stability evaluations.
Flood forecasting/warning/preventation system.
(a.2) Evaluation of needs for reservoir area clearing: Special study for
1997.
(a.3) Continuing monitoring/surveillance of other SEIs, namnely 4.2.6,
4.2.7, and 4.2.8.
(a.4) Training (technology transfer) program for staff of ERD/Subs (1997-
99).
(a.5) Special environmental enhancement studies (4.2.11), 1997-1999.
(a.6) Planning, by ERD for EMO functions following completion of
construction (1999-2001).
(b) For Operation of Project Components (1997 to 2001): Continuing
monitoring/surveillance of completed RS villages. Sections 6.2 to 6.5 give
details on how these objectives are expected to be met.
6.2   Environmental Management Activities
6.2.1  Organization of EMO/ERD
Over the period since establishment of RO in 1994, an EMO, called the
Environmental Resources Division (ERD), has become established as a suboffice of the
RO, with responsibility for carrying out the EPMs specified in the EIA including
environmental monitoring. The ERD capabilities comprise the ERD staff per se plus
contractual assistance from four agencies, namely (i) RPDI, (ii) YRWRB, (iii) Yellow
River Central Hospital (YRCH), and (iv) Henan/Shanxi Archeological Institutes (HSAIs).
Details on the above capabilities, including information on assignmnents and
budgets, are given in Figures 6.2-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, as follows:
Figure 6.2-1: Environmental Management Organization Chart

Figure 6.2-8: Henan/Shanxi Archeological Institutes Assignments
6.2.2 Assignments to ERD Staff and Subcontractors
Figure 6.2-1 shows the assignments carried out by ERD by its own staff and its
subcontractors (subs), as related to the discussion of SEIs in Chapter 4. Review of the
Chapter 4 evaluations shows that EMO capabilities, including capabilities of RPDI staff
who worked on EIA/92 and are now in the ERD/RPDI subcontractor group, are
progressively increasing in terms of skills needed for the EMO job, but that (i)
considerable continuing training of these staff is highly desirable to supplement the very
limited training fumished every six months by the EEMEP, and (ii) the ERD needs to
develop/use mechanics for making more effective use of other agencies having pertinent
specialty expertise, for example, on the issue of wildlife. It should be recognized that
ERDIRPDI environmental staff are mainly generalists and when they are confronted with
problems required specialized expertise, they should bring this expertise into the picture.
As shown in Figure 6.2-1, the ERD-cum-Subs performance needs improvement in
a number of ways, as follows:
(a) The performance of the RPDI team on dam construction should be much
improved now that each of the three major CCs will prepare a detailed monthly
report to provide the RPDI team.
(b) The role of the RPDI team, now limited mostly to the dam construction area,
should be expanded to give "equal attention" to the Resettlement Program. The
work on RS by YRWRB is of little value and hardly worthwhile. The RPDI role
should include arrangement for appointment of an Environmental Officer (EO) at
each RS village, funded by ERO, who will prepare monthly reports to the RPDI
team.
(c) The work of the ERD staff and of all subs should be progressively improved
much faster through provision of the extra training noted above. This will include
training of ERD staff in how to make effective use of the expertise of other
agencies as needed, including local EPBs (for example, on precious eco-resources
issues).
(d) The work of the YRWRB as now practiced for the RS program, because it is
limited to visits once every six months, is of little value. Also, it needs
improvement for the dam construction program. The YRWRB work for the RS
villages covers only water supply mineral quality, which is only one of the various
parameters of concern, and even for this visits made only every six months are
hardly worthwhile. The work of environmental management of the RS villages
should be assigned totally to RPDI. The work of YRWRPB should be limited to
(d.1) water quality monitoring of streams in ESA, and (d.2) noise/dust/air
pollution monitoring in dam construction area, to be done every three months, for
monitoring of the monitoring done by the CCs.
(e) Special studies should be undertaken in 1997, arranged by ERD, covering
the following:
(e. 1) Reservoir clearing program (as discussed in Section 4.2.7.8).
(e.2) Environmental enhancement potentials as discussed in Section 6.3.
6.2.3 ERD Reporting
ERD reporting has been geared to match the needs of the Expert Panel, with
reports produced every six months, one month ahead of Panel Meetings. These have
given only limited attention to the recommendations made by the EEMEP.
6-2



The experience to date indicates, as noted in the Panel report for Oct. 96 (Ref.
201.5), that the best procedure is for preparation of reports every six months as follows:
(a)  ERD Overall Report
Activities of ERD Staff
Brief Review of Reports by Subs
(b)  Reports by Subs
RPDI
YRWRB
YRCH
HSAIs
These reports will all be critiqued in detail by the EEMEP, hence are of value for
technology transfer purposes.
6.2.4  Estimated Costs
Estimated costs for administrating EMO/ERD are shown in Figure 6.2-9.
6.3   Follow - Up Studies
6.3.1  Recommended Studies
The EIA/92 report recommended that some additional follow-up studies be
undertaken in order to obtain optional enhancement benefits from the XLD project. None
of these has been needed for the dam construction stage operation but these should be
carried out before dam construction has been completed. The recommended studies
include those for (i) wetlands preservation, (ii) optional water balance, (iii) reservoir
fisheries, (iv) forestry rehabilitation in area around reservoir, (v) use of the reservoir area
as a regional recreational park, and (vi) enhancement of downstream aquaculture. These
are discussed below.
(a)  Wetlands Preservation
The objection here is to evaluate the situation on precious eco-wetlands in the
lower basin, to determine the extent to which these have been impaired by drying up of
the lower Yellow River due to extraction and to flood control, and if these are serious and
if the wetlands are worth it, to recommend the most feasible plan for preservation
purposes.
(b) Optimal Water Balance
The objective here is to make an in-depth evaluation of water use needs in the
lower basin for all purposes over the next two decades, for all purposes including
irrigation, urban, industrial, and other uses, to compare these with supplies available from
surface and groundwater sources, and to develop the optional plan for use of both sources,
particularly with respect to maintaining a stable water table.
(c) Reservoir Fisheries Management
The objective here is to develop a plan for management of the reservoir fisheries
to obtain optional yields for commercial and/or sports fishing, including consideration of
use of introduced species suited to the new reservoir conditions, with use of experience
gained in fisheries from existing dams/reservoirs above XLD.
(d)  Forestry Restabilitation in Reservoir Vicinity
Since the 1970s it has become increasingly recognized in the planning of
dams/reservoirs in developing countries that, because such projects do disturb and impair
existing eco-resources (both by inundation and accelerated encroachment), the project's
overall plan should include provisions for offsetting these impairments by investing in
eco-restoration, especially in reforestation and protection against erosion in the watershed
above the dam. The objective of the study proposed here is to evaluate the situation with
6-3



XLD to determine whether such a reforestation project would be feasible and if so, to
prepare the recommended improvement plan.
(e) Regional Reservoir Recreational Park
Every new rmajor reservoir offers significant opportunities for establishment of a
regional recreational park including provisions for camping, hiking, wildlife study, sport
fishing, etc. This can be especially beneficial to the "ordinary and poor" people in the
region who can scarcely afford to seek recreation elsewhere. The objective here is to
evaluate this potential for XLD to determine whether this is feasible, and if so, to prepare
the recommended plan.
(f)  Downstream Aguaculture
The objective here is to evaluate the existing downstream aquaculture situation,
determine whether it would be feasible for the XLD project to include a component for
enhancing aquaculture, and if so to prepare the recommended plan.
(g)  Additional Special Studies
6.3.2 TORs for Reconmnended Studies
The TORs for the recommended studies are given in Annex 6-1, including tasks,
skills, timeframes, and costs. All of the studies are to be done by selected Chinese experts
in the specialties concerned, and all of the recommended plans should be prepared at the
feasibility level.
6.4   Training of EMP Participants
6.4.1 Training Need
In 1996 an EIA was completed by local Chinese institutes with World Bank
assistance for the pending Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project, a major water resources
development project which, like XLD, involves major environmental implications (Ref
305). This proposes establishment of an EMO for implementing the recommended EMP,
and establishment of an Expert Panel to meet every six months for evaluating actual
environmental performance. Based on the pioneering experience in environmental
management at XLD since establishment of XLD/ERD in 1994, the Wanjiazhai Project
Loan Agreement incorporates provision for a program for systematic training of the staff
of Wanjiazhai EMO and of the other local participating agencies including the Shanxi
EPB and the Taiyuan city EPB. This includes both tailored classroom training at Taiyuan
plus training assignments in the USA.
6.4.2  Trainine Program
It is now realized that a tailored training program is needed for XLD for the staff
of ERD and of ERD's subcontractors, and the proposed program is as follows-.
(a) Tailored classroom training (combined with field observations) of selected
staff of ERD and of ERD's subs (RPDI, YRWRPB, YRCH), in enviromnental technology
for EIA for major dam/reservoir projects, with sessions of 10 calendar days every 3
months for period of two years, with instruction by a distinguished Chinese
Environmental Technologist.
(b) Field observation training in environmental monitoring for selected ERD
and other YR agency staff, say for 10 persons, for a period of one month with a selected
appropriate agency in the USA or elsewhere. For this purpose training with one of the
State of California's Regional Water Quality Control Boards (there are nine, one for each
major river basin in California) is recommended. Arrangements for this could be made by
a selected California Environmental Technologist who has the necessary experience and
contacts with the California Boards and who would be "USA Manager" for the visiting
group. This would require 2 man-months of the Expert Expert's time. (A recommended
6-4



candidate is Mr. Robert Lewis, retired from his former position as Chief of R& D for the
California State Water Resources Control Board, the parent organization for the nine
regional boards.)
(c) Training in Management Information System technology is being developed
by YRWHDCRO for RS management, for purpose of ensuring adequate attention to
incorporation into the system of informnation on applicable environmental parameters.
This should be included in the MIS on training program for RO's RS suboffice.
6.4.3 Estimated Costs
Estimated costs for the proposal training are given in Annex 6-2.
6.5   Expert Panel Operations
The present Expert Panel and its membership are as shown in Figure 1.3.2 of
Chapter 1. The Panel totals 9 members, including 7 Chinese and two expiates. The two
expiates are Dr. H. Ludwig, an Environmental Engineer (who is the only Environmental
Engineer on the Panel) and Dr. K. Connor (who is the only Sociologist on the Panel). The
Panel is divided into two Subpanels, one on Resettlement and the other on Environment.
The Subpanel on Environment is chaired by Prof. Liu Junde (a Resettlement Expert).
With respect to ERD's operations, the periodic visits and reports prepared by the
Environmental Engineer Member of the Expert Panel (EEMEP) (Dr. H. Ludwig) have
been valuable for purposes of training of the staff of ERD and ERD's Subs. However, in
view of the great complexity of ERD's assignment, it would be very helpful if some
additional special training be furnished as discussed in Section 6.4.
With respect to Panel membership, it would be very helpful to the EEMEP if an
additional member be appointed to the Panel, who should be a distinguished Chinese
Environmental Engineer, who could serve as Dr. Ludwig's Counterpart. An alternative is
to reestablish the panel system to be two panels, one for Environmental and one for RS.
With respect to the Panel's field trips, the procedure used to date has been to
"piggyback" the environmental field trips onto the RS field trips, but this has not
permitted sufficient time for the needed field environmental work. Hence it is
recommended that in the future the environmental and RS visits be separately arranged.
6.6   Economics of EMP
6.6.1 EMP Costs
Figure 6.6-1 gives cost estimates for implementing the EMP including costs for
ERD and all ERD subcontractors.
6.6.2 Value of EMP/EMO
Environmental management is a new kind of activity in development project
planning implementation (in both ICs and DCs). Hence, even though the EIA may
included an approved EMP including the specified environmental monitoring, there is a
common tendency in DCs for the funding for this to be deleted during project
implementation because many financial reviewers do not recognize the need or because of
fiscal problems. Moreover, over the past two decades much of the environmental
monitoring done in DCs has not been effectively utilized so that financial reviewers tend
to regard such costs as an unnecessary increase in project overhead costs. It is therefore
necessary for the EMP to include its own Benefit and Cost evaluation, to show clearly
that the proposed monitoring will "make money and not lose money." Estimating the
benefits of the monitoring is not an established methodology, but estimates can be made
by projecting the likely future situation for both "with monitoring" and "without
monitoring" cases.
6-5



Section 4.2.9.1 explains the benefits gained through incorporation of EPMs into
the overall XP plan. This notes that the estimated overall benefit cost ratio with EPMs
included is approximately 1.44 compared to 1.33 without, representing an 8 percent gain
in the ratio. As shown by experience elsewhere in many DCs, without the EMO/EMP,
much if not most of those additional benefits would not actually be realized.

NOTES:
(a) Final design for the project, including contract documents, plans and
specifications must include the EPMs specified by the EIA.
(b) Provisions for the construction stage must include construction supervision for
environmental matters as well as the usual construction supervision for
engineering activities.
(c) On completion of construction, a trial run will be conducted to be sure that EPMs
have been implemented effectively.
(d) Operational phase monitoring will be done to ensure that the project is being
operated in compliance with the constraints intended to protect the environrnent,
and to provide feedback necessary to identify and correct residual problems or to
take advantage of enhancement opportunities.

CHAPTER 7
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
7.1    Summary
Figure 7.1-1 has been prepared to summarize the situation for XP in terms of environmental
performance over the period 1992 (when EIA/92 was prepared) and February 1997 (date of EIA/97).
This lists all the SEls and for each gives the following evaluations (by column members, C3 to C7):
C3 Relative Workload for EMO: For some SEIs, the primary work is to be done by the EMO
including EMO subcontractors, whereas for other SEIs (for example, Earthquake Stability) the
primary work is done by other agencies from which EMO obtains the needed information every six
months.
C4 Performance Adeguacy. 1992 - Feb. 1997: This is based on the data made available by
EMO to Expert Panel and by evaluations made by Expert Panel/EEMEP.
C5 Needs for Improvements.
C5.1 The main need is for EMO and EMO subcontractors to pay strict attention to
performance on all EPMs specified in the EIA (and incorporated into the government/WB
loan agreements), and to report upon this performance in detail every six months (in April
and October), with the April report prepared to be a strict Environmental Audit for the
preceding year.
C5.2  The needed improvements will be achieved by (i) establishing an effective
Environmental Panel, (ii) restructuring the EMO into two EMOs or sub-EMOs, one for
Environment and one for RS, (iii) requiring the EMOs to follow up on all Panel
recommendations, (iv) requiring periodic diligent reporting by the EMOs and EMO
subcontractors, and (v) furnishing appropriate technical training to all EMP participants.
C6 Pro:ected Adequacy of Performance: Assuming C5, the environmental performance of
XP should be OK for each SEI and overall, with no significant net losses in environmental values but
with great gains.
C7 Assuming EPMs are implements, all risks will be adequately managed.
7.2    Conclusions
7.2.1   Overall Conclusion
As noted in Section 7.1, it is concluded that, given the improvements noted under Item C5,
all of which are to be included in the Loan 2 Agreement, if can be expected that the XP's status in
terms of environmental protection will be upgraded from its preset level of "fair performance" to
excellent performance. Much of progress in performance has been achieved since E[A/92, but it must
be remembered that XP is a large and complex project and that the concept/program for ensuring that
the project is environmentally sound is very complex and pioneering for a major water resources
development project in China. Hence, despite the progress made to date, much more needs to be
made and, based on the "lessons learned" over the period 1992-97, the entire XP/EMP is to be
restructured and improved as noted in Section 4.2.2 and as described in detail below.
7.2.2  Details on Needed lmDrovements
7.2.2.1 Responsibility for Environmental Management
The Environmental Management job, carried out by the EMO, is now assigned to RO, which
has a sub-office called the Environmental Resources Division (ERD) which is the EMO for carrying
out the EMP (Environmental Management Plan). The work of the EMO has been reviewed every six
months by the Environmental Engineer Member of the Expert Panel on Environment and
Resettlement which was established in 1994 for reviewing and guiding the work of the RO. The
reports of the EEMEP (Environmental Engineer Member of Expert Panel) are in effect
"Environmental Audits" of the RO's work on environment. These audits show clearly that the EMO
has been able to function with only partial effectiveness, primarily because the resettlement job itself
is huge and requires the RO's attention to such a degree that insufficient attention is available for
EMO. For this reason the work of the EMO subcontractors has been only partially effective for
environmental control of dam construction, less for environmental control of resettlement, and
7 -I



lacking'in other components including attention to disease control, archeological relics, and precious
eco-resources. The alternatives for correcting this problem are either (i) strengthening RO/EMO, or
(ii) establishing an EMO/Dam Project to be managed by the Dam Engineering Office, and leaving
with RO the EMO/Resettlement.
7.2.2.2 Expert Panel Restructuring
The present situation is not very satisfactory for environmental management purposes. While
the Panel is entitled, "Expert Panel on Environment and Resettlement", with seven Chinese members,
one expert Environmental Engineer (the EEMEP), and one expert Sociologist, there are no experts in
Environmental Technology among the Chinese members. Six are RS specialists and one is a Medical
Sanitation (whose field of expertise covers only a very small part of the total SEls of concern for
XP). Hence the EEMEP has no meaningful counterparts on the Panel, and the Panel has focused its
entire program (including field visits) on RS, and the Panel has not been able to give the needed
attention to Environmental Management.
The alternatives for correction are either (i) to strengthen the existing Panel by adding some
Chinese Environmental Technologists, or (ii) reestablish the Panel structure into two panels, one on
"Environmental Management" and one on "Resettlement Management". The Environmental
Management Panel would be concerned with both the EMO/Dam Project and the EMO/RS Project.
7.2.2.3 Environmental Auditine
The reports of the EEMEP have amounted to Environmental Auditing, but have not been
officially recognized as such, hence many of the findings and recommendations of the EEMEP have
gone unheeded. It is recommended that the Panel visits continue to be made every six months, and
that the Panel reports made in April each year be classified as official Environmental Audits. There
should also be understanding that Panel's recommendations on environment, made every six months,
will be acted upon by the EMOs and duly reported upon in their 6-month reports. For this purpose the
Panel's meeting should be extended to a period of three weeks each.
7.2.2.4 Environmental Management for Dam Proiect
(a) Needed ImDrovements
The program for Environmental Management for Dam Project should include all SEls except
those relating to RS, including dam construction, control of diseases affected by building and
operating the dam, relics control, and riverine water quality monitoring. With the proposed new
EMO/Dam Project set-up, it should be readily possible to carry out the recommended needed
improvements in EMO operations related to the dam. These will include improvements in (i)
performance of the Environmental Construction Inspectors (under RPDI control), (ii) control of the
CCs, including the requirement that each CC submit a detailed monthly report on the CC's
environmental management operations, (iii) the system for preparation of competent "notices" to the
CCs on particular problems and transmittal of these to the CC without interference by XECC's
Engineering Supervisor/Safety Department, (iv) performance of the other EMO subcontractors, (v)
provision of continuing periodic expert assistance to the EMO/Dam Project, and (vi) provisions for
training of EMOlDam Project staff in environmental management technology.
(b) Details on Needed ImRrovements
(b.l) With respect to Item (i) above, each ECI should be required to make daily, weekly, and
monthly reports, and for purpose of review of this work by the Expert Panel or Sub-panel on
Environment. Typical reports should be made available (in both Chinese and English) for review by
the Panel or Sub-panel every six months.
(b.2) With respect to Item (ii), the TOR for this work is as discussed in Section 4.2.2. Also,
the CC must recognize that the CC's responsibilities are not discharged simply by subcontracting
with local Chinese agencies (such as YRCH and provincial Anti-Epidemic Stations) unless these sub-
contractors carry out all of the CC's obligations (which has not been the case).
(b.3) With respect to Item (iii), it must be made plain, for the Loan 2 period, that
responsibilities for environmental management of the CCs is with the EMO, not with the XECC
Engineering Supervisor/Safety Department, and that the role of the Safety Department is simply to
transmit the EMO instructions (and not be modify them and "water them down", as has been the
7-2



case), and that the CC's monthly environmental report will include detailed discussion on receipt of
such notices and the CC's response to them.
(b.4) With respect to Item (iv), two other YRCC agencies are involved, YRCH and
YRWRPB. First, YRCH on disease control, to date has prepared semi-annual reports only to suit
their own views on reporting whereas what is needed is a report covering all aspects of the disease
control program as specified in EIA/92 and included in the Loan I Agreement. Because of this, the
YRCH performance to date has represented only partial compliance with the EIA/92 requirements,
and it seems clear that YRCH will cover all needed work only if required to produce complete reports
on performance every six months. In particular, YRCH must immediately implement monitoring as
specified in EIA/92 (i) for evaluating rat densities in the peripheral areas around the reservoir, to
protect the people living and working in the periphery from extra hazard of haemorrhagic fever, and
(ii) for monitoring disease mosquito larval in the ESA. This work must begin promptly in order to
establish a meaningful data base representing prior XP (without project) conditions. In addition,
YRCH should review its rat killing program in the construction zone so that densities will be within
the standard throughout the year.
(b.5) With respect to YRWRPB's work, the monitoring done by YRWRPB at the RS
villages, every six months, comprising only partial evaluation of water supply quality (and not even
including the salient water quality parameter of chlorine residual at taps) is so limited and so
infrequent that it is not worthwhile. The needed monitoring is for all environmental parameters
involved in RS villages, only one of which is water supply and safety. The recommendation is to
expand the role of the RPDI/ECls to cover RS villages as well as the Dam Project. (The YRWRPB's
present role does include air pollution/dust/noise monitoring in the dam construction zone and this is
valuable but too infrequent.)
(b.6) With respect to Items (v) and (vi), the 1994-97 experience of the EEMEP has showil
that additional continuing periodic technical assistance should be made available to the EMOs, by
extending the periods for Panel Meetings from two to three weeks, plus periodic training of staff of
the EMOs and of the EMO Subcontractors in environmental management technology. The
recommended training program is given in Section 6.4.
(b.7) With further reference to YRWRPB, the YRWRPB's program for Yellow River water
quality monitoring should be immediately modified to include the parameters requested in EIA/92,
which YRWRPB has not yet got around to doing even though these modifications represent only a
small amount of work.
(b.8) The present Environmental Sub-panel, at the suggestion of the EEMEP, recommended
that EMO commission a special study by pertinent experts to evaluate the need for proceeding with
the usual type of reservoir area clearing program, because of the EEMEP's judgment that the mud to
be deposited in the reservoir may make such clearing unnecessary, at least for the deeper portions of
the reservoir. This special study was not undertaken, and clearing is scheduled to start in June 1997.
The WB and XP officials may wish to give consideration to this issue during the WB's appraisal
mission. The objective is not to "disobey" government regulations on clearing, but to conduct a study
to determine whether a modification in the regulations would be in order for XP.
7.2.2.5 Environmental Management for RS
(a) As noted above, the new RO/EMO's role should be limited to environmental
management of RS, functioning with surveillance and guidance from the Expert Panel or
Panels. The functions of the RS/EMO should be to implement the work program
described in Section 4.2.3. It is believed that this can best be done by subcontract with
RPD[, with periodic assistance from the experts noted in Section 7.2.2 (b.6) above, and
with participation in the training program mentioned in Section 6.4.
(b) RO should obtain expert guidance to assist in developing the MIS program so that RS
statistics can be readily updated on a continuing basis, including data on environmental
parameters.
