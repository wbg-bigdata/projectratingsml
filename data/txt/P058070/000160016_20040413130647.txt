Environmental Management Framework
1.    Introduction: Sri Lanka North-East Irrigated Agriculture Project (NEIAP) intends to
help conflict-affected communities to reestablish at least subsistence level of production and
basic community services. This is to be achieved through repairing of 400 small irrigation
schemes and 1,200 km of rural roads, constructing about 400 community buildings and 600
drinking water wells and providing livelihood support assistance to most vulnerable people to
start household level income generating activities that would serve as safety nets to overcome
economic stress in the event of crop failure and loss in rainfall deficient seasons. Institutional
development at village level through reforming and strengthening of CBOs (farmers
organizations, rural development societies and women RDSs) is one of the key outputs of the
project. The project covers all eight districts of the North-East province and border villages of
the four districts of neighboring Uva, North-Central, North-Western Provinces. The
implementation responsibility was anchored to the North East Provincial Council - first Bank
financed project in Sri Lanka with a PC as main implementation agency, but GAs as main
partners of implementation at districts.
2.    The project activities interventions are small scale in nature and are widely scattered
over the project area. A large majority of project investments will include labor intensive,
small scale civil works and household level, individual, livelihood support income generating
activities. Civil works are localized activities at village levels likely to be associated with
rehabilitation and improvements of irrigation schemes and intra-village rural roads, and
construction of drinking water facilities and buildings that mostly utilize local construction
material. Individual household level income generating activities are likely to be highland
and home-garden agriculture and livestock and poultry rearing etc. The rehabilitation of
irrigation schemes and ponds will include: (i) strengthening, improving and filling breaches
of earthen embankments, repairs to sluices and spill ways; and (ii) cleaning, repairing and
improving the earthen irrigation canals and cement/concrete canal structures. These are
structures with embankment less than 15 m in height. Besides rehabilitation and
improvements, there would be new minor construction of some key structures like falls,
division boxes, regulators, measuring structures at canal off-take points for effective
irrigation and water management. The rehabilitation of village roads will include filling
depressions and pot holes and grading existing road platforms with borrowed earth, provision
of culverts and other cross drainage structures and side drains. Construction of buildings and
drinking water wells will involve earth excavations and construction of cement/concrete
structures.
3.    Therefore these activities are not expected to generate significant site-specific or
cumulative adverse environmental effects. On the other hand, the nature of rehabilitation
activities, particularly irrigation rehabilitation, by nature would include measures to control
and prevent environmental problems such as inadequate drainage, water-logging, salinity etc.
Given the small size and rehabilitation nature of the envisaged project components and
related activities, their potential adverse environmental impacts on human populations or
environmentally important areas including wetlands, forests, grasslands and other natural
habitats are not expected be significant. Even if there are negative impacts these are expected



to be easily manageable with proper guidance, training and oversight during planning,
imiplementation and monitoring phases of the project activities. Therefore, as is the case with
NEIAP, the proposed NEIAP II is classified as Category B of World Bank's project
environmental classification.
4.    Given the nature of project activities, the project adopts a simple and functional
environmental oversight system to guide the management and monitoring of the
environmental aspects of the project. This was particularly necessary as project investments
were being determined through a continuing village planning process and were being
approved on a rolling basis as village plans were developed. The functional environmental
management and oversight system, therefore, includes the following planning,
implementation and monitoring actions.
*  Development and application of checklists of potential environmental impacts and
mitigation measures for the four major project civil works activity categories, namely
rehabilitation and construction of small-scale irrigation systems, rural roads, tube/dug
wells and construction of buildings;
*  Development and application of checklists of potential environmental impacts and
mitigation measures for typical activities that are to financed under the Livelihood
Support Activity (LSA) components;
*  Integration of these checklists in the Village Development Planning (VDP) Process to
ensure that existing environment problems are tracked and monitored jointly by
project beneficiaries and implementing agency staff/NGO social mobilizers and
mitigation measures incorporated into the design and implementation of
rehabilitation/construction activities;
*  For medium irrigation schemes (command area more than 80 ha but less that 400 ha),
carrying out project specific environmental assessments on case by case basis as an
integral activity of feasibility studies for rehabilitation and incorporation of
environmental mitigation measures;
*  Revision and inclusion of clauses of existing standard civil works specifications and
contract documents to ensure that contractors and community based organizations
execute civil works in compliance with necessary environmental management and
minimal damage to the environment;
*  Development and application of simple monitoring and evaluation framework
including environmental indicators and outcomes; and
* Arrangements for training of field-level project staff, NGOs and other technical staff
to sensitize them typical environmental issues in the project area in general, and to
build capacity and skills in environmental assessment techniques and monitoring
specific to project activities in particular. The arrangements include:
(i)   identification of environmental training needs of the project and preparation of
training modules;
(ii)  validation of the training modules through application in the field;
2



(iii) preparation of training curriculum and modules to sensitize key project
stakeholders on typical environmental issues in the project area in general and
project specific environmental issues and safeguard/mitigation measures in
particular;
(iv)  translation of the training modules into Sinhala and Tamil languages for usage by
the community-based organizations and community members;
(v)   preparation of training plan for NEAIP reflecting environmental assessment,
oversight and monitoring needs; and
(vi)  undertaking of training of resource persons and the training of target groups such
as project engineers, technical officers, social mobilizers and work supervisors,
and community-based organizations in the use of the environmental impact
assessment checklists, incorporation of environmental aspects in project feasibility
reports, and conduct of environmental monitoring and evaluation of project
activities.

Sample Full Feasibility Report For Medium Irrigation Schemes
Vammiyadi Tank, Ampara Distrct
Environment
1.     Catchment degradation.
This is a medium tank with it own catchment. The catchment area of this tan, is 5.40 sq mile with
moderately slope area. About 90% of the area is covered with natural dense forest vegetation and balance
area is grassland. The tank is about 30km away from Akkaraipattu. Before 10 years back about 15% of
catchment area was under chena cultivation but last 10 years back about 15% of catchment area was
under chena cultivation but last 10 years all farmers are displace. In future will start chena cultivation by
the farmers. The present situation 100% of the catchment is not having any adverse degradations activities
and there will be no effects in the future too large number of elephant and forest animals and birds are
living in this catchment area. Illegal timber felling activities is found in this area mitigation measure.
Mitigation measures
* Mobilize community action to prevent encroachment, fires, tree cutting, and chena cultivation
in catchments area
* Re-plantation in degraded catchments areas
2.     Tank bed cultivation
The present situation tank bed area is covered by medium jungle. Tank bed cultivation did not
practice. Therefore, tank bed cultivation is not a problem in this area and there will be no effects in the
future too. Land is not demand in the area. Large quantity of fertility land available in command area.
Mitigation measures
* Mobilize community action to prevent tank bed cultivation in tank bed area
3.     Siltation of tank
Tank bed area is covered by natural medium forest and grassland. Siltation is found in the
catchments area and tank bed area. Due to the rainy seasons large amount of rainwater come
down in the tank from natural forest. At the same time silt also come in the tank bed area. And
Elephant corridor activity, illegal temper felling also create siltation problem. About 3 to 4
percentage of tank bed area is reduced by soil erosion and siltation. In future, water-holding
capacity of the tank will be decrease even though the catchments gradient is gentle and it is
within the allowable limit.
Mitigation measures
- Retain ground cover to reduce soil erosion
- Dump vegetation and scraped earth at suitable location and compact



- Do not block natural drainages
- Awareness creation to public and farmers
4. Seepage through bund
The length of the earthen bund is 900 feet. It had been formed with clay sand. Therefore seepage is
found. Small amount of water is escaped as loss every day and at the same time silt is also removed
slowly. This phenomenon may affect the band in future even though comparable erosion is not visible in
the embankment. The numbers of Elephant herds are come down in to the tank across the band daily for
drinking water and bathing purpose, in this activity date to date damaged both site of the band. Right end
of the band is significantly damaged. Loosing water is logging in the down site of the band. So the
Elephant activities may affect the bund in the future.
Mitigation measure
* Clay cut off wall on upstream of bund
* Rubble packing and toe filler on the down stream of the bund
*
5. Water logging in the command area
The available command area is 530 Acs. There is no significant water logging in the
command area. Water stagnates at the down stream of bund by seepage. The spill water of this
tank and the drainage of this scheme fall to Sagamam tank. From sluice the water is release to a
stream and water is issued by service of anicut for proper water issue. The drainage and anicut
are very useful for buffalo and cattle farming, wild animals and local fishing. The aquatic
ecosystem is developed due to this stream and drainage. Most of wild animals are found in this
area. So, the water logging are most use full in the wild animals, and aquatic fauna and flora.
Specially elephant, wild bore, peacock, spotted deer, ornamental fish etc. seepage water logging
is a problem in the bund.
Mitigation measures
a. Train farmers on effective and efficient water management
b. Rehabilitation of borrow areas
c. Reshape excavated areas to present stagnation and establish vegetation
d. Design proper drainage system
6. Effect on domestic water supply
With the rehabilitation of this scheme, water capacity in the tank will increase. Paddy
cultivation would be developed and also ground water table will increase. So this scheme helps
9



to maintain a shallow water table in the command area. Therefore, domestic water supply would
develop. But, surrounding area paddy field and forest area, have not any village in this area.
Farmers mostly use in this land for paddy cultivation. Therefore domestic water supply is not a
problem come across in this scheme.
Mitigation
No action necessary, domestic water supply is a positive impact
7. Health hazards
'This tank is isolated. So No health hazards are encountered in this scheme. In this
scheme is found about 20km away from the village. Farmers temperately living in this paddy
land area in cultivation time only. There for health hazard is not a problem in this scheme. But,
have not any shallow come across water wells in this paddy land area. The cultivation time the
farmers are use stream or channel water for during and cooking purpose. The cultivation time,
improper application of Agrochemicals is a health hazards in this area. The farmers are not using
safety methods to apply pesticide and insecticide. And also they use over demand fertilizers.
After application empty bottle & cans are thrown out or washed in a water body. Farmers and
animals that consume this water get into health hazards in the paddy land area.
Mitigation measures
a. Train farmers in integrated pest management
b. Train farmers in organic farming
c. Create awareness on proper handling, storage and disposal of pesticide and
insecticide
d. Rehabilitation of borrow areas
e. Reshape excavated areas to present stagnation
8. Land fragmentation and tenure pattern
Last 10 years this paddy land is not cultivated in the security problems. Last year more
than 300 Acs was cultivated land fragmentation is identified in very few cases. Tenant pattern is
practiced in the command area. Only 25 % of paddy land is cultivated by tenants and the balance
by owner. Tenant cultivations do not practice land management & maintenance. They will
expect more income quickly. So, they apply over use of agrochemical and fertilizers. In this
activities will create land degradation such us Salinisation. In this area is already high fertility
land. So, over use of fertilizers is not necessary.
10



Mitigation measures
a. Train farmers in integrated pest management
b. Train farmers in organic farming
c. Create awareness among the owners & tenants
d. Introduce integrated farming system.
e. Train farmers in use of Agrochemicals.
9. Encroachment
The reservation of drainages and channels are not encroached. Land is available in this area. So,
encroachment is not necessary. Therefore drainage and channels are functioning satisfactorily in the
command area. Encroachment of private lands has not been encountered in this scheme.
Mitigation measures
a. Mobilize community action to prevent encroachment in tank bed, catchment and
command area
10. Effects on flora & fauna
The tank is isolated from village, more area is patches of jungle. Large number of wild
animals living in this area and also catchment area, and part of command area are covered by
natural vegetation. After rehabilitation of the scheme, the water level will increase in the tank
and command area. The drainage watercourse will also develop. Therefore, the Aquatic fauna
and flora will be protected and develop ecosystem in this area. At the same time vegetation
cover also develop Island fishing will develop and ornamental fish would be protect. Livestock
farming activities would be developed. Drinking water problems of wild animals is decrease.
This scheme helps to developed and maintains fauna & flora. Totally positive impacts to fauna
& flora.
Mitigation measures.
a. No action need
b. Mobilize farmer action to avoid / reduce crop damage by wild animals
11. Conflict of Wild animals.
The tank is isolated from village area catchment area and surrounding tank area is thick forest
cover and grassland, large number of wild animals living. More than 200 elephant have in this
area. And large number of peacock living in this area. They are affected paddy cultivation.
Farmers are facing so many problems during the cultivation time
The hard of elephants are damage channels bund, tank bund and paddy every day.
11



Mitigation measures.
a. Mobilize farmer action to avoid / reduce crop damage
12. Soil erosion
Soil erosion is found in the tank bund and command area due to wild animals (elephant
and wild bore) activities, buffalo and cattle activities and in proper farming activities in
command area cultivation. During rainy seasons, large amount of water is running across the
command area that time large amount of soil come down to the command area tank bed area and
catchment area year to year the sand is accumulated in the catchment area and command area.
The tank is a isolated from village so. The review sand is not use for construction work by the
people. Therefore every year should be removing in the erodable sand, and silt.
Mitigation measures.
-  Construction in dry season
-  Retain ground vegetation as much as possible
-  Retain channel / drainage reservation to reduce soil transport
-  Turf exposed surfaces quickly
-  Create contour strips / steps as slops breakers

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The North East Irrigated Agriculture Project (NEIAP) is the largest rehabilitation project
in the North and East Districts of Sri Lanka. It was started in 2000. A number of projects
such as irrigation, roads, wells and other re-construction activities and livelihood support
activities (LSA) with community participation have been implemented in stages. All
these project investments are small in size, very localized, largely labour intensive, utilize
local materials and largely of a rehabilitation nature. Since 2002, due to concerns on the
environment, the Project Management Unit (PMU) with the advice from World Bank
(WB) has been actively involved in the development and implementation of
environmental checklists. These have been incorporated in monitoring and mitigation
procedures in the project activities. Further, to encourage wider participation and to
increase the incorporation of environmental safeguards in project implementation, PMU
has developed environmental training modules and conducted environmental training at
three levels, namely Target Group I: Senior Officers (SO), Target Group II: Technical
Officers (TO) and Social Mobilizers (SM) and target group III, the members of
Community Based Organizations (CBOs). Since the environmental training program is
nearing completion, it was felt necessary to review the effectiveness of the
implementation of the environmental management aspects. In this context, the present
evaluation study was carried out in June 2003 with the objective of assessing the
effectiveness of the environmental training programs and to make recommendations for
increased effectiveness of environmental programs in the future.
Seven districts in the North, East and conflict affected Border districts villages were
selected for the environmental training evaluation, namely Mannar, Vavuniya,
Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Ampara, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. The study relied
mainly on primary data collected from multiple sources of information, namely SO (35),
TO&SM (49) and CBO (84) by using interview guidelines, semi-structured schedules and
survey techniques respectively. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was also used where
farmer groups consisting both trained and non-trained members were met in the two
selected focal villages in each district. To evaluate the training impact effective scale
method, knowledge score, success index and frequency analytical statistics were
employed.
The findings of the evaluation study indicate that all SOs had a positive attitude towards
conserving the environment. They were generally aware of the environmental impacts of
the projects that they were involved in. SOs accepted the concepts of environmental
impacts of the projects and the mitigatory measures discussed at the environmental
training programs. Generally they incorporate the environmental safe guards indirectly
through their routine technical auditing of the projects. However, to further strengthen the
environmental aspects indicated in the training, they encouraged the TOs to incorporate
important environmental safeguards through adequate use of the environmental impact
checklist in planing, implementation and monitoring of the projects. Generally SOs
attitude was that the environmental training efforts was not wasted, even if the acquired
knowledge was not applied: the argument was that it has created a valuable
environmental awareness among the concerned people.
v



The environmental training received by TOs was useful in promoting the environmental
safeguards application in the different stages of the projects' activities such as planning,
implementation and monitoring. However, this middle level training in incorporating
environmental skills was found to be weak on the part of Social Mobilizers (SM). This
was due to difficulties they face in mobilizing the people and lack of technical expertise
in the environmental safeguards. Review of the project feasibility reports prepared by
TOs revealed improvements in the use of the checklist in the environmental assessment,
and mitigation procedures at the filed level. The environmental training and backstopping
received by the TO was useful in promoting the use of environmental safeguards into
project activities. However, the evaluation shows that training did not have much impact
upon the subsequent behaviour and performance of the TOs because of: difficulty in
transport due remoteness of the project areas, delay in submission of the schedule of
project activities by the CBOs and specific local problems.
Due to environmental training, over two third of the CBO respondents seemed to have a
moderate understanding of the environmental impacts of the projects that link with their
farming activities. The interview with non-participants of the training indicated that
useful training information always was shared among CBOs' members for joint effort in
environmental programs. Promoting active involvement of CBOs in the projects, through
environmental training has generally increased concerns on group behaviour. Using the
problem solving methodologies in the training has facilitated better understanding and
contribution of farmers in environmental safeguard activities. About 40% of the targeted
training programs to CBOs are yet to be completed. Inappropriate timing, lack of support
among CBOs and backstopping were the commonly mentioned weaknesses at the CBO
level training. The future training to CBOs need more close attention and monitoring.
The proportion of successful environmental training was comparatively higher in
Trincomalee district followed by Batticlao and Vavuniya. Training offered at Ampara
was not adequate and environmental training were demanded by the women respondents
in Mannar and Vavuniya. Environmental training in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa had
increased the concern of CBOs on environmental safeguards. However, there was lack of
attention due to several limitations that delayed the project activities.
Overall, the environmental training is found to be partially successful. One of the
important factors responsible for this was that environmental training was given only
after project was implemented. Based on the results of the evaluation study, some
important recommendations have been made. E.g. Future environmental training should
be given at the initial stage of the village development program. This helps to minimize
the damage to environment and use appropriate environmental safeguards at the early
stage by the CBOs and TOs. The effectiveness of any training programs depends on its
continuous monitoring and evaluation, which should include appropriate and different
methods. This will ensure effective incorporation of environmental concern of the
beneficiaries in the project activities and helps in identifying the overall performance of
trainers and trainees.  This will increase the sustainability of the projects.

THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING
ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SENIOR OFFICERS, TECHNICAL OFFICERS
AND THE MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS
1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1   Back Ground Information
North East Irrigated Agriculture Project (NEIAP) was established under the World Bank
grant in March 2000. NEIAP has invested in number of rehabilitation projects in the
north, east and conflict affected border districts. Since these rehabilitation project
investments are expected to be small, very localized and labour intensive, it was expected
that environmental impacts would be small and readily manageable with proper planning
and oversight. It adopts an Integrated Village Development Approach (IVDA) with a
number of sub projects such as irrigation, roads, wells and other re-construction
activities. Under the IVDA farmers are mobilized to form groups in order to more
effectively address the problems they face; field officers help them to identify potential
solutions and to test and adopt these solutions to their environmental problems.
Therefore, a simple and easily workable environmental management and oversight
system was developed to enable effective screening of the evolving plans for their
environmental conformity application. However, one of the important challenges faced
by the projects in applying environmental safeguards approaches was that the
beneficiaries and the staff of the line agencies lacked the necessary understanding, skill
and attitude in environmental monitoring and remedial measures in dealing with the
project. Thus the NEIAP emphasizes environmental monitoring be an integral part of its
project implementation. It was felt that the staff and farmers involved in the
implementation of civil construction and those involved in the social mobilization of the
project be provided with the training to carry out monitoring of the environment, and
implementing environmental mitigation measures. The Project management Unit (PMU)
has developed checklists for monitoring of potential environmental issues and impacts
and work categories such as Irrigation, Roads, Wells, Public Buildings and other
Livelihood Support Activities (LSA). Accordingly the framework for monitoring of
potential environmental issues (before, during and after rehabilitation) has been prepared
and safeguard measures have been undertaken.
1.2   Objectives of the Evaluation Study
Since the environmental training program is nearing completion, it was felt necessary to
review the effectiveness of the implementation of the environmental management
aspects. In this context, the present evaluation study was carried out in June 2003 with
the objectives to assess the effectiveness of the environmental training program and to
make recommendation for increased effectiveness of environmental programs in the
future.
The specific objectives of the study are:
vii



(1) To find out whether any of the information impaired during the
environmental training were relevant to management objective that had been set,
and what effect it was on the environmental conservation of the senior officials
(Target group I.)
(2) To find out how effectively the Social Mobilizers have motivated the people and
the Technical Officers (Target group II) to use the environmental impact
assessment checklist, monitoring and mitigation measures at the field and in the
village level feasibility reports, after receiving the training.
(3) To find out what the community based organization members (Target group III)
remembered of the training, whether any of the information and skills imparted
during the training were of help in carrying out their farming operation.
(4) To find out what the target groups' current problem was and what suggestions
they had for future environmental conservation under the NEIAP project.
(5) To make recommendations for increased effectiveness of environmental training
programs in the future.
2.0   METHODOLOGY
2.1   Beneficiary Survey and Officers' Interviews
The evaluation study relied mainly on primary data collected from multiple sources of
information, from the sample of 35 Senior Officials, (Target group I), 49 Technical
Officers (Target group II) and 84 members of Community Based Organizations (Target
group III). Out of 12 districts in the North, East and border districts, seven districts
namely Trincomalee, Batticalo, Ampara, Vavuniya, Mannar, Anuradhapura and
Polonnaruwa were selected for the data collection ( Table 1).

In each district 5 SOs, 7 TOs & SMs and 12 CBO beneficiaries were selected randomly
among those who had attended and not attended the environmental training.
Questionnaire schedule for interviews of the beneficiaries was developed. In line with the
beneficiary survey, technical officers survey was also conducted using a separate semi-
structured schedule in order to triangulate some vital information on how effectively they
use the environmental checklist, monitoring and mitigation measures in the village level
feasibility reports. The officer interviews were also held using an interview guideline in
obtaining a comprehensive description on the process followed in setting up
environmental training. These officers contacted and their designations are given in
Annexure 1. The interview schedules and guidelines used in the evaluation are presented
as Annexes 2, 3 and 4. The sample included mainly the participants and non-participants
of environmental training. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was also used where
farmer groups consisting both trained and non trained members were met in the selected
focal villages. A total of 14 farmer groups discussions were held, 11 of the 14 farmer
groups were conducted in the focal villages where environmental training was offered.
Both environmental training offered and non-offered focal villages were included in this
study to allow comparison and to find out the effectiveness of the environmental training.
2.2   Data Analysis
The data collected through beneficiaries interview and officers group discussions were
coded, entered into the computers and analyzed using SPSS software package. In
analyzing the data, scoring technique was adopted to determine the level of
understanding, extent of usefulness of the environmental training program by the officers
and the beneficiaries.
To estimate the farmers' attitude towards the application of environmental safeguard a
attitude scale was constructed. Attitude has been defined as the degree of the positive and
negative thoughts associated with one physiological object. Among the techniques
available for construction of scales Likert's scale was selected for the study. The farmers
were requested to give their reaction to each statement on the environmental aspects dealt
in the training on the five relating points namely strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree
and strongly disagree. If the item was positive maximum value of 5 was given and
strongly disagree was given one. The abstracted data were analyzed using frequency
analytical statistics.
It was envisaged to obtain evidence to categorize the environmental training according to
the level of success and to find out the factors affecting the success. Since the valid
quantitative information could not be obtained during the investigation a qualitative
(success) index was developed using the quality of training received, the level of
application of the instruction and number of people participated in taking
environmentally related activities. Then the distributions of aggregate values were
hypothetically divided to three categories as "good, average and poor".

FINDINGS OF THE STUDY
3.1   Review of The NEIAP Environmental Training Programs
The PMU conducted a comprehensive series of training by using two environmental
specialists and has taken necessary steps to address the environmental aspects of the
project. Following are the progress achieved in this respect.
(1) Finalization and application of environmental check lists for the four most common
project supported activities, namely: small irrigation works, rural roads, drinking
water wells and small community buildings.
(2) Identification of environmental training needs of the projects and preparation of three
levels of training modules. These curricula reflect and encompass the major and
minor environmental problems of the project that arise during implementation and
after completion of the projects. Validation of the training modules was done through
conducting a validation workshop and application in the field. The comprehensive
curriculum, including aims and objectives were translated into Sinhala and Tamil and
usually distributed to the CBOs trainees. Summary of training programs, which were
conducted for the officers, technical officers and community based organizations, are
given in Table 2.
(3) Training of Trainers was conducted with the aim to build a cadre of trainers capable
of implementing environmental training in an effective and participatory manner.
Selection of six trainers was done on the basis of their involvement in environmental
programs. Out of six who received the training of trainers, three trainers were selected
to conduct training based on their characteristics in terms of their experiences in the
field, which are directly related to improving the environmental training programs.
(4) Beneficiaries selection followed clear, predetermined steps. Selection of beneficiaries
was done by PMU through DPDs. In Target Groups I and II selection, officers' active
involvement and certain criteria in NEIAP were taken into consideration in the
respective districts. In Target Group III, three office bearers from FOs, RDS and
WRDS were selected for the training from the focal villages. The beneficiaries who
showed a keen interest to join the training were also selected.
(5) The training process included problem solving approaches and groups discussions.
Formal lecturing was the method least used. These approaches were usually coupled
with appropriate audiovisual aids. In general, environmental training has been very
useful in strengthening the project development and many training programs have
been successfully completed from August 5th 2002 to May 31 st 2003.
(6) Recent recruitment of civil engineers for quality monitoring to eight districts is an
important action taken by the PMU to improve the sustainability of the project.

3.2   Effectiveness of the Environmental Training Programs
3.2.1 Target Group I - Senior Officers
Impact of Environmental Training on Professional Performance
The findings of the evaluation study indicate that all Senior Officers had a positive
attitude towards conserving the environment. They were generally aware of the
environmental impacts that they were involved in. Table 5 shows the response to three
major questions asked: How useful was the knowledge of training in their jobs?, Whether
they have used knowledge in the projects' activities? and Have they had any difficulty in
applying them?.
With regard to the usefulness of the environmental training: majority (above 74%) of the
senior officials was generally agreeing the usefulness of the topics discussed in the
environmental training. They accepted the concepts of environmental impacts of the
projects and the mitigatory measures discussed at the environmental training.
In respect to use of knowledge in project stages: all the SOs reported that, generally the
environmental safeguards were already incorporated in the preliminary inspection report
and in full feasibility reports of the projects and it was covered indirectly through the
routine technical auditing of the project. However, to further strengthen the
environmental aspects indicated in the training, they encouraged the TOs to incorporation
of environmental safeguards through adequate use of the environmental checklist in
planing, implementation and monitoring of the projects. This has generally increased the
technical quality of the project.

* Figures in parenthesis are number of responses
On the difficulties in the application of acquired knowledge in the environmental
training: many officials (about 70%) doubted if the environment training program -
though it gave more insights and ideas of environmental safeguards - was in itself
adequate to improve the environmental impacts of the projects; they had to follow strict
instructions and real implementations of the projects particularly in tank rehabilitation
were not in a position to examine closely and apply the safeguards as indicated.
Personal Views on Environmental Training
The environmental training program was widely remembered on the concepts of
environmental impacts of tank head works and irrigation facilities rehabilitation and its
linkages of environmental management. Other subjects, such as Initial Environmental
Examination (IEE) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) were remembered -and
that too vaguely - by less than half the respondents. The majority of the respondents
reported that there was a delay in the environmental training and insisted that it should be
offered with the village development plan.
Senior officers consider environmental training methods to be effective. They value the
positive client orientation of the field officers brought about by the environmental
training. Using the environmental guidelines and tools facilitated an improvement in the
contribution of farmers in planning and conducting environmental safeguards. However,
they accepted that, the technical officers had several obstacles in incorporating
environmental safeguard application in practice.
Some SOs mentioned that they learnt something about social obligation of environmental
management and these officers said that, after attending the training programm, they
carried out their duties related to environment more conscientiously than they had been
doing previously. An attitude observed during the interviews at all levels of the hierarchy
was that the environmental effort was not wasted even if the acquired knowledge was not
applied: the argument was that it has created a valuable environmental consciousness
among the people.

3.2.2 Target Group II - Technical Officers and Social Mobilizers
Effectiveness of the Environmental Training on the Use of the Environmental
Safeguards
The evaluation study found that the Technical Officers (TOs), Social Mobilizers (SMs)
and Work Supervisors (WSs) were generally aware of the advantages of the
environmental training to their present duties. Due to the its importance more than
targeted number of 8 training to TOs additional 3 training were conducted (see Table 2).
The training sessions conducted were subject to evaluation by the coordinators. The feed
back from the trainees was helpful in updating and modifying the programs. The review
of these feed back reports reveal that many training programs resulted in significant
improvement in the understanding of environmental checklist and its practical application
in the filed particularly by the TOs. The environmental training received by TOs were
useful in promoting the environmental safeguards application in the different stages of
the projects' activities such as planning, implementation and monitoring. Only a third of
the TOs mentioned that the training helped incorporation of environmental safeguards
measures in the preparation of village level feasibility plans/reports. Review of the
project feasibility reports prepared by TOs revealed improvement in the use of the
checklist in environmental assessment, and mitigation procedures at the filed level.
Further the 39% of TOs and SMs indicated that they have received good support from
their superior officers in doing so (Table 6).

This middle level training in incorporating environmental skills was found to be weak on
the part of Social Mobilizers (SM). This was due to difficulties they face in mobilizing
the people and lack of technical expertise in the technical aspects. However, the review of
the reports on VDP, VSP, PRA and PNA prepared by the social miobilizers with the help
of the CBOs indicate their progress in the village development. They also give training to
CBOs on environment, water management and record maintaining. The SMs agreed that
environmental training offered to them has been much useful in doing their duties.
However, lack of team work among TOs and SMs was observed. This was due to their
own limitations.
xv



Problem Faced by Technical Officers and Social Mobilizers
Although the NEIAP has been successful in getting the cooperation of the line
agencies, filed officers who are responsible for environmental identification, monitoring
and writing feasibility reports, highlighted some limitations encountered by them. The
training did not have much impact upon the subsequent behaviour and performance of the
target group II. Table 7 shows the problems faced by TO in carrying out environmental
safeguards in their duties.
About 26% of the respondents reported that environmental training was not
adequate for the use of environmental safeguards into project activities. Further, 37% of
the TOs face problems of transport due remoteness of the project area. In addition, lack
of timely submission of the schedule of activities by the CBOs is a major difficulty in
carrying out their duties. Further, TO and SM receive Rs. 200.00 per day as incentive and
they feel these amounts were insufficient for the additional responsibilities in carrying
out environmental safeguard in the villages. Further provision of transport facilities has to
be taken into consideration in order to increase the coverage and mobility. The field staff
also expressed much to be done on the system of environmental monitoring and
evaluation. The difference in motivation and environmental input driven towards
environmental safeguard application by the field officers is observed. In fact, success of
the environmental safeguard application would be greatly on such factors. Therefore,
measures have to be taken to recognize the efforts of the field staff and to reward the
efficient officers based on their contribution.

According to the field officers response it was found that the rehabilitation work caused
less damages to environment as engineering design includes the quality checks that
xvi



address the environmental component of the project. According to the degree of impact
of the project activities on environment, TOs ranked tank rehabilitation and ecosystem
management as the most important one. Drinking wells, access roads and community
buildings were considered to have less negative impact on enviromnent. Almost all the
field officers were in opinion that environmental training was important for them.
3.2.3 Target Group III -Members of Community Based Organizations -
Effect of Environmental Training on Knowledge
Farming is the major source of income for most of the study population. Majority of the
farmers is young and had received secondary education. There are no significant
difference in age and education among the districts.
Effect of environmental training on environmental knowledge was analyzed based on knowledge
and attitude. The mean total knowledge score was 10.72 with standard deviation of 1.57. Farmers
within frequencies between 0 - 9.15 were considered as low knowledge group. Score between
9.15 - 12.20 was considered as medium knowledge group and the rest was considered as high
knowledge group. Distribution frequencies of CBO respondents according to knowledge score are
given in Table 8.
Table 8 shows that in each district Farmers had received some knowledge on environment
through the environmental training conducted to them. The knowledge of Northern farmers' was
followed by Eastern and Border districts, above medium knowledge were 79%, 69% and 63%
respectively. With respect to difference in knowledge level among the district, chi-square test
indicates that the difference is significant at 5% probability. Due to environmental training over
two third of the CBO respondents seemed to have a moderate understanding of the environmental
impacts of the projects that link with their farming activities. Before the environmental training
people were not aware of environmental problems and their impacts on their livings.

Using the problem  solving methodologies facilitated a higher understanding and
contribution of farmers in environmental safeguard methods. There was a considerable
variation in the quality of environmental training received by the farmers. The farmers
are generally satisfied with the quality of advice given by the trained resource persons.
However, some were not happy about the training received.
xvii



About 40% of the targeted training programs are yet to be completed. The future training
to CBOs need more close attention and monitoring. This will ensure effective
incorporation of the environmental concern of the beneficiaries in the project activities.
Attitude of the Farmers Towards Environmental Safeguards
The attitude score of farmers in the studies sample ranged from 46 to 75. This was
divided into three categories as favourable (positive) 48 - 75, neutral 58 - 67 and
unfavorable (negative) 66 - 75. Table 9 shows significant higher positive attitude in
Northern district; followed by Eastern and border districts, the values are 85%, 55%R and
43% respectively. There was significant association between attitudes and cooperation
among the farmers in group activities. The attitude of WRDSs members was higher than
RDSs and FOs members.

The interview with non-participants of the training indicated that useful training
information always was shared among CBOs' members. Promoting active involvement
of CBOs in the projects, through environmental training had generally resulted in
increased concerns on group behaviour.
In general, environmental training programs have been useful in strengthening the environmental
safe guards in the project activities. The farmers had expressed that the environmental training
program has been very conducive in expanding their existing knowledge regard to environmental
concerns.
More than two third of the CBO respondents expressed that they very well remembered
the watershed and irrigation aspects discussed in environmental training programs.
Further, it was observed that there were a number of environmental concerns that would
uplift both the productivity and the efficiency of water of the poor dry zone farmers.
However, their involvement in identifying, monitoring and mitigatory measures in
environment is inadequate. Farmers were of the opinion that all should be encouraged to
cooperate in addressing the environmental safeguards measures. Further, the respondent
farmers intended that the environmental safeguard measures could be attended if farmers'
income level was improved.
Given below is the extent of application by farmers on some important environmental
safeguard measures, which are promoted by the environmental training program among
xviii



farmers and villagers. Majority of the respondents expressed that the information and
skill impaired during the training were of help in improving their farming practices.
E.g. Incorporating straw into soil, wise use of chemicals, agro forestry etc. The attitudes
of the respondents towards environmental training were positive. About 82% of the
respondents have expressed the usefulness of the training (Table 10).

Weakness of Environmental Training Mentioned by the Trained Farmers
One fundamental objective of the environmental training was to disseminate the
environmental safeguard practices among a large number of the target population. If
considerable number of farmers has not adopted the promoted practices there could be
matter worthy to be investigated. As shown in Table 11. The most frequently mentioned
problems (42%) with related to environmental training were related to timing of training.
They have indicated that many environmental problems could been avoided if the
training was given earlier with the village development planning. The second most
common weakness (35%) mentioned was about the practicality of applying technical
advice imparted in the training. Carefully selecting the procedures adopted by some
successful cases and using them as example in future training programes could overcome
this. Also demonstration should illustrate the application of appropriate environmental
identification, monitoring and mitigation. The majority of the farmers had agreed with the
farmers' selection and satisfied with the duration of training conducted.

In addition to the above mentioned weakness of the training program the following are
suspected major factors that affect the success of environmental training at the CBOs
level: 1) Honesty and sincere leadership,
2) Self reliant sprit of the group members,
3) Active participation of the members in discussion and decision making,
4) Homogeneity of the group,
5) Cooperation from the implementing agency.
3.3   Overall Success of the Environmental Training Programs
To obtain tangible evidence to categorize the level of environmental training programs to
their levels of success, a qualitative index was developed using the following indicators:
a) Number of training completed.(Scale: 0%=1, 25%=2, 50% =3, 75%=4 & 100%=5)
b) Number of trainees attended per training (Scale: 10=1, 20=2, 30=3, 40=4 & 50=5)
c) Usefulness expressed (Scale:High=5, Good=4, Average=3, Poor=2 & Very poor =1)
d) Level of application (Scale: High=5, Good=4, Average=3, Poor=2 & V.poor =1)
e) Problems faced (Scaled as, Non-5, Low=4, Average=3, High=2 & V.high=l).
The values allocated to for each variable were added to arrive at an aggregate. Then the
distributions of aggregate values were hypothetically divided to three categories as "good
(more thanl6), average (between 15 and 12) and poor (Less thanl2)". It was found that
the training programs at the target group I was good with success index value of 19,
while majority of the training conducted at target group II and III had an average success
with success index values of 15 and 13 respectively. The overall average success index
was 16, indicate that the overall environmental training programs had achieved an
average success. One of the important factors responsible was that environmental training
was given only after the project was implemented. The proportion of successful
environmental training was comparatively higher in Trincomalee district followed by
Batticlao, Vavuniya,. Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts. Environmental training
offered at Ampara was not adequate and the women respondents in Mannar and
Vavuniya demanded environmental training. Environmental training in Anuradhapura
and Polonnaruwa had increased concern of CBOs on environmental safeguards.
However, there is lack of attention due to several limitations that delayed the project
activities.
The PMU get the services of one environmental trained project assistant on a part time
basis, who is working for provincial council for Central Environmental Authority. It is
suggested that his services should be fully utilized to complete the balance of the training
program. The other staff trained under the environmental program could be used for
frequent visits to the environmental sensitive project areas to encourage the use of
environmental safe guards by the beneficiaries. The environmental safeguard activities
such as identification, monitoring and mitigation were only followed at the beginning.
Thereafter, the commitment of many farmers had gradually decreased due to the fact that
xx



the returns were not forthcoming in the foreseeable future. Thus frequent visits and
follow up are essential in setting up successful environmental safeguard implementation.
4.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.1   Conclusions
The following conclusions are drawn based on the analysis of the data collected and the
Filed observation in the project areas.
1) The environmental training programs at senior officers level is successful and it has
satisfactorily met the objective of increased concern on the environmental
conservation in the project activities. They encouraged the TOs to incorporate
environmental safeguards through adequate use of the environmental impact in
planning, implementation and monitoring of the projects. Also they perceived
favourable changes of TOs performance after the environmental training.
2) Field officers had learned the importance and the application of the
environmental
impact assessment checklist and the procedures at the field level. The TOs are  seem to
perform better in using environmental safeguards in the field. This is clearly revealed in
feasibility plans and reports prepared by them now.
Involvement of Social Mobilisers is highly useful for the motivation of the CBOs
in using environmental safeguards and technical advice should be taken from the line
agencies wherever possible.
The middle level environmental training programs had an average success and
there are few weaknesses in this groups for effective implementation of environmental
safeguards with their present duties.
3) All the community based organizations had positive attitude on the environmental
training program. Providing environmental information through CBOs will enhance the
effectiveness of environmental safeguard technology dissemination at the village level.
This group had a partial success and about 40% of the training still  needs to be
conducted. More emphasize should be paid in conducting the training  properly to this
group.
4) The evaluation study shows that environmental training did not have much impact upon
the Subsequent behaviour and performance of the TOs because of: difficulty in
transport due remoteness of the project areas, delay in submission of the schedule of
project activities by the CBOs and specific local problems.

4.2   Recommendations
To improve the effectiveness of implementation of the environmental management aspects of the
projects the following recommendation could be considered.
1. The impact of environmental training program could probably be improved if the
training effort were conducted frequently in local areas, where the participants could
travel easily, short training each designed to serve a particular purpose. The training
should be coordinated with other measures such as organizational development and
greater use of experienced people to provide advice.
2. Future environmental training should be given at the initial stage of the village
development program. This helps to address the environmental safeguard of the
projects at the early stage by the beneficiaries and the implementing agencies.
3. The effectiveness of any training programs depends on its continuos monitoring and
evaluation, which should include appropriate and different methods. The
environmental training at CBOs level is important and subject to monitoring and
evaluation. This helps in identifying the overall performance of trainers and trainees.
4. Workshops of short duration on environmental aspects should be held from time to
time to exchange and generalize experiences and find solution to new problems in
environment in the projects.
