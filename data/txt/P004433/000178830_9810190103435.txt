PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES - PRIVNTE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
(LOAN 1052-PH)
HIGHLIGHTS
This report covers experience under Loan 1052-PH for US$30 million
made by the Bank to the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines
(PDCP). The objectives of the loan were: (a) transfering foreign exchange
resources to promote the development of widely-based, export-oriented manu-
facturing industries; and (b) continuing institution-building efforts,
particularly by encouraging PDCP to achieve greater regional dispersion of its
investments, and to provide greater support to smaller industries.
The loan was su,cessful in meeting its objectives. The funds were
transferred to a satisfactory number of subprojects with broad sectoral
representation and significant export orientation being achieved. The
ex-ante financial and economic rates of return for these subprojects were
generally high, and ex-post rates, calculated for a number of subprojects,
were generally found to be satisfactory, averaging 35.4% and 45.3%,
respectively (paras. 5.09--5.10 and 9.01 of PCR). In line with the other
objectives, PDCP has: established seven branch offices which have been
helpful in improving the regional dispersion of PDCP's investments and
promoting small and medium industry loans (para. 8.02 of PCR); undertaken
equity participations in a select number of private development banks (para.
5.05 of PCR); and increased significantly the volume of operations under its
small business program (para. 7.03 of PCR).
Actual disbursement of the loan proceeds was considerably longer
than the anticipated year-end 1978 estimated at the time of appraisal. The
reasons for the slow disbursement are complex and include:    (a) an uncertain
business climate caused by two rounds of oil price increases during the
project implementation period; and (b) the fact that the currencies disbursed
by the Bank were appreciat:ing considerably against the peso thus causing Bank
funds to be relatively expensive and therefore less attractive to the end-user
who carried the foreign exchange risk (para. 5.01 of PCR).
The quality of PDCP-s portfolio has been consistently deteriorating
since 1976 when total arretars represented 7.4% of the outstanding portfolio;
as of March 31, 1982, total arrears were 11.5% of the outstanding portfolio.
While part of this decline may be attributable to certain institutional



- iv -
deficiencies (optimistic appraisals and weak supervision),/l most of the poor
performance is due to adverse economic conditions.    To improve its portfolio
quality and hence its own profitability PDCP needs to: (a) improve its
project supervision, particularly by increasing supervision staff- and (b)
undertake a thorough review of projects in arrears with a view toward
determining whether these projects would be viable given an appropriate
amortization schedule and improved economic conditions.
A major institutional change which has occurred since appraisal of
this loan is PDCP's tie-up with the Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC),
the sixth largest commercial bank in the Philippines. This tie-up arrange-
ment allows both PDCP and FEBTC to continue to operate separately while at the
same time allowing FEBTC to emerge as a strong universal bank and providing
PDCP with a potential source of domestic currency resources.
With regard to lessons learned under this project, it is very
difficult to arrive at general conclusions given the unique set of economic
conditions which prevailed during project implementation. The two oil price
increases and resulting high inflation contributed to an uncertain business
climate in the mid-to-late 1970s. The economic recession which has prevailed
since 1979 has certainly had an adverse impact on the projects financed under
the loan. The disbursement problem of the loan arising from the hard
currencies which would be required to be repaid has already been addressed by
the Bank through the recently introduced currency pooling system. With regard
to the few institutional inadequacies pointed out, PDCP is introducing
procedures to improve the quality of its subproject appraisals and is well
aware of the fact that its supervision of subprojects requires improvement.
In summary, the 1975-81 period during which the project was implemented was a
period of basic structural adjustment in the economy, to which PDCP, as a
well-managed financial institution, responded quite well.
/1 PDCP, however, feels that this conclusion may be unduly influenced by
hindsight and that at the time appraisals were made, the assumptions
utilized were considered to be realistic and valid. With regard to
project supervision, PDCP emphasized that its Project Management Group
is considered to be a well-managed group and that the adverse economic
situation and prolonged recession contributed materially to PDCP's
higher level of arrears and past dues (Attachment A, page 1).

PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This project completion report reviews Loan 1052-PH, the fourth loan
made by the Bank to the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines
(PDCP)./l Thus far, PDCP has received five loans from the Bank totalling
$125 million and is a recepient of $36 million under Loan 1984-PH, which was
made to the Central Bank (CB) of the Philippines in 1981. PDCP also received
a $15 million loan from IFC in 1972. Basic data concerning Loan 1052-PH is
given below.

2. ENVIRONMENT
2.01      During the 1970s, the Philippines followed a much more dynamic
growth-oriented development strategy than in the past. The growth rate of GNP
was raised from 5% in the 1960s to almost 7% at the end of the 1970s.
Recently, however, the world recession has been reflected in the domestic
economy. The second round of oil price increases and resulting upsurge [n
inflation, together with declining commodity prices and export demand explain
the recessionary conditions which have recently prevailed in the Philippines
and which have severely curtailed industrial investment for the past few
years. Real GNP growth fell from almost 7% in 1977/78, to an estimated 2.5%
in 1982.
2.02      During the 1970s, manufacturing industry as a whole grew only at
about the same rate as GNP; manufactured exports, however, grew dramatically
during the decade in response to various export promotion measures introduced
in the early 1970s. Towards the end of the 1970s and through the early 1980s
as industrial sector growth deteriorated markedly, it was increasingly
recognized that the industrial sector was facing some major structural
problems. Past trade, financial and industrial policies geared to support
import substitution and capital intensive industries resulted in low effi-
ciency and misallocation of investment. In order to correct the import
substitution and capital-intensive biases of previous industrial and trade
policies and to promote those industries having comparative advantage, the
Government developed a phased policy reform program to be implemented over a
five year period. The first phase, which is already being implemented by the
Government, consists of a major tariff reform/trade liberalization program and
export promotion measures. The second phase, currently under preparation,
will cover investment incentives and their administration, industrial
restructuring and subsector programming. To support the Government in its
first phase of policy reform, the Bank approved in September 1980 a $200 mil-
lion Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL I). Support by the Bank of the second
phase of reforms is being considered under a proposed SAL II, currently under
preparation.
2.03      In conjunction with the trade and industrial policy reforms, in
1980-81, the Government introduced a comprehensive set of banking and finan-
cial sector reforms. These reforms included: liberalizing banking regula-
tions to allow different types of financial institutions to undertake expanded
activities, thereby increasing competition within the financial sector; and
lifting interest rate ceilings for loans over two years maturity, resulting in
positive real interest rates for the first time since 1978. These reforms
aimed at increasing savings and the availability of term-finance and reducing
fragmentation and inefficiency in financial institutions. The reforms were
supported by the Bank's Industrial Finance Project (Loan 1984-PH), approved in
May 1981.



- 3 -
2.04      In retrospect, the 1975-81 period during which the project was
implemented was both a, turbulent time for PDCP and a period of basic struc-
tural adjustment in the economy which required changes in PDCP's character.
The decline in the economy, starting in 1979 following the second round of oil
price increases and resulting in a lack of investment demand, significantly
slowed PDCP's loan commitment rate. In addition, declining demand, both
domestic and export, caused many of PDCP's borrowers to experience repayment
problems and resulted in a deterioration in the quality of PDCP's portfolio.
3. THE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
3.01       PDCP was established as a privately-owned corporation in 1963 with
active Bank Group assistance. Its main objectives are to: assist in the
creation, expansion and modernization of private production enterprises in the
Philippines; encourage private capital participation from local and foreign
sources; and develop local technical, financial and managerial knowledge. For
these purposes, PDCP-s Articles of Incorporation allow it to extend medium-
and long-term loans, invest in equity capital, underwrite or take up equity
and debt security issues, guarantee loans and provide managerial and technical
assistance to its borrowers. At the time of its establishment, IFC subscribed
P 800,000 ($205,200 equivalent at the exchange rate then prevailing) of
PDCP's initial capital stock which it subsequently sold at a profit in 1967.
PDCP's initial share capital of P 25.0 million has been periodically
increased and as of April 30, 1982, amounted to P 100.0 million ($11.8 mil-
lion equivalent).
3.02      The emergence of expanded commercial banks under the 1980 finan-
cial sector reforms (para. 2.03) made it necessary for PDCP to reassess its
organizational structure! and overall business strategy in order to retain
its competitive position in the country's financial system. PDCP's stock-
holders therefore approved in May 1981 a stock swap with the Far East Bank
and Trust Company (FEBTC) through which FEBTC would acquire at least 51% of
PDCP'6 outstanding shares. FEBTC is the sixth largest commercial bank in
the country and is a widely-held institution. As of April 30, 1982 FEBTC
held 87% of PDCP's shares; no other single stockholder, however, held more
than 1% of PDCP's shares (Annex 1). The tie-up with the FEBTC allowed both
PDCP and FEBTC to continue to operate separately and provided other added
advantages to both institutions: FEBTC would emerge as a strong universal
bank with a large capita:L base, extensive banking experience, and newly
gained expertise in project lending, while PDCP would continue to perform
its development finance i-unctions with the added advantage of having access
to funds from FEBTC./1 FEBTC's control of PDCP necessitated a revision of
PDCP's Statement of General Business Policies to delete the provision
/1 PDCP notes that the merger has helped to strengthen both institutions.
Cofinancing between FEBTC and PDCP is progressing, the management of
accounts is coordinated to provide full services to clients, and the
marketing of services of the whole group is now being done by both
PDCP and FEBTC loan officers (Attachment A, page 4).

calling for broad dissemination of PDCP's ownership. FEBTC, however, wculd
continue to keep ownership of its stock widely dispersed in compliance with
Central Bank regulations relevant to expanded commercial banks. The Bank
had been duly consulted by PDCP prior to the finalization of the tie-up and
approved the arrangement.
4. LOAN OBJECTIVES
4.01      The main objective of Loan 1052-PH was to transfer foreign
exchange resources to support the Government's policy of promoting the rapid
development of widely-based, export-oriented manufacturing industries by
financing the foreign exchange component of subprojects in the industrial,
agro-industrial, tourism and transport sectors. It was expected that the loan
would cover, on an approval basis, 65% of PDCP's foreign currency requirements
for a 1.5 year period (fourth-quarter 1974 to first-quarter 1976). A second
objective was to continue institution-building efforts with PDCP, particularly
to encourage PDCP to achieve greater regional dispersion of its investments
and to provide greater support to smaller industries. It was expected that
PDCP would achieve these objectives by: (a) continuing to lend to financially
and economically viable subprojects; (b) expanding its newly developed Small
Business Program; (c) helping to develop industrial estates; (d) taking equity
investments in private development banks (PDBs); and (e) establishing branch
offices.
5. UTILIZATION OF LOAN 1052-PH
Resource Transfer
5.01      Rate of Utilization.   As shown in Annex 3, the utilization of Loan
1052-PH was much slower than estimated at the time of appraisal. While it was
estimated that this loan of US$30 million would be fully disbursed by year-end
1978, as of that date only 49% of the loan had been disbursed. The reasons
for the slow rate of disbursement are complex and include (a) an uncertain
business climate caused by two rounds of oil price increases and resulting
high inflation; and (b) the fact that the hard currencies disbursed by the
Bank (Yen, Swiss Franc and Deutsch Mark) were appreciating considerably
against the peso thus causing Bank funds to be relatively expensive and
therefore less attractive to the end-user who carried the foreign exchange
risk (para. 5.12). In addition, with LIBOR funds going at 6-8% during this
time period, Off-Shore Banking Units (OBU-s) were increasingly more attractive
to borrowers, the result being much slower than projected growth in PDCP's



lending operations with prepayment and cancellation of loans increasing. Due
to the slow rate of disbursement, the original closing date of June 30, 1979
was first extended to June 30, 1980 and finally to June 30, 1981. On
September 15, 1981, $211,503 of the loan was cancelled.
5.02      Fund Allocation. As summarized in Annex 4, Loan 1052-PH was used
to finance seven "A" subprojects ($14.8 million) above the free limit of
$1.5 million /1 and thirty-nine "B" subprojects ($15.0 million) below the free
limit.  Within the "A" grouping of subprojects, one borrower (Mariwasa Manu-
facturing) received two separate subloans from the proceeds of Loan 1052-PH,
while for the "B" subprojects, three separate borrowers (L.S. Sarmiento,
Cagayan Electric Power and Light Co., and Philippine Development and
Industrial Corp.) each received two subloans. In most cases, the second sub-
loan to the same borrower was to provide financial support for an additional
expansion of the enterprise, although in one case the initial project
underwent revision and required supplemental funds. To ensure that the loan
would be used to finEnce a relatively large number of subprojects, a subloan
ceiling of $2.5 million was established. In the case of two subprojects,
however, this ceiling was waived by the Bank. The average subloan size
amounted to $647,576 which is satisfactory, especially when considering that
nearly half of the proceeds of the loan went to "A" subprojects. The Bank
reviewed all seven of the "A" subprojects and provided comments on four of the
seven projects. The Bank's comments were generally made to elicit more
detailed project information from PDCP and in all cases, PDCP satisfactorily
responded to the issues raised by the Bank.
Subproject Characteristics
5.03      The table below summarizes data on the subprojects financed under
Loan 1052-PH, while Annex 6 presents detailed information on the character-
istics of these subprojects.
/1 A subloan to one subproject (Gonzalo Puyat and Sons, Inc.) of $939,918
although technically below the free limit is an A subproject because the
subloan amount originally requested and approved by the Bank was

5.04      Regional Distribution.   At the time of appraisal for Loan 1052-PH,
PDCP was criticized, perhaps unjustly, for providing a large proportion of
its resources to subprojects located in Metro Manila. Actually, the trend of
resources going to Metro Manila had been very erratic: between 1963-71, 19%
of loan approvals (by amount) were for Metro Manila; in 1972 this decreased to
7% before rising sharply to 33% in 1973; in 1974, the percentage fell to 3% so
that for the period 1963-74, 17% of PDCP's loan approvals were for projects
located in Metro Manila.
5.05      In an effort to improve the regional distribution of its financing,
however, PDCP stated Its intentions at the time of appraisal to: (a) open
promotional branches in Davao, Cagayan de Oro and Cebu; (b) help develop
industrial estates for small- and medium-scale industries in Paete and Davao;
and (c) take up participation in the equity of local private development banks
(PDBs). PDCP's efforts at establishing branches have been most successful:
as of June 30, 1982, seven branches have been established and have proved to
be effective vehicles for promoting and financing small and medium industries
in the regions. Equity investments in selected PDBs have been limited, with
PDCP taking up 25% ownership of the Davao City Development Bank in 1975, 18%
of the Southern Negros Development Bank in 1976 and 30% of the Northern
Mindanao Development Bank in 1981, for an aggregated cost of P 4.6 million.
With regard to the development of industrial estates, PDCP's efforts in
identifying/developing industrial estates in Paete and Davao were
unsuccessful. In Paete, the estate plans were abandoned due to the prohi-
bitive cost of the major road construction which would have been required, the
difficulties encountered in trying to gain property ownership and the decline
of the market of wood furniture and carvings, the subsector the estate was
intending to promote. The Davao industrial estate was intended to promote the
region's metal working industries. The failure of the entrepreneurs in the
region to agree on a project site (due to various vested interests), coupled
with the world-wide recession resulted in PDCP's withdrawal from the project.
Government agencies, however, subsequently took over development of the
estate.
5.06      The regional distributon of subprojects financed under Loan 1052-PH
is given in Annex 7. On the whole, the distribution was satisfactory. While
Metro Manila (25.5%) and Southern Tagalog (5.3%) together accounted for 30.8%
of the subprojects receiving financing, 19% went to Central Luzon, 19.9% of
the loan proceeds were for projects in Central Mindanao, 12.5% went to
Northern Mindanao and 7.2% went to Southern Mindanao. This distribution is
especially good considering that regional dispersion of investment has
historically been a problem. The dependence of import substituting consumer
good industries on imported inputs created a strong incentive for these
industries to locate near Manila, the country's major port and largest
consumer market. Excluding resource based industries, nearly 90% of all
manufacturing value-added has been produced in and around the capital city.



- 8 -
5.07      Sectoral Distribution.   The sectoral distribution of projects
financed under Loan 1052-PH was evenly balanced and thus, satisfactory
(Annex 7). As a percentage of the total number of projects financed,
textiles and nonmetallic mineral products each accounted for 17%, followed by
wood/wood products with 13%, shipping and transportation project- with 11% and
chemicals/chemical products and electric power/ apparatus each receiving 6.5%.
The remaining subsectors each received about 4% of subprojects with the
exception of "miscellaneous" which accounted for 11%. In terms of amount
disbursed, the dominant subsectors were wood/wood products (29%), nonmetallic
mineral products (20%), mining (11%), chemicals/chemical products (10%) and
textiles (9%).
5.08      Interlocking Directorships and Repeater Loans.   At the time of
appraisal for Loan 1052-PH, PDCP was criticized for making too many loans to
companies who had Board members also sitting on PDCP's Board of Directors.
PDCP was also faulted for making repeater loans to the same borrower rather
than spreading out its resources to perhaps better stimulate industrial
development. Under Loan 1052-PH only two subloans (4% by number, 3% by amount
disbursed) went to companies having an interlocking directorship with PDCP.
With regard to repeater loans, 50% of the subborrowers had received previous
loans from PDCP, which is reasonable given the fact that the investment
climate was rather unfavorable and that PDCP, in order to limit its business
risks, prefers to lend to clients with whom it has had previous experience.
Operational and Economic Performance of Subprojects
5.09      Operational Results.   Operational data on the projects financed
under Loan 1052-PH are provided in Annexes 6, 8, and 9. Cost estimates made
by PDCP at the time of subproject appraisal were very realistic. While
19 subprojects had cost over-runs ranging from 0.1% to 18.6%, 20 subprojects
had actual costs of 0.1% to 66.0% less than the original cost estimate./1 The
cost over-runs were generally explained by changes in equipment or project
design or long delays in implementation; the large under-runs were generally
caused by the scaling-down of projects after subproject appraisal had been
completed. While 24 subprojects experienced delays in implementation ranging
from 1 to 34 months, 16 subprojects were completed on time or ahead of
schedule./1  The delays in project implementation were due mainly to:    (a) the
protracted time required by some borrowers to comply with predisbursement
conditions; (b) changes in, or problems with the equipment supplier; and (c)
the recessionary climate which caused borrowers to delay acquisition of fixed
assets. With the exception of those borrowers who delayed project
implementation due to their inability to meet PDCP's collateral requirements
or predisbursement conditions, most of the factors causing delays were outside
PDCP's control. Annex 5 provides information regarding the subprojects which
had implementation delays of six months or longer. Estimated and actual sales
/1 For the remaining subprojects, data was either not available or the
subproject is still in the process of being implemented.



- 9 -
data were available for 34 subprojects. As shown in Annex 8, actual total
sales for both the first and second year of operations were marginally more
than PDCP's appraisal estimates. Actual profits for the first and second
years of operation, however, were significantly less than estimated profits.
Only three of the thirty-four projects for which data were available had
actual profits exceeding estimates for the second year of operations, the
remaining experiencing losses to varying degrees, such that total aggregate
losses for the second year of operations amounted to P 6.2 million,
compared to estimated profits of P 84.7 million. It should be noted,
however, that neither the first nor second years of operation are truely
representative of a project's profitability as these initial start-up years
are usually the most (lifficult in terms of adjusting pricing policies to
actual production cosl:s. In the case of many of the subprojects financed
under this loan, this adjustment process was particularly difficult given
the increase in oil prices coupled with rising inflation and a deteriorating
business climate. In addition, actual profits are often understated for tax
purposes.  As indicated by the FRRs given in Annex 9, however, these initial
losses did not imply financial disaster for the subprojects financed under
the loan.  Ex-post FRRs were calculated for 27 subprojects.    While the FRRs
for six of the subprojects were negative, the remaining subprojects had FRRs
ranging from 1.3% to cver 200%, with a weighted average of 35.4%. This
suggests that while the first few years of operations may have been
difficult for many subprojects in terms of profitability, the subprojects
were able to overcome these problems and were indeed financially viable.
5.10      Economic Performance.   Details of the economic performance of the
subprojects financed under Loan 1052-PH are presented in Annex 9.    Ex-post
ERRs were calculated for 23 subprojects. Three of the subprojects had nega-
tive ERRs while the remaining 20 subprojects had ERRs ranging from 6.4% to
260%.  The weighted average ERR for the 20 subprojects was 45.3%.    Based on
data available for 38 subprojects financed under the loan, a total of 8,420
jobs were created at an average cost per job of P 73,694 or $US9,328./1 By
comparison, for 47 subloans made by the Development Bank of the Philippines
under Loan 1190-PH (effective April 1976), the average cost per job was
about $24,500. The relatively low average cost per job value indicates that
very few capital intensive projects were financed under Loan 1052-PH, although
most of subprojects financed belonged to medium-to-large-scale industries.
Estimated and actual data on export sales were available for 34 subprojects
and are summarized in Annex 9. While export sales were projected to
represent 43.7% of total sales, they actually amounted to 36.8% which is quite
satisfactory as the projects were operating in a recessionary period during
which export demand was not very strong. Value-added for 28 subprojects
amounted to P 314.9 million compared to estimates of P 348.8 million.
/1 Based on 1981 exchange rate P 7.90 = US$1.00.

Status of Subloans
5.11      As of December 31, 1981, 23 loans were in arrears, 16 were up-to-
date in terms of repayment and 7 had heen either repaid in full or prepaid
(Annex 10). Six subloans had been rescheduled, of which four were once again
in arrears.  Total arrears of principal and interest amounted to P 42.1 mil--
lion, representing 10%. of the principal outstanding for subloans financed
under Loan 1052-PH. The level of arrears for these 46 subloans is about the
same as for PDCP's overall lending operations and reflects the deteriorating
business climate which has prevailed over the last few years.
Effective Cost of Bank Funds to Subborrowers
5.12      PDCP has estimated the effective cost of Bank funds to its sub-
borrowers under Loan 1052-PH by using a discounted cash flow analysis (Annex
11). The effective rate of 20.4% compared to the nominal rate of 12.5-16.0o%/l
represents the average annual borrowing cost to PDCP subborrowers over a
period, starting with the first disbursement and assuming that the outstanding
balance of the loan is repaid as of January 15, 1982. The high effective cost
of Bank funds caused some subborrowers under Loan 1052-PH to prepay their
subloans. Since this loan was made, the Bank introduced currency pooling
arrangements, thereby correcting to a certain extent, the inequitable burdetn
among Bank borrowers resulting from the Bank's currency disbursement
practices.
6. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Institutional Aspects
6.01      Management/Organization.   PDCP's Board of Directors consists of
11 members, 9 of whom are also incumbent directors of FEBTC. Despite the
FEBTC control, PPCP is expected to be guided by its own corporate goals and
will continue to be active both in development banking and investment
hanking activities. DDCPss organizational structure and management team
have basically remained the same since the appraisal of Loan 1052-PH.
PDCP's top management, consisting of its President, Executive Vice President
and Senior Vice "resident, has recently been strengthened by the addition of
another Senior Vice President. In an effort to decentralize and strengthen
middle management, four new Assistant Vice President positions have also
been established. PDCP has divided its operations among eleven departments
which form three groups (Operations, Project Management and Administration,
/1 PDCP's interest rate to subborrowers, including its service fee, ranged
from 12.5% to 16% over the time taken to disburse the proceeds of
Loan 1052-PH (Annex 2).



- 11 -
and Accounting and Finance) each of which is headed by either an Executive
or Senior Vice President. PDCP recognizes that the current organizational
structure places a great deal of responsibility on the Vice President
heading the Project Management and Administration Group, considering the
growing volume and intensity of project supervision required. Although PDCP
appointed a full-time Department Head for the Project Management Group in
June 1982,/l, the burden on the Senior Vice President remains the same.
6.02      Staffing.   Between 1974-81, PDCP's staff increased from 157 (101 of
whom were professionals) to 280 (185 of whom are professionals). Despite this
increase, the adequacy of staff, particularly project supervision staff who
number only 28, requires further management review. The rate of staff
turn-over has been a historical problem for PDCP; while the staff turn-over
rate was about 10% in 1974, it was 17% in 1981. The chief reasons for staff
turn-over have remained consistent over the years, however: strong demand
from other financial institutions for PDCP-trained professionals, and the
higher positions and therefore higher financial emoluments offered by
competitors to PDCP's experienced staff. PDCP management feels that as long
as there is demand for people well-trained in the field of project finance
there will always be staff turn-over. PDCP has, however, reviewed its salary
structure to ensure its competitiveness and expanded its middle-management
positions to provide some promotional avenues for its more senior and
experienced staff. In addition, to diminish the problems caused by turn-over,
PDCP operates an active recruitment program and has a well-established
training system for new staff.
Standards and Procedures
6.03      Operating Policies.   PDCP's Statement of General Business Policies,
adopted in March 1964, was last amended in April 1981, so as to be consistent
with the amended Articles of Incorporation brought about by PDCP's tie-up with
FEBTC (para. 3.02). PDCP's operations have always been guided by these
policies and no significant deviation has been noted.
6.04      Project Appraisal.   PDCP-s project appraisal procedures are well
established and are consistently applied by its staff, resulting in project
appraisal reports which are generally thorough and informative. As can be
seen in Annexes 8 and 9, however, actual subproject performance under Loan
1052-PH, was lower than appraisal estimates in terms of profitability,
although, on average, the financial and economic rates of return were
satisfactory (para. 5.09-5.10). While the appraisal estimates may have been
adversely affected by the relatively poor economic climate prevailing when the
projects became fully operational, it also appears that PDCP's evaluation of
projects tended to be somewhat optimistic. Optimistic projections may have
resulted in PDCP providing shorter grace and repayment periods which could
help push a project into arrears. PDCP's management has also recognized a
problem in appraisal of projects, particularly in light of the growing number
of projects in arrears (para. 7.14), and is working to identify the critical
factors which spell success or failure for a project. As an immediate step to
/1 See Attachment A, page 3.



- 12 -
strengthen the quality of project evaluation and also achieve greater impact
on improving project design, PDCP has recently formed a Preappraisal Review
Committee (comprising the heads of the Operations and Administrative Group,
the Project Evaluation, Project Management and Business Development
Departments and the relevant industry specialist of the Project lanagement
Group), to screen all applications for assistance prior to undertaking any
extensive evaluation. Using this procedure, the collective experience and
judgment of the committee members is pooled to identify the possible strengths
and weaknesses and potential problems of the project. Since 1979, PDCP has
also routinely undertaken sensitivity analysis for subprojects receiving loans
of $500,000 or more. l/
6.05      Project Supervision.   Responsibility for project supervision, which
starts with loan signing, rests with the Project Management Group.    Nearly all
IBRD appraisal and supervision missions to PDCP emphasized the need to
strengthen the staffing and management of this group.   The ratio of staff to
projects, however, has remained relatively constant since 1974 with the number
of staff increasing from 15 in 1974 to 28 in 1981 and the number of outstan-
ding loans increasing from 312 in 1974 to 538 as of year-end 1981.    As can be
seen in Chart No. 1, since 1974 the management and organization of the Project
Management Group (PMG) has also become more complex with specialization
(according to degree of project problems) and additional managers being
introduced. Despite these improvements, PDCP's project supervision calls for
further strengthening. PDCP-s management recognizes this and is currently
trying to recruit a person to head PMG on a full time basis and is considering
the need to introduce additional staff (para. 6.02). In addition, PDCP has:
established a separate unit within PMG for small and medium industry project
supervision; introduced the position of Collection Coordinator to assist in
collection activities; introduced a computerized integrated billing system;
and established an acquired assets management unit. PDCP's management feels
that the combined effect of these changes will be to strengthen project
supervision thereby eventually improving collection performance and reducing
the level of past due accounts. In its letter to the Bank of May 2, 1983
(Attachment A), PDCP indicated additonal organizational changes contemplated
for May 1983, including: (a) dividing PMG into two groups, project monitor-
ing/supervision and problem projects/acquired assets; (b) increasing PMG
staff by nine persons and (c) increasing the active participation of senior
executives in rehabilitating past due accounts.
Resource Mobilization
6.06      Domestic Currency.   Between 1974-77 PDCP relied essentially on its
equity to meet its domestic currency requirements. Starting in 1978,
however, when the Central Bank imposed a 16% ceiling on the yields of money
market operations, thereby increasing the availability of funds for place-
ment in longer-term operations, PDCP initiated a program of borrowing,
through the issuance of its own promissory notes, mediumr to long-term funds
from savings banks and insurance companies. As shown in Annex 12, these
domestic currency borrowings amounted to P 26 million in 1978, peaked at
P 43 million in 1979, and started to decline significantly in 1980.    The
/l See Attachment A, page 2.



- 13 -
decline in term borrowings of domestic resources was due chiefly to an
interest rate structure which did not allow PDCP to raise these resources at
a cost low enough to enable it to lend at a reasonably positive margin.
While domestic resources have been readily available for the smaller projects
which PDCP is able to 100% refinance with the CB's Industrial Guarantee and
Loan Fund (IGLF), peso lending for larger projects has been constrained both
by PDCP's inability to raise substantial domestic currency resources and by
its relatively poor collection performance (Annex 24). In order to provide
some domestic currency financing to larger-scale borrowers, PDCP, in 1980,
introduced a scheme whereby its loans to the borrower were refinanced through
the sale of the borrower-company's long-term commercial paper. In addition,
PDCP has had to rely increasingly on its syndication operations, which have
increased from P 50.2 million in 1977 to P 198.6 million in 1981 (Annex
15). With respect to meeting future domestic currency resource requirements,
PDCP plans to raise funds by gaining access to new resource mobilization
programs with FEBTC and to gradually build-up its paid-in capital from P 100
million in 1981 to P 190 million by 1986.
6.07      Foreign Currency.   At the time of appraisal for this loan, it was
noted that the administered interest rate structure made it impossible for
PDCP to mobilize long-term resources carrying a fixed interest rate from
foreign capital markets, even through a syndicated arrangement with IFC. It
was therefore necessary for PDCP to rely chiefly on the Bank and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) for its foreign currency requirements. In addition
to Loan 1052-PH, the Bank made a fifth loan to PDCP in 1978 (Loan 1514-PH).
In 1981, PDCP was allocated $60 million by the Central Bank, $36 million of
which was from the $150 million Industrial Finance Loan (Loan 1984-PH) the
Bank made to the Central Bank in 1981, and $24 million of which was from the
Central Bank's own commercial borrowings. During appraisal for Loan 1984-PH,
it was determined that the Central Bank would be able to command better terms
and conditions for borrowings from foreign markets than would the private
financial institutions on their own. Since 1969, ADB has made a total of five
loans to PDCP, the last: coming in 1980. In 1977, PDCP received a DM 5 million
(US$2.1) loan from the German Development Bank (DEG) and in 1978 a $10 million
equivalent loan from a syndicate of banks led by the Bank of Tokyo (BOT) was
arranged. The BOT loan, which represents PDCP's only borrowing from
nonofficial sources, was difficult to utilize, however, as the minimum
disbursement was fixed at $1.0 million and the interest mark-up on the loan to
PDCP was set at 1.25% above LIBOR. For its projected foreign resource
requirements, PDCP expects to continue to rely heavily on Bank and ADB
support, although borrowing from some unspecified commercial sources is also
anticipated. A summary of PDCP's foreign currency borrowings is given in
Annex 13.
7. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF PDCP
Operational Performance
7.01      Overall Lending Operations.   The level of PDCP's lending operations
projected at the time of appraisal of Loan 1052-PH for the period 1974-78 and
the actual levels achieved are presented in Annex 14. With regard to total



- 14 -
approvals, commitments and disbursements, the actual results fall consistently
short of the projected amounts for each year in the 1974-78 period. The
actual approvals, commitments and disbursements relating to PDCP-s foreign
lending operations were considerably below the projected levels. With the
exception of 1975 when actual total foreign currency disbursements reach
103.4% of the project level, actual disbursements amounted to only about
20-30% of projected levels for the 1975-78 period. An explanation of the
wide discrepancy between projected and actual operations is that the
projections made in 1974 were premised on the expectation that the healthy
economy of the early 1970s would continue in the following years. At that
time, a continuing increase in investment was forecast due to: (a) Govermnent
emphasis on developing export-oriented manufacturing industries; (b) advanced
investment plans of local companies in anticipation of much higher equipment
costs in the future; and (c) the shift in foreign investment (particularly
Japanese investment) from Hongkong, Taiwan and Korea to the Philippines.
However, the unexpected and sharp increase in oil prices and resulting upsurge
in inflation and interest rates adversely affected investment plans, thereby
severely curtailing borrowings from local firms and effectively reducing the
rate of growth of PDCP's approvals, commitments and disbursements particularly
those relating to its foreign currency lending operations. Although PDCP
introduced measures to increase its lending operations, such as providing
working capital and small- and medium-industry financing and expanding its
branch network, it was not able to meet the forecast levels of operation until
1978 when total investment approvals amounted to P 488.2 million compared to
a projected level of P 476.9 million.
7.02      PDCP's lending operations for the five year period 1977-81 are
summarized in Annex 15. As noted above, lending operations began to pick-up
in 1978 with total loan approvals amounting to P 321.0 million compared to
P 81.9 million in 1977. Similarly, equity investments increased from
P 4.3 million to P 11.8 million, and syndications rose from P 50.2 mil-
lion to P 112.0 million. Loan and equity investments and syndications
continued to grow steadily in 1979. Although loan approvals decreased to
P 288.7 million in 1980, total approvals (loans, syndications, guarantees
and equity investments) increased by 86% due to a very large (483%) increase
in syndications. The huge increase in syndications is explained, in part, by
PDCP's lack of domestic currency resources (para. 6.06).    In 1981, however,
syndications decreased by nearly two-thirds from the previous year's
approvals. While loan approvals recovered somewhat in 1981 (P 316.8 mil-
lion), equity investments fell from P 28.2 million in 1980 to P 7.6 mil-
lion in 1981 due largely to PDCP's domestic currency constraint.
7.03      Small Business Program.   Under its Small Business Program (SBP),
PDCP finances industrial projects meeting the Government s asset-based
definition of small and medium industries, /1 as well as agricultural
/1 Currently borrowers having assets of up to P 2.5 million are
classified as small-scale industry and those with assets up to
P 10 million are classified as medium-scale industry.



- 15 -
projects. Although the SBP was launched in 1972, it gained momentum after
September 1976 when PDCP was accredited with the Central Bank's Industrial
Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF). Through IGLF, PDCP is able to obtain 100%
refinancing of the industrial loans it makes to small- and medium-scale
borrowers. PDCP's SBP has been growing steadily since 1972-73 when 13 loans
were approved for P 2.1 million. In 1980, 49 loans for P 42.4 million
were approved, representing 15% of PDCP's total loan approvals for the year.
Depending on project location, PDCP's SBP loans are processed both at the head
office and the branches and PDCP's branches have contributed significantly to
the increase in approvals under the Program. Although SBP loan approvals
decreased by 5% in 1981, this is explained by PDCP's domestic currency
constraint which effectively restricted PDCP to making only industrial loans
eligible for refinancing under IGLF.
7.04      Equity Investments.   PDCP's direct equity investment operations
account for only a small proportion (3.6% of investments outstanding in
1981) of its total operations. With the current uncertainty in the economy,
PDCP has adopted a cautious attitude in the acquisition of new equity
investments, which accounts for the recent decline in approvals. PDCP's
outstanding equity portfolio as of year-end 1981 is summarized in Annex 16.
Due to the depressed condition of the equity market, PDCP's outstanding
equity portfolio of P 52.7 million has depreciated to P 47.5 million
(book value) representing a 10% decline of acquisition cost. The allowance
for decline in market value for PDCP's equity investments is adequate to
cover this depreciation, however.
7.05      Guarantee Operations.   As seen in Annex 17, PDCP's guarantee oper-
ations have been erratic over the 1977-81 period. PDCP's guarantees
normally supplement its direct financial assistance and are issued against
suppliers' credits or peso accommodations of local financial institutions.
However, in certain instances they have been used to help clients finance
prepayment of their foreign exchange obligations to PDCP, the purpose being
to retain business relations and compensate for the loss of future interest
income on the loan being prepaid. As of December 31, 1981, outstanding
guarantees amounted to P 96.2 million. As the gurantees are fully secured
and experience has been good (as of December 31, 1981, there have been no
advances on guarantees), PDCP does not make provisions against losses on
guarantees.
7.06      Syndications and Underwriting Operations.    Through its syndication
operations, which began in 1969, PDCP is able to maximize its assistance to
clients with viable projects without violating the prudent exposure limits
for a single enterprise established in its Statement of Business Policies.
Also, as a leading investment house in the Philippines, PDCP resorted to
this device to mitigate its own domestic currency resource constraint. Over
the 1980-81 period, PDCP's syndications fluctuated greatly in volume, due
largely to the fact that 1980 was an exceptionally good year (para. 7.02).
PDCP's underwriting/private placement operations have also fluctuated over
the 1977-81 period (Annex 15).   In 1981, despite the unattractive conditions
affecting the capital market, PDCP was able to underwrite seven debt
security issues for P 25.3 million.



- 16 -
7.07      Money Market Operations.   PDCP originally initiated its short-term
money market operations to maximize the yield on its liquid resources and
tap excess liquidity in the market for channeling to businesses temporarily
in need of additional working capital. For the period 1977-81, PDCP's money
market borrowings as a percentage of total assets increased stee'ily from 7.1%
in 1977 to 17.1% in 1980 before deceasing to 14.3% in 1981. Income from money
market operations as a percentage of total income increased from 4.7% in 1977
to 9.1% in 1980, before sharply falling to 2.1% in 1981. Over time, due to
the deteriorating quality of its portfolio and poor loan collections, PDCP
has had to use its short-term money market funds to cover maturing debt
liabilities. As of December 31, 1981, the variance between the sum of PDCP's
cash assets and short-term investments less bills payable amounted to a
negative P 71.3 million; the first negative varience experienced by PDCP
occurred in July 1979 and amounted to P 15.7 million.
7.08      Loan Characteristics.   The sectoral distribution of PDCP's loan
portfolio has been historically dominated by loans to the manufacturing
sector, which accounted for 62% of the loans approved by PDCP between 1963-81
(Annex 18). While loans to certain manufacturing industries or loans to other
sectors (i.e. transportation, communications) may have accounted for a large
share of approvals in any given year, the overall loan portfolio is quite well
diversified. Over the period 1963-81, 61.6% of the cummulative total of
PDCP's loan approvals (by amount), went to the manufacturing sector. Within
this sector, projects producing non-metallic mineral products accounted for
12.5% of approvals, followed by chemicals/chemical products (12.0%) and
wood/wood products (8.2%). Other sectors receiving a significant proportion
of PDCP's approvals (by amount) included: transportation (12%), communication
(6.9%) and mining (5.8%). In line with industrial development in the
Philippines, loans for projects located in Metro Manila have represented as
much as 45% of PDCP's annual approvals (1980) but surprisingly account for
only 30% of approvals for the period 1963-81. The introduction of PDCP
branch offices has helped improve the regional distribution of the projects
it finances. PDCP opened its first branch office in 1974 in Davao, and
since then has established six other offices throughout the Philippines
(para. 8.02). In conjunction with its tie-up with FEBTC, PDCP's Articles of
Incorporation have been amended to allow it to undertake lending operations in
Asean countries, such that in 1981, 23% of loan approvals (by amount) went to
projects in Asean countries,/1 25% went to Metro Manila and 24% went to
projects in Luzon (excluding Metro Manila). The average size of PDCP-s loans
has grown steadily from P 2.4 million for the period 1963-78 to P 4.4
million for 1981, reflecting, largely, the affects of inflation.
/1 PDCP's participation in these projects represented part of the
Philippine contribution to officially designated ASEAN projects; Bank
funds are not involved in the financing of these projects.



- 17 -
7.09      According to its Statement of General Business Policies, a major
objective of PDCP is the development of private productive enterprises
through term and equity financing. As shown in Annex 18, however, PDCP has
always tended to finance expansion projects rather than new projects. This
preference has been even more pronounced in recent years (1979-81) when
loans for expansion projects represented from 78% to 95% of annual loan
approvals. PDCP ex]?lains its high investment in expansion projects as a
result of its being a private corporation: in order to ensure its stock-
holders a reasonable return, PDCP is willing to assume the risks inherent in
new project financing only to a limited extent. This is particularly true
during recessionary periods when expansion projects of existing clientele
provide a much safer form of lending.
Financial Performance
7.10      Financial Position.   PDCP's projected and actual balance sheets
for the period 1974-78 are presented in Annex 19 while audited balance
sheets for the period 1977-81 may be seen in Annex 20. The growth of PDCP's
total assets has been very erratic since 1974. While actual total assets
exceeded projections in 1974 and 1975, for the three year period 1976-78,
the projected levels of total assets were not achieved, due largely to the
lower than expected growth in PDCP's lending operations (para. 7.01). The
slow growth in PDCP's loan portfolio was caused by the stagnation in lending
operations and some large loan prepayments in advance of maturity. For the
period 1978-80, PDCP's total assets grew impressively by an average annual
rate of 18%, reflecting PDCP's successes in both short- and long-term bor-
rowings. For 1981, however, total assets grew by only 7% which is attribu-
table to the prevailing recessionary climate. Balance sheet items showing
notable growth over the last few years include: (a) short-term money market
borrowings which have steadily increased from P 64.3 million in 1977 to a
high of P 254.2 million in 1980 before decreasing to P 226.9 million in
1981; (b) long-term borrowings which were static at P 591.8 million for
1977-78 but then steadily increased to P 994.7 million in 1981; and (c)
acquired assets which first appeared on PDCP's balance sheet in 1980 at
P 17.6 million and increased to P 76.0 million in 1981. The increases
in short-term money Market borrowings and acquired assets reflect the
collection difficulties PDCP is currently experiencing which stems from the
general deterioration of the economic environment.
7.11      Capital Structure and Liquidity.   PDCP's paid-in capital which
remained at P 73.4 million from 1976-80, increased to P 100.0 million in
1981; total equity, however, has increased from P 123.7 million in 1976 to
P 187.1 million in 1981. PDCP's total debt/equity ratio,/1 though steadily
increasing to 8.0:1 in 1981, has remained within the 10:1 limit established by
PDCP. The long-term debt/equity ratio has also steadily increased and
/1 Total debt and long-term debt include guarantees.



- 18 -
amounted to 6.5:1 in 1981 which is still within the contractual limit of 8:1
agreed to with the Bank under Loan 1984-PH. PDCP-s short-term debt/equity
ratio has been climbing from 0.7:1 in 1977 to 1.7:1 in 1980 and 1.5:1 in 1981,
reflecting the pattern and magnitude of its short-term borrowings. PDCP's
liquidity position as measured by the difference between current assets
(excluding maturities on term loans) and current liabilities (excluding
current maturities on term debt) has been erratic. While the difference was
P 49 million (5.6% of total assets) in 1976 and P 27.4 million (3% of
total assets) in 1977, by 1981 it was only P 3.5 million (0.2% of total
assets). PDCP has maintained a net liquidity ratio of at least 4% of total
assets as agreed with IFC. Under loan 1514-PH, the Bank and PDCP agreed to a
minimum liquidity ratio of 1.15 times current liabilities (with principal and
interest overdue more than 180 days being deducted from current assets).
Based on 1981 audit figures, this ratio amounted to only 1.11:1.    PDCP's
tight liquidity position is largely due to its poor collection performance
(para. 7.14) which is forcing PDCP to utilize its short-term money market
borrowings not for short-term investments but instead for making good on the
past dues of its borrowers.
7.12      Profitability.   PDCP's projected and actual income statements for
the period 1974-81 and audited income statements for the period 1977-81 are
found in Annexes 21 and 22, respectively. While PDCP's gross income grew at
an average annual rate of 16.5% for the period 1977-81, net income grew only
marginally during 1977-80 (averaging 7.7% p.a.) and actually decreased in
1981 to P 17.5 million (36% less than the 1980 value).    Financial expenses
as a percentage of gross income steadily increased from 56.4% in 1977 to
72.8% in 1981 which, in part, is explained by the cost of PDCP's short-term
"money market" borrowings which was not adequately offset by interest income
from its money market investments. As a result of the increasing level of
arrears (para. 7.14), PDCP also substantially increased its provisions for
doubtful accounts by P 9.9 million in 1981.
7.13      Audit.   As always in the past, PDCP's auditor, Sycip, Gorres,
Velayo & Co., issued its report for 1981 operations without qualification.
7.14      Quality of Portfolio.   Since 1978, when PDCP-s collections
amounted to 87% of the amount of principal and interest falling due and past
due, collection performance has deteriorated with yearly collections amcunting
to around 67% of the amounts due and past due (Annex 24). While collection of
current due principal and interest were 77% and 84% respectively, in 1981,
collections of overdue principal and interest came to only 13% and 28%. The
status of PDCP's loan portfolio for the period 1977-81 is given in Annexes 25
and 26. Due to the deteriorating collection performance, loan arrears
steadily increased from P 57.2 in 1977, representing 7.7% of the loan
portfolio, to P 134.5 million in 1981, representing 9.7% of the loan
portfolio. The portfolio affected by arrears also increased substantially
from 24%, by amount, and 53%, by number, in 1977 to 37%, by amount, and 67% by
number in 1981. While arrears of more than 12 months have declined from 3.7%



- 19 -
of the outstanding loan portfolio in 1978 and 1979 to 3.1% in 1980 and 3.3% in
1981, this is most probably due to the extensive reschedulings which occurred
in 1980-81./l   The increasing level of arrearages is attributable to several
factors. The worldwide economic recession and tightening of domestic credit
following the 1981 financial crisis resulted in a number of PDCP clients
facing liquidity problems. The appreciation of foreign exchange obligations
also caused major repayment problems for many of PDCP-s clients as all foreign
exchange risk is borne by the borrower. In addition, several factors within
PDCP's control also contributed to the arrears problem. First, a Vice
President solely in charge of the Project Management Group (PMG) has yet to be
appointed and management of this important group is left to the Senior Vice
President who is also in charge of Administration. Also as pointed out in
para. 6.07, the PMG has gone through a number of organizational changes over
the last few years but still appears to remain understaffed and subject to
staff turnover. Finally, overly optimistic projections prepared during
project appraisals resulting in shorter than required grace periods, may have
added to the arrears problem. As of December 31, 1981, PDCP's provisions for
losses amounted to P 21.1 million (1.8% of the total loan portfolio
outstanding), a level considered adequate by its auditors. The level of
provisions is based on a detailed review of the portfolio taking into account
past collection experience, collateral values,/2 and other information
important to the project and its proponent.    For 1981, PDCP had one write-off
for P 12.6 million.
8. DEVELOPMENT ROLE OF PDCP
8.01       In the nineteen years of its existence, PDCP has developed into a
mature DFC and has made a significant contribution toward the growth of the
country's private industry. PDCP is second only to DBP as the country's most
important source of long-term finance for industry. As a matter of policy,
PDCP closely alligns its operations to the economic priorities set by the
Government. PDCP's appraisals of projects are comprehensive and PDCP is
/1  In 1980, 42 loans representing P 81.5 million in principal outstand-
ing (7.4% of the total loan portfolio) were rescheduled; in 1981,
44 loans representing P 68.9 million in principal outstanding (6%
of the total loan portfolio) were rescheduled.
/2  For its regular lending operations, PDCP's loans are adequately secured by
collateral (fixed assets and real estate) which is conservatively valued
by PDCP; in the case of its IGLF loans, when the borrower does not have
sufficient collateral, PDCP requires that he obtain an IGLF collateral -
short guarantee.



- 20 -
selective in its choice of projects, assisting only those which satisfy its
criteria for financial, managerial, technical, market and economic viability.
PDCP assists both large- and small-scale industries, including projects
relating to mining, public utilities, transport and manufacturing. In
addition to providing financial assistance, PDCP has also served as a valuable
training institution, as reflected by the number of PDCP-trained staff
actively recruited by other financial institutions (para. 6.02) and by the
willingness of PDCP's management to accept staff from development finance
companies of other countries for training with PDCP.
8.02      Economic Impact.   Over the period 1963-81, PDCP assisted 1,089 pro-
jects by providing financial assistance amounting to P 4.9 billion (inclu-
ding equity, syndication and guarantee operations). Based on appraisal
estimates, the investment requirements of these projects amounted to
P 9.5 billion of which P 2.7 billion (28%) was financed directly by PDCP.
The total amount of incremental employment generated by PDCP directly-assisted
projects since 1963 is estimated at about 58,600. Since 1963, PDCP assisted
projects have generated about P 12.8 billion in sales, contributing
P 5.3 billion to the country's net domestic product. Because PDCP gives
priority to projects which earn or save foreign exchange, the foreign exchange
impact of PDCP-s directly-assisted projects is significant: the cummulative
total of foreign exchange earnings/savings as of year-end 1981 is estimated at
$432.4 million. In a continuing effort to improve the regional distribution
of its investments, in 1981, PDCP opened a branch office in Bacolod City, the
center of the country's sugar industry. This brought the total number of
PDCP-s branch offices to seven, the others being located in Davao, Cagayan de
Oro, Iloilo, Cebu, Legazpi and Dagupan.
8.03       Development Strategy.   In early 1980, PDCP formulated its second
development strategy which is intended to guide PDCP's operations through the
1980s. Key elements of the strategy include PDCP's intentions to:
(a) increase its contribution to domestic capital formation by establishing
higher targets of financial assistance to productive projects; (b) gear its
financial expertise to resource mobilization activities to meet the
increasingly more complex funding requirements of large industrial ventures;
(c) diversify its portfolio to reflect a more regionally oriented distribution
of assisted projects; (d) continue expanding its assistance to small and
medium-sized industries; and (c) continue to provide training opportunities
for its own staff and to disseminate its expertise to the private and
government sectors.
9. CONCLUSIONS
9.01       Overall, PDCP has been quite successful in meeting the lending
objectives established under Loan 1052-PH. Although disbursement under the
loan was slower than anticipated at the time of project appraisal, PDCP was
successful at transferring foreign exchange resources to support industrial

development.   While many of the subprojects financed under this loan suffered
initial operating problems, by and large, the subprojects eventually proved to
be economically and financially viable, as confirmed by ex-post ERR and FRR
calculations which averaged 45.3% and 35.4%, respectively. The subprojects
financed had the added merit of being relatively labor-intensive and many were
export-oriented.   Since 1974, DDCP has also been most successful in estab-
lishing its presence in the regions. The establishment of seven branch
offices, starting in 1974, illustrates PT)CP's commitment to promoting indus-
trial development throughout the country. PDCP's branch network, in combin-
ation with its dynamic Small Business Program, have improved the overall
regional distribution of subprojects financed by PDCP, while at the same time
providing long-term resources and project counselling to borrowers who would
have previously had to rely on short-term, collateral-based lending from local
commercial banks.
9.02       PDCP continues to be a well-managed financial institution.     While
staff turn-over has presented PDCP with some problems, these are adequately
being addressed through an active recruitment and training program. Project
appraisal standards have been satisfactory, although greater moderation is
recommended with regard to projections of profits and rates of return.
Supervision of projects has historically been a problem for PDCP, and
despite numerous organizational and procedural changes, PDCP's Project
Management Group still needs to be strengthened further.
9.03       PDCP's financial performance has been seriously affected by the
adverse economic environment and the resulting deterioration of its port-
folio; this matter will continue to require the serious attention of PDCP's
management. Decreasing collections have been compensated for by short-term
borrowings which are now beginning to have repercussions on PDCP-s liquidity
position. Assuming that the projects currently in arrears are not going to
find solutions to their repayment problems in the short run, PDCP's manage-
ment must find ways to raise long-term domestic currency resources in order
to meet PDCP's repayment obligations without further damaging its liquidity
position.
9.n4      Due to the increased competition in the financial sector resulting
from the 1980 financial sector reforms, PDCP was forced to enter into a tie-up
arrangement with FEBTC in order to emerge as part of an expanded banking
facility. A major advantage of this tie-up arrangement is that PDCP will now
have a source of long-term peso resources, although the particulars regarding
peso borrowings from FEBTC remain to be worked out./l Such borrowings would
not only help remove the peso lending constraint under which PDCP has operated
for the last few years, but they would also help decrease PDCP's dependence on
short-term borrowings, thereby improving its liquidity position.
/1 PDCP stated that FEBTC's domestic currency resources remain unavailable
to PDCP due to a limitation in the General Bank Act. PDCP is currently
investigating the possibility of receiving an exemption from this
limitation from the Monetary Board     (Attachment A, page 4).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Reasons for Delay in Completion of Subprojects /1
1. Acoje idiniag Co., Inc. (Estimated - January 1978; Actual - January 1979)
The one-year delay in project start-up was brought about by two
events: (a) loan signing took place almost ten months later than projected
due to prolonged discussion over terms and conditions; and (b) a market slump
beginning 1978 forced management to delay acquisition of fixed assets.
2. Pilipino Telephone Corporation (Estimated - March 1977; Actual -
September 1977)
The project was delayed six months due to the supplier's error.
Instead of a 1,200-2 party line inside plant capacity, ITT delivered a 600-2
party line inside plant. This was subsequently corrected by the supplier.
3. Royal Porcelain (Estimated - May 1977; Actual - September 1978)
Construction delays were due to technical problems: delay in the
supply of special form bricks for the kiln, misunderstanding with Japanese
supplier of their kiln during construction and test firing.
4. Nitro Chemical Phils. (Estimated - September 1977; Actual - March 1978)
Construction delays were caused by the late arrival of the Taiwan-
ese equipment and the modifications incorporated by Taiwanese technicians
into the building.
5. Sherwill Plastics, Inc. (Estimated - March 1978; Actual - September 1979)
Construction delay was due to modifications in the design and size
of the factory building, late arrivals of imported machinery and bad weather.
6. J&C Deep Sea Fishing (Estimated - October 1978; Actual - June 1979)
The project was delayed due to the following factors: (a) late
compliance with the predisbursement requirements, specifically the completion
of the mortgage documents; (b) contractor's delay in the completion of con-
struction of the lightboat; and (c) inability of suppliers to deliver the
machineries and fishing equipment on time.
/a Delays of six months or longer.

7. Pennell Commercia'L Corporation (Estimated - July 1978; Actual - May 1979)
The project was delayed due to the time required to comply with
predisbursement conditions which led to the delay in opening of the Letters
of Credit.
8. Falcon Minerals, ]:nc. (Estimated - August 1980; Actual - not yet fully
disbursed)
Difficulty in complying with PDCP's collateral requirements resul-
ted in a delay of funds drawdown. The dearth of a local market for barite
in 1981 further forced management to stop equipment acquisitions for the
project.

COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM TIE BORROWER
VICENTE R. JAYME
PRESIDENT
May 2, 1983
Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
Director
Operations Evaluation Department
The World Bank
1818 H Street, N. W.
Washington, D. C. 20433
U. S. A.
Dear Mr. Kapur:
This is with reference to the Project Completion Report
on PDCP (Loan 1052-PH) dated January 7, 1983 which was
enclosed in your letter of March 11, 1983.
First of all, allow us to congratulate you and your
staff for a most comprehensive and analytical performance
audit of our institution. The Completion Report presented
a generally fair assessment of PDCP's operational and
financial performance during the period under review.
We also wish to thank you for allowing us to give our
comments on the report. We have very few to make, since
as mentioned, we found the report well done.
In the Highlight's portion (p. iii, fourth paragraph) it
was mentioned that ".1.. while part of this decline may be
attributable to certain institutional deficiencies (optimistic
appraisals and weak supervision), most of the poor performance
is due to adverse economic condition...
Included         Regarding the optimistic appraisal, we would like to
in PCR,     indicate that this conclusion could easily be made on hindsight.
page iv,    However, at the time the appraisals were made, the
footnote 1. assumptions utilized in the appraisal were considered to be
realistic and valid. Many events in the international



ATTACHMENT A
- 51 -
environment which occurred during the period of the loan
were unexpected. and therefore could not have been included
in our appraisal. The oil crisis of 1974 and subsequently of
1979 triggered off economic events, alien to many of us.
The prolonged recession which the world experienced
starting 1979, was not anticipated by most economists to be
Incorpo-  as severe and as prolonged as what has occurred. However,
rated in  with the experience we encountered as a result of the recession,
PCR,      we are now doing more rigorous discussions on markets.
para.     We would also like to indicate that the recommendation on
6.04.     page 12 paragraph 6. 04 regarding the need for sensitivity
analysis has in fact been done by PDCP since 1979 for
projects amounting to $500, 000 and above.
Regarding the weak supervision, we wish to take
Incorpo-  exception to this statement. While we recognize that there
rated in has been an increase in our arrearages, I would not say that
PCR,     this has been due to weak supervision. Our Project Manage-
page iv,  ment Group (PMG) including its operations, is considered to
foot-    be one of the more well-managed groups compared to those in
note 1.   other development finance institutions. As indicated previously,
the adverse economic situation, worldwide and domestically,
as a result of the prolonged recession contributed materially
to the higher level of our past dues and arrearages. None-
theless, we would like to point out that the recession has
brought about a new plateau for levels of past dues worldwide,
not only for DFIs in developing countries but also for financial
institutions in developed economies such as Japan, Germany
and the U.S. This new phenomenon has thus made it
imperative for financial institutions worldwide to adjust their
internal systems and ways of doing things.
We also would like to bring to your attention, so that
this may be included in the Report, some of the organizational
changes which we have already introduced and which, hopefully,
will alleviate if not eliminate our problems on collection and
past dues.



ATTACHMENT A

The changes contemplated on page 12 paragraph 6. 05
for instance have already been implemented. A Department
Incorpo-    Head for PMG on a full time basis was appointed in June 1982.
rated in    The other changes mentioned have likewise been introduced,
PCR,        namely, establishment of a separate unit within PMG for
para. 6.01  small and medium industry projects supervision; introduction
of a computerized integrated billing system; establishment of
an acquired assets management unit; and the introduction of
the position of a Collections Coordinator to assist in the
monitoring of collections.
While the combined effects of these changes are seen to
eventually strengthen project supervision and eventually
improve collection performance, additional organizational
changes are being contemplated for implementation this May,
1983. The overall direction is to divide the Project
Management Group into two (2) departments under senior
officers who have been with PDCP for over 8 years. One
Department shall be responsible for Project Monitoring and
Supervision; the other shall be responsible for Special Accounts,
namely all problem projects and acquired assets. The splitting
of these functions, which are at the moment all under PMG,
Incorpo-    would allow a more extensive and intensive approach to the
rated in    management of PDCP's portfolio. There will be an increase
PCR,       in the number of staff members assigned to both areas of
para. 6.05  responsibility from thirty to thirty nine. There will also be
more professional staff members of managerial rank working
in both departments.
Incorpo-         Furthermore, we have asked all our senior executives
rated in   in PDCP to actively participate in bringing down the level of
PCR,        our past dues by spending time with these units to directly
para. 6.05  assist in the planning of the rehabilitation of past due accounts.
I would like to add however that with the anticipated
upturn in the world economy, we foresee an improvement in
certain sectors of the economy and this should contribute to
improving our past dues and reduce the level of our non-
earning assets for 1983 and 1984.



ATTACHMENT A

It might interest you to know that both PDCP and Far
East Bank and Trust Co. are continuing to link their
Incorpo-   operations. In the past year both institutions have set up
Iratedin   various operating committees to study how operations could
PCR,       be coordinated or linked in order to maximize the strength of
page 3,    each institution, as well as to do away with duplication in
foot-      certain functions. Also, the marketing of the services of the
note 1     whole group is now being done by both PDCP and FEBTC loan
officers. The management of accounts are also being coordinated
so that the group can provide all clients full services available
from both. Co-financing between FEBTC and PDCP is now
progressing.
The expectation of an additional flow of funds from
FEBTC to PDCP has been temporarily held back in view of
a limitation in the General Banking Act which, however,
Incorpo-   may be granted an exemption by the Monetary Board of the
rated in   Philippines. This limitation sets a ceiling to the investments
page 21,   and lending of a bank to another institution at not more than
foot-      15% of its total assets. I have had informal talks with the
note 1     Governor of the Central Bank and he sees no obstacle to giving
course to a request for exception to the ceiling, from FEBTC
and PDCP, especially where PDCP will be looked upon as the
lending arm of the group specializing in medium and long
termlending. One of the aims of the Universal Banking Law
is precisely to enable expanded commercial banks to allocate
increasing portions of funds for medium and long term loans.
It is our hope that the abovementioned comments may
be included in the Final Report to be given to the Executive
Director s.

U. S. A.
Dear Mr. Kapur:
This has reference to Mr. Jayme's letter dated May 2, 1983
giving his comments on the Project Completion Report on PDCP (Loan
1052-PH). Before Mr. Jayme left for abroad, he asked me to advise
you of a correction in the second paragraph of Page 4 of said
letter. The reference to the limitation set to the investments
and loans of a commercial bank to another institution should be
15% of the "unimpaired capital and surplus" instead of "total
assets" of such bank. The relevant provision of Section 23 of the
General Banking Act reads as follows:
"SEC. 23. Except as the Monetary Board may otherwise
prescribe, the total liabilities of any person, corporation
or firm, to a commercial banking corporation for money
borrowed, excluding (a) loans secured by obligations of the
Central Bank or of the Philippine Government; (b) loans fully
guaranteed by the government as to the payment of principal
and interest; (c) loans to the extent covered by hold-out on,
or assignment of, deposits maintained in the lending bank and
held in the Philippines; (d) loans and acceptances under letters
of credit to the extent covered by margin deposits; and
(e) other loans or credits which the Monetary Board may,
from time to time,specify as non-risk assets, shall at no
time exceed fifteen per cent (15%) of the unimpaired capital
and surplus of such bank."
Best regards.
Very   uly yours,
LUIS V. .ST-SON

ATTENTION: MR. SHIV S. KAPUR
DIRECTOR, OPERATIONS EVALUATION DEPARTMENT
REURLET MARCH 11 ON l'DCP PCR FOR LOAN 1052-PH. WE FIND THE REPORT COM-
PREHENSIVE AND WELL I3ALANCED AND GENERALLY AGREE WITH ITS FINDINGS AND
CONCLUSIONS AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE OVERALL CONCLUSION THAT LOAN OBJECTIVES
HAVE BY AND LARGE BEEN MET. HOWEVER, IN ONE OR TWO AREAS THE REPORT APPEARS
SOMEWHAT INCONCLUSIVE. WE REFER IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTIONAL MERGER OF
PDCP WITH FEBTC AND T'O CERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES. TWO ENVISIONED OB-
JECTIVES OF THE TIE-tUP WERE TO GIVE PDCP THE ADVANTAGE OF ACCESS TO PESO
FUNDS AT FEBTC'S DISP'OSAL (PARA 3.02) AND TO DEVELOP NEW RESOURCE MOBILI-
ZATION PROGRAMS WITH FEBTC INCLUDING GRADUAL BUILD-UP OF PDCP'S PAID-IN
CAPITAL (PARA 6.06). IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO PASS FINAL JUDGMENT ON THE
ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE OBJECTIVES, BUT PROGRESS SO FAR HAS FALLEN FAR SHORT
OF EXPECTATIONS. PDCP REMAINS SHORT OF PESO FUNDS AND CONTINUES TO RELY
PREDOMINANTLY ON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR ITS LOANS. ON THE INSTITUTIONAL SIDE,
WE BELIEVE PDCP HAS NOW TAKEN IMPORTANT AND REQUIRED STEPS TO STRENGTHEN ITS
PORTFOLIO AND PROJECT SUPERVISION. THIS AREA OF ACTIVITY SHOULD NEVERTHE-
LESS CONTINUE TO BE CAREFULLY MONITORED. IT NEEDS TO BE KEPT IN MIND THAT
THE INCREASE IN ARREARAGES IS MOSTLY ASCRIBABLE TO ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND
BUSINESS CONDITIONS IN GENERAL, WHICH NO EXTENT OF SUPERVISION COULD HAVE
MATERIALLY CHANGED.  IN GENERAL, WE ARE SATISFIED THAT PDCP'S MANAGEMENT
IS FORCEFULLY AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING THE PORTFOLIO PROBLEMS.

S i r:
Thank you for sending us a draft of the Project Completion
Report of IBRD Loan No. 1052-PH for our comments.
We found the reyort to be comprehensive in scope and detail
of analysis. Projects which are geared primarily towards resource
transfer to the private entrepreneurs in developing countries like
the PhiliDpines are necessary specially during periods of tight
business conditions. However this premise will hold only so long
as the resources are made available at affordable rates. Experiences
culled from the implementation of Loan No. 1052-PH can be made the
basis for similar future efforts by the Philippine government and
the World Bank.
Very truly yours,
