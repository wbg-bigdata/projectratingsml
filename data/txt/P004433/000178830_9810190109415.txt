PHILIPPINES
APPRAISAL OF THE
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
i.        The Private Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP),
established with Bank Group assistance in 1963, has made a request for a
fourth loan from the Bank. Three previous loans from the Bank (amounting
to $65 million) have been fully disbursed and a further loan of $15 million
syndicated by IFC has been fully committed. PDCP's volume of foreign
currency lending has increased dramatically over the past twelve months,
because of both a much higher level of real industrial investment in the
Philippines and increases of between 30-50% in the cost of imported capital
goods. At current rates of approval, PDCP's present foreign currency
resources are expected to be fully committed by December 1974. Consequently
it is in urgent need of foreign currency funds to support its project
pipeline. Under present conditions, PDCP has found it impossible to raise
these funds commercially, either directly or through a syndicated arrangement
with IFC at a rate which would allow it to relend with a positive spread.
With these considerations in view, and on the basis of a field appraisal
conducted in May 1974 a Bank loan of $30 million to PDCP is recommended.
ii.       The Philippine economy, which experienced a real growth rate of
about 5% during the 1960's and early 70's, is expected to grow at a faster
rate of 7-8% in 1974 and over the next few years, after an exceptionally good
year in 1973 when the real growth rate was 10%. Since mid-1973 inflation
has emerged as a major problem, with consumer prices rising at an annual
rate of almost 40%, owing in part to food shortages in 1973. This has
inevitably led to a dilemma in monetary management given the need to curb
the excess liquidity fuelling inflation and the need to expand credit
to allow for a sustained high rate of investment. Uncertainty about future
economic prospects notwithstanding, industrial investment continues to
increase, especially in export-oriented manufacturing.
iii.      As PDCP is an important institutional source of long-term industrial
finance in the Philippines, the Government's investment drive has had a
quantitative impact on its operations. Qualitatively PDCP's operations
continue to reflect its development orientation as it maintains its efforts
to assist projects which: balance the industrial structure (for instance
its heavy investment in intermediate and capital goods industries); maximize
the utilization of domestic raw materials; result in a greater diversification
of its clientele; and contribute to the regional dispersal of investment.
In terms of some common indices of economic impact, PDCP-financed projects
have: generated sales of about P 3.4 billion annually with a value-added
component of P 1.2 billion; resulted in an estimated net saving or earning of



- il -
foreign exchange of about US$278 million annually; and contributed to the
creation of over 30,500 jobs at an average cost of about US$12,750 per job.
Based on estimates made at the time of appraisal, PDCP-approved sub-projects
in 1973 and the first quarter of 1974 have economic rates of return ranging
from 22% to over 100%. More recently, PDCP has also focused its attention
on assistance to small-scale entrepreneurs. It now has a special financing
program for such clients which is about to be further extended and liberalized;
it is actively promoting the development of industrial estates for small-scale
industries; and it is about to invest in small private development banks
which are geared primarily to meeting the financial needs of local communi-
ties. To reach small borrowers in the provinces, PDCP is establishing three
promotional branches in Davao, Cagayan de Oro and Cebu. PDCP's Business
Development Office apart from providing direct technical assistance to clients
has played an extensive role in major national and regional undertakings,
and its Development Finance Institute has established a well-deserved
reputation as a training school for staff from other development finance
companies and government agencies.
iv.       PDCP is a privately-owned corporation with an authorized capital
stock of P 100 million, of which P 40.25 million has been paid in. Owner-
ship is presently distributed among some 1,100 stockholders but, with its
next planned issue of a further one million shares (par value P 10; market
value P 20), PDCP hopes that this ownership base will be doubled. With an
influential and active Board, PDCP continues to be one of the best
managed and staffed DFCs with which the Bank Group is associated. Its
operating policies and practices, established in consultation with the
Bank, are sound, and its project evaluation and follow-up standards are
high.
v.        Since its inception, EDCP has provided (in terms of approvals)
financial assistance totalling P 946 million (US$140 million) to the in-
dustrial, agro-industrial and transportation sectors in the Philippines,
with direct lending accounting for 76.2% of this amount; underwriting and
syndication operations for 13%; equity investments for 3.4%; and guarantees
for the remaining 7.4%. Foreign currency loans account for over 80% of its
total lending. As of March 31, 1974, PDCP had 211 loans totalling P 475.5
million outstanding in 125 companies. The average size of its loans in
dollar terms was about US$520,000. As of that date PDCP had also underwrit-
ten (or privately placed) twelve separate issues (stocks and bonds) for a
total of P 58.7 million; syndicated a further P 72.3 million for seven
clients; directly invested nearly P 29.7 million (gross) in the equity of
40 different firms; and issued 18 guarantees for a total amount of i 64.5
million. PDCP plays an active role in the well developed Philippine money
market, earning a fairly high return on its undisbursed liquid funds. In
1973 the volume of PDCP's short-term transactions reached P 1.8 billion,
with the profit on such transactions contributing substantially to its net
income.
vi.       PDCP's financial position is sound and its financial performance
satisfactory. Its total assets, as of March 31, 1974, stood at nearly



- iii -
P 706 million (US$105 million), the rate of growth declining from 40% in
1973 to an annual rate of about 17% in the first quarter of 1974. Long-
term assets account for about 63% of total assets. Total liabilities were
P 628 million and PDCP's net worth was P 78 million, with retained earn-
ings accounting for 44.5% of this amount. The capital structure remains
sound with PDCP keeping well within contractual debt/equity limits (as
agreed between PDCP and the Bank/IFC). Net income in the first quarter
of 1974 was P 3.5 million, reflecting an annual increase of 11% over the
P 12.7 million earned in 1973. Long-term lending operations contributed
77.7% to gross income; money market operations 19.4%; and guarantee fees
and other sources 2.8%. Earnings per share in the first quarter of 1974
amounted to P 0.88 (P 3.52 on an annual basis) with book value per share
rising to P 19.34. The quality of PDCP's portfolio remains high, with
arrearages being kept under close control.
vii.      The project pipeline built up by PDCP for the next two years
confirms expectations of a continued rise in the level of Philippine
industrial investment. In that period PDCP expects to approve loans
totalling over P 500 million (US$75 million) of which 85% (or US$63 mil-
lion) will be in foreign currency. Its present resources are clearly
inadequate to cope with that volume of lending and will need to be aug-
mented substantially. On the domestic front PDCP has already taken steps
to mobilize domestic resources through the issue of medium-term notes
(P 3 million in 1974 and a further P 20 million in 1975). It also plans
to augment paid-in capital with issues of shares in 1974 and 1976 which
are expected to yield P 20.0 million and P 25.0 million respectively.
These efforts should adequately cover peso resource requirements, esti-
mated at P 62 million, for the 1975-76 period. On the foreign resources
front PDCP faces a critical problem. Its commitment of available lines
of credit (the IFC loan and the third ADB loan) has been much more rapid than
expected and although it has recently been deliberately husbanding these re-
sources it is likely to run out of foreign currency funds by December 1974.
Between then and December 1976,its foreign currency approvals are estimated
at about $70 million. The proposed loan would only cover about 42% of this
amount.
viii.     Through the proposed loan the Bank will provide a small part of
the foreign exchange resources needed to support export oriented manufac-
turing investment, a key component of the Government's overall development
strategy. It will also help maintain the mutually beneficial relationship
established with PDCP which has enabled the Bank to play a useful role in
shaping PDCP's lending policies and improving the quality of its operations.
ix.       As with the three previous loans to PDCP, the proposed loan would
be coursed through the Philippine National Bank (PNB), and would finance
only the direct foreign exchange costs of capital goods required for a
broad range of sub-projects. A flexible amortization schedule, conforming
essentially with the aggregate of the individual sub-loan amortization
schedules, will be applied. Bank funds will be re-lent by PDCP at the



- iv -
current statutory maximum rate of 12%. This, taking into account the 0.75%
p.a. handling fee to be paid by PDCP to PNB, would give PDCP a spread of
3.25%. It has been agreed in negotiations between the Bank, the Government
and PDCP that, in case PDCP is allowed to increase its relending rate above
12% p.a., PDCP's net spread woild be limited to 3.5%, with the excess spread
accruing to the Government. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by
sub-borrowers. The Government may offer PDCP's sub-borrowers insurance to
cover, for a fee, the exchange risk between the currency of procurement
and the currency of obligation. To ensure the dispersal of the proposed
loan to a relatively large number of sub-projects, a ceiling of $2.5 million
would be applied to each sub-loan financed under this loan. A free limit
of $1.5 million is recommended. The debt/equity ratio would be maintained
at the present limit of 6.5:1.



PHILIPPINES
APPRAISAL OF THE
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Private Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP)
was established in 1963 with active Bank Group assistance. At that time,
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) subscribed P 800,000 ($205,217
equivalent at the exchange rate then prevailing) to PDCP's initial capital
stock which it subsequently sold in 1967 at a profit. Since its inception
PDCP has received three Bank loans totalling US$65 million and an IFC loan
of US$15 million. PDCP has also received three loans from the Asian Dev-
elopment Bank (ADB) totalling US$45 million.
1.02      PDCP enters its second decade as an efficient development financing
institution with a solid record of performance from both the financial and
development points of view. It is now an important institution within the
Philippine financial system, with innovative approaches to appraisal and
evaluation work and in the conduct of lending operations.  PDCP has now
committed all three Bank loans, the IFC loan, and two of the loans from ADB.
The third ADB loan, made in January 1974, is expected to be committed by
December 1974. Over the past year PDCP's volume of operations has increased
sharply, reflecting both a rise in industrial investment in the Philippines
and a higher level of prices for capital goods imports.
1.03      PDCP is, at present, confronted with an imminent shortage of long-
term foreign exchange resources for financing further industrial investment.
Its foreign exchange resource requirements over the two-year period 1975 and
1976 are estimated to be about $70 million. It has applied to the Bank and IFC
for a $40 million financial package and plans to approach the ADB and the
Export-Import Bank of Japan for the remaining $30 million. Under prevailing
circumstances, with commercial sources unwilling to provide long-term funds
at fixed rates, it is impossible for PDCP to tap them either directly 1/ or
through a syndicated arrangement with IFC. With these considerations in
mind, and on the basis of the appraisal contained in this report, a Bank
loan to PDCP of $30 million is recommended.
1/   PDCP is, however, preparing to float a bond issue of $10 million on
foreign capital markets in 1977. If market conditions permit PDCP
may bring this issue forward.

II. THE ECONOMY AND INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
2.01      A summary analysis of the performance and prospects of the
Philippine economy and industrial sector in 1973 was provided in a recent
report distributed to the Executive Directors. 1/ Annex 1 provides an
updated version. The report of the Bank's economic mission of April/May
1974 will be distributed to the Executive Directors shortly.
2.02      Recent Economic Developments.  The Philippine economy recorded a
remarkable 10% real growth rate in 1973, compared with an average rate of 5%
during 1965-1972. This rate is expected to settle to a lower, but sustainable,
level of 7-8% over the next few years. The main cause for concern on the
economic front lies in the present inflation rate. Consumer prices in Manila
rose by 35.8% between .Tune 1973 and June 1974, the highest price increases
being posted for food (45%), utilities and fuels. Recent monetary measures
taken by the Central Bank reflect a duai concern for containing inflation
on the one hand and maintaining the levels of liquidity necessary for sustained
growth on the other.
2.03      Industrial Investment. Despite increases of 30-50% in the
cost of capital goods and some uncertainties about investment prospects
following the increase in petroleum prices, there is no sign of a
slowdown in industrial investment. Although no firm figures are available as
yet, discussions with commercial banks and the industrial financing institu-
tions suggest that some industrial investment is being accelerated. Several
reasons have been advanced in support of this observation: (a) the Government's
strong emphasis on increasing export earnings to offset increased import
costs has spurred investment in export-oriented manufacturing; (b) indus-
trialists in some instances are advancing investment plans to reduce the
impact of continually escalating costs of capital equipment; and (c) an
increasing amount of foreign investment, particularly Japanese, is shifting
from Korea, Taiwan and Hong-Kong to the Philippines. Based on the present
flow of applications and the increase in costs both PDCP and DBP have had
to revise their projections for the next two years sharply upwards.
2.04      Recent Financial Developments.  Two developments have taken place
which have implications for the availability of short and long-term credit
for industry. First, the Central Bank recently approved the use of its own
Certificates of Indebtedness (CBCI's) and other government securities as
acceptable assets to cover temporary reserve requirement deficiencies of
commercial banks and allowed export bills of less than 31 days to serve as
1/   "Appraisal of a Loan to the Republic of the Philippines for Financing
(A) Industrial Investment and (B) Smallholder Tree-Farmers through
the Development Bank of the Philippines". Report No. 424a-PH dated
May 5, 1974.



-3-
reserves on marginal deposits for letters of credit.  This means that CBCI's
can now be used as open market instruments and render less effective any
contractionary mDnetary measures by providing a liquidity cushion. The
second development was an announcement by the Board of Investments (BOI) 1/
on May 16, 1974 suggesting guidelines for restricting the availability of
domestic credit to foreign subsidiaries in an attempt to force a greater
inflow of foreign capital. Under these guidelines firms registered under
R.A. 5455 (the Foreign Investments Regulation Act) would be allowed access
to domestic credit resources to cover their needs in amounts proportional
to the percentage of local ownership in them. These would range from no
domestic credit for firms with less than 10% Filipino ownership to 60% of
total credit requirements for firms with between 60-70% Filipino ownership. 2/
The announcement raised an immediate reaction from both foreign firms and
the financial community with the prospect being raised of substantial
dislocations in project implementation schedules and an adverse impact on
industrial investment. The strength of the reaction caused BOI to reconsider
its decision. It has now decided to hold public hearings before taking a
final decision on the matter. The final decision, whatever it is, will
affect only marginally PDCP's operations, since the overwhelming bulk of
PDCP's present and prospective clientele consists of companies with domestic
ownership exceeding 70%.
2.05      Interest Rates.  The Anti-Usury Law of 1916 limits lending rates
to 12% and 14% per annum on secured and unsecured loans respectively.
Effective lending rates on some commercial bank loans were however 4 to
6 points higher with add-on charges, compensatory balances and advance
interest collection. In the past few years these rigid legal limits have
resulted in distorting both the mobilization and allocation of capital
resources and led to the growth of an unorganized "private" market. On the
deposit side, with current rates of inflation of 35-40%, depositors have
received a highly negative rate of interest (present deposit rates are
6-8%) and the flow of private savings to the banking system has been
depressed. With these rates of inflation it is unlikely that financial
institutions will be able to mobilize a significantly greater volume of
domestic savings without increasing their deposit and (consequently) lend-
ing rates from current levels. Up to now they have not been in a position
to compete for funds with the money market (whose rates are not covered by
the Law) or even with short-term Government instruments which yield between
12 and 14%. The Law has been amended recently to empower the Monetary
Board of the Central Bank to raise lending rate ceilings in accord with
prevailing economic conditions. The Monetary Board, however, has not yet
done so.
1/   For a detailed account of the BOI's role please see Annex 1, paragraph
10.
2/   Firms with over 70% Filipino ownership would not be under any domestic
credit restraints.

III. PDCP'S DEVELOPMENTAL ROLE
3.01      Overall Operations.  As of March 31, 1974 PDCP had approved loans
aggregating P 720.8 million, issued guarantees for a further P 64.5 million,
and invested a total of P 29.7 million in the equity of industrial concerns.
PDCP's underwriting totalled P 40.8 million for equity issues and P 12.5
million for bond issues, while syndications, as of May 31, 1974, totalled
US$22.9 million in foreign currency loans and P 12.3 million in local cur-
rency. Tabulated details of its operations are provided in Annex 2. PDCP's
portfolio is concentrated mainly in medium and relatively large-scale manu-
facturing enterprises (which account for 66.3% of its loan approvals by amount
and 63.1% by number) with some financing of utilities (9.2% by amount) and
transportation companies (12.5% by amount). Including equity operations,
manufacturing has received over 83% of PDCP's total financial assistance.
Its inter-industry portfolio dispersion reflects PDCP's propensity to em-
phasize investments in non-traditional industries and projects involving
the introduction of new technology into the Philippines. In its operations,
PDCP has adhered closely to the BOI's investment priorities. It has actively
assisted the development of intermediate and capital goods industries (with
138 such investments in projects which absorbed 67.4% of PDCP's total assist-
ance to the manufacturing sector) and of projects which maximize the utili-
zation of domestic raw materials; (over 66% of PDCP's projects are dependent
on local sources for 86% or more of their raw material requirements).
3.02      Diversification of Clientele.  Sensitive to previous criticisms
(which were not entirely justified) about the concentration of its portfolio
in a few very large firms linked Lo members of its Board, PDCP has made
a conscious effort to diversify its clientele. The evidence indicates
that it has been reasonably successful in doing so. As of March 31, 1974
the largest 20 (or 11.7%) of its clients accounted for 40.8% of its loan
approvals and 36.6% of loans outstanding. The above ratio of 40.8% of
approvals accounted for by the largest 20 of its clients as of March 31, 1974,
compared with 55.3% for March 1973 and 50.8% for June 1972, indicates that
PDCP's recent financing has gone mainly to new clients. Twenty-seven (or 16%)
of its clients were associated in some way with PDCP's present or previous
Board members and these firms accounted for about 21% of loan approvals and
17% of loans outstanding. These distributions are not indicative of portfolio
concentration nor of undue favoritism towards Board associated clients. In
fact, given the overall concentration of Philippine manufacturing industry,
these figures are lower than might reasonably be expected. Available data
(Annex 3) on repeater loans indicate that 89 (or 52%) of PDCP's 171 clients
have received at least one repeat loan. However, the total amount approved
in repeat loans to existing clients is P 207.4 million or 28.8% of total
approvals for new and expansion projects. These statistics suggest that
PDCP's continued financial support for projects sponsored by established
clients has not been at the expense of pursuing project opportunities with
new clients. In expanding its loan portfolio PDCP has attempted to strike



a reasonable balance between the need for maintaining a strong financial
position and meeting its obligations to its creditors and shareholders on the
one hand, and for retaining the development orientation which is integral
to its reputation and institutional character on the other.
3.03      Regional Dispersal of Investment.  Roughly 17% of PDCP's total
investments as of March 31, 1974 have been in the Metropolitan Manila
area, with a further 47.3% in Central and Southern Luzon, 14.1% in the
Visayas, 18.2% in Mindanao and 3.4% elsewhere. Data for year-to-year
approvals do not show an aggregate shift towards investments in less dev-
eloped regions although there has been a discernible shift in investment
away from the Greater Manila area (1973 was an exception). In keeping with
the Government's development priorities PDCP is encouraging its clients to
consider locating in less developed areas whenever it can demonstrate that
there would not be an adverse impact on the financial viability of their
operations. It is also playing a more direct role in facilitating regional
investment dispersal through: (a) the opening of promotional branches
in Davao, Cagayan de Oro and Cebu; (b) the development of industrial estates
for small- and medium-scale industry in Paete and Davao (paragraph 3.06);
and (c) its planned participation in the equity of local private development
banks (paragraph 3.07).
3.04      Economic Impact of PDCP Financed Projects.  An assessment of the
economic significance of PDCP's operations must, of necessity 1/, rely on
partial economic indicators (Annex 4) which are illustrative of overall
impact rather than investment efficiency. In aggregate terms PDCP has,
as of March 31, 1974 provided financial assistance totalling P 946 million
to some 282 projects whose total investment requirements were P 2.64 bil-
lion. Annual incremental sales attributable to these projects have aver-
aged P 3.4 billion with a value-added component of P 1.2 billion. This
volume of output has resulted in the direct earning or saving of about
US$390 million equivalent in foreign exchange. Taking into account aver-
age annual import requirements of about US$102 million, the net positive
balance of payments effect of these projects is estimated to be an average
US$278 million annually. In terms of employment creation, these projects
have generated about 30,500 jobs with an annual incremental payroll of about
P 138 million (or roughly P 4,500 per worker). The cost of job creation
has been about P 86,550 (roughly $12,750) per job, less than the average
for BOI-registered projects. Over the last 10 years, PDCP's invest-
ments have, on average, accounted for roughly 6% of annual domestic gross
fixed capital formation in the manufacturing sector and for about 10% of the
total jobs created each year in manufacturing industry. An ex ante calcula-
tion of the economic rate of return (which PDCP now regularly incorporates
in each of its appraisal reports) for a representative sample of projects
1/   No systematic ex-post evaluation has yet been carried out on the economic
rates of return of PDCP-financed projects which are fully operational.
Hence no single meaningful index can be provided. For those projects
still in the gestation period, the partial indicators included in the
aggregate figures above represent expectations rather than actual impact.



-6-
approved in 1973 and 1974 (Annex 4) shows rates of return varying from 22%
to over 100%. Financial rates of return for the same projects vary from 16%
to over 60%.
3.05      Small-Scale Lending.  Although primarily geared for lending to
medium- and large-scale enterprises, 1/ PDCP in February 1972 launched a
small business lending program aimed at financing the fixed capital require-
ments of firms with paid-in capital of between P 50,000 and P 300,000.
Cognizant of its manpower limitations and aware that the needs of small
scale entrepreneurs are substantially different to those of its larger,
more sophisticated clients and necessitate a more intensive relationship,
P])CP has emphasized quality rather than quantity in its small-scale opera-
tions. It has so far been fairly selective and has restricted its exposure
to those projects to which it could provide major inputs, such as organizational
or technical assistance, sub-contracting arrangements with larger clients
etc., in addition to finance. As of April 30, 1974 PDCP had approved P 3.27
million in loans to 19 small businesses in several industries (Annex 5),
and had a further 17 firm projects requiring P 3.0 million in its pipeline.
On the basis of its experience and spurred by the Government's policy em-
phasis on small- and medium-scale industries PDCP is contemplating major
changes in the scope of its program 2/, a relaxation of debt/equity propor-
tion limits (from the previous 50:50 to 70:30) and of collateral require-
ments, and the financing of working capital. PDCP has also developed close
working relationships with the principal technical assistance agencies in
this field 3/ through which its "reach" has been extended considerably.
l
3.06      Industrial Estate Development.  In addition to direct financing,
PDCP is also actively involved in two pilot industrial estate projects for
accommodating small-scale firms and providing them with infrastructure,
utilities, and technical assistance services in a centralized location.
The first estate project, on which work is expected to begin within the
next 4-6 months, is at Paete on Laguna Lake. Meant to cater to the craft
woodcarving industry, it will involve the development of a 30-hectare site
at a cost of about P 3 million. The second estate, at Davao, will cater
to) small-scale entrepreneurs in the metal working industry; site negotia-
tions are presently under way. PDCP's approach is to develop the master
plan for these estates, supervise the civil works and construction, attract
entrepreneurs to the estates, and provide administrative and technical as-
sistance services. After the initial 2-3 years PDCP hopes to establish a
co-operative of the estate occupants and gradually turn management over to
the co-operative, withdrawing eventually to the role of consultant.  If its
experience with these two pilot estates proves successful PDCP plans to re-
plicate the model in various other locations.
1/   Excluding small business loans, the average size of PDCP's loans is
about US$520,000 in dollar terms.
2/   PDCP will adopt the Government's definition for eligibility under its
program iae firms with total fixed assets between P 100,000 and
P 1,000,000 (roughly US$15,000-$150,000).

Academy of the Philippines (DAP).



-7-
3.07      Participation in Private Development Banks (PDBs). 1/  To improve
its access to industrial opportunities in rural communities and undeveloped
regions of the Philippines (particularly Mindanao) PDCP is about to make
fairly sizeable equity investments in an existing PDB in Davao and in a
new PDB to be established in Cagayan de Oro. Through assuming a significant
share in the ownership of these institutions, PDCP hopes to exercise its
organizational and managerial expertise in getting these banks to operate
on sound commercial lines and to realize their full potential in playing a
greater catalytic role in local community development. Eventually PDCP hopes
to invest in about 10-15 PDBs strategically located throughout the
Philippines 2/, thus strengthening its role in assisting small enterprises.
3.08      Other Developmental Activities.  PDCP's impact as a development-
oriented financial institution in the Philippines is reinforced through a
host of other activities. Its Economic and Corporate Research Unit (ECOR),
in addition to providing economic advisory and consulting services to PDCP's
clients, publishes monthly and quarterly economic reviews which have wide
circulation in the Philippine business community; it has also published 11
1/   Private Development Banks are generilly small local institutions which
confine their banking functions to the immediate community. As of
June 30, 1973 (the last date for which figures are available) there
were 33 PDBs in the Philippines with total assets of P 216.82 million
(roughly US$32.1 million). Their paid-in capital amounted to P 64
million (nearly P 2 million per PDB) and their deposits amounted to
P 108.1 million. Total PDB loan investments amounted to about P 57
million dispersed among 7,000 borrowers (average loan size of P 8,100).
Of this amount P 43 million was in medium- and long-term loans. Agri-
cultural loans to about 4,000 borrowers accounted for just over 50%
of total PDB operations, whilst small loans to rural industries
accounted for 28%. Up to now PDBs have been strongly supported by the
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) by way of equity participation
(DBP holds about 36% of the total equity in PDB's), rediscounting
facilities (to the tune of P 32 million outstanding as of June 30, 1973),
and by maintaining savings and time deposits. Recent amendments to
the "General Banking Act" (Republic Act 337) and the "Private
Development Banks Act" (RA 4093) have encouraged ownership participation
by larger commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions in
PDBs to strengthen the managerial capability of these institutions --
an asset of which PDB's are, at present, woefully short.
2/   PDCP has also been asked by the Government to provide technical assist-
ance in the establishment, organization and initial management of a
national commercial bank to cater specifically to the Moslem
community.



-8-
comprehensive industry surveys 1/. PDCP's Business Development Office, in
the course of promoting new business for PDCP, has participated in the
development of major regional or national undertakings, some notable examples
being the identification of project possibilities under the Mindanao Devel-
opment Program; active participation in the Tourism Industry Development
Program; the Maritime Industry Development Program; identification of agri-
business projects in the Bicol River Basin and undertaking a feasibility
study for the Mindanao Group Port Terminal. BDO is also planning to increase
its feasibility study assistance to clients and to exercise its influence
with its existing and new clients in guiding investment into priority indus-
tries and underdeveloped regions. In the past, whenever circumstances were
appropriate BDO has endeavored to bring about changes in project design,
putting together or reconfiguring financial packages, and arranging sub-
contracting ties between small and larger firms.
3.09      Training.  In the training field, PDCP's Development Finance
Institute (DFI) has established a solid record. Apart from providing PDCP's
own incoming staff with an induction to the various aspects of development
finance company operations, the DFI also trains staff from several government
departments and agencies in project analysis and follow-up, as well as
personnel from DFC's in other countries (recent trainees being from Afghanistan,
Mauritius, Sierra Leone, and Indonesia). In September, 1973 the DFI in
co-operation with the Asian Development Bank held a successful six-week
Regional Workshop for Small and Medium Industry Project Development. Asso-
ciated with its training activities are the close ties which PDCP has
established with the academic community serving as a bridge between academia
and the Philippine business world. PDCP is an active corporate member of
the Asian Institute of Management and has close institutional links with the
major business schools. It has also released one of its senior staff members
on sabbatical leave to start up a broad range of programs in the Develop-
ment Academy of the Philippines. Its close relationship with the Bank
Group has proved PDCP to be a dedicated and capable volunteer in pioneering
innovations which would improve DFC performance or efficiency (e.g, its
active participation as leader of a group of Asian DFCs in developing a
computer model for DFC projections and for use in project appraisal).
IV. PDCP - INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
4.01      Ownership and Share Capital.  PDCP is a privately owned company
with a fairly wide dispersion of ownership. On March 31, 1974 there were
1,092 shareholders (comprising 980 Class "A" or Filipino shareholders with
voting stock and 112 Class "B" non-voting stock holders). This represented a
reduction of 10% (resulting from market transactions) in the total number of
shareholders since March 31, 1973. Foreign (Class B) shareholdings however
increased by 12% with seven new foreign shareholders. PDCP's authorized

capital stock is now P 100 million (including an increase of P 40 million
authorized in March 1974) of which P 40.25 million has been paid-in along
with a P 3 million capital premium 1/. For the immediate future, PDCP plans
to make a primary offering in September 1974 of a further one million shares
(par value P 10) at close to the current market price (which fluctuates
around P 20). With this issue PDCP hopes to broaden the ownership base by
attracting over 1,000 new shareholders and allowing present small shareholders
to increase their holdings. To achieve these objectives PDCP's management
has submitted to its Board a memorandum suggesting alternatives for having
present large stockholders (those with over 10,000 shares) waive a portion
(65%) of their pre-emptive rights. A further offering of a million shares
is slated for 1976. PDCP's major shareholders and their holdings are listed
in Annex 6.
4.02      Board of Directors.  PDCP has an active and representative Board,
which takes a keen interest in its affairs. PDCP's articles provide for
eleven Directors, three of whom represent foreign Class V"B shareholders.
In the last year there has been one change in directors representing Class "A"
shareholders 2/ along with a change in all three directors representing
Class B interests. 3/ As before, the Board continues to include two in-
fluential members of the Government, Messrs. J.P. Enrile, Secretary of De-
fence (and Chairman of the Philippine National Bank) and G. Sicat, Director-
General of the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA).. The Chairman,
Mr. R.T. Villanueva, has been re-elected and continues to serve concurrently
as President. The composition of the Board of Directors as of March 31, 1974
is shown in Annex 7.
4.03      Organization, Management and Staff.  Although fairly significant
changes have occurred in the structure of its top management team, PDCP
continues to be among the best organized and most efficiently managed DFCs
with which the Bank Group is associated. The almost concurrent departures
in early 1974 of the Senior Vice-President, 4/ the Vice-President for
1/  PDCP's initial paid-in share capital of P 25 million was increased to
1 27.5 million in February 1970 by issue of a 10% stock dividend. A
rights issue for cash was offered in March 1971 increasing PDCP's
paid-in capital to P 35 million. The offering price of P 14 resulted
in a capital premium to PDCP of P 3 million. A further stock dividend
of 15% was declared in 1972 bringing total paid-in share capital to
the current level of P 40.25 million.
2/  Mr. Benigno Toda was replaced by Mr. Henry Sy.
3/   Messrs. Cooper, Pudner and Noguchi replaced Messrs. Carroll, Sutherland
and Parnell.
4/  He has left PDCP on a temporary (3-year) basis to take up a senior
appointment at the Asian Development Bank.



- 10 -
Finance and Economics 1/ and the Asst. Vice-President for Administration, 2/
have caused a regrouping of the functional units at PDCP (Chart No. 8903)
and imposed, at least for a short period, a heavier supervisory burden on
the Executive Vice-President and the newly appointed Senior Vice-President
(previously Vice-President for Project Administration). At the same time
these departures have precipitated the promotion of experienced and dynamic
younger executives who have been well-groomed for their new responsibilities.
It is to PDCP's credit (and a reflection of its emphasis on quality training
and career development) that the loss of three key personnel, in what remains
a fairly small and well-knit entity, has been absorbed without any interrup-
tion of workflow or deterioration in work quality. In fact, in the first
few months of this year PDCP has coped effectively with an unprecedentedly
high volume of business. The generally high quality of PDCP's staff is
evident through all levels of the organization. Unfortunately the necessarily
limited scope for promotional opportunities within PDCP together with the
demand in the Philippine financial community for PDCP-trained staff have
resulted in a high (but stable) turnover of staff (9-10% per annum) at lower
organizational levels. As of March 31, 1974, PDCP had a total of 157 staff
of whom 101 were professionals. This represents an increase of 22 staff
(or 16%) over the previous year, all in the professional category. PDCP's
present staff, strengthened by prospective recruits, will be sufficient both
to maintain the usual good quality of PDCP's operations and to process the
expanded volume of business over the next two years mentioned in paragraph 4.16.
4.04      Operating Policies.  The amended Statement of General Business
Policies (Annex 8) 3/ has remained essentially unchanged since September 1972
and continues to provide sound guidelines for PDCP's operations. PDCP's
normal exposure limit in any single project, restrained by its policy guide-
lines 4/, is now nearly P 21.4 m-llion (or US$3.2 million equivalent). This
limit can, under exceptional circumstances, be exceeded. The last amendment
to the policy statement emphasized PDCP's firm intention to diversify its
clientele and to provide a greater level of assistance to small- and medium-
scale firms. The direction of PDCP's recent operations suggests that it is
living up to this policy commitment.
4.05      Project Evaluation and Follow-up.  The practices adopted by, and
standards applying to, PDCP's project appraisals and supervision continue
to be of a high quality. An analysis of a sample of recent appraisal and
follow-up reports reveals them to be precise, informative and incisive.
P:DCP's analysis of the technical, market and financial aspects of projects
continues to be thorough. It has now adopted as routine the calculation

of the internal economic rate of return as prescribed by the recently issued
Bank guidelines on the calculation of an economic rate of return for DFC
sub-projects. It is also developing refinements to protection rate criteria
and to domestic resource cost criteria as additional measures for evaluating
the economic implications of the projects it finances. PDCP has also in-
corporated in its follow-up an evaluation mechanism for determining whether
the financial and economic benefits expected to result at the time of proj-
ect appraisal were actually realized (and if not to analyze the causes of
variation). In an effort to employ PDCP's data on its own project portfolio
to make wider assessments of the impact of DFC-financed projects in general,
PDCP (along with six other DFCs) is cooperating with the Bank Group in a
pilot scheme to develop a computerized data bank. Hopefully this will be a
first step towards enabling both the Bank Group and other DFCs to understand
better the effects and consequences of DFC financing and to undertake more
meaningful project analysis and follow-up.
4.06      Procurement and Disbursement Practices.  PDCP does not, in general,
require its clients to invite bids for their equipment on an international
basis. It does however ensure during appraisal that the equipment it fi-
nances is suitable for the client's purposes and is being procured at a
competitive price. Disbursements are made only after PDCP has satisfied
itself that expenditures have been, or are about to be incurred for the
purposes approved through a detailed scrutiny of supporting documents sup-
plemented by site inspections wherever appropriate. The appraisal mission
was satisfied that PDCP's procurement and disbursement procedures are appro-
priate and thorough without being unduly time-consuming.
4.07      Lending Operations.  A comparative analysis of PDCP's lending
operations up to March 31, 1974 is provided in Annex 9. Total financial
assistance approved by PDCP for the industrial, agro-industrial and trans-
port sectors amounted to P 946.1 million, with direct lending accounting
for 76.2% of this amount, the rest being accounted for by underwriting and
syndication 1/ operations (13%), equity investments (3.4%) and issuance of
guarantees (7.4%). Cumulative loan approvals as of March 31, 1974 totalled
P 720.8 million for about 260 projects executed by 171 companies. Foreign
currency loans (207) amounting to nearly US$107.4 million accounted for
81.4% of total lending with peso loans (177) totalling P 133.8 million
accounting for the rest. The rate of loan approvals in the first quarter
of 1974 was unprecedentedly high with approvals in that period accounting
for 15% of the cumulative total for the previous ten years. Foreign cur-
rency loan approvals (16) of over US$14 million, 2/ exceeded approvals for
1/ Inclusive 'of private placements totalling P 5.2 million and syndica-
tions totalling P 72.3 million.
2/   A further US$3.86 million was approved in April and May 1974.  Unless
it runs out of foreign resources, its pipeline suggests that PDCP
could approve a total of US$35 million in foreign currency loans in
1974 - or 3 times the 1973 level.



- 12 -
the entire previous year; on an annualized basis local currency loan approv-
als (14) for the first quarter (P 14.1 million) were about 130% above 1973
levels. As of March 31, 1974 PDCP had 211 loans amounting to P 475.5 mil-
lion outstanding in 125 companies, including 19 small-scale loans totalling
P 3.3 million (paragraph 3.05).  In dollar terms the average size of PDCP
loans (excluding small-scale loans referred to in paragraph 3.05) is around
US$520,000, reflecting a levelling off in the trend towards financing larger
projects. Inflationary trends may push the average dollar size of PDCP loans
to a higher figure, but it is expected that, over the next year or two, the
size of PDCP loans will decline slightly in real terms.
4.08      Capital Market Operations.  PDCP's underwriting commitments includ-
ing private placements (Annex 10), amounted to P 58.7 million for twelve
separate clients; three of the issues underwritten were for long-term debt
(bonds), one for a promissory note and the remainder for common stock. As
of March 31, 1974 syndications amounting to P 72.3 million for seven clients
had been approved by PDCP (Annex 11) 1/.  These syndications involved foreign
exchange financing 2/ of US$14.6 million equivalent and local financing of
P 2.3 million. Direct equity participation by PDCP since its inception
amounted to P 29.7 million (in gross approvals) for some 40 firms. PDCP
later withdrew from 6 investments requiring P 5.6 million, resulting in net
approvals of P 24.1 million for 34 firms. As of March 31, 1974, PDCP's
equity portfolio stood at P 18.8 million in 24 investments. Capital market
operations for the first quarter of 1974 did not reflect the same advances
over previous year levels as did lending operations. There was only one
private placement, for P 1.2 million, two equity investments totalling
P 0.83 million 3/, and one syndication for P 13.4 million. PDCP expects
that, at the end of 1974, syndications and equity investments will far sur-
pass 1973 levels, but in view of the growing number of new "investment
houses" eagerly scrambling for underwriting business, its own operations in
this area will increase only nominally.
4.09      Guarantee Operations.  Total guarantees (18) approved by PDCP as
of March 31, 1974 amounted to P 64.5 million, of which 76.5% was accounted
for by foreign currency guarantees (US$11.9 million equivalent) and the
remainder (P 15.2 million) by peso guarantees (Annex 2). After repayments
of amounts disbursed against these guarantees, PDCP had outstanding contin-
gent liabilities amounting to P 29.8 million (US$3.66 million equivalent in
foreign currency and P 5.16 million in local currency). Following the
Central Bank's measures in 1970/71 to regulate the terms of foreign credits,
PDCP 's guarantee operations have remained depressed, the much improved
1/   Three more syndications amounting to P 46.34 million were approved in
April and May 1974.

3/   Two more equity investments for P 4.5 million were made in May 1974.



- 13 -
investment climate in 1973/74 notwithstanding. Contrary to PDCP's expect-
ations only two guarantees for foreign currency credits (totalling US$0.9
million) have been issued since 1971. 1/
4.10      Money Market Operations.  The volume of PDCP's money market trans-
actions during 1973 reached P 1.8 billion, up 28% from the previous year's
level of P 1.4 billion. Transactions in government securities, in which
competition was intense, accounted for 29% of the total volume compared
with 50.7% in the previous year. The level of temporary placements in the
first quarter of 1974 was up by 53% from first-quarter 1973 levels although
the yield decreased from 15.74% to 13.37%. 2/ The money market climate has
been somewhat unsettled in the first few months of 1974 owing to successive
attempts by the CB to mop up excess liquidity fuelling the present inflation
and at the same time expand credit for investment purposes (paragraph 2.02).
This has led to fluctuations in call money rates on a week to week basis of
between 17-33% per annum. As of March 31, 1974 PDCP's holdings of money
market instruments and cash amounted to P 173.9 million or 70% of current
assets and 24.6% of total assets. Short-term liabilities attributable to
money-market operations totalled P 49.7 million or 43.6% of current liabili-
ties (paragraph 4.11).
4.11      Financial Position.  PDCP's financial position remains sound and
is analyzed in detail in Annex 12, with summary balance sheets for FY 70-73
and the first quarter of 1974 being provided in Annex 12, Table 1. While
total assets in 1973 grew by 40% over 1972 levels, the increase of 4.4% in
the first quarter of 1974 (which brought total assets up to P 705.9 million)
did not fully reflect the stepped up tempo of lending activity mainly because
of the lag in disbursements. Long-term investments of P 443.8 million
accounted for 62.9% of total assets, as current assets (P 250.1 million)
declined slightly in prominence from 40% of total assets at the end of 1973
to 35.4% as of March 31, 1974. On the other side of the balance sheet total
liabilities amounted to P 628 million with net worth rising to P 77.9 million.
Retained earnings, which grew by nearly 30% in 1973, increased by a further
6.5% in the first quarter to a level of P 34.6 million as of March 31, 1974;
they presently account for 44.5% of stockholders' equity. Long-term debt
amounted to P 511.7 million reflecting a growth of 8.8% in the first quarter
(compared to overall growth of 40% through 1973), while short-term liabilities
amounted to P 114.2 million, a decline of 12.4% over the 1973 year-end level.
Consequently, PDCP was slightly more liquid at the end of the first quarter
(current ratio of 2.2) than at the end of 1973 (current ratio of 2.0). The
long-term debt/equity 3/ ratio as of March 31, 1974 stood at 5.37 (vis-a-vis
1/   Both in 1973.
2/   For the 5 months ending May 31, 1974, however, the sudden jump in
money market rates boosted the overall yield from temporary place-
ments to 16.4%.

the contractual limit of 6.5); the short-term debt/equity I/ ratio was 0.54
(as against a contractual limit of 2.0) and the percentage of net liquid
assets to total assets 1/ was 19.26% (against a contractual minimum of 4%).
4.12      Financial Performance.  As with its overall financial position,
PDCP's financial performance in 1973 and the first quarter of 1974 was
satisfactory; (details are provided in Annex 12). Net income after taxes
increased by 10.2% in 1973 to P 12.7 million versus P 11.5 million in 1972.
As of March 31, 1974 net income after taxes was P 3.5 million (6% above
last year's comparable figure or an 11% increase on an annual basis). 2/ The
principal constituents of gross income (P 18.2 million) retained roughly
the same proportions as for 1973 with long-term lending operations accounting
for 77.7% of income (or P 14.2 million), money market operations for 19.4%
(P 3.5 million) capital market operations for 0.03%; guarantee fees for 0.6%
(P 0.1 million); and other sources for the remaining 2.3% (P 0.4 million).
On an annualized basis, income from long-term lending operations rose by
7.8% from 1973 levels and that from money-market operations by 13.1%.
Interest charges and financial expenses (P 10.1 million on March 31, 1974)
on the other hand rose only by 8.1% from previous year levels (on an annual
basis). First quarter results however indicated that operating expenses
(exclusive of taxes and licenses) were running at about 30% above 1973
levels, mainly because of upward salary adjustments and the increased cost
of utilities and maintenance of the headquarters building; this trend has
continued into the second and third quarters of 1974 and is estimated to drive
up total administrative expenses for 1974 to about 1.5% of total assets.
4. 13     Portfolio Quality and Arrears.  PDCP's portfolio remains a sound
one. This is attributable more to the quality of its appraisal and follow-
up work than to any underlying predisposition towards financing "no-risk"
projects undertaken by well-established sponsors. Of the 125 clients with
211 loans outstanding on its books as of March 31, 1974, 23 clients (or 18.4%)
had 33 loan accounts (or 15.6%) in arrears for three months or more (Annex
13). The total amount (principal and interest) in arrears was P 16.15 mil-
lion, an increase of 33.8% over arrears on December 31, 1973. Principal in
arrears totalled P 7.47 million, or 1.6% of the total principal outstand-
ing. An amount substantially more than the increase was attributable to
accounts between 3-6 months overdue (which rose from P 1.53 million to
P 7.56 million), as 6 more companies fell behind on their payments. Because
of collection action taken by PDCP on some long overdue accounts there were
material reductions in amounts between 6-12 months overdue (which fell from
P 4.36 million to P 3.59 million) and more than 12 months overdue (from
P 5.90 million to P 5 million). The total amount "infected" (i.e. principal
outstanding for loans in arrears over 3 months) amounted to P 74.9 million
1/   As defined by IFC.
2/   Net income as of May 31, 1974 was P 6.4 million; on an annualized basis
this suggests a somewhat higher growth rate of 20.9%.



- 15 -
or 15.7% of the outstanding loan portfolio, compared to 15.8% at the end of
1973. Of the twenty-three clients in arrears, two (with arrears amounting
to P 4.3 million) were in serious difficulty with PDCP considering fore-
closure; restructuring of loans was being considered for a further five.
Satisfactory payment arrangements have been made with the remaining 16
clients and PDCP is keeping a close watch on these accounts. The arrears
problem has, to some extent, been exacerbated by recent money market rates.
Present returns have made it worthwhile for client firms to withold repay-
ments and incur penalty charges whilst using their funds for short-term
investments. Although realizable collateral and securities for the accounts
in jeopardy are sufficient and actual losses are unlikely, PDCP has more than
adequately allowed for such an eventuality. For the first quarter of 1974,
P 0.6 million was set aside as provision (against income) for doubtful ac-
counts. Total allowances (against assets) for doubtful accounts as of
March 31, 1974 amounted to P 11.1 million, whilst reserves and retained
earnings amounted to P 34.6 million or 7.2% of the outstanding portfolio
(net of allowances) as of that date. So far, no loans have been written off.
4.14      Share Prices and Returns.  PDCP's net worth as of March 31, 1974
was P 77.9 million, up 3% from end-1973. On an annual basis, the increase
in net worth through 1974 will be 12% compared to a 10% increase through
1973. Book value per share (par value P 10) grew from P 16.96 in 1972 to
P 18.82 in 1973 and was P 19.34 as of March 31, 1974. Trading in PDCP's
shares was active in the first half of 1973 but dropped sharply in the
second half and has remained light since then; only 51,718 shares were
traded in the first quarter of 1974.  The market value of PDCP's shares
rose from P 14.5 in January 1973 to P 22.0 in June 1973 and has fluctuated
between P 18-22 since then, generally staying at a level above P 20.  The
cash dividend per share was P 1.30 in 1973 with a dividend pay-out ratio of
41%.  The cash dividend for the first quarter was P 0.35 (P 1.4 annualized).
4.15      Audit.  PDCP continues to retain the internationally recognized
firm of Sycip, Gorres, Velayo and Co. as its auditors. Auditing require-
ments have always been satisfactorily met, with reporting being prompt and
thorough. No auditors' report on PDCP has contained any qualification.
4.16      Business Prospects and Projections.  All available indicators
suggest that the level of productive industrial investment in the Philippines,
which increased significantly in 1973, will continue to rise in the foresee-
able future (Annex 1, paragraph 14). On the basis of recent approval rates
in the past 6-8 months and the substantial project pipeline it has built up
(Annex 14), PDCP expects to approve in the next two years (1975 and 1976)
loans totalling about P 500 million (US$75 million), of which 85% (or US$63
million) will be in foreign currency. Including guarantees, equity invest-
ments and other capital market operations PDCP expects to provide financial
assistance totalling nearly P 680 million (over US$100 million) to industry.
The proposed Bank loan will consequently cover barely 30% of PDCP's total
financial requirements. This level of operations is markedly higher than
the growth trend over the previous ten years would appear to justify. How-
ever,in view of the increased levels of actual and planned investments



- 16 -
coupled with increases of between 30-50% in the cost of imported capital
equipment, the assumptions on which PDCP's projections are based are reason-
able; in fact, they probably are on the conservative side. PDCP's business
projections along with their impact on its financial position and performance
are analyzed in detail in Annex 15. On the basis of its assumptions (those
on operating expenses being somewhat optimistic) PDCP's profitability is
expected to remain satisfactory, climbing from P 14.4 million in 1974 to
P 25.9 million in 1978, or at a compounded growth rate of about 12%.  Total
assets are expected to grow from P 723.4 million in 1974 to P 1,343.2 million
in 1978, a compound growth of over 13%; net worth is expected to increase
at an annual compounded rate of 12%. The return on average equity will dip
gradually from 16% in 1974 to 15% in 1978. Dividends are expected to be
maintained at 14% with the pay-out ratio dropping from 42% in 1974 to 32%
in 1978.
4.17      Peso Resource Position and Requirements.  PDCP's resource position
as of April 30, 1974 is provided in Annex 16. As of that date undisbursed
long-term peso commitments (P 35.2 million) exceeded available long-term
peso resources (P 33.1) by about P 2.1 million. Short-term investments
outstanding also exceeded short-term holdings of notes and commercial paper
by about P 21.7 million, the excess being financed by long-term undisbursed
resources. This situation reflects PDCP's policy of employing available
idle resources to the maximum extent possible, rather than an imprudence
on its part in overcommitting peso funds. In the short-term its ability to
raise fairly large amounts of peso resources almost immediately through its
money market operations, ensures that PDCP will be capable of meeting its
current local currency commitments (i.e. upto end 1974). Nevertheless, it is
beginning to feel the pressure for raising further domestic resources, and is
drawing up plans for floating or privately placing (mainly with institutional
investors) medium-term debt instruments (3-5 year debentures/notes) for P 3
million in 1974 and P 20 million in 1975 (further issues are planned for 1977
and 1978). In addition, the planned share capital increases in 1974 and 1976
are expected to yield P 20 million and f 25 million respectively. For the
two year period FY75-76, PDCP thus expects to raise about P 68 million in
peso resources in addition to peso loan collections estimated at P 32.8 million;
its peso commitments in the same period are expected to be about P 62
million. The planned share capital increase and debentures issue for 1974,
totalling P 23 million, will go a long way in correcting the over-commitment
of long-term peso resources noted above.
4.18      Foreign Currency Resource Position and Requirements.  As indicated
in Annex 16, PDCP had about US$13.5 million equivalent in foreign currency
resources available for commitment, as of April 30, 1974. In the month
of May PDCP approved a further US$0.4 million, bringing the five month
(January-May) total of foreign currency approvals to US$17.8 million. Based
on its present pipeline, PDCP expects to approve the remaining US$13.1 million
by around December 1974.  (The rate of approvals could have been much faster
had PDCP not been husbanding its remaining foreign exchange funds.) Unless



- 17 -
it can mobilize additional resources by then it will have to withold
further approvals. Given prevailing circumstances, PDCP has found it
impossible to mobilize resources from foreign capital markets, even through
a syndicated arrangement with IFC, except at a floating rate. Medium- and
long-term funds at a fixed rate of interest are simply unavailable. Even
if they were, PDCP, with its own lending rate legally limited to 12% (for
secured loans), could not afford to borrow them.1/ To ensure the continuity
of its operations PDCP is relying heavily on the Bank Group to cover at least
part of its foreign currency needs, with a request for a US$40 million
IBRD/IFC financing package. In the present monetary situation, IFC has felt
unable to syndicate a loan for PDCP; even if the prospects improve, indications
are that IFC will not be able to provide more than US$10-15 million. PDCP
has also approached the Export-Import Bank of Japan for a yen loan equivalent
to US$10 million, the terms of which are not yet certain. The loan is
expected to bear a rate of about 7.5 to 7.75%, with a maturity of 10-12
years. PDCP expects the balance (US$20 million) of its foreign exchange
requirements of US$70 million over the 1975-76 period to be covered by a
further loan from the ADB in 1976. PDCP feels that, on present indications,
it will be unable to approach foreign capital markets directly until about
1977 when it plans to float a bond issue for US$10 million.
V. THE LOAN - OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPAL FEATURES
5.01      Purposes of the Loan.  Broadly, the proposed loan to PDCP will
support one major constituent of the government's stated development policy,
i.e. the rapid development of widely based export oriented manufacturing
industries, by financing the direct foreign currency fixed capital costs of
a number of sub-projects in the industrial, agro-industrial, tourism and
transport sectors. 2/ The projects financed under this loan would be those
1/   Current Asian and Euro-dollar minimum lending rates are above 11.5%
for short-term funds.
2/   Recent changes in legislation (particularly R.A. 6142, "The Foreign
Borrowing Act") have enabled PDCP to utilize the proceeds of the Bank
loan to finance virtually any type of project (except those involving
foreign ownership in excess of 30%) without restriction. Industrial
projects to be financed from the Bank loan do not necessarily require
registration with the BOI, as long as such projects are authorized by
the charter of the public institution (in this instance PNB) incurring
the loan for relending to a private company. PNB's Charter effectively
authorizes the financing of all projects for the "establishment, reha-
bilitation or expansion of agricultura, export, industrial and other
profitable enterprises". Nevertheless, PDCP has, as a matter of policy,
provided its support primarily to those projects clearly approved as
being in line with the Government's development objectives and priorities.



- 18 -
approved by the appropriate government authorities in consonance with the
country's investment priorities and development objectives. While small
industry projects would be eligible for financing under this loan,1/ it
is expected that the bulk of the loan proceeds would finance medium-scale
projects, most of which would be oriented towards the earning or saving
of f-oreign exchange. As with other Bank loans to DFCs, eligible projects
would be broadly defined to include manufacturing, agro-industries, ocean
and coastal shipping, hotels, etc.
5.02      Objectives.  A Bank loan to PDCP at this time would ensure the
continuity of its industrial financing operations over the next year, and
would, over the longer term, contribute to relieving the expected pressure
on the Philippine balance of payments. This loan would also serve to continue
the long and mutually beneficial relationship the Bank Group has established
with PDCP. As a result of that relationship the Bank Group has been instru-
mental in helping establish a sound and efficient institution, and has been
able to exert its influence in encouraging PDCP to be more innovative in
its lending approach; to commit itself towards greater regional dispersal
of investment; to ensure the viability and value of industrial projects from
the economic and social viewpoints, and to provide greater assistance to
smaller enterprises. The initiatives taken by PDCP in these directions
(paragraphs 3.01 to 3.09) along with its successful syndication efforts
(in which IFC has played a prominent role) are evidence that Bank Group
influence has been beneficial.  Over the period of the proposed loan's
disbursement, the Bank Group can expect PDCP's efforts along these lines
to be intensified.
5.03      Justification.  Since the loan will finance sub-projects
which have not as yet been identified, an ex ante calculation of the economic
rate of return for any of these is clearly not possible. However, as pre-
viously noted (paragraph 3.04), the economic rates of return 2/ on a sample of
PDCE'-financed projects approved in 1973 and early 1974, range between 22%
and over 100%. Subprojects financed from this loan are expected to show
similar results. 3/
5.04      Form of Bank Lending.  As with the previous three Bank loans to
PDCTP, disbursement and repayment of the proposed loan would be coursed through
the Philippine National Bank (PNB). This is necessitated by a legal require-
ment: which restricts the issuance of a government guarantee only to obligations
1/  Under previous Bank loans, there was a minimum limit of US$50,000 for
sub-projects to be financed from Bank funds. There will be no such
minimum limit under this loan.
2/   Calculated at the time of appraisal.
3/   PDCP has plans to undertake an economic analysis of some of its pre-
vious projects which are now fully operational, to evaluate ex-post
whether original expectations of economic and financial benefits
emanating from them have been justified.



- 19 -
incurred by public institutions. For its services as a conduit, the PNB will
charge PDCP a handling fee of 0.75% per annum on the outstanding loan amount.
5.05      Utilization and Withdrawal of Proceeds.  The loan would finance
only direct foreign currency costs of capital goods required for eligible
sub-projects. The authorization and approval of withdrawals would be in
accordance with normal Bank practice as it relates to DFC loans. The
estimated disbursement schedule of the loan is shown in Annex 17.
5.06      Foreign Exchange Risk.   The main foreign exchange risk, e.g. that
on the foreign currencies of the countries where the goods are procured,
will be assumed by sub-borrowers. The Government may offer to PDCP's sub-
borrowers insurance against the risk of fluctuations of exchange rates
between the currencies of procurement and the currencies of obligation, for
a fee to be determined. If this insurance is not forthcoming or if it is
not desired by a PDCP sub-borrower, the sub-borrower will also bear the risk
on currencies of obligation.
5.07      Amortization Schedule.  The proposed loan would have a flexible
amortization schedule which would conform essentially to the aggregate of the
amortization schedules of the sub-loans made by PDCP to its clients. Our
previous experience suggests that the loan would be fully amortized within
a period of sixteen years, with a grace period of about 2 years.
5.08      Free Limit.  In view of the high quality of PDCP's appraisal work
and the control exercised by its management and Board, a free limit of US$1.5
million is recommended for industrial sub-loans. The free limit set at the
time of the last Bank loan in 1969 was US$500,000. There was no requirement
for prior approval of sub-projects of any size under the terms of the IFC
loan of US$15 million made in 1972. An analysis of the loans approved in the
first quarter of 1974 suggests that with the proposed free limit about one
quarter of the number of projects financed with the proceeds of this loan
(accounting for over two-thirds of the loan amount) will require the prior
approval of the Bank.
5.09      Ceiling on the Size of Sub-Loans.  To ensure that the proposed loan
will be used to finance a relatively large number of industrial projects, a
ceiling of US$2.5 million on each sub-loan made by PDCP under the proposed
Bank loan is recommended. The recent IFC loan of US$15 million was used to
finance 31 sub-loans (average size of sub-loan being about US$500,000). It
is expected that the proposed loan would finance about 40-45 sub-loans aver-
aging about US$600,000.
5.10      Relending Rate.  As with the recent loan to DBP, it is expected
that PDCP would relend the proceeds of the loan at 12%, the maximum legal
rate that can be applied to secured loans in the Philippines (paragraph 2.05).
After payment of the 0.75% per annum handling fee to PNB, PDCP would be left
with a spread of 3.25%. If the legal lending rate ceiling of 12% is
lifted PDCP would, after consultation with the Bank, raise its re-lending
rate to competitive levels. If the new relending rate results in a spread



- 20 -
to PDCP of greater than 3.5% (which appears reasonable), the excess spread
would accrue to the Government as a guarantee fee.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01      Rapid growth of the export-oriented manufacturing sector is an
important element in the continued economic development of the Philippines,
and deserves the continued support of the Bank Group. In view of the
competence of its management and staff and the soundness of its organization
and financial position, PDCP is a suitable borrower of Bank funds. A Bank
loan of US$30 million is recommended.
6.02      During negotiations the following matters were discussed and
agreed:
(a)  the limitation of PDCP's spread to 3.5% in the event PDCP
is allowed to raise its relending rate above the present
legal limit of 12% p.a. (paragraph 5.10);
(b) a ceiling of US$2.5 million on each industrial sub-loan to
be made by PDCP under the proposed loan (paragraph 5.09);
(c) a free limit of US$1.5 million (paragraph 5.08);
(d) a handling fee of 0.75% per annum for PNB (paragraph 5.04);
and
(e) the maintenance of the lung-term debt/equity ratio at not
more than 6.5:1, and of the short-term debt/equity at not
more than 2:1 (paragraph 4.11).



ANNEX 1

THE PHILIPPINE ECONOMY AND THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
The Econoyl/
1.        Background.  Prior to 1973 the performance of the Philippine
economy was relatively disappointing.  Its growth rate belied the poten-
tial of a country with considerable natural resource endowments. Towards
the end of the 1960's increasing budgetary deficits, losses of foreign
reserves and ther apid accumulation of short-term foreign debt to an
unmanageable level compelled the Government to adopt a floating exchange
rate (para 2.11) and embark on a program of stabilization in February 1970.
The restrained monetary and fiscal policies introduced under the program
sharply curbed both investment and growth. The adjusted exchange rate
reduced export earnings, increased the import bill and resulted in a signi-
ficant deterioration in the external terms of trade.  The economy also
experienced rapid inflation between 1969-72; prices increased by about 45%
over that period, resulting in a drop in real incomes for the wage-earning
group and an increase in umemployment. Economic recovery, which began
slowly in 1971, was severely set back in 1972 with the worst floods in
20 years and a large drop in agricultural production. The resulting eco-
nomic pressures provoked widespread civil unrest which culminated in the
imposition of martial law in September 1972. With the subsequent
restoration of stability, the passage of economic reforms and favorable
changes in world commodity prices, the economy registered an impressive
10% real growth rate in 1973. Improved performance was recorded in
every sector. The agricultural sector which had suffered from adverse
weather conditions during the previous three years grew by 11%. Export
earnings rose to a record high of $1.7 billion in 1973 (55% over 1972)
reflecting increases in both traditional exports (mainly due to prices)
and new exports, particularly manufactures (paragraph 2.05). Net
foreign exchange reserves rose to US$835 million at the close of 1973 -
the highest in Philippine history. On the domestic front, measures
such as tax reforms, amnesties and improved collection resulted in a 38%
increase in tax revenues in 1973. Investment activity and foreign capital
inflows also rose to levels substantially above those of 1972.
2.        Current Performance:  Results for the first quarter appear to
bear out expectations that the remarkably high growth rate would not be
sustained in 1974 but would level off to the long-term growth rate of
around 6-7%. International reserves, over $1 billion on March 31, 1974,
remain strong but the trade balance has deteriorated from a level of
$102 million in the first quarter of 1973 to $8 million this year.
Export receipts were 49% higher (due mainly to price increases) but
imports rose by 105%, reflecting substantial increases in raw material
and producer goods prices. Invisibles made up for some of the deterioration
with a surplus of $126 million reflecting a much higher level of private

equity and debt capital inflow, offset to some extent by a $60 million
increase in short-term debt service payments. The most worrying factor
is an inflation rate of around 38-40% which has hit lower-income groups
the hardest.
3.        Future Directions.  As outlined in the 1974-77 Development Plan,
the Government's economic strategy aims at increasing the long-term annual
growth rate to over 7% in real terms and increasing the annual rate of
employment creation to over 4%. The projected oil import bill remains a
continuing source of uncertainty threatening the country's reserves position.
Whereas 1973 exceeded expectations, the ensuing period may be one of con-
solidation with the groundwork being laid for a sustained rate of better
distributed growth. The Philippine economny is a relatively open one and
adverse changes in the economies of its major trading partners (the USA,
Japan and Europe) will inevitablg have repercussions on the domestic front.
xport coqpetition, particularly in manufactures, in bound to heighten
as neighboring economies will also pursue export promotion strategies to
caver rising import costs and the outcome will be heavily dependent on
whether present trends in stability and economic management are maintained.
4.        The Role of Industry.  Over the long term, heavy reliance is
being placed on industrial expansion in achieving income and employment
growth targets. Specifically, the Government's thrust is toward the
promotion of employment opportunities through the encouragement of labor
intensive methods of production, increasing foreign exchange earnings
through the rapid expansion of manufactured exports, the strengthening
of intra- and inter-industry linkages and the intensification of efforts
at a wider regional dispersion of investmernt. Accordingly, the Government
has given priority to investments in export-oriented projects and to the
further development of small- and medium-scale industrial enterprises.l/
The Industrial Sector-/
5.        Recent growth.  Industry (manufacturing, mining and construction)
represents the third largest sector in the Philippine economy (after agri-
culture and services), accounting for 27% of net domestic product in 1973,
absorbing over a third of total fixed investment and providing employment
for 15% of the total labor force. Reflecting the strong recovery of the
economy in 1973, industry grew by around 11%, a markedly higher rate than
the average growth rate of 6% in the 1960's and early 70's. An increasing
proportion of manufacturing output was export-oriented. Non-traditional
manufactures accounted for over 11.8% of total exports in 1973 compared
with less than 5.7% in 1969, increasing in val-ue from US$49 million in
1969 to US$200 million in 1973.
1/ Appraisal of a bank loan for Small-Scale Industry has been scheduled
for September 1974.
2/   The Industrial Sector is discussed in detail in a report entitled,
"Industrial Development Problems and Prospects in the Philippines",
dated March 19, 1974 (Report No. 280-PH).



ANNEX 1
Page 3
6.        Structure.  Manufacturing, which accounts for over two-thirds
of all industrial activity, is predominantly privately owned and is
generally concentrated in large-scale, vertically integrated, relatively
capital-intensive units. In 1971, organized manufacturing units with
fewer than 20 employees accounted for 85% of the number of enterprises but
for less than 17% of industrial employment, 8% of the payroll, 4.7% of
value added and 5.5% of total assets of manufacturing enterprises. By
sectors, food and beverages represent the largest industry group, with
chemicals and petrochemicals second, and textiles ranking third.
Geographically, over 65% of manufacturing enterprises are concentrated in
the greater Manila and southern Luzon area, with increasing industriali-
zation taking place in Mindanao.
7.        Orientation.  Its growing export orientation notwithstanding,
Philippine manufacturing is geared mainly to production for the domestic
consumer market. This is attributable to an industrialization strategy
which previously (in the 1950's and 60's) placed excessive emphasis on
import substitution, resulting in a domestic market highly protected by
both direct import controls and high tariffs. The industrial investment
and output thus encouraged tapered off with the exhaustion of possibilities
for easy import substitution. For a time, the protected market, the lack
of any direction and regulation of investment, and cheap capital resulted
in chronic overcapacity in several industries and created severe financial
difficulties for several large enterprises. However, with better markets
at home and abroad, a more realistic exchange rate and better regulation
of investment this situation has improved considerably in the last two
years.
8.        Policies.  Since 1968, the industrial sector has been affected
by several policy changes. The most important of these include: (i) a
reform of investment and export incentives and the establishment of the
Board of Investment (BOI); (ii) the exchange rate adjustment and (iii)
tariff policy.
9.        Investment and Export Incentives.  The Investment Incentives Act
(R.A. 5186) of 1967 reformed and subsumed the previous fragmented structure
of incentives; it was supplemented by the Export Incentives Act (R.A.6135)
in 1970. Both acts were amended in 1973 with a "labor-intensity" criterion
being introduced. These Acts resulted in a reduction of taxes and tariffs
foregone from 20% of annual gross investments (between 1965-68) to 10%
(between 1968-72) and in a change in the composition of taxes forgiven.
Exemptions have emphasized income and sales tax relief (which do not
discriminate against domestic products) and reduced reliance on import
duty. Export incentives, which have been widely availed of, have assisted
the growth of exports and the diversification of the export product range.
10.       The Board of Investments (BOI).  The responsibility for determin-
ing the eligibility of and registering projects for incentives and regulat-
ing private industrial investment lies with the BOI. Accordingly, it:
issues an annual Investment Priorities Plan (IPP) listing those activities
which qualify for incentives; determines the additional capacity required



ANNEX 1
Page 4
in industries; and approves individual investment projects in line with
the annual IPP. The BOI also draws up a periodical list of "overcrowded
industries" in which the Government discourages further investments by
refusing incentives and foreign exchange for imports. The BOI plays a
central role 'an an "evaluation and appraisal" body which delves deeply into
the technical, financial and economic viability of industrial projects.
Its project evaluation is of high quality. BOI is, in addition, an active
promotional agency, which by virtue of its powers to provide or refuse
incentives guides investment and reshapes project design. It also assists
private investors with arrangements for domestic and international market-
ing and subcontracting, and undertakes specific industry and market studies
for them. BOI has been endeavoring to improve its operations, policies
and procedures, and to that end has received, since 1972, the technical
assistance of the UNDP in a program for which the Bank is the Executing
Agency. About one-half of new industrial investment in the Philippines
now goes into projects approved by BOI. From its inception in June 1968
to June 30, 1973, BOI has approved 250 projects requiring a total invest-
ment of P7.2 billionl/ of which about P4.3 billion (or 60%) represents
fixed investment. When completed, these projects are expected to generate
46,000 additional jobs. Average fixed investment per job created for BOI
projects has been P93,500 or $13,750 with a noticeable declining trend,
reflecting BOI's increasing emphasis on labor-intensive industries.
Exports of BOI-registered firms are expected to grow from $243 million
in 1973 to over $400 million in 1974 and about $670 million in 1976.
11.        Exchange Rate.   The floating of the peso in February 1970 re-
sulted in a large de facto devaluation of about 60% (from P3.9 to P6.4
to US$1). The more realistic exchange rate reduced distortions in the
price of inputs, discouraged currency speculation through over-invoicing,
and made Philippine manufactui"ed exports more competitive. Unfortunately,
it also hit very hard those industrial firms heavily dependent on imported
inputs and with sizeable foreign debts. The problems of debt-servicing
thus created are slowly being ironed out. The initial "shock" of the
devaluation has now worked itself through the system and the maintenance
of a more realistic exchange rate will probably have a salutary effect
on future resource allocation.
12.        Revision of Tariffs. A number of changes and improvements took
place in the structure of protection with the passage of Presidential
Decree No. 34 which took effect on January 1, 1973. Although introduced
principally as a revenue measure, the new tariff code has simplified and
re-arranged the previous structure. A minimum tariff rate of 10% is im-
posed on raw materials which have to be imported and on capital goods not
yet manufactured in the Philippines. Higher rates, of between 30-70%, are
levied on intermediate and consumer goods, with a maximum 100% rate applied
to products manufactured domestically and to luxury items. The element of
protection in the tariff structure is reinforced by an import licensing
system administered in consultation with BOI for industrial products and
capital goods for which domestic capacity exists or is planned. BOI can
also recommend changes in tariff rates for industries included in the IPP.

ANNEX 1
Page 5
Because of licensing and the fact that nominal rates for complete products
are higher than for inputs or components, the level of effective protection
for domestic finished products is generally higher than the nominal rate.
13.       Policy-Making and Implementation.  The BOI, originally designed
as the principal regulatory agency which would guide industrial investmen.
has, by default, been increasingly involved in policy-making.  To relieve
it of the resulting overload two new Government agencies are expected to
play an important role alongside the BOI in formulating and implementing
industrial policies. The first is the National Economic Development
Authority (NEDA). Created in 1973, NEDA is now the principal apex
policy-making institution, and is responsible for the preparation of the
4-year Development Plan. The second is the newly established Department
of Energy and Industry (DEI) which is expected to begin operating shortly.
Industrial Finance
14.       Investment Requirements.  Total industrial investment over the
4-year  .riod 1974-77 is expected to be around P20 billion (in 1973
prices)_  or over 25% of total fixed capital formation.  This represents
a real increase of about 60% over the previous 4 years. Investment in
manufacturing will account for over 67%, increasing in real terms by 20%
between 1974 and 1975 and by 10% thereafter. The Government expects 75%
of these requirements to be financed through domestic sources,- 5% from
direct foreign investment and 20% from guaranteed commercial foreign
borrowings. This level of investment will require a doubling in resource
mobilization from traditional domestic sources. The main sources of
industrial finance are discussed below.
15.       Development Banks.  Two institutions, DBP and the Private
Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP) are the main providers
of long-term finance with DBP by far the larger of the two (paragraph
3.01).  IBP's  total assets as of the end of 1973 were P5.1 billion, with
outstanding loans to industry amounting to P2.5 billion.  DBP recently
received a Bank lbn of w$go million of which -US$US million was for
industrial finanoing.
16.       Commercial Banks.  There are 35 privately-owned Filipino com-
mercial banks, and two owned by the Government. Branches of four foreign
banks also operate in the Philippines. Over half of the Filipino banks
have been established in the last decade. They operate under a branch
banking system (there are over 700 branches) and are the main sources
of working capital and trading credits. The largest bank is the Govern-
ment-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB). With 161 branches, it accounts
for about 24% of the banking system's total assets (over P30 billion at
the end of 1973). The banking system has grown rapidly in 1972 and 1973,
doubling its assets in that two-year period. Domestic credits provided by
commercial banks.in 1973 amounted to P21 billion, one-half of which went
to the manufacturing sector, mainly for short-term working capital.

ANNEX 1
Page 6
17.       Other Financial Institutions.  Besides DBP and PDCP, several
institutions provide term finance to industry. These include: (i) the
National Investment and Development Corporation (NIDC), a subsidiary of
PNB; (ii) private investment houses; (iii) insurance companies; and
(iv) pension and trust funds including the Government Service Insurance
System (GSIS) and the Social Security System (SSS), whose resources for
industry are funnelled mainly through DBP. While the outstanding loan
portfolios of these institutions now total over P6 billion, the bulk of
their lending is for real estate (60%) and consumer loans (25%).
18.       Suppliers' Credits.  Foreign commercial borrowings guaranteed
by domestic financial intermediaries (principally DBP) have in the past
accounted for 30-35% of investment in manufacturing. Prior to 1970, such
borrowings were obtained on relatively hard terms. As a result of the
stringent debt management measures taken since 1970 by the Central Bank
which stipulated minimum terms for foreign credits, and the substantial
increases in export earnings, the burden of servicing such debt has been
reduced to a manageable level.
19.       The Securities Market.  After a three-year slump,  the Philippine
stock market experienced a remarkable year in 1973. While listings con-
tinued their steady upward trend, increasing to 188 from 171 in the
previous year, trading reached an all time high with a volume of 136
million shares worth P6 billion. This reflected a fivefold increase in
volume and ninefold in value over 1972. In addition 20 companies already
listed increased their capital stock from P1.3 billion to P3.1 billion
with a much wider base of public participation. The comparatively
attractive price-earnings ratios of Philippine stocks also drew funds
from the Japanese and Hong Kong Markets.  The substantial gains in capital
market activity in 1973 were attributable to several factors such as the
general recovery of the economy, a decline in money market rates, and
structural reforms based on the recommendations of a joint IMF-Central
Bank Commission. The reforms included such measures as a reduction in the
stock transfer tax; exemption from capital gains on the securities of
preferred productive enterprises; repatriation of foreign capital and
profits; a tax amnesty which returned several hundred million pesos from
the "black market" to the capital market; and a compulsory dividend
declaration rule for companies generating profits in excess of reasonable
capital expansion requirements.
20.       Prospects.  Plan expectatiorns are that corporate savings and
personal savings channelled through the capital market will provide about
45% of total industrial financing requirements. In the light of current
levels of profitability and capital market activity (paragraph 2.19)
these expectations are reasonable. Financial intermediaries are expected
to mobilize a further 30% (or P6 billion) over the 4-year period, including
foreign borrowings from aid and commercial sourcesl/ and domestic savings
(paragraph 2.20). The remaining 25A, expected to come from direct and
indirect foreign investment (guarantees), represents a reduced relianace
on guarantees (paragraph 2.18), a desirable but uncertain prospect.

ANNEX 8
Page 1
FRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
General Business Policies
(Adopted by the Board on March 10, 1964 and amended by Board
Resolutions No. 264-66 on July 15, 1966; No. 333-68 on
January 16, 1968; No. 456-70 on June 19, 1970; and No.
559-72 on September 12, 1972)
I. Economic Role of PDCP
The Corporation shall assist in the economic development of the Philippines.
To this end it will assist in the development of private productive enter-
prises in the country by providing medium, long-term and equity financing
to such enterprises, assisting in the development of a wider market for
corporate securities, encouraging a wider distribution of ownership in
such enterprises.
II. Privately-Controlled Industrial and Other Productive Enterprises
The term rlprivately-controlled" as used in the Articles of Incorporation
will be taken to mean all enterprises which are privately operated and
managed, and where private ownership is of controlling interest (at
least 2/3 of the voting stock). The mere fact that such firms have
secured loans from government financial institutjions, or that the govern-
ment holds a minority equity position (up to 1/3 of the voting stock)
will not exclude such firms from receiving assistance from the Corporation.
III. Non-Control of Enterprises Financed
The Corporation will not seek to control any of the enterprises that it
finances and will not participate in the management of such firms.
TI.  Diversification of Investments
In managing its portfolio, the Corporation will endeavoir to diversify
its investments--in terms of the type of industries being financed, the
location of such industries, and as to whether funds are used for medium-
or long-term loans, or for equity investments. Having regard to its
developmental objectives, the Corporation will give priority to increasing
the number of enterprises it finances, to assisting medium and small firms
as well as large, and to diversifying the ownership of client enterprises.
In this latter connection, the Corporation will seek to broaden the
entrepreneurial base in the country, by making special efforts to assist
qualified enterprises that, by virtue of their size, age or ownership, do
not have as ready access to other financial institutions as the larger,
better established industrial enterprises in the country.
V. Maximum Investment
a) The Corporation shall not normally make an investment in any one
investment enterprise, if at the time or as a result thereof the



ANNEX 8
Page 2
total investment enter-rise shall exceed an amount equivalent to
20% of the sum of paid-in unimpaired capital, surplus and reserves
of the Corporation and the amount of the A.I.D. loan not due and
payable.
b)  In general, the Corporation's iLvestment in any one investment en-
terprise shall not exceed 5k% of the total assets of the >ivestment
enterprise including PDCP's investment.
c) For the purposes of this policy, the term "investment" shall refer
to loans, equity participations and guarantees.
VI. Retirement of Equity Investments
The Corporation looks upon its equity investments more as an assistance
to productive enterprises and will seek to retire and dispose of its
shares, as soon as this becomes feasible and a fair price can be ob-
tained for its shares.
VII. Dissemination of Ownership
The ownership of the Corporation will be disseminated as widely as pos-
sible, and reasonable efforts will be taken to prevent any one person,
entity, or group from dominating the ownership or management of the
Corporation.
VIII. Reserve and Dividend Policy
The Corporation will pursue a pr-dent dividend policy that will enable
it to provide shareholders with a fair return on their investment, while
at the same time ensuring that its surplus reserves grow at a reasonable
rate. The Corporation will from time to time appropriate a portion of
its retained earnings to surplus reserves. The Corporation will also
provide by charges against income valuation reserves consistent with the
size and quality of the Corporation's loan and equity portfolio.
IX. Exchange Risk
The Corporation will protect itself adequately against foreign exchange
risks arising out of its operations.
X.  Criteria in Processing Loan Applications
Loan applications filed with the Corporation will be processed on the
basis of their economic and business merits. The projects will be
analyzed as to their economic desirability, technical feasibility, finan-
cial soundness, management competence, etc., to insure that only sound
productive vent,res are financed.
XI. Technical Assistance to New Enterprises
The Corporation will endeavour to provide the necessary technical services
to the enterprises being financed, whenever necessary.

Financial Position and Performance
Financial Position
1.        Assets. As the audited balance sheets for FY70-73 and unaudited
balance sheet for the first quarter of 197)4 (attached as table 1) show,
PDCP's total assets as of March 31, 1974 stood at P705.9 million. The
composition of PDCP's asset structure and its recent growth is illustrated
in the following table:
PDCP's Asset Structure (Pesos in millions)
Dec. 31,'72     Dec. 31  173     March 31, '74

Year-to-year growth              9.1%            39.8%            17.5k/
As can be seen from the above, 1973 was a year of sharp changes both in
terms of the growth and structure of PDCP'x assets. The first quarter of
1974 reflects a return to a more stable long-term growth rate and a greater
long-term orientation in asset structure. Current assets and fixed assets
showed the most marked changes in 1973; the former reflecting a heightened
level of money market activity (current assets grew by over 114% to account
for just under 40% of total assets, with PDCP's holding of money market
instruments and cash growing by over 230%) and the latter reflecting the
acquisition of PDCP's headquarters building in Makati. Long-term loans,
however, which grew by 12% in 1973 increased by a further 12% in the first
quarter of 1974 alone (or 48% at an annualized rate), reflecting a much
higher level of disbursements in 1974. Domestic currency loans have continued
their steady decline in prominence as a proportion of total long-term loans,
falling from 14.8% in 1970 to 9.7% as of March 31, 1974. Equity and long-term
debt investments have remained almost static at the P23-24 million level since
1971. Not shown on the above table are accumulated allowances for bad debt

of P1l.l lmillion (P5.1 million against current assets and P6 million
against long-term loans) and an allowance for a decline in the market
value of investmnts of P1.25 million. These allowances are more than
adequate and represent nearly 7.7%, 1.4%, and 4.9% of the short-term
receivables, long-term receivables and equity investment portfolios.
2.        Liabilities.  PDCP'a total debt liabilities as of March 31, 1974
amounted to P62B 5il       with additional contingent liabilities of P29.8
million. The coqposition and growth of its liabilities since December 31,

The growth pattern of liabilitLew, as might be expete l, is quit. siudlar
to that of assets, although the composition of liabilities has remained
much more stable over tho period.  Reflecting the growth of PDCPts amoney
market operations, current liab.lities grw  aubstantially in 1973 (by 63.7%)
with short-torm pagables of, *oo  market instruents and notes increasing by
over 150%. The first quarter of 1974 however has seen a much greater drop
(proportionately) in suck liabilities than in equivalent assets (although
these have also declined sinhat).  The extraordinary level of money market
operations in 1973 to *oms extent reflected the availability of a greater
quantity of undisbursed (but comitted) funds than has been available to
PDCP before or since. The marked increase in long-term loans payable in
1973 reflected the full drawdown of the $15 million (F101.4 million equi-
valent) IFC loan prior to its comaitment for specific sub-projecto. In the
first quarter of 1974 other long-term loans payable also increased sharply
(by about 50% on an amual basis) reflecting a much higher than usual level
drawdown on the second AM credit line.

3.        Net Worth.   PDCP's net worth as of March 31, 1974 was P77.9
million; retained earnings of P34.6 million, accounted for 44.4% of this
amount, having increased by P7.5 million (or 30% in 1973 and a further
P2.12 in the first quarter of 1974). Paid-in share capital has r_mained
constant at P40.25 million since the and of 1971, but as indicated Olhe-
where, it will increase by P10 million in 1974 and perhaps a further P10
million in 1976 with paid-in capital premiums of P10 million and P15 million
respectively.
4.        Cpital Struture. As Table 3 indicates, PDCP'a capital structuy,
has graduall  become  ore debt-oriented as the long-term debt equity ratio-
has crept upwards from 4.1:1 in 1970 to its present level of 5.4:1.  This is
well within the contractual limit of 6.5:1 (aznded in July 1973). An
institution with PDCP's managerial capabilities and portfolio quality could
probably sustain a much higher level of leverage without jeopardising its
viability. The short-term debt/equity ratio (limited to a contractual
maximum of 2:1) has fluctuated wildly, reflecting largely the volume of
PDCP's money market operations in any given period - as of March 31, 1974
it was 0.54:1.

ANNEX 12
Page 4
As can be seen the annual rate of income growth has levelled off in 1973 and
the first quarter of 1974 to around 10-11% compared to an average annual rate
of growth of 24% in the previous 5-year period (1968-72). This reflected a
much lower than expected rate of approvals and disbursements between 1970-72
when the political situation in the Philippines was highly unsettled and
rates of investment much lower than at present. Income from short-term
investments has again increased in significance (partly due to interest
received on deposits of the IFC loan) now accounting for 19-20% of gross
income compared to a 15-16% level between 1970-72 (in 1968 it accounted for
29% and in 1969 for 22%). Income from other sources has risen ubstantially
over the last quarter due to rental income deriving from its recently acquired
building. Commissions and fees from underwriting and guarantee operations have
declined steadily since 1972 - this source of income is expected to be of
diminishing importance.
6.     ,ExenJes.  PDCP has continued,to the extent possible,to keep a
tight contr      rits expenses.  The sharp increase in operating expenses
in 1973 (by 88%) was attributable to: i) increased costs for maintenance
of its newly acquired building (which aecounted largely for a 150% increase
in administrative expenses); a sizeable increase in staff compensation levels
and benefits and an increased proportion of professional staff in its total
work force (which accounted for the 41% increase in salaries and other
personnel expenses). Interest expenses, which continue to account for about
77% total expenses, rose by about 50% (compared to average increases of 25-30%
in the past) mainly because of the lump sum withdrawal of the IFC loan.
Provisions for doubtful accounts for 1973 were reduced from 1972 levels,
but nevertheless quite adequate.
7.        Performance Indicators.  As the indicators in Table 3 suggest
PDCP's performance can be considered satisfactory, despite a declining trend
in a few critical ratios. While on the whole net earnings are still satisfactory
and high enough to allow adequately for both dividends and increases in retained
earnings, before-tax profits on average assets have declined steadily from 5.6%
in 1970 to 3.3% in 1973 (after-tax profits in that year amounted to 2.2% of
average assets). In terms of return on equity, however, the earnings are
satisfactory at a stable level of 17-18% of average equity. Financial expenses
are about 6.4% of average assets, having risen from the previous level of 5.2%;
administrative expenses on the other hand continue to account for around 1.0%
of average assets. Earnings per share, after a slight dip in 1971 when they
fell to F2.41 have risen steadily since to P3.16 in 1973.  Debt service coverage
remained quite stable at 1.24 in 1973 but has fallen to 1.1 in the first quarter
of 1974. PDCP's attention has been drawn to the Bank's concern about this
reduction and its implications. It has undertaken to exavine the situation
carefully and to advice the Bank of its intentions on effecting an improve-
ment in the coverage ratio.

Highlights on Variances of Loans in Arrears
For the Periods March 31, 1973 to March 31, 1974
1.  From 24 companies appearing in the past due list as of March 31, 1973,
March 31, 1974 report registered 23 companies or a decrease of one
(1) company.
2. Amount in arrears as of March 31, 1974 increased by P4,661 million.
However, it will be noted that the "over 12 months" category of loans
in arrears has substantially improved due to the collection of several
long overdue accounts. "Over 12 months overdue" as of March 31, 1973
represents 65.4% as compared to 31.0% as of March 31, 1974.

ANNEX 15
PHILIPPDIES                   YZg
PRIVATE IEVhLOPMHT CRURORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
Projection of Cperations and Finances 1974-78
Industrial Investment Prospects
1.        Levels of industrial investment in the Philippines have picked
up markedly since 1973; despite a high rate of inflation and uncertainty
about future economic conditions there are no signs of a let-up. In peso
terms levels of investment have been significantly higher than anticipated
mainly because of price rises. But, quite apart from these,in NEIA's
1974-77 Development Plan the real growth in private manufacturing invest-
ment was projected to be 20% in 1974 levelling off to 10% thereafter
through 1977. Present trends suggest that these growth rates are
achievable, and from 1975 onwards may be on the low side.
Operational Projections
2.        Lending Operations.  Table 1 attached to this Annex provides
PDCP's latest forecasts for approvals, commitments and disbursements
through 1978 for its lending, capital market and guarantee operations.
Compared to forecasts made a year ago (for an ISRD supervision mission),
current projections of lending operations reflect a significantly higher
level of operations beginning 1974; in dollar terms, foreign lending is
higher by 83% for 1974, 64% for 1975, 63% for 1976 and 72% for 1977, whilst
peso lending is higher by 27% in 19744, 31% in 1975, 37% in 1976, and 43%
in 1977.  To an extent these increases (especially for foreign currency
loans) are accounted for by price increaaes for imported capital goods.
However, the increases mainly (but inadequately) reflect the higher level
of overall investment which despite the projected increases in lending will
result in a decline of PDCP's market share (paragraph 5). The foreign
currency lending figures for 1974 (which are 142% above previous year levels)
also reflect some "bunching" of projects which should have been approved
in 1973; this would account for about $5.0 million of the projected $30
million. Some bunching is carried over into 1975 (about $1.3 million).
Loan approvals (including small business loans Which are expected to
increase from P5 million in 1974 to P14.4 million, or at 30% per year) from
1974 onwards are expected to grow from P234 million in 1974 to P356 million
in 1978, or at an average annual rate of just over 11%; disregarding the
effect of bunching the annual growth rate is just over 14% (about 3% more
than last year's assumption).  Under present asaumptions the annual growth
rate for foreign currency loans is about 10% (15% disregarding the bunch-
ing effect) and for local currency loans just under 18%. Over the five
year period foreign currency loans would account for about 86.5% of total
loan approvala in 1974 dropping to 82.8% in 1978 suggesting that after a
temporary upsurge of foreign currency lending, the declining trend in
foreign currency loans as a proportion of total loans (82% in 1972 and 77%
in 1973) will reassert itself. The assumptions used in projecting these
figures are supportable with the evidence available so far and are con-
firmed (within an acceptable margin of error) by PDCP's project pipeline.



ANNEX 15
Page 2
3.        Guarantee Operations.  PDCP's projected guarantee operations have
been revised substantially downward from the last forecast, as previous
expectations have failed to materialize. After a virtual cessation of
guarantee issues following the CB's clampdown in 1970/71 PDCP expected
that with a substantially improved business climate in 1973, operations
would pick up and that it would issue guarantees totalling P25 million in
1973 and P29 million in 1974. In fact approvals in 1973 totalled P6.1
xillion and there have been no approvals so far in 1974. Consequently
using 1974 as the base year PDCP has revised guarantee issues to P10
million and assumed a 15% growth rate thereafter. It is difficult to
judge under present circumstances whether these expectations will be
borne out; under present unsettled foreign capital market conditions
the industrial borrowers who compriae PDCP's clientele are not too prone
to assume obligations carrying a high and fluctuating rate of interest,
nor is the CB willing to see too heavy a reliance placed on such financing.
However, all things being equal, PDCP'a revised projections are moderate
and considerably more realistic in the light of actual recent experience.
4.        Capital Market Operations.  Based on the experience of the past
year PDCP haa projected equity investments at P4.6 million in 1974 rising
at a rate of 15% per year to P8 million in 1978. These assumptions are
the same as for the previous forecast and on the basis of approvals so
far may prove to be conservative. Underwritings/private placements are
expected to grow somewhat more slowly than previously expected. The base
level for 1974 remains P4.8 million but the annual growth rate is assumed
to be 15% instead of 20%. In view of the competitive pressures faced by
PDCP in this activity, the downward adjustment seems appropriate. Syndi-
cations, however (on the basis of approvals in 1973 and in 1974 so far),
are expected to be significantly higher than allowed for in the previous
forecast. For 1974, tbe amount to be syndicated has been adjusted upward
by 37% to P50 million, growing at a 15% annual rate thereafter (irnstead of
a 25% rate as previously assumed). Total capital market operations for
1974 are thus expected to post a growth of 133% over 1973 with a growth
of 28% in equity (more likely to be 35-40%), 140% for underwriting/private
placementn and 151% for syndications.
5.        Overall Persaective.  The aggregate volume of PDCP's financing
is thus expected to grow from P303.5 million in 1974 to p476.9 million in
1978, representing an annual increase of around 12%. However its share of
the total market is expected to decline from 13.9% in 1974 to 12.7% in
1978. The difference of 13% between the volume of financing between 1973
and 1974, however, suggests that PDCP is now operating on a higher trend
line. The rate of growth of the potential market for foreign currency
assistance is estimated to be 15.5% per annum, which against PDCP's
projected increase of 10% annually from 1974 onwards will result in a
decline in its share of the market from 15.3% in 1974 to 12.5% in 1978.
On the other hand the projected increase in PDCP's local currency
financing from a total of  101 million in 1974 to P182 million in 1979 is
expected to outpace the growth of the local currency market and result
in an increase in PDCP's share of this market from 11.8% in 1974 to 12.9%
in 1978. PDCP's projections do not, however, take into account the



ANNEX 15
Page 3
possibility of increased domestic production of presently imported capital
goods which may result in a greater shift towards peso financing. In this
event, it may need to reconsider its local currency projections from 1976
onwards.
Projections of Financial Performance
6.        Income. Projected statements of income and expenses are provided
in Table 2 of thi8 Annex. As a result of the higher volume of total financ-
ing, gross income is shown rising from P71.8 million in 1974 (compared to
P71.4 million in the last forecast) to P143.8 million in 1978 or a compound
annual rate of about 19%. This growth is largely accounted for by income
from long-term loans which is expected to grow at 21% annually (from P56.3
million in 1974 to P118.3 million in 1978). Income from short-term invest-
ments on the other hand will grow by only 12% during the period accounting
for about 11% of gross income in 1978 as compared to 14.4% in 1974. Income
from capital market and guarantee operations is expected to grow by 20%
annually, while the growth of other income (from rentals etc.) is pro-
jected at 15% annually. These income projections have been based on
fairly conservative assumptions (on interest charges and yields) and on
reasonable assumptions derived from past experience between approvals,
commitments and disbursements.
7.        Expenses.  Operating expenses, have been projected to grow at a
rate of just over 10%, which in the light of recent experience seems too
optimistic an assumption.  The previous forecast assumed a compound growth
rate in expenses of 17%, a more reasonable figure. The base operating
expense figure for 1974 of P7.5 million also seems understated; operating
expenses incurred up to May 31, 1974 were P3.36 million suggesting a
year-end amount of about P8.05 million. At a 17% rate operating expenses
should increase to P15.1 million in 1978 (versus 11.0 million projected
by PDCP).  Taking into account this more conservative assumption,
administrative costs will account for only 1.15% of total average assets
in 1974 and for less than 1.2% in 1978 (compared to projections of 1.07%
and 0.88% respectively).  Interest expenses of P41.1 million for 1974 are
about 7-4% lower than projected last year, mainly because of a slower than
expected rate of disbursement from the second ADB line of credit. However,
theyare expected to be back to previously projected levels by 1975 and
show a higher rate of growth from then on. In the 1974-78 period interest
expenses and financial charges are projected to grow by nearly 22% per
annum (this could be higher if rates for comercial loans and loans from
IFC are higher than presently assumed).
8.        Earnings and Reserves. Assuming that PDCP's expense projections
are somewhat o timintic, not income would be lower than projected by P0.37
million in 1974, PD.8 million in 1975, 0O.82 in 1976, P1.55 million in 1977,
and P2.64 million in 1978. At these revised levels, net income would rise
from P14.0 million in 1974 to P23.3 million in 1978 or a growth rate of
13% per annum (higher than the 10% previously forecast). The (adjusted)
return on average equity would, then drop from 15.6% in 1974 (versus 16.01%



ANNEX 15
Page 4
as projected) to 13.6% in 1978 (against the 15.09% projected). The
reduction in net income resulting from the higher than projected levels
of expenses could conceivably be absorbed by a correaponding reduction
in the projected cash dividends (thus enabling the net cash flows and
projected balance sheets to remain unaffected); dividends would thus
be reduced from the assumed rate of 14% in 1974 and thereafter, to a
rate  of 13% in 1974, 12.6% in 1975 and 1976, 11.7% in 1977 and 10.1%
in 1978. Theme rates while admittedly leas satisfactory would still be
quite acceptable. With provisions for doubtful accounts and losses
being made at the rate of 2% of outstanding loans and guarantees and 5%
of outstanding equity investments (past experience suggests these rates
are quite adequate), PDGP expects to accnmulate reseves of P12.9 million
by the end of 1974, rising to f25.0 million in 1978. Projected debt service
coverage exceeds 1.1 throughout the period. This is lower than desirable and
PDCP should take any reasonable action necessary to maintain a higher ratio.
Projections of Financial Position
9.        Assets. Projected balance sheets for FY74 through FY78 are
provided in Tables 4.1 (assets) and 4.2 (liabilities) of this Annex. Totai
assets are expected to grow from P723.4 million in 1974 to P1,343.2 million
in 1978 - an annual growth rate of 16% (twice the growth rate assumed for
the last forecast). The bulk of this growth is accounted for by long-term
loans outstanding, which (net of allowances) are projected to nearly
double from P481.6 million in 1974 to P939.1 million in 1978, growing at
an annual rate of 18%. Current assets are expected to grow annually at
14% from P196.9 million in 1974 to P334.7 in 1978. This growth is mainly
attributable to a rapid rise (25% annually) in the amounts of long-term loans
falling due within one year, as a substantial part of PDCP's portfolio begins
to mature. On the other hanu. PWCP's holdings of cash and short-term
instruments are projected to grow very gradually (8% annually).
10.       Liabilities and Net Worth.  Total debt liabilities (Table 4.2)
are expected to increase from P619.2 million in 1974 to P1,163,0 million
in 1978 - or at an annual rate of 17%, with current and long-term liabili-
ties growing at 13% and 18% respectively; the proportion of the latter
increasing in the liability structure from 77% to 80%. Corresponding to
the rapid increase in the portion of long-term loans receivable within a
year, is an even nore rapid increase (27% per annum) in loans payable
within a year. The annual growth rate in long-term foreign currency
obligations (including loans and a $10 million bond issue in 1977) averages
out at 18% a year whilst that for local currency obligations (including
debenture issues of P3 million in 1974, P20 million in 1975 and 1977 and
P25 million in 1978) is a much faster 40%. Contingent liabilities out-
standing are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 20%. PDCP's
net worth is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 15% from
P104.2 million in 1974 to P180.2 million in 1978 with retained earnings
rising at 20% from P40.9 million in 1974 to P84.4 million in 1978; they
will account for 39.2% of net worth in 1974 and 46.9% in 1978. PDCP has
projected issues of 1 million shares -n 1974 and 1976 with a 15% stock



Pa-ge5
dividend in 1975. The number of shares outstanding are thus expected to
increase from  5,025,000 in 1974 to 6,778,000 in 1976 and remain at that
level till 1978. The share issues are expected to yield capital premiums
of P10 million and P15 million in 1974 and 1976 respectively.
11.       Capital Structure.  The above-mentioned share increases not-
withstanding, PDCP,s capital structure will be more heavily debt oriented
by 1978 with a long-term debt/equity ratio of 5.85. PDCP is also expected
to maintain lower levels of liquidity (the current ratio being maintained
around 1.4) in the next few years than in the past (current ratio in 1973
and 1972 was over 2.0).
