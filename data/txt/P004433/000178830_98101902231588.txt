REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK TO BE
GUARANTEED BY THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A FOURTH PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
OF THE PHILIPPINES (PDCP) CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Philippine National Bank for the equivalent of $30.0 million
with the guarantee of the Republic of the Philippines. The loan would be
at an interest rate of 8% per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be
relent to the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines at an
interest rate of 8% plus a handling fee of 0.75%, but otherwise on the
same terms as those of the Bank loan, for onlending to specific productive
enterprises. The Loan would be repaid in accordance with the composite
amortization schedule of subprojects up to 15 years, including an appro-
priate period of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 78-PH of April 20, 1973) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on May 2, 1973 (R73-85). An economic mission
visited the Philippines in April and its preliminary conclusions are in-
corporated below. The full report of the mission will be distributed to
the Executive Directors in due course. Annex I contains country data.
Recent Developments
3.        Since 1972, the Government has re-formulated its development
strategy by introducing a number of important and potentially far-reach-
ing economic and social reforms through decrees in such areas as agrarian
reform, taxation, customs administration and tariffs, banking and govern-
ment organization. These reforms provide an opportunity to improve the
performance of the Philippine economy. Aided by the recent commodity
boom in the international markets, economic activity in the Philippines
has increased considerably. The growth in real GNP, which had been about
5% a year for more than a decade, is estimated to have doubled and reached
10% in 1973. However underemployment and unemployment remain quite high,
and in common with most other countries the rate of inflation has increased
appreciably in the past year. These problems and the long-term implications
of the energy crisis for domestic production, the balance of payments, costs
and employment are now being examined by the economic mission.
4.        The strong recovery of the economy in 1973 resulted from increased
agricultural production, a recovery in the industrial sector including
manufactured exports, a boom in export incomes and an expansion in public
and private investment. The agricultural sector, which had suffered from
adverse weather conditions during the previous three years grew by 7% in



1973. Rice production in 1973-74 is estimated to have increased by 25%
over the level of the previous year when floods reduced production levels.
This increase has been mainly due to favorable weather conditions, increased
use of fertilizers, more supervised credit and increased investments in sup-
porting rural services as part of a general drive for rice self-sufficiency.
The impact of the recent floods on rice production in the present crop year
appears to be moderate, chiefly because of the short duration of the typhoon
and the quick drainage and protection provided by the rehabilitation work
undertaken after the 1972 disaster. The Government has vigorously imple-
mented a program of agrarian reform among rice and corn tenants concentrating
mainly on the larger holdings in the first phase. Titles are being trans-
ferred to tenants and supporting services improved.
5.        The increased activity in agriculture has provided the base for
renewed expansion of the industrial sector. The growth of industrial pro-
duction for exports has also been stimulated by the Government's industrial
export drive which included a range of export incentives. Nontraditional
industrial exports, which have been increasing since 1970, are estimated
to have doubled in 1973 to about $200 million. The prospects of increased
profitability are attracting a large amount of new investment into industries
such as plywood, textiles and garments, handicrafts, light consumer durables
and electronics.
6.        The growth in production was also assisted by the sharply acceler-
ated public development outlays in 1973 made possible by a significant im-
provement in the financial position of the Government. The Government has
implemented a series of long-needed tax reforms and improvements in tax ad-
mi-nistration, such as customs and tariff reform, tax amnesties, reforms in
corporate and local taxation, continuation of the export tax, and increased
taxation on luxury items and on gasoline. These reforms resulted in a 36%
increase in tax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 47% in FY74. As a
result the ratio of Central Government tax revenues to GNP has increased
from an average of 9% in recent years to an estimated 12% in FY74.
7.        High prices for the Philippines' chief exports, including coconut
products, sugar, copper and wood products, were largely responsible for an
increase in merchandise receipts of almost 70% in 1973. The merchandise
trade account recorded a surplus of about $270 million, as compared with a
$120 million deficit in the previous year. International reserves rose by
$594 million during the year and stood at $876 million, equivalent to about
five months of imports, at the end of the year, and had risen to $1.2 billion
by May, 1974.
8.        Ilowever, in the latter part of 1973 inflation emerged as a major
problem in the Philippines. Since mid-1973 consumer prices have been rising
at an annual rate of more than 40%. This has been caused by the higher rate
of world inflation, by higher export prices, by domestic food shortages, and
more recently by the increased cost of petroleum. Provided there is a good
harvest later in the year, the rate of inflation should moderate in 1975,
but it probably will take 1-2 years for the price effects of the energy
crisis to work themselves out fully. The rapid inflation has also exacer-
bated the decline in real wages which fell by a total of about 25% between
1969 and 1973. The urban wage earners have been most affected. In the past



year, agricultural incomes have improved very substantially, while, with
some exceptions, entrepreneurs have been able to pass on increased costs.
Money wages will have to be raised in the near future if further deterioration
in the living standards of wage earners is to be avoided.
The Energy Crisis
9.        Imported petroleum provides some 93% of the Philippines' total
energy requirements. In 1973 the equivalent of 71 million barrels of
petroleum crude and other petroleum products were imported at a cost of
about $230 million c.i.f. When the energy crisis developed late last year,
it looked as though economic activity in the Philippines would be severely
disrupted. There were temporary dislocations while reduced quantities of
petroleum were available, but the Government moved quickly with conservation
measures to reduce non-essential consumption. By March these problems had
been overcome and the Philippines is now obtaining sufficient petroleum for
its needs. In 1974 imports of petroleum and products are likely to be about
73 million barrels at a cost of about $820 million c.i.f.
10.       In response to the energy crisis the Government has decided to
accelerate the development of local energy sources, especially hydropower
and geothermal energy. These will be supplemented with nuclear energy
in the 1980's. The transport sector, which now accounts for 40% of total
energy consumption, is likely to continue to be the major consumer of energy.
The growth in demand for energy will therefore be influenced by policies
that affect the pattern of expansion in this sector. In any event, total
demand for energy is expected to grow at about 10 percent a year, and even
with more rapid development of natural power sources, petroleum would still
account for 85% of total energy needs by 1980. The Philippines does not
have any commercial oil fields, but the Government has recently taken steps
to encourage more exploration.
Growth Prospects
11.       Earlier this year the Government decided that, despite the energy
crisis and rapid inflation, the growth momentum built up last year should be
maintained, to provide for a continued increase in employment and to ensure
that export income expands rapidly enough to meet most of the country's for-
eign exchange needs. The labor force will continue to grow at almost 3% a
year for another decade. Providing half a million new jobs a year as well
as dealing with unemployment and underemployment will be a major task.
12.       The economy has the potential to continue growing at 7-8% a year
in real terms. Despite the big increase in the cost of petroleum and
other imports, there will be only a modest deficit in the balance of
payments this year, because of continued high prices for major export commo-
dities. Moreover, the rapid increase in export prices at a time when
external debt has not been changing, has resulted in a sharp fall in debt
service from 23% of export earnings in 1972 to an estimated 14% this year.
There has also been a substantial improvement in the climate for private
investment in the Philippines, especially in exports. There will probably



- 4 -
be a substantial increase in financing requirements, but with rising domestic
incomes and a substantially improved capacity to borrow abroad, it should be
possible to mobilize the needed resources.
13.       A substantial increase in both public and private investment to
support the growth and employment strategy is required, with priority being
given to increasing food production, to export ventures and to selective
import-replacing investments. The Government plans to spend about P 17
billion on infrastructure and other public investments during FY74-77;
about 40% of the proposed investment program would be allocated to the
transport sector, 21% to power and 13% to irrigation. This would mean
doubling the proportion of these expenditures to GNP from 1.7% in FY68-72
to about 3.5% in FY74-77. To finance this program, the ratio of taxes to
GNP would have to be increased to 15-16%, and public savings would have
to be raised from the present level of 1.7% of GNP to beyond 2% in the
next few years.   With the Government's program for further tax reforms,
there are reasonable prospects for achieving these objectives. Even so,
it would mean continued heavy reliance on public borrowing from the local
market and from abroad. Implementing this program would also call for
continued improvements in public sector management which has already been
strengthened by the Government reorganization.
Balance of Payments
14.       Because of continued high prices for major export commodities,
export receipts are expected to increase by 33% this year to $2.5 billion.
Merchandise imports are likely to increase by about 90% to $3.1 billion,
because of the increased cost of petroleum and the rapid increase in the
prices of other imports. In response to the energy crisis the Central
Bank negotiated a series of standby credits with various foreign com-
mercial banking groups earlier this year. The economic mission estimates
that the overall balance of payments will record a deficit of about $100
million this year.
15.       After allowing for continued reserve accumulation and repayment of
loans, the total foreign exchange requirements for the period 1975-79 would
be about $7 billion or more depending on the behaviour of the terms of trade.
About $2.5 billion would be provided by remittances, official grants, direct
investment, and short-term trade finance. The remaining $4.5 billion would
lhave to come from foreign borrowing. Last year the Bank estimated total
requirements for 1974-78 at about $4 billion. In June 1973 the Consultative
Group for the Philippines met anz. accepted the need for rising levels of
commitments for development projects to support the Philippines' increased
development program. The increased estimate of requirements reflects the
effects of inflation, the more optimistic outlook for growth in the Philippines,
and the improved capacity to carry foreign debt.
16.       Borrowing on this scale would not pose serious problems for
balance of payments and external debt management. At the end of 1973,
the Philippines' medium and long-term external debt stood at about
$1.9 billion, of which public debt was 44%. Because the Government
h-ias exercised strict control over the amount and type of new external



borrowings, the total amount of debt outstanding has not increased much
since 1970, and the maturity structure has improved. Moreover, the debt
service ratio is expected to remain at about 14% in 1975. With this
moderate debt burden the Philippines will be able to contract substan-
tially larger amounts of external debt which would probably lead to a
small increase in the debt service ratio, perhaps to about 14-15% by
the early 1980s. The Philippines thus remains creditworthy for substantial
Bank lending. At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is
about 9% and its share in debt service is about 5.5%. Since the Philippines
will have the capacity to service more commercial debt in future, it is
unlikely that the Bank's share in debt service will rise even with a higher
level of lending.
17.       The Philippines' development program will continue to require
resources in excess of the foreign capital which will become available
for financing the import component of development projects. Some fi-
nancing of local currency expenditures will be justified, especially
for projects of economic and social importance which need only limited
amounts of foreign exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
18.       The Philippines has received 26 Bank loans and three IDA Credits
totalling $572 million, net of cancellations. About 54% of the Bank/IDA
lending, $306 million, has been for infrastructure projects in power,
transportation, water supply and for education whilst $25 million has
been for population. The remainder has been divided about equally between
agriculture and industry. Of this $126 million has been for irrigation,
livestock, rice processing and rural credit and $115 million for industry
in three loans to the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines
and one loan to the Development Bank of the Philippines. There has been
a marked improvement in the way Bank-financed projects in the Philippines
have been executed in the last two or three years compared with experience
in the 1960's when shortages of peso counterpart funds combined with poor
administration caused serious problems. All these projects are now going
reasonably well. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of September 30, 1974 and notes on the
execution of on-going projects.
19.       The size of the Bank/IDA lending program increased substantially
in FY74 reflecting the ambitious development program of the Government and
its improved capacity to prepare and implement projects. Commitments in
FY74 amounted to $165.1 million compared to an average of about $30 million
a year in the previous five years. It is proposed that future Bank lending
continue to concentrate on public infrastructure and agriculture. We also
plan to continue financing industry and to provide more assistance for proj-
ects in the social sectors.
20.       The following projects are among those which should be ready
for Board consideration later in FY75 - Tarlac Irrigation, Rural Development



- 6 -
and Small Industry. Three projects, Population, Sixth Power and Inter-Island
Shipping have already been approved by the Board. The Tarlac Irrigation
project would help improve irrigation systems in a heavily tenanted area
of Luzon. The Rural Development project would help finance a range of rural
investments designed to promote the integrated development of the island
of Mindoro. The small industry loan would provide funds for relending to
small firms and possibly technical assistance to help strengthen the
institutions serving these firms.
21.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $69.2 million
for investments in eleven companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of September 30, 1974, $18.2 million have been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $2.1 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $48.5 million. On the
same date $13.0 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been
received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper,
dinnerware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND INDUSTRIAL FINANCE
22.       Industry (manufacturing, mining and construction) is the third
largest sector in the Philippine economy (after agriculture and services).
It accounted for 27% of net domestic product in 1973, absorbing over one-
third of total fixed investment and providing employment for 15% of the
total labor force. Since the early 1970's Governmient has placed increasing
emphasis on industrial growth to expand and diversify exports, meet growing
domestic demand, and provide increased employment opportunities.
23.       Manufacturing, which accounts for over two-thirds of all indus-
trial activity, is predominantly privately owned, and generally concentrated
in large scale, vertically integrated, capital-intensive units. In 1971,
organized manufacturing enterprises with fewer than 20 employees accounted
for 85% of the number of enterprises but for less than 17% of industrial
employment, 4.7% of value added and 5.5% of total assets of manufacturing
enterprises. By sectors, food and beverages are the largest group, with
chemicals and petrochemicals second and textiles ranking third.    Geograph-
ically, over 65% of manufacturing enterprises are concentrated in the
greater Manila and southern Luzon area, although more recently increasing
industrialization has been taking place in northern Mindanao and the Visayas.
24.       Philippine industrial production has up to now been geared pri-
marily toward meeting the needs of the domestic consumer market. Reliance
on the industrial sector as a major vehicle for enhancing export earnings
is a relatively recent development signalled by the introduction of the
Export Incentives Act in 1970 and by other policy measures such as the
floating of the peso resulting in a sizable devaluation which made
Philippine industrial exports much more competitive in international
markets. The rapid increase in industrial exports in the last two years



- 7 -
reflects both the success of these measures and favorable changes in world
market demand for Philippine products. The encouraging performance so far
has led the Government into establishing a special duty-exempt Export Pro-
cessing Zone at Mariveles to attract foreign and domestic investment into
manufacturing for export.
25.       Both the Export Incentives Act and the earlier Investment
Incentives Act of 1967, which reformed the previous cumbersome structure
of incentives, are administered by the Board of Investments (BOI) - the
principal industrial regulatory agency. Its main functions are to: (a)
issue an annual Investment Priorities Plan (IPP) - the current IPP is the
sixth - listing those industries or product lines which qualify for incen-
tives; (b) determine the additional capacity required in these industries
to meet domestic demand and/or take advantage of export possibilities; and
(c) approve individual projects in line with the annual IPP. The BOI also
draws up a list of "overcrowded industries" in whlich further investments
are discouraged by denying access to incentives and foreign exchange for
imports. In addition to its regulatory functions, BOI is an active promo-
tional agency, wlhich undertakes specific industry and market studies, and
publishes information useful to industrialists. About one-half of new
industrial investment in the Philippines goes into BOI-registered projects.
Between June 1968 and June, 1973, BOI approved 250 projects requiring a
total investment of ? 7.2 billion. While BOI is primarily responsible for
regulating investment, industrial policy formulation is the responsibility
of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). A newly estab-
lished Department of Energy and Industry (DEI) is beginning to play a
prominent role in coordinating industrial policy formulation and implementation,
covering whatever gaps exist under the present institutional arrangements.
26.       The Four-Year Development Plan for FY74-77 estimates total indus-
trial investment in the period to be in excess of $3 billion. Investment
in manufacturing is expected to account for about two-thirds of the total.
This level of investment will require a large increase in domestic resource
mobilization, as well as a sustained inflow of foreign capital on reasonable
terms. The climate for private investment in the Philippines is also much
improved, especially in production for exports. This improvement stems
from the strong performance of the economy in 1973, the current higher
prices for many export commodities, and the efforts of Government to
attract more foreign investment. A number of big projects are proposed
in mining, wood processing, fertilizer, steel, aluminum and other indus-
tries which seem likely to push up the private investment rate from recent
levels of about 16% of GNP to perhaps 22% by the latter part of the decade.
The total investment cost for these major projects is expected to exceed
$4 billion during 1975-80, with the individual cost of many of them exceed-
ing $100 million. The Government will need to find suitable financial back-
ing for these projects within the international financial community, since
a large portion of the required funds will have to come from abroad. Even
so, the supply of long-term funds from domestic sources will need to in-
crease substantially.



- 8 -
27.       Two institutions, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP),
the government's principal development financing institution, and the
Private Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP), are the main
providers of long-term industrial finance. Besides DBP and PDCP, several
commercial banking and other financial institutions also provide term
finance to industry, covering less than 5% of total needs. Working
capital needs are covered mainly by commercial banks, which in 1973
provided $3.1 billion in domestic credit, half of which went to the
manufacturing sector. The remaining gaps in financing are covered by
internally-generated funds and by equity financing through the capital
market.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
'8.       The proposed loan is the sixth in a series of Bank Group loans
for financing industrial investment in the Philippines. The most recent
of these was a $50.0 million Bank loan to the Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP) approved in June 1974. The proposed project was
appraised in May 1974 and negotiations were held in September 1974.
The leader of the Philippine negotiating team was Ambassador Eduardo Z.
Romualdez. The Appraisal Report (No. 514a-PH) on the project is being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Annex III provides
a loan and project summary.
29.       PDCP was established as a privately-owned corporation in 1963
with Bank Group assistance, and has since been the beneficiary under three
Bank loans and an IFC loan totalling $80 million. It has also received
three loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) totalling $45 million.
Its authorized capital stock stands at P 100 million, of which P 40.25 mil-
lion has been paid in. PDCP hopes to double its number of stockholders,
from the present 1,100, with a stock issue planned for late 1974. As of
March 31, 1974 PDCP's net worth was P 77.9 million ($11.5 million).
30.       Set up to assist the development of private enterprise in the
Philippines, PDCP is the principal privately owned institution providing
long-term industrial finance. Since its inception, it has approved finan-
cial assistance totalling P 946 million ($140 million) to the industrial,
agro-industrial and transportation sectors, of which more than 75% was
through direct lending. Foreigio -lrrency loans account for over 80% of
its total lending. Apart from lending, PDCP also undertakes underwriting
and syndication operations, equity and guarantee operations, and plays an
active role in the well-developed Philippine money market.
31.       PDCP remains an efficient and well-managed institution, with a
staff of good calibre at all levels. Its operating policies and procedures,
including in particular its project appraisal and supervision work, are of
a high standard. As an institution, PDCP has generally exhibited an inno-
vative approach to development banking.



- 9 -
32.       The high standards of PDCP's project evaluation and follow-up
work are reflected in the quality of its portfolio. The small number
of accounts in arrears are supervised closely and timely action taken.
Provisions for doubtful accounts are adequate. To date, no loans have
been written off. PDCP's financial position is sound, and its earnings
performance satisfactory. Its total assets as of March 31, 1974 stood at
i 706 million ($105 million). The capital structure remains sound with
PDCP keeping well within the contractual debt/equity limit of 6.5:1 agreed
upon at the time of the third loan to PDCP. In 1973, net earnings repre-
sented 17.7% of average net worth.
33.       Demand for funds for industrial investment is expected to
increase considerably in the foreseeable future. PDCP expects, on
the basis of recent approvals and its substantial project pipeline,
to approve during the next two years (1975 and 1976) about P 500 mil-
lion ($75 million) of loans, 85% of which will be in foreign currency;
and including guarantees, equity investment and other capital market
operations, to provide in excess of $100 million equivalent to industry.
Given expected demand and the present pattern of increases in the cost
of imported capital goods PDCP's expectations appear reasonable - PDCP
proposes to meet its domestic resource requirements through loan collec-
tions and new share issues supplemented by the issue of medium-term notes.
PDCP expects to have fully committed its present foreign currency resources
by December 1974 and is looking for support from the Bank, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and the Export-Import Bank of Japan to assist with
foreign currency loans. The proposed loan would cover about 40% of PDCP's
estimated foreign resource requirements for the next two years.
34.       The proposed loan of $30 million would provide foreign exchange
to finance direct imports for sub-projects in the industrial, agro-indus-
trial, mining, tourism and transport sectors, with the bulk of the loan
amount expected to go to export-oriented manufacturing projects.
35.       As with the previous three Bank loans the proposed loan would be
made to the Philippine National Bank (PNB), which would relend the proceeds
to PDCP under a subsidiary loan agreement. This arrangement arose
because until last month under Philippine law the Government
could only guarantee the obligations of publicly-owned institutions. PNB
will charge PDCP a handling fee of 0.75% of the outstanding loan amount
per annum. This would give PDCP a spread of 3.25% since the relending rate
charged by PDCP to sub-borrowers is expected to be 12% per annum, the
present legal maximum rate for secured loans in the Philippines. If
interest rate ceilings are raised for medium and long-term loans, PDCP
would consult the Bank about raising the relending rate to sub-borrowers
and if this was done, the Government would collect a fee from PDCP designed
to limit PDCP's spread to 3.5%, which appears reasonable (see Project
Agreement Section    3.07; Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.04).   Sub-borrowers
would assume the foreign exchange risk. The Government may offer PDCP
insurance to cover the exchange risk between the currency of the country
where the goods are procured and the currency owed to the Bank. If such
insurance is offered, sub-borrowers will be offered the option of taking



- 10 -
loans bearing only the risk of the currency of the country where the gooids
are procured but at an increased cost which will reflect the cost of this
insurance (See Guarantee Agreement Section 3.03; Project Agreement, Section
2.04 (c)). The proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule
substantially reflecting the aggregate of the repayment schedules of sub-loans.
The free limit would be $1.5 million, instead of $500,000 under the previous
Bank loan made in 1969. In order to ensure that the proceeds of the loan
are shared amongst a reasonably large number of sub-borrowers, the maximum
size of sub-loans would be $2.5 million. The other terms and conditions
of the proposed loan would be similar to those of recent Bank loans to
development finance companies.
36.       PDCP-financed projects are estimated to have generated a total
investment of about $390 million, about 30,000 jobs at an investment cost
of roughly $12,750 per worker, and earned or saved foreign exchange equiv-
alent to about $280 million annually. PDCP has supported the Government's
efforts to develop industry outside the Greater Manila Area, and has estab-
lished regional offices in Cebu and Davao. More recently, PDCP has also
been giving particular attention to assisting small-scale enterprises.
Since 1972 it has been manning a special lending program for small-scale
industries. It is also promoting the establishment of industrial estates
for small enterprises, and will soon invest in small private development
banks which are geared to meeting the financial needs of local communi-
ties. PDCP's importance as a development-oriented institution is reinforced

C.   Projects in Execution -
Ln. No. 637-PH       Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan of August 18, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly 77,C'00 hectares. The proj-
ect's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irriga-
tion development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the 1972
floods, the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule.
All work is expected to be completed and the loan fully disbursed by June 30,
1976, the original completion date. Project costs have increased 34 percent
over appraisal estimates largely due to inflation, devaluation of the peso
and design changes in the dam. However, as a result of close coordination
established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services, the
project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion
of construction instead of 13 years estimated dluring appraisal. The project
remains economically viable.
Ln. No. 720-PH       Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and mod-
ernization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the project
was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis was on
the construction of new integrated rice mills with large capacities. Due
in part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills,
the demand for sub-loans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be small,
and, on the basis of the President's Memorandum dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40)
the loan agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to rehabilita-
tion of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the project made
little progress. The loan agreement was amended again in April, 1974 basically
to (i) expand the scope of the project to include corn in addition to rice,
(ii) enable local governments and the National Grains Authority to borrow
funds under the project, and (iii) streamline procurement procedures (Pres-
ident's memorandum Sec. M74-244 of April 15, 1974). As a result of these
amendments, the project is now progressing satisfactorily and the loan is
expected to be fully disbursed by the Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 731-PH      Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Closing Date: May 15, 1975
The project for the construction and improvement of the Cotabato-
Digos road (160 km) in Mindanao is now behind schedule, because of civil
disturbances in the Cotabato area, exceptional rains and rapidly escalating
prices. Completion is now expected in the last quarter of 1975 compared to
June 1974 expected during appraisal. However, all principal problems have
been identified and work on resolving them is progressing satisfactorily.
The project also includes two components financed by UNDP: technical
assistance to the Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) for operational improvements
and feasibility studies for future highway projects. Work on the technical
assistance component is progressing well and the feasibility studies have
been completed.
Ln. No. 809-PH and Fifth Power; US$22.0 million and US$10.0 million Loan
Cr. No. 296-PH      and Credit of April 3, 1972; Closing Date:    June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. The project is behind schedule because
procurement has taken longer than expected. The Closing Date has been
postponed from June 30, 1976 to June 30, 1978 to allow time for delayed
procurement and because retention monies will not be paid to the major equip-
ment supplier until at least one year after the plant is commissioned. NPC's
financial situation has been improved by the imposition in July 1973 of a
surcharge to cover increased fuel costs. A further tariff increase was
approved, effective July 1, 1974 and this should enable UPC to achieve its
covenanted rate of return in FY 74/75.
Ln. No. 823-PH       Livestock; US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the
Philippines. The project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 349-PH       Second Education; US$12.7 million; Credit of
January 5, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project will assist Government to improve such areas as educa-
tion, planning, management and curriculum development, science teacher train-
ing, and training of technicians, skilled craftsmen and farmers. Although
no disbursements have been made, the project is progressing on schedule.

Ln. No. 891-PH      Fisheries; US$11.6 million Loan of May 21, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the private
sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine and inland
fisheries development. The loan became effective on December 5, 1973.
The demand for loans appears adequate and the organization to implement them
has been properly established. The project is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 939-PH      Second Ports; US$6.1 million Loan of October 24, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
ports of General Santos and Cagayan de Oro in the Island of Mindanao.   Detailed
designs for both ports are llow complete and contract documents have been issued.
The project is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 950-PH      Second Highway; US$68.0 million Loan of December 12, 1973;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1977
The project is helping the Government to implement its program of
construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder roads.
Work has begun on twelve of the fourteen contracts. In line with world-wide
inflation, costs have increased sharply and the estimated completion cost
has risen by 60%, reflecting the increased cost of fuel and basic construction
materials. Several proposals to assist offsetting some of the additional
cost are under consideration. The INDP financed Road Feasibility Studies
(Phase II), for which the Bank is Executing Agency, are progressing satis-
factorily and a possible Third Highway project has already been identified.
Execution of other minor project items is proceedirg generally on schedule.
Cr. No. 472-PH      Irrigation; US$9.5 million; Credit of May 14, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30   1979
Ln. No. 984-PH      Irrigation; US$9.5 million; Loan of May 14, 1974;
