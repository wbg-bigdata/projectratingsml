MEIMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESEDENT
OF THE iNTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMEN ASSOCIATION
TO TER EXECUIV   DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CRDIT
TO ALBANIA
FOR A HOUSING PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendaton a
proposed credit to Albani for SDR 10.6 (US$15 milion equivalent), to help finance a
housing project. The credit would be at sandard IlDA terms, with a matrity of forty year,
including ten years of grace.
2.   ITe Economy: Over four decades, until the collapse of the old regime, Albania
centrlized all economic activity and isolaed itself to an ext undented in the socialist
world. Igoring economic incentives, comparative advantage and financiai constraints,
eventually led the economy to a fial coLapse under the weight of a ignificant foeig debt,
severe price distortions and an arhaic strucur of production. As a result, Albania is today
the poorest country in Europe. The 1992 gross domestic product per capita of its 3.3 million
population was estimated to be less than US$250 (Atlas methodology). Howeve, Albania is
now a full-fledged nmeber of the inteatonalcommunity. Wrth social stability broadly
regined and the basic insttutonal settng in psace, the Government decided to apply shock
theapy, supported by a US$27.0 million IAM  Standby Arrangement which was approved on
August 26, 1992.
3.   The Dramatic Changes Implemented during the first eight months of the reform
program have visbly taken root, most notably in the areas of price refrm, the exhange and
tade  tem, the budget, central banking, and  clture. Industial output ap     to have
bottomed out, agricultumal production, following an early land reform, has rebounded and
the   e strong signs of incrased pnvate sector actvity, although formal sscd  data are
not available. Inflation has fallen from 14 percent a month at the begnning 1992 to less than
1 pecent in March 1993, and keeps falling. The bankig system has stopped giving credit to
non-viable public entepises and about 40 percent of the state enterprise workforce has been
laid off. Official foreign exchange reserves have increased from virally zero to about three
weeks of imports. The Lek (the domestic currency) apecated by about 30 percent at the
start of the program and has remained fairly stable since then in the fredy floating exchange
market. Equally important, the social consensus appears to have held despite a rie in
unemployment to about 26 percent of the workforce and a fall in real wages of more than 30
percent The Government has negod    a Policy Framework Paper with the EIF and the
World Bank that will constitute the bads of access to the IMF's Enhanced Structul
Adjument Facility in mid-1993. The PFP has been circulated to the Board and onains
comehensve information on Albania's economy and growth prospects.



-2-
4.   The Economnc and Social Situation remains difficult. The fiscal consoHdation
achieved In 1992 relied on cuts in investment expenditure to about 3 percent of GDP in the
second half of that year, which is clearly not consistent with Albania's long-tmn
requirements. There are also risks to the maco economic outlook. Social safety net
expenditures could be higher than foreseen should unemployment incre  faster than
expected. Many state enteises are in aears to the budget, which casts a doubt on the
prospect for increased fiscal revenues from the enterprise sector. In addition, the drastic
reduction in bank credit and in budgetary transfers to state enterpises has resulted in a
growth of inter-enterprise aras. Finally, the practical implementation of reform meamres
is an enduring problem in view of Albania's limited institutional capacity and lack of
familarity with market economics. However, the Government has no real alternative, and
has affirmed its commitment to the program at all levels.
5.   AssocIatin Strategy: The early success of the stabilization effort is not sustainable
over the long run in the absence of growth. Albania has significant mineir rsources, water
reserves, prospects for the development el tourism, and above aU a strong agrcultu
potential. However, sustained investment in public inf  is required to retore
public services to a level consistent with the requirements of a market economy for this
growth potential to materalize. At the same time, after two years of precipitous fall in
output, there remains much productive potential that can be better utilized, paticularly in the
ste enterprise sector. Therefore, the Association's lending stegy consists of the
rehabilitation of the inftastucture and sector improvements under the proposed Housing
project, as well as through projects in trasport, water supply and the social sectors, and the
promotion of a supply response through the Agricultural Setool Adjustment Credit to be
followed by an Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Credit.
6.   Albania has attacted strong support from foregn donors, with aid commitens for
1993 amounting to US$420 million. In this contex, the comparative advantage of the
Association is its erse in project praradon, rather than the scale of its intervention.
Therefo  the strategy consist in Wing projects as vehicles for aid coordinaon and as a
catalyst for the mobilization of funding. Coordination with other donors has ben excelnt,
both formally during aid meetings organized by the ECIG24 and informally among staff
working on Albania. USAID is expected to finance the technical assistance under the
housing project.
7.    iouing Conditions: With an average 7.5 square meter per capita and poor
sanitation levels, housing conditions in Albania compare unfavorably w   those of Romania
and Bulgaria and lag far behind those of Poland and Hungary. The average urban flt
consists of only 30 square meters of usefid space and it is not unusual tat four to six people
of multiple geneaons might be crowded in two or three rooms. Less tan one third of the
city dwellings are less tan twenty yean old. One unit out of three has no piped water
connection and barely half of the flats have an internal W.C. with flush-discharge. Despite
the harsh winters, cental heating is virtually unknown and homes are warmed up only
intrmittenty with wood or coal stoves. Poor insation, lack of fnifshes, shoddy



-3-
workmanship and a total neglect of maintenance rault in substandard conditions and rapid
obsoesnce.
8.   Traditional Housing Supply: For over four decades, th GOA has devoted about
1.3% of GDP to subsidize the supply of rental housing in the cities, which acounted for
over 4% of gross fixed capit4 fomation. Retuns on such investments were nil, because the
rents being charged (typically 2 to 3% of the tenant household's income) did not even cover
the operatng costs of the distrct agencies responsible for the admiistration and maintenance
of the housing stock. Providing a home to at least some of the workers in the waiting lists
was viewed as a 'social' commitment warranted by the genealized low-wage policy. Today,
an estimated 13,300 units which were under construction in urban areas have come to a
standstill beause of lack of funds. Half of these unfinished units are located in the six
largest cities, and show various degrees of completion (the average is 54%). Govenment
emates indicate that about US$64 million would be needed to complete aU units.
9.   Recent Government Initi-tives: The current Govemrnent has undertaken three
important steps to reform the housing sector. (i) it has undertaken the privatzaton of the
public housing stock, (ii) it has adopted a Law on Condominium Property; and (iii) it has
created a National Housing Agc:..:y (NHA).
10.  The Housing PrivatzaZion Act, allows the transfer of ownership of about 200,000
urban flats from the State to sitting tenants in exchange for a minimal payment or even fee
of charge (n the case of small-size flats built before certain dates). This law has been
approved by the Parliament. The Act r,i Condomlnuml Property has also been approved
recently. Despite mior shortcomings which need to be worked out in theimplementing
eulations, these two acts represent bold steps towards starting off a re  estae markeL
11.  The National Housing Agency wiU be financed through the proceeds of the
pivatzation process, some domestic credit, external borwing and the retuns of its own
opertions. This agency would be responsible for the completion and sale of the unfinished
strucur  and the built up stes on behalf of the State. The NHA has the stu of a semi-
autonomous enterprse with a mnaging board in which three Ministies and two national
credit institutions are represented.
12. Rationale for IDA Involvement: In the short term, the resumption of housing
construction activities could provide jobs and additional dwellings, especially in the cities; In
the medium term, the process of privaizadon and the reduction of the current, dee
distortions of the sector (ngid rent control and excessive fiscal subsidies) would motivate
households to mobilize savings for new investments. Therefore, the focus of IDA's
assistance would be to support the Government policies of stabiizaton and stcturl change,
to forestall furter declines in houing producton and employment and to sdmuat the birth
of a housing market. The key areas of reform include: on the fiscal dde, a reducdon of
subsidies by adopting cost recovery on new housing investments; on the finanlal side, the
introduction of affordable repayment schemes, which can preserve the real value of the



-4-
Housing Agency's portfolio; on the real side, the intrduction of competitive prcedue for
ontact award and appropriate norms for the development and use of ubgan land,
infrastucture and buildings.
13.  IPraect Objectives: IDA asslsta.ce would aim at starting off a market-based housing
system. This involves: (i) completing and putting on the market a substantial sware of the
unfiished rental housing; (ii) establishing the National Housing Agency as an effective agent
of change duilng the transition period; and (iii) broadening the role of private sector
operators in housing supply (investors, brokers, bankrs, contractors and suppliers).
14.  Prect Desciption: The project would include the following components:
a) Completion of Unf;nished Housing: The whole amount of the IDA credit
($15 million) would be used for completion of public housing projects in which
construction was interrupted for lack of funds. IDA financing would be limited
to building3 in which the dwelling units: i) are not occupi; ii) clear tide can
be conveyed to purchasers; and iu) can be sold to individual households under
cond.4ninium arangements immediately after completion.
b)   Technical Assistae: Grant funds of the order of US$1.5 million are
expected mainly from the USAID to finance consultants, stdies, and training
progrms on new procedures for the NHA and MOC. Technical assisnce is
necessary to help MOC estabhsh a policy framework for sector refom, rc'iove
regulatory constaints and develop new instruments and insfitutions.
Institubonal development of the new National Housing Agency calls for hands-
on advice on a variety of opeaonal matters: the procedures for costing land
and new construction, the preparation and apprasal of projets, the tendering
and review of proposals for constction, organizing condomina, writing
contracts, defining sale terms for the new units, invoicing and collecting
payments, improving banlkng and accounting techniques.
15.  PIroject Ipl ion Arrngemenits: (i) The Mkistry of Construction,
Housn and Territorial Plannig (OC), acting on behalf of the Borrower, would enter
into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with NHA, defining the terms under which the proceeds
of the IDA credit would be passed on to NHA and settng forth reportng and other
requirements with respect to the ulization of the proceeds. As the public authority under
which the National Housing Agency opates, MOC would supervise the fulfillment of the
objectives of the Project by NHA and establis the main principles for its opeation. MOC
would also carry out a program of technical assistance focusing on housing reforms with the
help of forgn experts. (ii) The project's Implementatio  gency would be the NHA
which would receive funds from various sources, keep its own budget, service its debt, meet
the cost of operations out of its revenues, select and apprise subprojects for compleion of
unfinished public housing, procuring contctors to complete the constuction and ornizing



-5-
the sale of the completed buildings to private households under condominum arngements.
16.  Actions ageed:
at negotbtions, the following agreements were confirmed:
a) eligibility criteria for the subprojects to be completed by NRA with InDA fiuns;
b) a pricing policy adequate to recover the real costs of incremental investments in
the program;
c) the adoption of regulatory guidelines by MOC to facilitate the fomation of
condominia;
d) the introduction of competitive procedures for contacting works including
definiton of an acceptable ceiling for local shopping;
e)  an investment program acceptable to IDA including a preliminary definiton of
contract packages; and
t) a comprehensive technical assistance program for institutional development
including NHA and the MOC.
as effectiveness condiions:
g)  the adoption of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and
NrA; and
h) the adopon by the NHA of an Opeonal Manual sadsctry to IDA, whih
sall set forth the procedures for selection, appraisal, execution and sale of the
subprojects, and other essential operational policies.
17.  Envronmental Inpact: No adverse environmental Impact is expected from the
prposed opation. This project has been classified in environmental screeanng category C,
consistent with  IDA policies and procedures.
18.  Project Benefits: By keeping sufficient cash flow in the system, the IlDA credit
would accdele  recovery and progressive rructuing of the housing sector. A pzincipal
benefit of the project would be the improved uilizaon of the housing stock following
privatiztion. If privaization is successful, a real estate market would develop, especially
since rents are liberalized on the privatized units. This should facilitate some degree of
housetading, removing one hindrance to the mobility of labor. Moreover, the emergence
of a housing market should help mobilize household savings, encourage private investment
and provide additional employment in costruction.
19.  Risks: Te proposed project repesents an ambitious first step towards liberaization
of the housing sector. One critical factor could be the speed at which the government, the
parliament, the investors and the general public will be able to endorse new policies,
instruments and procedures and live with them. Also essential for a housing markt to
develop is some degree of mac-economic stability and real income growth. A rtional



balance must be struck between the desire of decent  and the need of central
guidance. By the same token, any centl goveent subsidy which may be required to
make the purchase of a home affordable needs to be made explicit, controllable and
equitable. Continuity of political consensus on all these points may be necessary to ensure
the success of the project.
Recommendation: I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreetnent of the Association and recommend that the Executive Diretors apprve it.
