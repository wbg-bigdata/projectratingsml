PUNJAB WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
CHAPTER I
THE PUNJAB WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Previous Bank Group Lending
1.01      IDA has extended two credits to the Government of India (GOI) in
the water supply and sewerage sector i.e.: a credit of US$55 million made
in 1973 for the Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project; and a credit of
US$40 million made in 1975 for the Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage
Project.
Background Data
1.02      The State of Punjab is located in the northwestern part of India2
bordering Pakistan (Map IBRD 13355). It covers an area of about 50,400 km
or 1.6% of the area of India and contains 13.6 million people (1971), of which
approximately 76% live in rural areas (12,188 villages) and 24% in urban
areas (108 townshiys). The population density (urban and rural) averages
270 persons per km ; the national average is about 200.
1.03      Punjab is located between 180 and 320 meters above sea level.
The temperature varies between +45 C (May and June) and +6 C  (January and
February). The annual rainfall ranges from 250 to more than 1,000 milli-
meters, which mainly falls during the monsoon season, July to September.
1.04      There are three major perennial rivers in the state, the Beas,
Sutlej and Ghaggar, and a well developed network of irrigation canals. The
groundwater table is high and groundwater, which is abundant, is also the
main source for domestic water supply. The incidence of water related
diseases such as dysentery (4.2 per thousand) and infectious hepatitis (0.03
per thousand) is lower in Punjab than the corresponding average figures for
India, 7.0 and 0.2 respectively. In four districts of the state, however,
the incidence of dental and skeletal fluorosis is severe because of the use
of ground water with a high fluoride content.
1.05      The economy of the state is based primarily on agriculture, from
which about 52% of its total income is derived. Of the total area, 82% is
under cultivation, the highest proportion of any state in India; the national
average is 43%.  Industrial development is advanced with about 40,000



registered small industrial units, which, in proportion to population, is also
the highest in India. The per capita state domestic product is considerably
higher in Punjab than in other states of India.
Service Levels
1.06      Punjab has in recent years been relatively successful in the de-
velopment of piped water supply for urban areas. Urban population served
increased from 21% (13% connections, 8% standposts) in 1971 to 44% (32%
connections and 12% standposts) in 1976, covering 59 out of 108 townships,
although only partially. People without any access to piped water supply rely
mainly on shallow wells, which at least in smaller population centres, are
reasonably well protected. Industries are either connected to the public
systems or have their own water supply.
1.07      The water supply is, however, in most cases intermittent, the pres-
sure is low, and the water is unevenly distributed. The operation of the
systems is unsatisfactory and there is little control on water produced and
actually used.
1.08      The development of rural water supply schemes has concentrated on
water scarcity areas or areas with groundwater containing excessive fluoride.
There are about 4.6 million people living in about 3,700 such villages. Out
of these about 1,700 have been provided with standpost water supplies covering
a population of around 1.6 million.
1.09      Sewerage systems have been extended to 46 urban areas with a cover-
age of 7% of the total urban population in 1976 compared to 3% in 1971. Pop-
ulation with access to sewerage systems is, however, larger, and even in
areas where sewers have been in existence for some years the connection rate
is only about 35%, mainly because of high connection costs.
1.10      The bulk of the urban population uses the conservancy (night soil
container) system or defecates in open drains or in the fields. Sanitary
conditions particularly in industrialized and congested urban areas are severe
and are steadily deteriorating with sewage flowing in open drains or stagnat-
ing in ponds. The maintenance of the sewerage systems is unsatisfactory;
silting of the sewers, because of low connection rates and consequently low
flows, constitutes a major problem. In rural areas, sanitation is of a very
low standard.
Sector Development and Objectives
1.11      The budget allocations for construction of water supply and sewer-
age works have always been less than the amount needed. The investments in
sewerage works, which have about equaled those for water supply (para 1.15),
have not been entirely utilized because of uneven extension of trunk mains
and laterals and low connection rates. Charges for water supply and sewerage
services have not been sufficient to cover actual costs. The rapid indus-
trialization and urbanization of the major towns, accelerated by the inflow
of refugees from Pakistan, have, inter alia, highlighted the need for
significant improvements of water supply and sewerage services.



1.12      Increasing sector investments are anticipated and the sector
organizations would be developed accordingly. The State Government of Punjab
(GOP) has consequently formulated the following objectives: (i) to develop
an institutional framework responsive to the needs of the sector; (ii) to
make the sector financially self-sufficient to the extent possible by the
introduction of -propriate tariff structures and levels; (iii) to improve
operation and maintenance and to uprate existing water supply and sewerage
systems for their optimal utilization; and (iv) to extend the services where
they are most urgently required.
1.13      GOP has established as main criteria for immediate sector invest-
ments (i) for urban areas, to concentrate on the extension of sewerage systems
and to extend water supply to congested areas or where the groundwater contains
excessive fluoride and (ii) for rural areas, to extend water supply to villages
classified as "scarcity and hardship areas".
Sector Investment Program
1.14      Past and projected investments for urban areas through FY1981-82
are shown in Annex 1, table Tl. Total sector investments in current values
have increased almost 7 times from the period 1970/74 to 1975/79 (from Rs 4.6
crores 1/ to Rs 31.3 crores). Investments for the years 1979/1982 (the
project period) are forecast to be about Rs 90 crores.
1.15      The budget for capital works for FY1977-78 was Rs 9.6 crores and
annual capital investments in the sector are projected to increase to Rs 27
crores by FY1982. Past investments have been about equally divided between
water supply and sewerage but in the coming years the main emphasis would be
on sewerage.
1.16      The sector investments have been financed by about 45% equity con-
tributions from Municipal Corporations/Committees (MCs) and 55% loans and
grants from the Central and State Governments. Operation and maintenance
expenditures have been financed from revenues and supplemented by municipal
taxation as necessary.
1.17      The projected sector investments through FY1981-82 are assumed to
be financed by loans from the Central and State Governments (including the
proposed IDA credit) and from local financial institutions and by continued
MCs contributions. Tariffs will be restructured and increased so that the
cash generation from the water supply and sewerage services is adequate
to cover part of future capital expenditures after meeting operating costs.
1.18      Past annual investments in rural water supplies increased from
about Rs 2.2 crores (for the period 1970/74) to about Rs 4 crores (for 1975/76).
The FY1977-78 budget provided about Rs 8 crores and future annual investments
are forecast to increase to about Rs 16 crores by FY1979-80.
1/   1 crore = 10 million

Sector Organization
1.19      The Public Health Branch of the Punjab Public Works Department
(PWD) was, up to 1976, primarily responsible for the planning and execution
of urban and rural water supply and sewerage systems. The PWD operated and
maintained rural water works on behalf of the Panchayats (village councils),
while the urban systems generally were operated by the MCs.
1.20      With the establishment of the Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage
Board (WSSB) in November 1976, the responsibilities of the Public Health
Branch were reallocated.
1.21      WSSB is responsible for planning, design and execution of water
supply and sewerage works in urban areas with minor exceptions (para 1.24).
It is administratively controlled by the Department of Local Government and
its functions and duties are defined in the Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage
Act 1976.
1.22      The Ministry of Public Works is organized into three departments
for Public Health, Bridges and Roads and Irrigation. The Secretary for Public
Health has administrative control over the Public Health Department, Rural
Water Supply Wing, (PHDRW); the Public Health Department, Government Works
(PHDGW); and the Punjab State Board for the Prevention and Control of Water
Pollution.
1.23      PHDRW is in charge of all activities related to rural water
supply such as planning, design, construction and system operation. Funds
for capital investments are allocated by the Ministry of Health and funds
for operation and maintenance by the Panchayat Department (in charge of rural
areas).
1.24      PHDGW is, on behalf of the Local Government Department, inter
alia, responsible for the development of industrial and urban estates and
housing colonies, which includes implementation and frequently also oper-
ation of related water supply and sewerage systems.
1.25      Agencies also involved in the water supply and sewerage sector are:
State Irrigation Department responsible for allocation of surface water;
Water Resources Directorate and the regional office of the Central Ground
Water Board which regulates and provides advisory services on groundwater
development; and the Board for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution
(established in 1975) which regulates waste water disposal.
Analysis of the Sector Organization
1.26      The responsibilities of the water supply and sewerage sector (urban
and rural areas) are broadly divided between WSSB, PHDRW, PHDGW, and MCs.
When WSSB was established in 1976, primarily as a project implementation
agency, no analysis was made of suitable institutional arrangements for
operation and maintenance of the facilities and existing arrangements were
continued.



5
1.27      Under present arrangements in urban areas the city engineer (nor-
mally on deputation to the MC from PWD) is in charge of public works includ-
ing the operation and maintenance of the water supply and sewerage systems.
Revenue collection and accounts for water supply and sewerage are normally
maintained in common with other municipal activities. Operation and main-
tenance of the systems are generally unsatisfactory because of orginizational
and financial constraints and lack of qualified staff. Operation and main-
tenance could be expected to improve by the transfer of this responsibility
to WSSB or by the establishment of separate water supply and sewerage depart-
ments within respective local administrations with full responsibility for
this function.
1.28      Following a sector study by the World Bank/WHO Cooperative Program
(IBRD/WHO CP) at the time of preappraisal, various organizational alternatives
were discussed with GOP such as (i) merging water supply and sewerage for
both urban and rural areas under one entity with full responsibility includ-
ing operation; (ii) establishing a separate Board for rural water supply; and
(iii) establishment of municipal enterprises for operation and maintenance.
GOP decided to create separate water supply and sewerage departments in the
MCs for operations and maintenance starting with the eight project towns
(para 1.35) whilst WSSB would carry out all construction work for the MCs and
would act as a lending agency for this purpose. WSSB would, however, be given
the function of assisting the MCs in related institutional and operational
matters. GOP also decided to retain the present rural water supply institu-
tional framework since WSSB is still in its formative stage and could not at
present take over the added responsibility for rural water supplies. However,
GOP proposes to review the position further once WSSB is adequately
strengthened and is well established.
1.29      PHDGW would still have some responsibilities in urban areas (para
1.24) giving rise to some overlap with WSSB but further organizational changes
are not practicable at the present stage. WSSB should, however, be given the
power to review works carried out by PHDGW and at negotiations assurances
were obtained from GOP to this effect.
1.30      The Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Act 1976 covers project imple-
mentation only, while the Punjab Municipal Act 1911, and the Punjab Municipal
Corporation Act 1976 provide for operation and maintenance of the systems by
the MCs. GOP has already amended this Act through a temporary ordinance to
enable the transfer of these functions to WSSB in case of default or misman-
agement and to empower WSSB to act as a lending agency. The formulation of
these arrangements through appropriate action would be a condition for credit
effectiveness.
1.31      The municipal water supply and sewerage departments would be estab-
lished under the following conditions: (i) appointment of a separate advisory
committee with the authority to recommend policy relating to water supply and
sewerage services; (ii) the department head reporting directly to the muni-
cipal chief executive; (iii) the maintenance of a commercial accounting system
separated from that of other municipal activities with a separate budget and
bank account; (iv) retention of funds generated from water supply and sewerage



operations for use in this sector (para 5.06); (v) compliance with agreed
technical and financial performance indicators (para 4.18); and (vi) appoint-
ment of staff members with appropriate qualifications. Municipal resolutions
have been passed in the eight project towns for the establishment of water
supply and sewerage departments. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that such departments would be functioning in accordance with the above con-
ditions by not later than March 31, 1979.
1.32      The pattern proposed for the eight project towns is expected to be
extended to other urban areas.
1.33      WSSB will function as a financing agency and an agreement will
be entered into between WSSB and each MC to stipulate on-lending terms and
conditions and also regulate managerial and operational matters.
The Project Area in Relation to the Sector in Punjab State
1.34      GOP has approached IDA and the Life Insurance Corporation of India
(LIC) for financial assistance for urban water supply and sewerage works. GOP
intends, however, to continue to finance the implementation of rural water
supply systems by regular budget allocations, which will be done entirely on
a grant basis.
1.35      GOP has prepared a project package of eight urban areas including
the three major towns, Jullundur, Amritsar and Ludhiana and five medium
size towns Moga, Patiala, Rajpura, Bhatinda and Pathankot (referred to as
"the three towns" and "the five towns" respectively). The locations of the
towns are shown on Map IBRD 13355. The total population in the eight towns
is about 2.0 million representing about 62% of the State's total urban pop-
ulation. The justification for the selection of the eight towns is given
in para 4.03.
Present Water Supply and Sewerage Systems in the Project Area
1.36      The existing water supply in six of the towns (including the three
major towns) is based on groundwater and on surface water in the remaining
two.  The present coverage of the water supply systems is shown on maps IBRD
13356 and 13357 and related data are shown in Annex 1, tables T2 to T5.
1.37      The towns are divided into a large number of small zones function-
ing independently, and in the case of groundwater supply, are provided with
tubewells, overhead tanks and distribution systems. The systems are simple,
with water being pumped to the storage tanks for gravity distribution to the
consumers. The only treatment required is chlorination. In the case of
surface water supply, the water is treated before distribution to the various
zonal reservoirs. There is little control over water production, consumption
and unaccounted for water. The supply is partially metered in the eight towns,
but many meters are defective. People without access to piped water supply
use shallow wells, which, particularly in heavily congested and industrialized
areas, are subject to pollution.



- 7 -
1.38      The existing sewerage systems consist mainly of a few laterals,
interceptors and outfalls serving a small part of the population. Untreated
sewage diluted with ground or surface water is used for farming. The present
coverage of sewerage services is shown on maps IBRD 13356 and 13357. Data on
existing systems and present service levels are shown in Annex 1, tables
T6 to T9.
1.39      The sewers, made of stoneware, concrete or brick laid in situ,
are underutilized because of the low connection rate. The waste water from
cooking and washing in non-connected households is generally discharged to
the sewerage system through the storm water drainage system, the two systems
being interconnected. Properties not connected to the sewerage systems are
served mainly by the conservancy system (para 1.10), which is becoming
increasingly unacceptable as the labor turns to less offensive employment.

CHAPTER II
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AGENCIES
The Water Supply and Sewerage Board (WSSB)
2.01      WSSB, established under the Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board
Act 1976, has a Chairman and a Managing Director -- both appointed by GOP --
and six ex-officio members, i.e., four Secretaries to Government, the Director
of Local Government and the Chief Engineer, Public Health. In addition, up to
five associate members may be co-opted by the Board from persons having expe-
rience of public life; one must be a woman and one a person belonging to a
"Scheduled Caste." The Board may also appoint Committees. The terms of office
of members other than the ex-officio members are to be as prescribed by GOP.
The Board is required to meet at least once in every two months.
2.02      No special qualifications are prescribed for the office of Chairman.
The Managing Director, however, is required by the Act to be a senior engineer
of the Department of Public Health.
2.03      The functions of WSSB as prescribed by the 1976 Act are broadly con-
cerned with investigating, preparing and executing water supply and sewerage
schemes, subject to reimbursement of all costs by the local authority concerned
(i.e. MC, panchayat, or similar entity). The Act contained no provision for
operation and maintenance of schemes by the Board (except that it may prescribe
the number of operational staff which a local authority must assign to water
supply and sewer maintenance). However, GOP indicated that institutional
arrangements would be made to enable WSSB to take over operation and mainte-
nance of the water supply and sewerage systems concerned in case of default
or mis-management by any MC.
2.04      Questions of general policy are decided by the Board, with executive
responsibility for all day-to-day activities devolving on the Managing Director
under regulations made by the Board. The present incumbent is a decisive and
capable administrator and engineer. Under him WSSB is organized into central
departments or units for design and planning, finance, and administration and
four decentralized engineering circles. Each circle, headed by a superin-
tending engineer, is composed of about four divisions, headed by executive
engineers, handling a varying mixture of project design, construction super-
vision and operation and maintenance (though the latter has been minimal
to date).
2.05      WSSB's responsibilities under the Act, like those of its predecessor
the Public Health Department, were very much construction-oriented and its
main strengths have lain in this aspect of engineering. It was less strong
in engineering design -- it had no specialized staff for this purpose, and
alternatives were not adequately evaluated to ensure least cost solutions;
finance and accounting have also been areas of weakness.



- 9 -
2.06      WSSB will accordingly need to strengthen its staffing and expand
its organization to be able to cope, not only with the added responsibility
of assisting the MCs in institutional development and systems operation, but
also with a greatly increased investment program. The organizational develop-
ment would particularly concentrate on (i) the establishment of adequate
capacity in project planning and design, procurement, project appraisal and
monitoring, and project financial control and (ii) the preparation and imple-
mentation of engineering and financial management information systems. WSSB's
organization, of which the nucleus has already been established, appears on
Chart 18363 and its present and projected staff requirements in Annex 1, table
TIO. The precise eventual structure will depend on studies which have already
commenced (para. 2.10).
The Water Supply and Sewerage Departments
2.07      The water supply and sewerage departments will be self-contained
entities in the municipal administrations handling all activities related to
operation and maintenance, and would broadly be organized into units for
physical operation of works, finance including billing and collection, and
administration. Staff will be transferred within the municipalities and key
personnel would mainly be seconded from WSSB. The deputation of staff from
WSSB would ensure the provision of experienced personnel and would also enable
a desirable rotation of staff to be made between various sector activities.
2.08      The department head would report to the chief executive of the
municipal administration; for recommendations on policy matters, an advisory
committee to be composed of members of the municipal council would be estab-
lished with the sole purpose of handling questions related to water supply
and sewerage services. The municipal council would decide on policy matters
and budget approval. At present the municipal councils in the project towns
have been superseded by commissioners but elections are expected to take
place shortly.
2.09      The water supply and sewerage departments will have to be properly
organized and staffed to be able to cope with projected augmentation and
improvements in the water supply and sewerage services. Operational and
maintenance procedures will be established as well as reporting, monitoring
and financial management information systems. In cases where adequate spe-
cialization cannot be achieved in individual municipalities, WSSB will provide
appropriate assistance. The departments would give initial priorities to
rehabilitation of existing systems, metering, meter maintenance and repair,
leak detection and financial improvements. A close working relationship has
to be maintained between WSSB and the MCs; GOP agreed at negotiations to
cause the MCs to cooperate with WSSB and its consultants (para 2.10) for the
development of the water supply and sewerage departments.
Consultant Assistance
2.10      For the development of its own organization and of the municipal
water supply and sewerage departments WSSB needs consultants for: (i) man-
agement, organization and staffing and the development and implementation of



- 10 -
project monitoring systems and administrative procedures; (ii) the establish-
ment of accounting and financial management information systems and their
implementation; (iii) the development of tariff structures and levels based
on appropriate socio-economic research; and (iv) the preparation and imple-
mentation of necessary training programs.
2.11      The organizational development is critical for the implementation
of the investment program and consultants have already been appointed for
services mentioned under references (i) to (iii) of para. 2.10. IDA obtained
assurances at negotiations that a training consultant (2.10 (iv)) should be
appointed not later than December 1, 1978. The training consultant cannot
start working until recommendations on organization and staffing have been
made and training components included in other consultant services have been
identified.
2.12      Other consultant assistance will be required in engineering for
design of water treatment works (for two towns) and sewage treatment works
(for eight towns). A consultant has been appointed for design of water treat-
ment works and IDA obtained assurances during negotiations that a consultant
for sewage treatment works would be appointed not later than December 1, 1978.
The consultant services including training are assumed to amount to about 500
man/months, all for local consultants, at a cost of about US$0.5 million
equivalent. Furthermore, a sanitary engineer and a financial analyst attached
to the IBRD/WHO CP will, on a part-time basis, provide engineering and finan-
cial advice and review technical reports for the five towns (para. 4.14). The
possibility of bilateral technical assistance is also being explored by GOP.

POPULATION FORECASTS AND DEMAND PROJECTIONS
Population Forecasts
3.01      The population increase in Punjab during 1961-71 was 21% (for urban
and rural areas it was 25.3% and 19.7% respectively). GOP has made future
population projections for the project towns individually in the light of
master plans for urban development and taking account of factors such as
growth potential and industrial development. These projections are reason-
able and have been ;sed for the design of the sub-projects. 1/
3.02      Present and forecast populations in the eight project towns are
shown in Annex 1, tables T2 to T5, and are summarized below:

Present and Forecast Water Demand and Sewage Flow
3.03      Water demand projections are shown in Annex 1, tables T2 to T5,
individually for the three towns and consolidated for the five towns. The
present water consumption pattern cannot be readily established because of
the lack of production meters and reliable customer meters. In the three
towns about 56% and in the five towns about 60% of all domestic connections
are metered and it is believed that of these 30% to 40% are out of order
(para. 2.09). The number of standposts is insignificant in Jullundur (about
30) but considerable in the other towns (about 600 as a maximum). The
domestic water consumption has been analysed on a sample basis, which has
indicated rates of 200 to 240 liter per capita per day (1/cd).  These rates
would be representative for continuous water supply and for customers with
rather extensive plumbing systems. The average per capita consumption is
probably much lower.
1/   The project is defined to consist of sub-projects, one for each
individual town.



- 12 -
3.04      The projection of domestic water consumption has taken into account
(i) that all or most of the connections will be metered during the project
period; (ii) expected improvements in operation and maintenance; (iii) exten-
sion of water connections to poorer sections; (iv) introduction of a stepped
tariff structure; and (v) the socio-economic pattern in individual towns.
Bulk water meters will be installed and a leak detection program will be
implemented. On this basis, metered water consumption has been assumed to
range between 90 and 160 1/cd in the eight towns. Standpost consumption
has been projected at 45 1/cd.
3.05      Accurate production and consumption data are not available for any
of the eight towns. Although the existing water supply systems are similar
in design, the quality of operation and maintenance varies and system
losses are expected to vary from one town to another. However, the projec-
tions assume that during the project implementation period, through improved
operation and maintenance, leak detection, use of better quality meters and
adequate meter maintenance and repairs, the unaccounted-for water in all
the towns will be reduced to a reasonable level.
3.06      An inventory of industrial consumption, whether from public or
private witer supplies, has been carried out. The actual consumption varies
from 25 m to 60 m per hectare per day depending on the type of manufacturing.
Similar rates have been applied in the projections.
3.07      The sewage flow (Annex 1, tables T6 to T9) is based on the assump-
tion that 75% of water production will enter the sewerage system either
directly or indirectly through the storm water drainage system. In addition,
provision has been made for infiltration.
3.08      The design criteria were reviewed by the appraisal mission and
are acceptable with some agreed revisions.

CHAPTER IV
THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Project Composition
4.01      The project constitutes about 75% of forecast sector investments
in urban areas through FY1981-82. Its concepts are compatible with the sector
objectives as summarized under para 1.12.  The project target is to provide in
the eight towns safe and continuous water supply to the entire population and
satisfactory waste removal to the extent it is financially feasible. Imple-
mentation is scheduled during the period FY1978-79 through FY1981-82 with
construction works expected to start by end 1978.
4.02      The project would include the following major components:  (a) con-
sultant studies as stated under paras 2.10 and 2.12; (b) water supply and
sewerage works in the eight towns and (c) specialized equipment for WSSB
and provisions for training.
Project Priorities and Selection Criteria
4.03      The justification for a project package covering the eight towns
may be summarized as follows:
(a) The water supply and sewerage situation for unserved
people in all urban areas has been broadly assessed
and extension of the services is most urgently required
in rapidly expanding, congested and industrialized areas
and in areas where the groundwater contains excessive
fluoride (Rajpura and Bhatinda);
(b) By concentrating the investments in major population
centers, optimal population coverage is achieved; and
(c) In smaller population centers private water supplies are
generally better protected and an urgent need for
sewerage systems has not yet arisen.
4.04      The formulation of the water supply and sewerage schemes has been
influenced by the following specific project objectives:
(a) to maximize the utilization of existing water production
capacity by (i) the revision of the zoning systems; (ii)
the extension of metering to the extent economically justi-
fied; (iii) the introduction of a stepped tariff structure
to limit waste; (iv) changing the operational pattern; and
(v) the reduction of unaccounted-for water by leak detection
and repair and other measures;



- 14 -
(b) to maximize the utilization of the existing sewerage
systems by the increase of sewer connection rates, the
extension of laterals in areas already provided with
trunk sewers, and system rehabilitation by, inter alia,
desilting; and
(c) to increase the number of water and sewerage connections
to the economically weaker sections of the community by
the provision of credits on easy terms to cover connection
costs and basic WC installations.
Project Design
4.05      After review of the engineering design for the three major towns
(para 4.14) IDA recommended network analysis to be undertaken by consultants
to ensure least cost solutions. Various alternatives have been evaluated
using a discount rate of 10% and the most economical extensions of the water
supply systems have been determined.
4.06      The sewerage systems, interceptors and outfalls in the three towns
are basically well conceived and sites for disposal have been located.
Treatment works will be extended later in stages, but the project provides
for related preliminary and detailed engineering design and, to the extent
feasible, provisional treatment arrangements.
4.07      WSSB has proposed metering of all connections; provision for this
is included in the project. This might be questionable in cases where water
source development is comparatively inexpensive and where water connections
are given to the economically weaker sections of the society. Selective
metering might be more economical in such cases. This matter will be further
reviewed in the proposed tariff study (para 2.10).
Project Description
4.08      Annex 1, tables T2 to T9, show the major components which are proposed
to be included in the eight urban water supply and sewerage schemes and Maps
IBRD 13356 and 13357 show the extent of existing and proposed water distribu-
tion and sewerage systems. The major components for water supply are tube-
wells, service reservoirs, distribution mains, service connections, standposts,
and (for two towns) treatment works; and for sewerage, sewer connections with
WC installations, laterals, interceptors, pumping stations, outfall mains and
disposal facilities. Annex 1, table Tll, shows the number of connections to be
installed for water supply (about 90,000) and sewerage (about 140,000).
Cost Estimates and Amount of IDA Credit
4.09      Annex 1, tables T12 to T14, show for the eight towns the cost esti-
mates consolidated for water supply and sewerage. A summary project cost

ing design and on mid-1977 prices. Physical contingencies have been assumed
to average 12% and price contingencies 8% and 7% annually for civil works and
material and equipment respectively. The engineering costs have been assumed
at 4% for planning and design and 11% for construction supervision. The project
costs include import duties, excise and sales taxes to an estimated amount of
US$2.5 million equivalent.



- 16 -
4.11      An IDA credit of USU38.0 million is proposed, which would finance
about 50% of total project costs net of duties and taxes. About US$5.5 mil-
lion equivalent or 14% of the credit is estimated to be used to finance for-
eign expenditures. The balance of US$32.5 million or 86% will finance local
currency expenditures on civil works, equipment and material, consultant
services and training.
Financing Plan
4.12      Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has offered to partici-

4.13      The Municipal contributions of Rs 210.3 million would            the
form of a capital grant.  The GOP loan of Rs 326.8 million which  _ludes
the equivalent of the IDA credit, will be made to WSSB at 8-1/2% for 25 years
with a three year grace period. The LIC loan of Rs 130.0 million will be
lent directly to WSSB at the same terms as the GOP loan. The money wili be
onlent from WSSB to the MCs on the same terms and conditions as stated above.
The IDA credit will be transferred to GOP by GOI on the latter's standard
terms. This financing plan would be satisfactory. GOP gave undertakings at
negotiations (i) guaranteeing the availability of the MCs contrib'itions and
any other funds necessary to complete the project, and (ii) confirming the
lending terms and conditions for the GOP and the WSSB loans. A draft of a
subsidiary loan agreement between WSSB and the MCs was agreed during nego-
tiations.
Project Implementation
4.14      The three towns' water supply and sewerage schemes comprising 80%
of the total project costs, were sufficiently advanced to be appraised by IDA,
but the schemes for the five towns will be appraised by WSSB. Design criteria
for the five towns have been agreed with WSSB and preliminary designs have
been reviewed by IDA, and the cost estimates (para. 4.09) are based on these.
Detailed technical reports for each sub-project will be completed and sub-
mitted to IDA for approval as and when ready, which for all such reports
would be not later than December 31, 1978.
4.15      WSSB will be responsible for the preparation and implementation of
the project. Annex 1, table TIO, shows broadly WSSB's present and projected
implementation capacity and number of divisions, and the staff additionally
required for project execution. The newly established Design and Planning
Department has already been given five design divisions (including one for
sub-project appraisal and project monitoring) and a chief engineer has been
appointed to head the Department.
4.16      The new positions of superintending and executive engineers can be
filled by deputation (from PWD) and by promotion. Recruitment of engineers
is not a problem because there is an adequate supply of graduate engineers.
4.17      The management consultant (para 2.10) will study in detail staffing
requirements and recruitment schedules. A final report is expected by February
1979, and assurances were obtained at negotiations that WSSB and MCs will (i)
submit to IDA for review, staffing proposals not later than January 1, 1979,
and (ii) employ qualified staff to carry out the project and to operate the
physical and financial aspects of the systems.
4.18      The project monitoring, reporting and financial management informa-
tion systems to be prepared by the accounting and management consultants will
be reviewed by IDA before their implementation. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that such systems should be functioning for WSSB and MCs by not
later than April 1, 1979. Assurances were also obtained that technical and



- 18 -
financial performance criteria and indicators on operational matters should
be established by WSSB in consultation with the MCs and IDA by not later
than October 1, 1979.
4.19      WSSB has prepared for the three towns a detailed PERT network for
project implementation including contract processing. This was reviewed
during negotiations and found acceptable. An outline project implementation
schedule is shown on chart 18364.
Procurement
4.20      Annex 1, table T15, shows broadly material and equipment (M&E)
requirements, cost estimates, assumed number of contracts and average con-
tract sizes, and items to be put to International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
and Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). M&E contracts with an estimated value
exceeding US$100,000 would be subject to ICB except for stoneware and concrete
pipes (representing about 11% of total M&E costs i.e. about US$4.0 million
equivalent) for which LCB only is recommended. Such pipes have high trans-
port costs and are subject to damage during handling.
4.21      A further 37% of total M&E costs represents the cost of WC's and
other materials for sewer connections. Related works (procurement and
installation) would be executed through a large number of small contracts to
be awarded locally. Local procurement may include the award of contracts to
suppliers with whom the Directorate General for Supply and Disposal (DGS&D)
of GOI has entered into annual rate contracts after bidding.
4.22      For ICB, a domestic preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever
is lower, is proposed to be applied in bid evaluation. At negotiations GOP
informed IDA that a system of preferences in favor of Punjab manufacturers is
no longer applicable.
4.23      The contracts (ICB and LCB) will be suitably grouped  to secure the
advantages of economies of scale but for the initial requirements it is
envisaged that WSSB would enter into some smaller contracts via DGS&D proce-
dures to expedite the commencement of construction works.
4.24      Because of the dispersed nature of the project and the limited pos-
sibilities of grouping the contracts there would be at least 100 civil works
contracts with an average contract value of about US$250,000 equivalent. One
or two contracts could go up to US$1.5 million equivalent and the rest would
be much smaller in value. The majority of the contracts would comprise labor
intensive pipe laying works. LCB would be appropriate for all civil works
contracts and is recommended. The contracting industry is well developed in
the State and works will be executed by force account only in exceptional
cases. Force account is proposed to be accepted for works with a value of
less than US$30,000 equivalent without prior approval by IDA. This will in-
clude all tubewell drilling, of which the civil works component represents a
total cost of about US$300,000 equivalent. The local procedures for bidding
are satisfactory.



- 19 -
4.25      IDA would carry out ex-ante reviews of (i) all documents and awards
for material and equipment to be subject to ICB and (ii) documents and awards
for civil works for contract values exceeding US$500,000 equivalent. This
should cover about 40% of M&E costs (about US$14 million equivalent) and 50%
of civil works costs (about US$15 million equivalent).
Disbursements
4.26      The proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed as follows:  (i) for
equipment and material contracts to be awarded through ICB, 100% of foreign
expenditures or 100% of ex-factory costs; (ii) for civil works and for equip-
ment and material contracts to be awarded through LCB, 45% of local costs;
and (iii) 100% of consultant and training costs. The local costs exclude
engineering (WSSB'- administrative costs). A quarterly disbursement forecast
is shown in Alrl -x 1, table T16.
4.27      IDA agreed with LIC at negotiations that its loan would be disbursed
at the rate of 28% of local costs (excluding WSSB's administrative costs) for
civil works and for equipment and material contracts to be awarded through
LCB.
4.28      Disbursement would be made against statements of expenses for pro-
gress payments in respect of civil works and material and equipment not ex-
ceeding Rs 100,000 (US$11,600 equivalent) and Rs 50,000 (US$5,800 equivalent)
respectively.  Relevant documents would be retained by WSSB and available for
inspection by IDA during the course of project supervision. Retroactive
financing amounting to about US$100,000 equivalent is recommended for con-
sultant services for costs incurred after February 28, 1978.
4.29      For the physical components of the project, disbursements will be
made only against sub-projects which have been approved by IDA and where
WSSB-MCs subsidiary loan agreements have been duly executed.
Training
4.30      The engineering and operational standards are to be improved and
accounting systems on an accrual basis are to be introduced as well as project
monitoring, reporting and financial management information systems. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that the implementation of an agreed training
program based on the recommendations of the training consultant shall commence
not later than July 1, 1979 or such other date as may be agreed, and that,
if necessary, consultant assistance will be retained.
Project Impact
4.31      The impact of the project works can most readily be measured in
service levels before and after project implementation, which are shown in
Annex 1, table T17, and summarized below for water supply and sewerage
respectively.

4.32      In the eight towns 100% of the population will have access to piped
or protected water supply after project completion since the 12% not accounted
for in the above summary are covered by private water supplies or by isolated
systems for areas such as industrial estates and university compounds.
4.33      The additional population served by water supply (connections) and
sewerage amount to about 0.8 and 1.2 million respectively, which corresponds
to 22% and 32% of total urban population in the State. Furthermore the serv-
ices would improve considerably for presently served population in the project
towns: i.e. 1.1 million (water supply) and 0.3 million (sewerage). The per
capita costs for additional population served are reasonable. Without this
project the service levels combined for the eight towns would by 1982 have
declined to 46% for water supply (connections) and 10% for sewerage.
4.34      Concentrated poverty areas in the eight project towns are shown on
maps IBRD 13356 and 13357. The poverty areas are all covered by the extended
water supply systems, but at the present stage it has not been financially
feasible to cover these entirely under the extended sewerage systems. The
total population, however, benefits directly or indirectly from the extended
sewerage systems through a significantly improved environment and the
increased discharge of sullage waste to the sewerage systems through inter-
connections with the storm water drainage systems. For people who are not
in a position to connect to the sewerage systems, the project provides to a
limited extent for community toilets. Outside the project, improvements are
also being made to the conservancy system as regards collection and disposal.
4.35      In order to enable the urban poor to connect to the water supply
and sewerage systems GOP has agreed to the deletion of the administrative



- 21 -
fee for connections and the reduction of water meter deposits, and the pro-
ject includes provision of credit on easy terms for water supply and sewerage
connections. For each sub-project it would be a condition for disbursement
that (i) lending terms and conditions for the connection costs and selection
criteria for credit eligibility should have been approved by IDA and (ii)
an acceptable implementation program for sewer connections and WCs instal-
lation should be submitted by WSSB. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that WSSB should be made responsible for carrying out the above program and
to cooperate with MCs as appropriate.

CHAPTER V
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance and Present Position on Urban Water Supply and Sewerage
5.01      The MCs keep their accounts on a simple cash basis, which does not
provide financial data adequate to judge performance. They do not prepare
either annual reports or annual financial statements and the information which
is provided in Annex 1, tables T18 to T20, on past financial performance in
the three towns has been extracted from the simple accounting records that
are presently maintained. All three towns record a history of losses on
operations particularly on sewerage operations, although Amritsar and Ludhiana
are close to breaking even in FY1976-77 and FY1977-78 on their overall opera-
tions. Jullundur however will meet only about 35% of its operating costs in
these two years. In every case the debt/equity ratio is satisfactory. A
review of provisional statements for the five towns indicates similar finan-
cial patterns. A full review of the finances of the five towns will be
carried out when the detailed technical reports are submitted (para 4.14).
Water and Sewerage Tariffs
5.02      Water and sewerage tariffs have varied from town to town but aL
present are basicallv thee same for Auluxtsar and Ludhiana as follows:
Water flat rate         Rs 8.00 per month
Water metered           Rs 0.35 per m 3
Sewerage                Rs 2.00 per month per seat
representing about 2% of family income for the lower income group, which is
reasonable and is not expected to increase substantially in future (para
5.04). Full tariff details are shown in Annex 1, table T24, and the majority
of the towns use at least part of these charges. In Jullundur the charges
are about half of these and this largely accounts for the very much poorer
financial performance in that town when compared with the other two (Annex 1,
table T18).
5.03      GOP has caused the MCs, pending the tariff study (para 5.04), to
introduce common water charges in the eight towns based on the existing
tariffs for Amritsar and Ludhiana effective July 1, 1978. A sewerage charge
equivalent to the charge for water has been introduced at the same time to all
premises which have both a water and a sewer connection. GOP further proposes
to introduce full sewerage charges from April 1, 1979 for premises which are
not connected, but have access to, and benefit from the sewerage system. This
will seek to induce people to connect to the sewerage system and thus increase



- 23 -
the utilization of the system (para 1.09). The burden of the cost of con-
necting to the system will be relieved by the provision of credit (para
4.35). In addition, the present cost of conservancy estimated to average
about Rs 5.00 per month will no longer be payable after connection to the
sewerage system. GOP agreed at negotiations to cause the MCs to introduce
such charges.
5.04      A tariff study is to be carried out by consultants employed by
WSSB to design tariffs which will seek to maximize income, minimize wastage
of water and at the same time provide a reasonable level of service to the
urban poor at a price that they can afford.  The latter will be achieved by
the provision of free supplies of water from standposts and by the use of
a stepped tariff for metered supplies. The advantages of such a tariff are
that (a) it can be common to all consumers, domestic and industrial, large
and small; (b) the urban poor using small quantities are charged a subsidized
rate; and (c) the large consumers and high use industrial customers pay a
higher rate to discourage waste. The average levels of tariffs are not
expected to change as a result of the tariff study.
Future Finances
5.05      The future finances of the three towns are shown in the form of
Consolidated Income and Flow of Funds Statements and Balance Sheets in
Annex 1, tables T19 and T20. The assumptions used for those forecasts are
shown in Annex 2. For the other five towns, future financial statements will
be included in the detailed technical reports to be submitted (para 4.14).
With the introduction of common water charges and a sewerage charge in
FY1978-79, there will be an overall positive rate of return in the three towns
during the construction period to FY1981-82. This will also be true of the
three towns individually, except for Jullundur in the first year FY1978-79.
During this period there should be no need for any further tariff increases,
provided that prices do not escalate beyond the forecast level of about 7%
to 8%. In addition, the tariff study described in para 5.04 is expected to
recommend additional sources of revenue such as charges for:
(a)  Properties connected to the sewers but using private
water supplies;
(b)  The sale of waste water for irrigation purposes; and
(c)  The private extraction of water from the aquifer.
During the construction period up to FY1981-82 it is not anticipated that
the MCs would be in a position to make a significant contribution to future
investment from system revenues. However, with the increase in charges
effective July 1, 1978, each will be required to cover annual operating ex-
penses, working capital increases and debt service or depreciation whichever
is the higher. GOP agreed at negotiations to cause the MCs to comply with
such a covenant.



- 24 -
5.06      Increases in tariffs before FY1982-83 are, therefore, not anti-
cipated unless the level of inflation exceeds that forecast. However, with
the improvements in service created by the project, a large increase in tariffs
should be possible in FY1982-83 in order to generate sufficient cash to finance
a proportion of future investment and to ensure that an adequate return on
capital investment is obtained. The actual size of this increase will depend
upon the level of inflation during the intervening years, on the ability of the
MCs to generate additional sources of revenue as a result of the tariff study
(para 5.04) and to a lesser extent, on the level of recoveries of credits to
the poorer sections of the community for connections.  To regulate the actual                  p
tariff levels it is proposed to require that the MCs maintain separate accounts
for the water supply and sewerage services and from FY1982-83 provide a per-
centage contribution to future investment from system revenues. A cash gene-
ration covenant 'has been preferred over a rate of return covenant because the
schedule and values of physical assets have not been maintained by the MCs on
a sound basis and only estimated values have been assessed by WSSB staff for
the purposes of the financial projections. The cash generation covenant would
require the MCs to generate sufficient internal cash to finance a proportion
of the annual investment taking the average of the investments in the current,
the last preceding and the next following year, at the rate of at least 30%
FY1982-83, 35% in FY1983-84 and 40% from FY1984-85 onwards. These percentages
are adequate. This approach has been used in other projects and has proved to
work satisfactorily. However, for balance sheet purposes, WSSB proposes to
instruct consultants to properly value and record all existing assets (para
2.10). This will enable a rate of return calculation to be made as a further
test of financial viability, and this could also, as an alternative to the
cash generation covenant, be used as an earnings covenant on terms acceptable
to IDA, should GOP so wish.  It was informally agreed that GOP would decide
by March 31, 1982 if a rate of return covenant to be agreed with IDA, but of
not less than 6% on revalued average net fixed assets is preferred to a cash
generation covenant. GOP agreed at negotiations to cause the MCs to maintain
separate accounts for each town and to comply with such covenants. GOP also
agreed to ensure that revenues from the water supply and sewerage services
would be used exclusively for operation and maintenance and development of the
water supply and sewerage systems. However, transfers could be made for other
municipal activities taking into account the MCs ability to borrow and pro-
vided such funds are not needed for the water supply and sewerage services.
5.07      In order to protect the MCs future financial viability it is proposed
that they should not, without IDA's agreement, incur any further long term
debt in respect of water supply and sewerage services unless net income before
interest and depreciation is at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service in any
future year. GOP agreed at negotiations to cause the MCs to comply with such a
covenant.
5.08      On the above basis, by the end of the construction period in FY1981-
82 the three towns would achieve an operating ratio of 45%, a debt/equity ratio
of 57/43 and an internal cash generation of 1.0 times debt service. These
would improve to 32%, 55/45 and 1.7 times respectively by FY1983-84. From
provisional financial statements for the five towns with the water charges
standardized and a sewerage charge introduced, it is expected that the



- 25 -
finances of the five towns will remain viable throughout the project con-
struction period in the same way as for the three towns (para 5.05). This
will be further reviewed at the time of submission of the detailed technical
reports (para 4.14).
Finances of WSSB - Board Operations
5.09      WSSB will carry out the design and supervision of construction in
the eight towns and the rest of the urban water supply sector and an engi-
neering charge of 15% of total cost will be made on all construction work to
reimburse WSSB for these services.  The financial implications of carrying
out these services are shown in the form of income statements, flow of funds
statements and balance sheets in Annex 1, tables T21 to T23, and the assump-
tions used for these forecasts are shown at Annex 2. These statements include
only the supervisory costs of WSSB. All capital costs relating to civil works
and equipment purchases will be accumulated each year for each town with the
appropriate supervision cost and the appropriate liability for these costs
will be transferred to and accounted for in the financial statements for each
town at the end of each year.
5.10      The operations of WSSB, in this supervisory context, are viable
throughout the projection period. GOP has undertaken to provide a sum of
Rs 80.0 million to WSSB for working capital to enable it to finance the high
level of expenditure that will be necessary to sustain the project and other
sector work, pending receipt of loan monies from GOP and LIC and funds from
the MCs. The original assets were taken over from the Public Health Engi-
neering Department in 1977 and the additional assets forecast for future
years are mainly specialized equipment which will be operated by WSSB for the
benefit of the whole urban sector, and which cannot be directly allocated to
any particular town. GOP has agreed to cause each MC to provide its water
supply and sewerage department with an opening cash balance equivalent to not
less than one-twelfth of its annual operational expenditures.
5.11      Consultants are being appointed by WSSB to establish public utility
commercial accounting systems in two phases. These will be, first, an interim
phase which will focus on improved billing and collection and basic accounting
records, to be implemented speedily by April 1, 1979 and then a full system to
be implemented by April 1, 1980. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that a full public utility commercial accounting system should be implemented
by April 1, 1980, for WSSB and for the eight towns.
Audit
5.12      WSSB and the MCs are subject to audit by the Examiner, Local Fund
Accounts. The Examiner would be capable of carrying out an audit of WSSB and
the MCs both before and after the implementation of the commercial accounting
system to the satisfaction of IDA. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that WSSB and the MCs should submit statements of accounts, audited to
the satisfaction of IDA, within six months of the end of the financial year,
beginning with FY1978-79.

CHAPTER VI
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
6.01      The economic benefits of a water supply and sewerage project are
necessarily difficult to quantify, particularly in respect of the sewerage
component.  These benefits reflect the improved well-being of the population
through reduction in medical and hospital costs and increased work produc-
tivity along with increases in effective nutrition due to reductions in
intestinal parasites (particularly in children) and land value increases
as a result of the provision of services. The distribution of these services
also becomes more equitable, particularly in relation to the improved benefits
to the urban poor which are either provided free or at subsidized prices. The
project will also create employment for about 10,000 people a year during the
construction period.
Incremental Financial Rate of Return
6.02      The incremental financial rates of return based upon projected
actual revenues 1/ and actual project and operating costs in respect of the
three towns (see table below), for water only, are 17.4%, 12.8% and 17.9% com-
pared to the opportunity cost of capital in India of about 10% and these are
satisfactory. A sensitivity analysis in which capital costs are 10% higher
than estimated, reduces these returns to 16.7%, 12.3% and 17.1% and if a de-
crease of 10% in revenues is also considered the returns are further reduced
to 14.6%, 10.7% and 15.2%; a still satisfactory position. If the costs and
benefits 2/ of sewerage are also taken into account, the overall internal
financial rates of return for the three towns are 15.1%, 19.7% and 16.5%. The
negative returns from the sewerage component in Jullundur and Ludhiana indicate
that the present allocation of the total water tariff between water and sewer-
age does not reflect their marginal cost. This subject will be addressed
during the tariff review. In the meantime the total tariff compares favor-
ably with the total marginal cost of water and sewerage so that the joint
charge made to the consumer who is connected to the sewerage system is
appropriate. These rates of return are summarized below:
1/   No revenues are assumed in respect of standposts.
2/ "Benefits" being taken only as sewerage revenues, although charges for
this service may not of course, reflect the customers' valuation of
sewerage benefits.

Marginal Cost Analysis
6.03      The marginal cost of water for the three towns at 3O 10X. discount
rate and at A979 prices will vary from Rs 0.33 to 0.41 per m (U,' cents
4 to 5 per m ) or an average of US cents 16.5 per 1,000 US gallons.  The  3
marginal cost of the sewerage service 3will vary from Rs 0.54 to C.96 per m
of water used (US cents 6 to 11 per m ) or an average of US cent<. 33 per 1,000
US gallons used. The average tariff during the project construction period
will be consistent with this estimate in the case of water supply but will
be lower in the case of the sewerage service. However, the tariff will be
increased considerably on completion of the project (para. 5.06). With the
introduction of a stepped tariff, large users could pay much more than the
marginal cost and thereby subsidize the urban poor (para. 5.04). The follow-
ing table gives the detailed marginal cost figures.

CHAPTER VII
PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Project Justification
7.01      The project is justified on the grounds that it:
(i)  is an integral part of an acceptable investment program;
(ii) covers an important first stage in institutional devel-
opment;
(iii) will improve fiscal discipline and by the restructuring
and increase of tariffs will provide a cash generating
capacity for future capital investments;
(iv)  covers areas where improved water supply and sewerage
services are most urgently needed;
(v)  provides for optimal utilization of existing facilities
and the extended works represent least cost solutions;
(vi) is expected to achieve considerable improvements in works
operation initially for the eight project towns and
ultimately for the whole sector;
(vii) provides for 100% accessibility to safe water supply in
the project towns;
(viii) includes satisfactory provisions to benefit the poorer
sections of society;
(ix) has a cost per capita and an incremental financial rate
of return that are satisfactory; and
(x) promotes improved health standards and subsequent increase
in productivity.
Project Risks
7.02      The project involves significant institutional developments par-
ticularly regarding the establishment of separate water supply and sewerage
departments. Close cooperation will be required beween WSSB and the hlCs,
and delays might occur in achieving set targets despite actions taken
concerning early employment of consultants.



- 29 -
7.03      The project concentrates on investment in sewerage works despite
previous experiences of low connection rates. However, the resistance which
is growing to the use of the old conservancy system should result in a higher
connection rate. It includes provisions for encouraging and facilitating
connection to the sewerage systems, but these methods are untested and the
projected number of connections might not materialize as soon as envisaged.
No other unusual risks are anticipated.
Agreements Reached and Recommendations
7.04      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following major
points:
(a)  with GOI to make the proceeds of the Credit available
to GOP in accordance with GOI's standard arrangements
for development projects (para 4.13);
(b)  with GOP
(i)  to cause the establishment and functioning of water
supply and sewerage departments in the eight project
towns (para 1.31);
(ii)  to empower WSSB in case of default or mismanagement
by an MC to take over operation and maintenance
of its water supply and sewerage systems (para 2.03);
(iii)  to guarantee the availability of the MCs capital grants
and any other funds necessary to complete the project
and to onlend the IDA Credit to WSSB at 8-1/2% for
25 years with a three year grace period (para 4.13);
(iv) to cause MCs to introduce reporting and financial
management information systems and to establish tech-
nical and financial performance criteria and indicators
on operational matters (para 4.18);
(v)  to cause MCs to introduce sewerage charges from April 1,
1979 equal to the water supply charges for all uncon-
nected premises, which have access to and benefit from
the sewerage systems (para 5.03);
(vi) to cause MCs through FY1981-82 to produce revenues from
the water supply and sewerage services sufficient to
cover annual operating expenses, working capital, and
debt service or depreciation whichever is higher
(para 5.05);
(vii)  to cause MCs to maintain separate accounts and to
increase the water and sewerage charges in the eight
project towns to generate sufficient internal cash to



- 30 -
finance a proportion of the average annual investment
at the rate of at least 30% in FY1982-83, 35% in
FY1983-84 and 40% thereafter (para 5.06);
(viii)  to provide WSSB and to cause MCs to provide their
water supply and sewerage departments with working
capital (para 5.10); and
(ix)  to cause MCs to implement a full public utility com-
mercial accounting system and to submit statements of
accounts, audited to the satisfaction of the Association
(paras 5.11 and 5.12).
(c)  with WSSB
(i)  to appoint consultants for the preparation of a train-
ing program and its implementation and for preliminary
and detailed engineering design for sewage treatment
works (paras 2.11, 2.12 and 4.30).
(ii)  to submit to IDA the consultants recommendations on staff-
ing and recruitment proposals and employ qualified staff
to carry out the project (para 4.17);
(iii)  to establish project monitoring, reporting and financial
management information systems (para 4.18); and
(iv)  to implement a full public utility commercial accounting
system and to submit statements of accounts, audited to the
satisfaction of the Association (paras 5.11 and 5.12).
(d) with LIC to provide WSSB with a loan of Rs. 13 crores
(US$15.1 million equivalent) on the same terms and
conditions as the GOP-WSSB loan (para 4.13).
7.05      An additional condition for credit effectiveness would be for GOP
to take appropriate action to formalize the modifications to the institutional
framework as agreed at negotiations to enable WSSB to onlend funds and take
over operation and maintenance of municipal systems in the event of mismanage-
ment or default.
7.06      The following would be conditions for disbursements:
(i)  IDA approval of sub-projects for the five towns
(para 4.29);
(ii)  execution of subsidiary loan agreements between
WSSB and each MC (para 4.29); and
(iii)  IDA approval of (a) credit terms and conditions
for financing sewer connection costs including WCs
and of selection criteria for credit eligibility;



- 31 -
and (b) the implementation program for the instal-
lation of sewer connections and WCs (paras 4.35).
7.07      With the indicated assurances the project is suitable for an IDA
credit of US$38 million equivalent.

Assumptions for Financial Projections
Inflation
1.        India's rate of inflation has followed the general pattern of the
rest of the world, climbing to 7% in 1972 and 17% in 1973 to peak at 28% in
1974 and dropping right back again to about 5% in 1975 and to a negative 5%
in 1976. The present annual rate of inflation is about 8% to 10% and the
financial projections are based on inflation rates of an average of about
7.5% a year. It is upon this rate that the calculations for the proposed
cash generation covenant (see para 5.06) have also been made.
Exchange Rate
2.        The present exchange rate Rs 8.60 = US$1 is assumed to continue
throughout the project period.
Population and Demand
3.        The population and demand figures set out in Chapter III have been
used for projection purposes.
Form of Financial Projections
4.        Although the three towns Jullundur, Amritsar and Ludhiana have
been fully appraised, for the sake of brevity the financial statements have
not been set out in their entirety in this report. Instead, the nine
financial statements have been consolidated into two, namely, one for Income
and Flow of Funds Statements and one for Balance Sheets. In these statements
the detail for each of the three towns is shown separately (see Annex 1,
tables T19 and T20).
INCOME AND FLOW OF FUNDS STATEMENTS - THREE TOWNS (Annex 1, table T19)
Operating Revenues - Three Towns
5.        Operating revenues have been extracted from the cash records of the
MCs for the three years FY1974-75, 1975-76 and 1976-77 and from the budget for
FY1977-78. For the projections the revenues are based upon the population and
demand figures in Chapter III and Annex 1 (tables T2 to T9) and the tariff set
out in Annex 1 (table T24) plus sewerage charges equal to water charges. In



ANNEX 2
Page  2
FY1982-83 after project completion the tariffs are required to generate
sufficient internal cash to meet the cash generation covenant. For projec-
tion purposes various tariff increases between 50% and 100% have been assumed
but no income has been assumed for the additional sources described in para
5.05 as these are undefined at the present time.
Operating Expenses - Three Towns
6.        The operating expenses for FY1974-75, 1975-76 and 1976-77 have been
extracted from the cash records of the MCs.  The FY1978 figures are from the
MCs budgets for that year. Forecasts for FY1978-79 to FY1983-84 were made on
the following assumptions:
(i) Wages: The present levels are reasonable and are expected
to be maintained in real terms. To allow for inflation,
for new staff and for existing staff wage increments, in-
creases of 15% have been made in each year except FY1978-79
and FY1981-82 when an additional 10% has been included. This
is to cover the increased staff necessary for the start up
of WSSB on water and sewerage operations in FY1978-79 and
the increase to full operational capacity on completion
of the project in FY1981-82.
(ii) Chemicals: The FY1977-78 price of chlorine used is is 2.00
per pound and 456 pounds are used for each million m of
water produced. The cost of chemicals is therefore based
upon the total quantity of water produced at this price
escalated at 7.5% per year.
(iii) Power: The expenditure on power is based on the FY1977-78
budgeted figure increased each year in proportion to water
production and escalated at 7.5% per year.
(iv) Materials: These are materials used for operational main-
tenance and are projected on the basis of 0.75% of the
gross value of fixed assets in service.
(v) Fuel and Oil: This expenditure is escalated as for power
(see (iii) above).
(vi) Other: This expenditure is escalated as for wages (see (i)
above).
(vii) Bad Debts: In the past no provision has been made for bad
debts and these are reported to be minimal due to the sat-
isfactory powers for enforcement of payment. However, with
the considerable increase in charges that will be necessary
in the next few years it is considered prudent to make an



ANNEX 2
Page 3
allowance for bad debts and this has been provided at the
rate of 25% of billings in FY1978-79, 15% of billings in
FY1979-80 and 10% of billings in each year thereafter.
Depreciation
7.        Depreciation rates varying between 0% for land to 20% for vehicles
will be used for accounting purposes. For projection purposes an overall
rate of 3% is used for the total of assets in service at the beginning of the
year and one-half of this rate is used for assets brought into service during
the year.
Long Term Debt Service
8.        These are the amounts of principal and interest paid each year in
respect of the loans outstanding (see para. 11 below).
Project Investment
9.        These are the amounts of project investment in the three towns
during the project period FY1978-79 to FY1981-82 as follows:
Loan                     Amount
Rs Million
Jullundur                   161.51
Amritsar                    173.21
Ludhiana                    199.11
Total                  533.83 (US$ 62.1 million)
Other Works
10.       These are the amounts invested in the three towns both before
and after the project.
Long Term Debt
11.       Existing loans which are small, are repayable over differing periods
with various rates of interest up to 8%. The new loans for the project are
from GOP for a total of Rs 326.8 million at 8-1/2% for 25 years with a 3 year
grace period and Rs 130.0 million from LIC at 8-1/2% for 25 years with a
3 year grace period. For the three towns the GOP loan amounts to Rs 258.8
million (50% of project cost) and the LIC loan amounts to Rs 104.0 million
(20% of project cost). Future loans for the three towns in FY1982-83 and
FY1983-84 amounting to Rs 116.40 are expected to be provided by GOP on the
same terms as the loan for the project. Credits for the poorer sections of
the community are to be made for connection costs. The repayment terms are
yet to be agreed and no income has been included in the projections.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
Contributions
12.       The MCs of the three towns are expected to make capital grants to
the project work of about Rs 170.9 million or about 32% of the project cost.
BALANCE SHEETS - THREE TOWNS (Annex 1, table T20)
Net Fixed Assets
13.       Net fixed assets are the historical cost of assets less the depre-
ciation described in para. 7 above.
Work in Progress
14.       The total of work in progress at the end of each year is the
value of work carried out during the year and which is capitalized and
brought into service in the following year.
Current Assets
15.       The items included under this head with totals shown for FY1983-84,
the last projection year, are as follows:
