                    The proposed Programmatic Development Loan is the last o f a programmatic series of
                    three DPLs intended to support the three mainpillars o f the government's development
                    plan: promoting equitable growth and strengthening the investment climate, enhancing

Objectives:         capacity for increased public spending inpriority sectors, and improvingpublic
                    expenditure transparency and management. Other key areas for growth identified in
                    education, health and nutrition, and rural economic infrastructure are supported within
                    the CAS program through investment operations, which buildon the ongoing portfolio o f
                    interventions inthese areas.
                    This final loanof the DPLprogramcontinues to focus on the three mainobjectives of the
                    government's development plan, but includes a strengthened component on financial
                     sector development. The analytical basis draws on findings set forth inthe CEM, PER,
Description:        DR-CAFTA studies, as well as the Investment Climate Assessment andFSAPupdate.
                    This operation continues to emphasize transparency and efficiency inpublic spending by
                    including follow up actions on public financial management and procurement to ensure
                     the gradual implementation of measuresas prescribed inthe CFAA and CPAR.
                     The Key benefits expectedfrom the program are:
                         Meeting fiscal and financial needs during a year of political transition. This
                         proposed loan would help meet the Government's objective of providing stable and
                         low cost financing as well as diversifying financing sources for its 2008 budget.
                         This, in turn, would support the Government's concurrent goals of maintaining
                         fiscal stability and addressing social needs through increased and more efficient
                         spending.
                         Improving the outlook for economic growth, enhanced governance, and poverty
Benefits:                reduction. The loan supports a broad agenda o f measures anchored around
                         Guatemala's efforts to increase growth, enhance governance, reduce poverty, deepen
                         financial markets as well as improve its trade and regional integration agenda,
                         including its participation in DR-CAFTA. The agenda includes key actions of
                         policy and institutional reforms to help ensure that Guatemala can fully benefit from
                         growth and the opportunities o f trade and greater integration into the world
                         economy. Key actions include measures to facilitate the expansion o f trade and
                         investment levels, enhancing the stability o f financial markets and access to credit,
                         improvements in the investment climate, addressing infrastructure investment and
                         services, and promoting innovation and technology.

                      Increasing the eficiency and transparency of public sector management. The loan
                      supports public sector modernizationefforts aimed at improving the efficiency o f
                      public expenditures, strengthening governance and fighting corruption with a
                      specific focus on government procurement and financial management.Efforts in
                      these areas are also expected to foster an environment more conducive to investment
                      and growth.
                   The sustainability of reforms in this DPL series are subject to four mainrisks:
                      Political, given the September 2007 elections and subsequentgovernment transition.
                      This riskis expected to be modest given that leading presidential candidates from
                      both sides of the political spectrum have expressedinterest insolidifying and
                      deepening progress on policy areas supported by the DPL series.
                      Societal tensions related to the country's post-conflict status, especially around
                      controversial areas like tax reform, continued trade liberalization, promotion of
                       increased private participation in infrastructure, and issues surrounding property
Risks:                rights and land
                      Exogenous shocks related to natural disasters, which could derail efforts to attract
                       investment and necessitateunanticipated spending for emergency assistance and
                      reconstruction
                      Macroeconomic risks due to external or domestic market volatility, (e.g., domestic
                       financial market risks, low commodity prices, persistently high oil prices, global
                      recession, unfavorable conditions infinancial markets) that could affect the
                       economy negatively.
                   These risks and mitigating measuresare explained in detail inSection IV part F.

                 THIRD BROAD-BASEDGROWTHDEVELOPMENTPOLICYLOAN

                                     I.COUNTRYCONTEXT

1.      With a multi-ethnic population of about 13 million and a per-capita GNI of about
US$2,610, Guatemala is the largest economy in Central America. While a source of cultural
strength and rich historical heritage, Guatemala's ethnic diversity has also unfortunately been
accompanied by a pattern of conflict and exclusion since colonial times. In the latter half of the
20th century, long-standing socio-political and economic tensions sparked a debilitating 36-year
civil war, which ended in 1996 with the signing of a set of Peace Accords between government
and guerrilla leaders, following protractednegotiations.
2.      The 1996 Peace Accords marked an important turning point in Guatemala's
development, both ending the civil war and setting out targets to reverse the country's
historically exclusionarypattern of social and economicdevelopment.The Accords set national
targets in four main areas: (i)resettlement, reincorporation and reconciliation, (ii)human
development, (iii)  productive and sustainable development, and (iv) modernization of the state
and improved governance. In the ten years since the signing of the Accords, progress towards
achievement of its goals has been uneven, with major gains in some areas (e.g., reductions in the
military, decentralization, coverage of social and basic services) but slower-than-hoped-for
progress in others (accelerating economic growth, raising tax revenues to 12 percent of GDP,
land registratiodredistribution and reducing crimehiolence).
3.      Largely as a result of the country's historical legacy, poverty and inequality are high
and social indicators (health, nutrition, education) are low relative to the country's average
income. About 56 percent of all Guatemalans lived in poverty in 2000 and about 16 percent in
extreme poverty, despite a decline in the late 1990s when growth rates reached 4 percent or
about 1.4 percent per capita on average. The Government, with analytical support from the Bank,
i s currently undertaking a new living standards measurement survey which will provide updated
poverty andwelfare statistics by late 2007.
4.      An important impediment to steady progress on growth, poverty reduction and
strengthening of public institutions since the Peace Accords has been the lack of political and
policy continuity. This, in turn, i s related to the short political cycle and social fragmentation-a
legacy of the country's colonial history and civil war. Presidents are elected for 4-year terms,
butbecauseof aconstitutional limit to a single term, positioningbyparties and candidates for the
next election begins early with obvious difficulties for passage of legislation sponsored by the
executive. There have been a number o f efforts to forge longer-term consensus on development
priorities and policies through national dialogues on key issues such as fiscal reform, the
MDGs/poverty reduction and land, but the impact of these has been limitedto date.
5.      Upcoming elections are in September 2007, but overall policy continuity is expected.
Leading presidential candidates from both sides of the political spectrum have expressed interest
in solidifying gains in economic growth, employment generation and stability, reducing poverty
and insecurity, and deepening progress on governance and transparency.

  11. ECONOMICCONTEXTANDRECENTMACROECONOMICPERFORMANCE

6.      Guatemala is currently experiencingitsfastest expansion since 1998, but development
challenges remain. Given Guatemala's high levels of poverty, inequality and poor social
indicators relative to average income, recent growth will needto be sustained along with ongoing
government efforts for targeted poverty spending. Inthe three years since implementation of the
country's development plan, the economy i s showing signs of strong recovery, albeit from very
low growth in prior years. The economic expansion reflects, inter alia, the rebound in the U S
economy, greater business confidence, prospects for increased trade (under DR-CAFTA and
enhanced regional integration), improved public sector transparency, and a reboundinthe prices
of traditional exports. Economic growth surpassed population growth for the first time in four
years in 2004 reaching 2.7 percent (0.2 percent in per capita terms). In2005 growth rose further
to 3.2 percent, despite high petroleum prices and extensive damage due to Tropical Storm Stan.
In 2006 growth accelerated to 4.6 percent and forecasts are for similar growth in the medium-
term (about 2 percent per capita annually). Sustained growth at current levels will be needed for
several years if h4DGtargets for poverty reduction are to be achieved.
7.     Private investmenthas increasedsubstantially,growing 13.7percent on average in real
terms during 2004-2006 and is expected to grow a further 12 percent in 2007. By contrast,
average growth in private investment during 2000-2003 was negative (-0.4 percent). The trend
inprivate investment is expected to continue over 2007 due to improvedbusiness confidence and
regulatory environment as well as the implementation of DR-CAFTA and additional free trade
agreements. According to Doing Business Report (DBR) 2007, Guatemala was one of the top
ten reformers in the world. The most dramatic improvement of business regulations in 2006 was
the decrease in the number of days to register property-from      69 in 2005 to 37 in 2006, which
was also accompanied by lower costs (from 3 to 1percent of property value). According to DBR
2007, Guatemala i s the easiest country inL A C to register a property.
8.      The long-run impact on poverty reduction of sustained average growth rates of 4-5
percent is likely to be significant. Calculations presented in the Bank's CEM indicate that in
order to reduce extreme poverty by half between 2000 and 2015 and thus accomplish the first of
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Guatemala needs to both improve its economic
growth and change the degree o f income inequality. Relying exclusively on growth to cut
poverty by half by 2015 would require an average annual per capita growth rate of 2.4 percent, a
goal that Guatemala has not been able to achieve inrecent years.
9.     Guatemala's external position remains stable and private capital inflows have
permitted the accumulation of international reserves. Despite the continued growth inimports,
the performance of exports as well as sustained higher inflows of remittances (an average o f 9.7
percent of GDP for the period 2004-06) contributed to a stable current account deficit of 4.4
percent of GDP between 2004 and 2006.            In 2006, international monetary reserves were
relatively stable at equivalent of 4.5 months of goods and services imports.
10.    Fiscal policy remained prudent in 2004-06 while monetary policy slowly tightened in
response to higher-than-anticipated inflution.        The prudent fiscal policy of successive
Guatemalan governments i s reflectedinone of the lowest public debt-to-GDP ratios inthe region
at 18.5 percent on average for the period 2004-06. Since taking office in January 2004, the
current administration has maintained fiscal discipline as illustrated by fiscal deficits of 1.4



                                                 2

percent of GDP in average duringthe period 2004-06. For 2007, a modest increase inthe budget
deficit to 1.9 percent i s projected.
11.     The Government has made modest progress in efforts to raise net tax revenues as a
share of GDP, due to political opposition, unfavorable constitutional court rulings on taxes,
and otherfactors. Net tax revenues stagnated at around 10 percent of GDP over the last five
years. Revised numbers for tax revenues indicate that these stood at 10.1 percent in 2004,
dipped to 9.6 percent o f GDP in2005 due to some one-off factors, and rose again to 10.2 percent
of GDP in 2006. In 2007, tax revenues are expected to increase to 10.4 percent of GDP as
economic growth continues and efforts for strengthened tax administration, including passage of
an Anti-Evasion Law with provisions, inter alia, for tax withholding, offset drops in tariffs
associated with DR-CAFTA. A recent IMF and Bank mission favorably evaluated the country's
tax administration efforts, given strong implementation of the country's              106-point tax
administration strategic plan and the Anti-Evasion Law. The multi-party Fiscal Pact has also
been revived in recent months in the hope of reaching agreement on a new tax package for
passageinearly 2008, which i s expected to raise tax revenues to at least the Peace Accords target
of 12percent of GDP.
12.     I n 2007, inflation is expected to remain around 6percent,just within the target range
set by the central bank (4-6percent). The monetary framework was strained in 2004-05 in the
face of: (i)the appreciation of the quetzal given the global weakening of the US dollar; (ii)
strong inflows of private capital and remittances; and (iii) cost-push from higher oil prices. In
                                                            the
this context, the authorities adopted a relatively accommodative monetary stance (despite a rise
in inflation to 9.2 percent by 2004) inan effort to contain second-round effects from the oil price
shock and to discourage additional capital inflows and further appreciation of the quetzal.
Towards the end of 2004 and in the 2005-06 period, the central bank began to implement
modest increases in interest rates, with the result that inflation came down to 8.6 percent by
2005, though still well above the target range of 6 (+/-1) percent. In 2006, inflation rate came
down further to 5.8 percent, within the target range, due to continued modest hikes in interest
rates as well a moderationin oil prices. In2007, inflation will likely stabilize at around 6 percent,
still within the a lower target range o f 5 (+/-l),oil price declines are not expected and
                                                  as further
monetary authorities remain concerned about providing adequate liquidity to the banking sector.
Nonetheless, the Central Bank i s expected to continue to increase interest rates during2007.
13.      Recent concerns over two domestic bank failures have accelerated efforts to enhance
financial market supervision and regulation. Guatemala's financial sector was recently put to a
difficult test with the suspension of the operations of two banks: (i)  Bancafe (the fourth largest
bank) in October 2006, due to non-compliance with legally-established prudential norms linked
to difficulties o f its offshore bank, and (ii)
                                             Banco de Comercio (a smaller bank) inJanuary 2007,
due to problems with its (previously undisclosed) offshore affiliate. The failure of these banks
highlighted some important vulnerabilities in the sector, especially the existence of unsupervised
intermediation. Both banks were resolved quickly and successfully, demonstrating the adequacy
of the legal and institutional framework. These were the first rapid resolution cases ever
implemented without going through liquidation and used the "Purchase and Assumption
mechanism'' established in the 2002 Banking Law. Since the failure of the two banks, domestic
financial markets have remained stable with no systemic runs. However, authorities are closely
monitoring the financial system and are accelerating reforms toward risk-based consolidated
supervision of financial conglomerates.         This includes: strengthening of the Banking

Superintendency (SIB) and the Central Bank, enhancing the effectiveness of the deposit
insurance scheme-FOPA and the Bank Capitalization Fund (FCB, which assists in resolution
processes), modernizing the payments system through the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)
system established in early 2006, and in drafting critical legislation (e.g. insurance and movable
collateral, which are pending approval in Congress).
14.     Despite banking sector shocks, improvements to Guatemala's sovereign and country
risk ratings were reaffirmed in 2007. This was due to, in large part, the successful and quick
resolution of the two failed banks. Fitch, which rated Guatemala for the first time in 2006,
assigned sovereign ratings of BB+ with a stable outlook based on the country's low external and
domestic public debt burden, the government's track record of fiscal discipline and moderate
inflation, as well as a solid commercial debt repayment history. In addition, S&P upgraded its
country risk rating to BB with stable outlook and Moody's changed the outlook on the
government's Ba2 foreign-currency bond rating to positive from stable.

            111. WORLDBANKCOUNTRYASSISTANCE STRATEGY(CAS)

15.     The Bank's CASfor Guatemala, covering the period FYOS-08, was developed within
the government's development plan, and represents a satisfactory framework for moving
forward the Bank's core objectives of (i) reducing poverty and inequality; and (ii)fostering
sustained, equitable growth. The recently completed CAS Progress Report for Guatemala,
(discussed by the World Bank Executive Board on March 15, 2007) concludes that, with one
exception (raising tax revenues), the country has made strong progress in achieving desired
outcomes in the strategic areas identified, with performance meeting, or even exceeding CAS
targets in many cases. The Executive Board reaffirmed that Guatemala i s currently at the high
end of the base case of the CAS, under which expected lending to Guatemala, including the
proposedDPLI11o f US$lOO million, would be about US$611 million over the CAS period.
 16.    There is a strong congruence between the principal outcomes of the DPL series and
those in the CAS resultsframework. Country commitment and progress on the development
objectives warrant proceeding with the final loan in the programmatic series.            Progress
includes: (i) the government's persistent efforts, in the face of a difficult political context, to
strengthen tax administration, raise public revenues and to lay the groundwork for future
increases in taxes through developing political and social consensus on public investment goals
and priorities; (ii)
                   despite the lack of progress in raising the tax ratio, the government has been
able to achieve its objective of increasing pro-poor social spending as a share o f GDP within a
framework of fiscal prudence, by making difficult cuts in military and administrative spending
and reallocation of existing resources; (iii)the strong progress in nearly all areas of the DPL,
with performance exceeding expectations in key areas such as improved governance and
transparency; and (iv) much stronger progress made in the area of enhancing financial sector
stability inthe wake of two bank failures inOctober 2006 and January 2007.
 17.    Thefollowing sections of this document lay out theprogramfor broad-basedgrowth to
be supported by the DPL series, with special reference to the third loan (for US$lOO million).
The quick-disbursing support provided through the DPL series i s synchronized with the
government's annual budget cycle and would enable the Government to reduce its external
financing costs by partially replacing higher cost bonds issued in the international capital
markets. The design of the DPL series draws on an extensive body of recent analytical work
undertaken by the Bank. Chief among these are the 2003 Guatemala Poverty Assessment
(GUAPA), the CEM (2004) the Investment Climate Assessment (2004), the regional DR-
CAFTA Study (2005), the Public Expenditure Review (2005) andjoint CFAA-CPAR (2005).

A.      PROGRESSINTHE BROAD-BASEDGROWTH             AGENDA

 18.    Guatemalahas made steady progress in promoting more equitable, broad-basedgrowth
in areas supported by thisDPL series. Given the design of the Bank's CAS and the DPLseries
within the country's own development plan, there i s strong client ownership in all development
policy objectives supported by the DPL agenda. These areas include:

 the substantial body of analytical work carried out by the Bank in partnership with the
 Government of Guatemala (See Box A), the design o f key prior actions, triggers and indicators
 for DPL I11supports progress in each of the above three main areas. The primary analytical
 underpinnings, policy objectives, and development constraints remain highly relevant to those
 identified by the precedingDPLs in this programmatic series. Consequently, this section focuses
 more on the recent trajectory of the program, rather than the entire program's rationale. An in-
 depth discussion of the components of program i s presented in the Annex.

 20.      The focus of this third loan is on full implementation of many of the policy and
 legislative reforms undertakento date as well as strengthening of thefinancial sector in areas
 critical to achievement of the DPL program's specified results. The emphasis on
 implementation and sustainability rather than legislative actions also reflects recognition of the
 reality that the already-complex process of getting Congressional approval for new legislation i s
 more difficult in this election year. With this in mind, the DPLprogram i s designed with a focus
 on actions which contribute substantially to program objectives but remain under the control of
 the Executive.

21.     The DPL program remains on track, with solid progress in each of the three main
areas of the agenda. Table 2 below provides a summary of prior actions inDPLs Iand 11, and a
comparison of the original triggers for DPL I11(as laid out inthe DPLI1document) and the prior
actions now proposed for the DPL I11 operation. As the table shows, there has been strong
momentum in all areas o f the DPL program with most of the original triggers either fully met as
anticipated when DPL I1 was presented to the Board or surpassed. Original triggers were
exceeded in areas related to improved transparency and efficiency o f public resource use and in
tax administration. In addition, new prior actions have been added inthe area of financial sector
supervision reflecting the strong country response to recent difficulties in this sector. These
additional financial sector policy actions include, among others: (i) successful resolution of two
failed banks (Bancafe and Banco de Comercio); (ii)oversight powers granted to the Bank
Superintendency to review working documents of external auditors; (iii)    improvements in credit
registry data; and (iv) creation of a financial crimes investigation unit in the Banlung
Superintendency.
22.     I n cases where the initial triggersare not likely to be met, substituteprior actions have
been specified under the same development objective. With regard to strengthening of the
regulatory body (DNCAE) by developing tools for regulatory management (i.e., procedural
manuals, standard bidding documents, etc), this has not been achieved due to expected
enhancements to the law which would make the tools obsolete. As a result, substitute prior
actions have been introduced in the area of public expenditure transparency and management
(concerning expansion of SIAF's integration with Guatecompras) that are equal to or exceed the
policy impact of the triggers originally proposed.
23.     To clarih policy advances, the trigger detailing aviation security enhancementsat the
Aurora International Airport has been adjusted. Guatemala has successfully passed an audit
and has received final certification for Category 1classification under the International Aviation
Safety Assessment.This enables direct flights (both cargo and passenger) to U.S. destinations by
Guatemalan carriers thereby enhancing competitiveness by facilitating tourism and the transport
of Guatemalan exports. Overall progress in upgrading safety standards for the L a Aurora Airport
i s impressive and i s expected to be completed in November 2007. In terms of facilitating future
private participation in infrastructure, the DGAC has prepared three bills: (i) a new law for the
creation of an autonomous airport authority, (ii)a new law for the creation of a state-owned
airport operating company, and (iii)    a revised Civil Aviation Code to accommodate the new
laws. These laws are currently being reviewed by a parliamentary commission on transport.

24.      The country has made significantprogress in achievingexpected mid-term outcomes in
those areas of Guatemala'sdevelopmentplan supported by the DPL series. As shown inTable
3, many of the mid-tern results outcomes expected for end-2007 have already been achieved or
surpassed. Social expenditure as a share of GDP has grown in recent years and i s expected to
increase to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2007, but may not reach 6.0 percent o f GDP by end-2007 as
anticipated in the mid-term outcomes. Since 2004, the government reduced by one-third the size
of the militarybudget andbegan a step-wise effort to direct a greater share of the budget to social
programs. Social expenditures (Peace Accords definition2) rose from 4.9 percent o f GDP in
2004, to 5.3 percent in 2005, 5.4 percent in 2006, and 5.8 percent has been budgeted for 2007.
While the growth in 2006 social expenditures looks modest, this was primarily the result of
upward revisions to GDP, which reduced the ratio of social expenditures to GDP. In real terms,
social expenditures still grew 8.3 percent in2006 and i s expected grow 10.5 percent in 2007 (see
paragraph 62 in the Annex 1). Social sector spending now accounts over half o f total revenues
and almost half of total public spending. Around 78 percent o f the increase in social spending
has been directed to education (excluding tertiary level), health and social assistance. The effort
to reorder expenditure priorities i s particularly notable in light of the high proportion (about 41
percent) of legally mandated earmarks, which leave very little room for maneuver.
25.      Tax collectionas a share of GDP has grown in recent years, but may not reach the 11
percent of GDP expected outcome by end-2007. Nonetheless, the government made strong
efforts and significant improvements in tax administration, and as described above, has made
substantial progress in achieving the primary objective of increased tax collection, to improve
social spending (see paragraph 11 above and Section IIin Annex 1 for a detailed discussion of
progress on the tax issue). In terms of enhanced property rightsthrough the cadastral survey and
land titling, while over 33 percent o f the national territory i s titled and registered, from less than
3 percent in 2005-which         meets the expected outcome-the           cadastral survey o f the country has
reached about 37 percent of the territory, as opposed to the expected outcome of 50 percent by
end-2007. Support for cadastral surveying through the recently approved Land Administration I1
project, an increase in the number of registrars, the implementation of an electronic registration
system, and a decrease in the time to register property should accelerate the process, but it is
uncertain as to whether the expected outcome for the cadastral survey will be met.




2. The PeaceAccords definition of public social spending i s a unique measureof social spending and differs from
    the IMF's methodology as defined in the 2001 Manual on Government Financial Statistics. Using the I M F ' s
    methodology for calculating total social spending o f the public non-financial sector, Guatemala's level would
    reach 8.7 percent of GDP in 2005, higher than the 5.3 percent using the Peace Accords definition. While
    Guatemala's spending still ranks low compared to other countries in the region when using the IMFdefinition,
    the gap i s much smaller than when using the PeaceAccord definition.

B.      FIDUCIARYASPECTS
26.     The 2005 Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFAA/CPAR)-updated                      in March 2007-
indicates that theJiduciury environment in Guatemala is generally adequate, as evidenced by
the improvements in the public expenditure management systems made over the previous decade
and the actions being taken by the current administration to continue to increase transparency.
Indeed, as described indetail inprevious sections o f the report, the government has shown strong
commitment to the tackling o f fiduciary issues and surpassedtargets inmany key areas identified
by the Country Fiduciary Assessment. Drawingfrom this work, certain key actions and selective
milestones in the context of the DPL program have been identified to help track the public
financial management reform progress. The latter, in turn, are significantly supported by the
Bank-financed Third Integrated Financial Management Project under implementation. The
foreign exchange control environment o f the Central Bank i s adequate and, subsequent to the
IMF Assessment Report (2002), external auditing is in now in place and international foreign
currency reserves are managed according to prudent international practice.
C.      LOAN   ADMINISTRATION
27.     The Bank would disburse the loan proceeds into an account of the central bank
(BANGUAT) denominated in US d01lars.~BANGUAT will immediately credit the disbursed
amounts to the Ministry of Finance Treasury Single Account ("common fund"), thus becoming
available to finance budgeted expenditures. Within a week of this operation, the Ministry will
accordingly provide the Bank with a written confirmation.

D.      MONITORING EVALUATION
                        AND                  ARRANGEMENTS
28.     The Bank i s providing ongoing support for government and civil society activities to help
build capacity to evaluate information, increase transparency, and build public sector
accountability. The government and the Bank will take advantage o f several important data
sources to assess progress and development impact of the DPL, including:
                Central and nonfinancial public sector budget monitoring from the Ministry o f
                Finance
                National Institute for Statistics reports, including a living standards survey
                planned for 2007, and annual tracking surveys

Box B. Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1:Reinforce Ownership
The operation was developed within the objectives of the 1996peace accords and the government's development
plan, which establishes clear priorities developed through wide consultation with stakeholders and annual
agreementbroader civil society. The priority legislative agenda is developed inconsultation with the
Congressional leadership on an annual basis. Bank support focuses on promoting equitable growth and
strengthening the investment climate, enhancing capacity for increased public spending inpriority sectors, and
improving public expenditure transparency and management. These focus areas have all benefited from broad
political support. The DPL series is strongly underpinned by prior analytical and fiduciary work, including the
Poverty Assessment (2003), Investment Climate Assessment (2004), Country Economic Memorandum (2005),
Public ExpenditureReview (2005), the regional DR-CAFTA study (2005), C F M C P A R (2005, updated 2007)
and Financial Sector AssessmentProgram (2007).

Principle2: Agree upfront with thegovernment and otherjinanciulpartners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The Bank's support i s summarized ina brief and focused policy matrix. Currently, only the Bank, BCIE and the
IDB are providing budget support to Guatemala. All three institutions draw on the country's development plan,
thereby ensuring coordination among them and consistency of support. Inparticular all three institutions have
supported enhancedpublic financial management, progress in social sector expenditures, and improved
competitiveness.

Principle 3: Customizethe accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
Inaddition to supporting the government's development of its integrated financial management system (SIAF)
and e-procurement system (Guatecompras), the Bank is also providing ongoing support for civil society activities
to help build capacity to evaluate government information, increase transparency, and build public sector
accountability. The Bank has been working closely with donor groups (e.g., USAID, IADB, UNDP,Norway,
Dutch) on enhancing governance, as well as supporting various dialogues on social auditing with a range of civil
society organizations.
Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
The Bank's policy matrix uses a limited set of prior actions (9 in DPL 1, 15 inDPL2 and 10in DPL 3). They
address key development policies including actions inpromoting equitable growth and strengthening the
investment climate, enhancing capacity for increased public spending inpriority sectors, and improving public
expenditure transparency and management

Principle5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducivetopredictableandperformance-based jinanciul
support
As agreedwith the government, this programmatic DPL series consists of three single-tranche operations, timed
to the country's budget cycle, with each operation evaluated and monitored for results. This process allows for a
predictable releaseof the tranche during each fiscal year, allowing incorporation o f financing into the subsequent
year's budget. The policy matrix contains a range of outcome indicators (14), which are assessed as part of the
operation implementation and are closely linked to the supported policy actions.


E.        CONSULTATION AND DISTRIBUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL   AND                           IMPACT
29.       TheDPL series has been developed within theframework of the country's development
plan, which was widely consulted and disseminated within the country with a view to
informing the assessment of the program's distributional effects.                      Specific laws, institutional
reforms and programmatic actions supported by the loan series were (and are) also discussed
widely with different groups, including civil society organizations, the private sector and the
research and academic community. A PHRD grant for the DPL series supported by the Japanese
Government has included a series o f consultations and studies on key issues such as social needs



                                                          22

and tax reform, sectoral impacts of CAFTA, improved efficiency of procurement, and public-
private alliances in infrastructurewhich were discussed at workshops at the national and regional
levels. With respect to improvements in business climate, including customs reforms, reduction
of red tape etc., consultations have occurred through the PRONACOM expanded committee,
which includes representatives of diverse constituencies. In addition, workshops have been held
for members of Congress, which have increased the understanding of the nature o f Bank support
through DPLs and their main features
30.     The Bank is also providing ongoing support for civil society activities to help build
capacity to evaluate government information, increase transparency, and build public sector
accountability. The Bank has been working closely with donor groups (e.g., USAID, IADB,
UNDP, Norway, Dutch) on enhancing governance, as well as supporting various dialogues on
social auditing with a range of civil society organizations including: CoaZici6n por la
Transparencia(a group of CSOs engaged in social auditing in Guatemala), Accibn Ciudadana
(the national chapter of Transparency International), CZEN (a domestic think tank), and the
Guatemala Chamber of Commerce. In addition, the World Bank Institute (WBI) is supporting a
regional initiative to strengthen social auditing in Central America, which i s being supported by
the DPLteam as complement to other consultation activities. This i s an initiative aimed notjust
to share the experiences, but to build a regional network formed by national civil society groups
involved with public expenditure monitoring as a way to strengthen the groups' work in their
respective countries.    As a result of these activities in Guatemala, the Ministry of Finance is
formulating a program of training for civil society about the budget process and i s providing
experts from the Ministry to educate groups on specialized budget topics.
31.     Theactions supported by this DPL are expected to havepositive distributionalimpacts.
To the extent that the measures supported by the DPL series have played a role in Government's
ability to enhance social spending levels, their impact on income distribution i s expected to be
positive. This is confirmed by public expenditure incidence analysis undertaken in the context of
the GUAPA which indicates that public social expenditures (Peace Accords definition) are
generally pro-poor.     Likewise, a FY 05 PSIA on the distributive impact of fiscal reforms
supported by the DPL series, found the reforms to be mildly progressive. With respect to the
social impact o f CAFTA, the Bank's regional report "DR-CAFTA: Challenges and Opportunities
for Central America" found that about 84 percent of the Guatemalan population are net
consumers who would benefit from price reductions as a result of increased competition. A
follow-up PSIA, focused on analyzing the impact of DR-CAFTA on the indigenous population,
found that an average gain in consumption of all income groups (including the poor) would be on
the order o f 15 percent. The PSIA found that even households engaged in maize production
would benefit from DR-CAFTA because of consumption gains on other necessities and because
maize price declines would be mitigated by the white maize exception included inthe treaty. As
a result o f the exception, white maize prices would likely fall by 19 percent over time rather than
by 38 percent (without the exception). Nonetheless, to the extent that a small minority of maize
producers could be adversely affected by the gradual decline in maize prices, possible mitigating
measures would be part of the policy dialogue for future Bank interventions in Guatemala. In
terms of the resolution of two Banks, the distributional impact i s not expected to be adverse for
the poor as no deposits were lost in the resolution and the deposit insurance fund, FOPA, helped
to offset the costs. However, if the Banks had not been resolved and a generalized financial




                                                 23

crisis ensued, the distributional effects most likely would have been negative as the poor are less
diversified and not as able to adjust to the economic ~olatility.~


Box C: Guatemala Country EnvironmentalAnalysis-Findings                      and New Developments
Guatemala has made important efforts aimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability o f the country's development
program through systematic attention to environmental considerations. Despite some institutional and legal
improvements, Guatemala still faces considerable environmental challenges, including: i)over-exploitation of water
resources; ii)water pollution; iii)deforestation; iv) soil and land degradation; and v) vulnerability to natural disasters.
Given the new challenges facing the country with the signing o f DR-CAFTA and the proposed scaling-up of
infrastructure investments, there is a need to accelerate consolidation of institutional and organizational tasks in
Guatemala.
         The report concluded that if MARNconcentrates on its core functions such as planning and application of
environmental policy, enforcing of environmental regulation; and works in coordination with other environmental
agencies, ministries, and municipalities, most of these challenges can be met ina short time with minor adjustments to
the existing framework of environmental management. Three important issues to address are for example: i)
establishment of a cohesive and coordinated environmental framework, ii)improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
the Environmental Impact Assessment system (EIA) while introducing the use of other tools (Le. Strategic
Environmental Analysis); and iii)promote compliance with environmental law. Since the dissemination o f the CEA
some positive developments have occurred: i)the approval of the National Environmental Policy by the cabinet and the
President; ii)the supplementary allocation of Q5 million to MARN; iii)the expansion and consolidation of initiatives
such as the environmental laboratories (with a possible further expansion to the Central American region); and (iv)
establishment o f a donor roundtable on environmental issues led by MAFW which is seeking to prioritize and
harmonize environmental initiatives, guided inpart by the priorities established inthe CEA.

         The report also emphasizes the need to provide a more flexible and efficient regulation that nevertheless
provides strong incentives for polluters to change their ways. Market based instruments such as pollution taxeskharges
could be introduced in a gradual manner pending the implementation o f a reasonable and acceptable monitoring and
enforcement mechanism. The right incentives would also include engaging civil society by improving information and
participation mechanisms. In the long term, deeper reforms to the legal framework for water and transparency would
be needed, but they need longer periods o f maturation, consensus building, and negotiations, and ultimately
congressional approval.




32.      The specific policies supported by this DPL operation are not expected to entail
significant impacts on the environment, forests or other natural resources. However, to the
extent that measures supported by the DPL program are successful, over time, in attracting new
investment (including in infrastructure) and trade expansion, there will be a need to strengthen
Guatemala's national institutional capacity to identify and address environmental policy and
regulatory issues. With this in mind, a Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) was undertaken
in 2005-2006 (Box C) and discussed with the Government. The CEA provides cost effective
recommendations for closing gaps in institutional capacity for environmental regulation. The
Government publicly acknowledged the usefulness of most of the CEA analysis and
recommendations and has requested the Bank's assistance to support its implementation. As a
first step, the CEA conclusions and recommendations helped to prepare the ground to obtain the
cabinet's endorsement and the presidential approval o f the National Environmental Policy
(Politica de Consewacio'n,Proteccidn y Mejoramiento del Ambiente y 10s Recursos Naturales).

In addition, the Government has allocated a supplementary Q5 million to MARN in the 2007
budget to strengthen its capacity for environmental monitoring. The Bank is also involved, at
Government's request, in a commission formed to raise additional funds for this purpose from
donor sources.


F.      RISKS
33.     Continued sustainability of the program is subject to four main risks during the
implementation of the DPL series: (i)    political risks, given this i s a year o f political transition
for the government, (ii)societal tensions related to the country's post-conflict status, (iii)
exogenous shocks related to natural disasters, and (iv) macroeconomic risks due to external or
domestic market volatility. These are described below.
34.     Political risk is inherent in a post-conflict situation such as Guatemala's, where there
continues to be deep fissures within society, the electorate is very polarized and the
Government lacks a simple majority in Congress. This year will be especially challenging in
this regard, as campaigning for the next election (in September 2007) has begun and the
deepening of policies supported under the DPL program remains to be confirmed under a new
administration. Nonetheless, the DPL I11 i s particularly well suited for managing the risks
inherent in Guatemala's difficult political and social context.          The focus in DPL I11 on
implementation of legislative reforms undertaken in DPLs Iand I1helps to reduce risks from the
political environment going forward. Moreover, the DPL I11 is being prepared for the
Government's September 2007 budget proposal to Congress, and, as such, disbursement would
not occur before January 2008, thus serving to mitigate risks of policy slippage associated with
the September/November elections. Finally, leading presidential candidates from both sides o f
the political spectrum have expressed interest in solidifying gains in many areas supported by the
DPL series, including policies for economic growth, employment generation and stability,
reducing poverty and insecurity, and deepening progress on governance and transparency.
35.     Especially controversial is the tax reform agenda which is strongly opposed for
different reasons by powerful interests on both the right and the left and subject to the decisions
of the Constitutional Court (CC). Government's focus has been on promoting laws aimed at
combating evasion which, as previously noted, have helped to achieve modest increases in
revenues. It i s also attempting to address the issue through shifting the focus of the public
dialogue on social needs, their costs and the revenue requirements o f meeting them, while also
reactivating the fiscal pact. Political as well as social tensions also arise in other controversial
areas including trade liberalization and promotion of increased private participation in
infrastructure, and issues surrounding property rights and land, all of which are crucial to
accelerating growth and are central to the Government's agenda. Inthe run-up to the presidential
elections, the Bank is preparing a set of policy notes and i s engaged in dialogue with all relevant
stakeholders on the development challenges of the country, including the taxation issue, as a
means to underpin a political consensus on the need to enhance the tax effort necessary to
finance Guatemala's development needs more adequately.
36.     Besides political and social risks, Guatemala is also susceptible to external risks
derivingfrom natural phenomena. As with the other Central American countries, Guatemala i s
vulnerable to natural disasters (hurricanes, and seismic or volcanic activity) which could
necessitate unanticipated spending for emergency assistance and reconstruction, thereby


                                                 25

affecting achievement of established development goals in the short term. Experience with
Tropical Storm Stan shows, however, that fiscal discipline has been a high priority even in the
face of an emergency
37.     The main macro-economic risks derive from the financial sector and the external
environment. The financial sector, though stronger than in the past, needs to be further
strengthened through consolidation, improved provisioning and better supervision and
assessment of risk. There has been strong commitment in Guatemala to tackle financial sector
vulnerabilities since the 1998 banking crisis and, as noted earlier, steady progress in reforming
the sector has been made with support from the Bank and the IMF (through the FSAP program
and two complementary financial sector operations). The DPL series' focus on strengthening
risk-based supervision i s also expected to have a positive impact. Recent events involving the
intervention and resolution of two banks have highlighted some of the remaining vulnerabilities
inthe banking sector, which the authorities are now addressing. Reporteddata show an increase
in bank deposits following the resolution of the two banks. However, while confidence in the
banking sector remains a risk, it i s mitigated to a large degree by ongoing financial sector
monitoring, supported by technical assistancebeing provided by the Bank andFund. Inaddition,
there remains the threat of shocks from the external economic environment (e.g., low commodity
prices, persistently high oil prices, a slow-down in the U S economy, unfavorable conditions in
financial markets) that could negatively affect Guatemala's ability to sustain current (higher)
growth rates.

    ANNEX 1:POLICYPROGRESS ONKEYAREAS SUPPORTEDBYDPLSERIES

38.     Besides maintaining macroeconomicstability, Guatemala's key challenges in restoring
broad-basedgrowth are: (i)  taking advantage o f expanding trade opportunities and ensuring that
SMEs can share in those opportunities, (ii)strengthening the climate for both domestic and
foreign investment and business, (iii) modernizing property rights, (iv) addressing infrastructure
bottlenecks to growth, (v) continuing to strengthen and deepen the financial sector, (vi)
enhancing the capacity for efficient and effective poverty-oriented public spending-especially
for education and health, and (vii) strengthening public sector management and transparency.
The principal issues and government plans with respect to each of these areas are discussed
further below in some depth as they form the background to the specific actions supported by
this DPLseries. For ease of reference they are organizedinthe same order as they appear inthe
DPL matrix. Controlling the high levels of crime and violence is another key element of the
effort to promote growth (as well as security) in Guatemala. Issues inthis area are not described
here as they lie beyond the scope of this DPL operation. It should be noted, however, that
Government i s currently working with a number of bilateral donors (including Japan, Spain and
USA) to implement an integrated strategy to address this problem, within a regional context.


 I. PROMOTINGEQUITABLE            GROWTH     AND STRENGTHENINGTHE INVESTMENTCLIMATE

1.1. Promotionof Trade Expansion

39.     Thegovernment regards international trade expansion as a principal driver of growth
in Guatemala in the short- to medium-term and has expended considerable political and
institutional capital on expanding trade and investment opportunities. The Guatemalan
Congress ratified the US-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement-DR-
CAFTA-in     March 2005 (a prior action for DPL I).     Over the past year, the focus has been on
passing the CAFTA Implementation Law, an omnibus law involving amendments to existing
legislation in a number of areas related to CAFTA provisions. Following a tough set of
negotiations initially with USTR and subsequently with domestic interest groups and
congressional blocs, the CAFTA implementation law was finally approved in early June 2006
and CAFTA became effective on July 1, 2006. Free trade agreements are now also in place with
Mexico and Taiwan, and free trade discussions with Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia and the
European Union are ongoing. To ensure that information about the opportunities opened up by
the new agreements is widely disseminated and to help Guatemalan businesses understand
requirements to access international markets, the Government has established an FTA
Management and Trade Compliance Office. It has also taken steps to facilitate and promote
foreign investment and support quality improvements in Guatemalan products, as discussed
further below. Since DR-CAFTA came into effect on July 1,2006 up to February 2007, exports
have grown 19.8 percent, compared to 11.5 percent over the same period a year earlier. Foreign
direct investment (FDI) increased about 56 percent in 2006 to US$325 million from US$208
million in 2005. A similar or greater increase i s expected in 2007.
40.     Guatemala is also spearheading regional integration efforts within Central America,
with steps already being taken towards a Central America customs union, through the
harmonizing and simpliJication of customs procedures with neighboring countries, most


                                                 27

notably El Salvador and Honduras. Specific achievements to date in this area include: (i)
harmonization of about 95 percent of customs duties among all Central American countries-
with work ongoing for the remainder; (ii)use of identical customs forms (FAUCAS) by
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador; (iii)reduction of customs clearance times to 2 hours
(against 1-2 days previously) for air and road cargo between Guatemala, El Salvador and
Honduras through adoption of an electronic filing system and a reduction in physical inspections
for goods originating in these cooperating countries; (iv) implementation o f a pilot scheme to
eliminate customs inspections at the national borders for goods cleared through specified Central
American border entry points; and (v) provision for customs inspections by other Central
American countries at elected regional ports and border^.^
41.
support from the Bank, indicate that the net effects of DR-CAFTA on the poor and on the
        Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSZA) conducted in 2005 and 2006, with

indigenouspopulation broadly would be positive. On average, a typical indigenous household
would enjoy gains of nearly 15 percent of its average per capita expenditure, with consumption
gains dominating income losses. Even though maize prices decline over time and this hurts
producers, these losses are more than compensated by consumption gains on clothing, yellow
maize, other cereals and dairy. It should be noted that the white maize exception in CAFTA
provides some protection to producers. An important finding i s that further significant gains can
be realized by the poor if the export opportunities brought by CAFTA in agricultural activities
and manufacturing employment are complemented by domestic reforms aimed at facilitating
production andtrade.
42.     The government strategy for trade expansion assigns a central role to ensuring that the
benefits of new trade opportunities are accessible to SMEs, both directly through access to
export markets and indirectly by developing strategic linkages with foreign and local exporting
companies. This effort i s being supported through the Rural Economic Program operation which
assists rural cooperatives to form production/TA and marketing linkages with larger formal
sector businesses. In addition, the National Commission for Competitiveness (PRONACOM) has
supported the establishment o f networks of SME entrepreneurs (the "grupos gestores")
throughout the country.      It i s also supporting improved availability of market intelligence,
including data on export contacts, via a joint program with the National Institute of Statistics
(INE). Special efforts are being made to reach out to indigenous entrepreneurs through the
Association of Mayan Entrepreneurs and support to CECMA to create an Indigenous
Competitiveness Research Center.             Finally, a network of "infocenters",             with internet
connectivity, i s being established to disseminate information throughout the country, in part with
assistance from the Bank's Rural Economic Program operation approved in 2006.                           The
infocenters are expected to act as important focal points for support to SMEs outside the capital
city.
43.     To assist low income farmers and laborers (especially those involved with maize
production) to shi# away from traditional livelihoods, the government has also launched an
initiative to promote alternative employment in non-traditional agriculture, sustainable forestry
and off-farm activities in sectors such as tourism and agribusiness. Inpartnershipwith the private
banking sector and groups such as the non-traditional exporters association, Agexport, the


5  These include Tecun Uman, Puerto Quetzal, Puerto Santo Tomas and Puerto Barrios in Guatemala, Puerto
   Cortes inHonduras, Puerto Cutuco and Puerto de Acajutla inEl Salvador, and PenasBlancas in Nicaragua.


                                                    28

initiative combines technical assistance and marketing help for micro, small and medium rural
producers with improved access to finance via the commercial banking system, through the
provision of a Government guarantee. The initiative i s being supported by USAID and other
donors. The IDB-, Sweden-, and World Bank-supported Rural Economic Program i s also aimed
at strengthening rural cooperatives to take advantage of opportunities created by trade expansion
agreements.


1.2. PromotingInvestment andBusinessEfficiency

44.      While Guatemala still has a long way to go in improving the overall business climate,
there have been some notable achievements in reducing the costs of doing business over the
past 3years-an importantfactor in assisting SMEs in particular. Indeed, the DoingBusiness
Report 2007 identified Guatemala as one of 10top reformers world-wide for i)reduction in time
to open a business, ii)ease of registering a property, and iii)licensing. One important
achievement has been the implementation of a lower time limit for customs processing, from 4 to
2 days. If the required time expires and the cargo is not cleared, the trader can go to the
warehouse and claim it. There has also been a reduction in discretionality and "red lights" in
customs, through adoption of a new risk based system for inspections, which relies on objective
risk profiles such as type of import, place of origin, product type etc). On the basis of this
system, the number of physical inspections of cargo has been falling steadily to levels more
consistent with international practice-from   physical inspection of about 81percent of imports
in January 2005 to about 40 percent in 2006. A second major initiative has been the recent
establishment of a "one-stop shop" for business start-ups allowing prospective firms to apply for
company, tax and social security registration in one step and check the status of their applications
on line, with help services provided through a chat line. One-stop shop for business registration
i s fully operational. One-stop shop for business registration is fully operational. Registrations
for commercial enterprises (empresas mercantiles) usually take less than 24 hours and
registrations for corporations (sociedades anhimas) about 11 days. The number of registered
business increased 12percent in 2006, compared to 2 percent in 2005.
45.      Another area in which progress is apparent is the promotion of foreign direct
investment (FDZ). A newly-established agency, Invest in Guatemala (IIG), leads this effort with
assistance from MIGA and the Bank's Competitiveness project.             The agency has begun
implementing its promotion strategy which highlights investments in light manufacturing,
tourism, call centershusiness process outsourcing and agribusiness. The strategy outlines targets
for new investments, job creation, indirect employment, and the expected impact of these FDI
flows on exports. IIG i s now seeking to effectively measure the amount o f local value added.
This will set a benchmark to implement programs that increase linkages between the local
private sector and international investors operating in Guatemala to provide goods and services
that further increase local value added. IIG can already point to a number of successes in
attracting foreign investments since it became fully operational about two and a half years ago (a
prior action for DPL I), IIG has been instrumental in attracting about US$475 million in FDIto
Guatemala, involving the creation of 14,500 new jobs. Government has also sought to increase
the operating autonomy o f IIG, through a partnership with a reputable private sector foundation,
FUNDESA, operating in Guatemala.




                                                29

46.      To ensure institutional coordination in the competitiveness area, the Government has
created an Offlce of the Presidential Commissionerfor the Promotion of National Investment
and Competitiveness (Pronacom) and maintains a system of monthly meetings between
Pronacom, the Ministry of Economy, and representatives of the private sector, universities and
civil society, to review and monitor work plans and progress achieved. Pronacom i s part o f a
Central American network of government competitiveness agencies, allowing the region to
coordinate closely as it faces the challenges presented by the DR-CAFTA agreement.                In
carrying out its mandate, Pronacomhas developed a strategy o f alliances with key local partners
such as Agexport and the tourism sector as well as close connections with regional and
international institutions such as INCAE, the USDA, the World Bank Group and the UNsystem.
Thus far, Pronacom is holding itself to a high standard of performance, with concrete indicators
inpriority areas for the private sector andDR-CAFTA.
47.      The adoption of new technologies and promoting innovation are key elements of the
Guatemalan Government's effort to increase the productivity of Guatemalan businesses. In
addition to the appointment of a Presidential Commissioner for Science and Technology, the
Government has established a program linking universities and research centers with the private
sector in order to stimulate the research and development process. Another priority since 2004
has been the reform of the national training system, led by INTECAP, as a means o f raising the
skills level of the labor force. In this regard, some pilot programs have been implemented in the
past year under which INTECAP acts as a regulator and certifier of training programs organized
and implemented by the private sector, rather than providing the training directly as it has
traditionally done. Depending on the success of these pilots, the end-goal i s to transform
INTECAP's role from training provider to regulator in the medium-term. A third initiative has
been to reorient the focus of the Council of Science and Technology towards improved
technological diffusion among small- and medium-sized enterprises and to expand the role o f the
private sector in its advisory board. In addition, a system of incentives has been established to
promote the acquisition of new technology via capital goods purchases, technology licensing
arrangements and other appropriate mechanisms.
48.      Fundamental to Guatemala's growth agenda-as well as to the achievement of
increased social solidarity and a better business climate-is     the establishment of secure rights
to land. Over the past several years, considerable progress has been made on cadastral surveying
and regularization of land-largely     inurban, but also inrural, areas where most poor households
live. Until 2004, however, this progress was threatened by limited titling and the transitory
nature of the institutional framework.       An example is the Department of PetCn, where the
cadastral work was substantially completed by early 2005 but only about a quarter of land
parcels surveyed had been titled and registered, reflecting both the institutional weaknesses o f
the titling entities (municipalities for urban, andFONTIERRAS for rural, land) and the transitory
nature of the cadastral process. With the aim of rectifying these problems, Government, in 2005,
passed a modem law of cadastre and land registry which, inter alia, establishes an autonomous,
unified registry and cadastral office (Registro de Informacidn Catastral-RIC)        outside o f the
court system, and increases the transparency and accountability o f the RIC through establishment
of an independent Board with members representing different societal interests. Since passage of
the law, the new Registry has been established, it's board installed, and a new, independently-
selected, director appointed. Moreover, over the past year or so, the time to register property fell
by almost two weeks due to an increase in the number of registrars from 3 to 14 and full
implementation o f an electronic registration system. The RIC i s now establishing physical maps


                                                  30

of all properties which will help resolve cases of overlapping property titles.           The Bank's
ongoing LandAdministration project i s supporting these efforts.
1.3.    Strengthening Infrastructurethrough Private Sector Participation

49.     On the supply side of the economy, the Government's growth strategy places strong

investments in infrastructure (roads, ports and airports, telecommunication and ICTs and
emphasis on public-private partnerships for both financing and implementation of

renewable energy). As a first priority, the Government has promoted a series o f large
infrastructure projects in the transport sector to be implemented via public private partnerships.
These include: link roads in the northern and Pacific corridors, a link road connecting the
Atlantic and Pacific ports and a partial metropolitan beltway for Guatemala City .To establish a
clear legal basis for this effort, the Government presented a framework law for public-private
partnerships to the Congress in 2005 as well as specific laws facilitating private participation in
the construction of (i) 362 kmnorthern link-road connecting some of the poorest areas of the
                        the
country (Franja Transversal del Norte) and (ii)     the l O O k m partial metropolitan beltway (Anillo
Metropolitano). Congress enacted the two specific laws in late 2005 and an international bidding
process has been initiated for their construction, with bids expected in August 2006. Work has
also begun on the Guatemala-El Rancho freeway with assistance from the Government of
Taiwan, albeit outside of the PPP model. Thus far, however, Congress has not acted on the
framework Law o f Public-Private Alliances, despite wide national consultation o f the Law and
its provisions by the Executive prior to its submission to Congress. Government i s still pressing
for its enactment during the second half of this calendar year, but the likelihood of passage
appears uncertain given that this i s a year of political transition.
50.     Efforts are also underway to establishpartnerships wzYh the private sector to improve
management of key infrastructure such as airports and ports. In late 2004, a management
committee comprised of users (including airlines, cargo companies, the tourism agency etc.) and
representatives o f the civil aviation authority for better management of the main international
airport (La Aurora). In addition, Government has made substantial progress in implementation o f
a well-designed program of upgrading and expansion of the nation's main airport facilities in
accordance with an approved master plan, which i s fully in line with recommendations of a
Bank-supported PPIAF study of air transport needs and international safety and security norms.
Reconstruction of terminal and tarmac of L a Aurora is underway. Security i s well improved, as it
was audited by ICAO. The challenge remains to implement necessary separation work of
taxiway and main runway, which i s planned to take two years and will thus have to be done by
new administration.     Guatemala was upgraded to Category 1 by the U S FAA in June 2007
through a program of strengthening the civil aviation authority, including security measures.
This enables direct flights (both cargo and passenger) to U.S. destinations by Guatemalan
carriers thereby facilitating the transport of Guatemalan exports products. Government's efforts
with respect to seaports during 2005 and early 2006 were focused on upgrading their security
certification to international standards (prior action for DPL I).Despite the fact that it is
extremely difficult to reach IASA Category 1 for any country, Guatemala has achieved this
milestone. With this achieved, the focus has now been on improving the efficiency of operations
at Puerto Santo Tomas, the country's publicly-run main Atlantic sea port, through establishment
of a new private dock for cruise ships (construction now underway) and development o f plans
for a privately-operated cargo handling and warehouse facility at the port.



                                                  31

51.     Another priority for Government is the diffusion of information technologies (ZCTs)
and telecommunications to previously un-served rural municipalities.                   Guatemala made huge
strides in providing access to telephones due to privatization and liberalization reforms program
implemented by the end of the 1990s. The number of fixed lines has risen from 400,000 to 1.2
million; and cellular phones, from 100,000 to 4.5 million. The government i s committed to
stimulating further private sector investment in telecommunications and ICTs by updating the
legal and regulatory framework to make it consistent with DR-CAFTA, to take into account
market and technological innovations and to encourage the use of ICTs to improve governance,
delivery of services and increase the competitiveness of Guatemala's economy. In order to
address the growing urban-rural "digital gap", a rural access strategy has been adopted that uses
output-based aid (OBA) mechanisms aimed at fostering private sector provision to each
municipality of at least one internet access point that enables local governments, NGOs, and
private sector operators broad band access to the internet and to ensure that all rural localities
have at least one public payphone. Implementation of the rural access strategy i s already
underway and the strategy i s being incorporated into a broader Information Society Strategy
which aims at determining priorities for the national broad-band internet network. The effort i s
being supported by the Bank under the Rural Economic Program operation and by WBI.


1.4.    Financial Sector Strengthening, Modernization and Deepening


52.     Guatemala made substantial progress in strengthening the country's financial sector,
in part with assistancefrom the Bank, the ZMF, and the ZDB. Since 2001, Guatemala has
strengthened the institutional and legal framework of the financial system with the
implementation of five important laws,6 which enabled the authorities to start registering and
supervising offshore banks, and make efforts to initiate consolidated supervision of financial
conglomerates (13 groups originally approved); they also strengthened supervision of payments
systems and put in place an electronic clearinghouse and settlement system at the central bank.
However, as highlighted in a recent joint IMF-WB FSAP Update, there i s still a need for
significantly strengthening consolidated supervision as well as putting in place better risk-
management practices by financial institutions, which would enable better access to finance.
53.     The current framework was recently put to a difficult test with the failure of two
banks, which were successfully handled. This stated when the operations of the country's
fourth largest bank, Bancafe, with over 1.1 million accounts, were suspended in October 2006
due to non-compliance with legally-established prudential norms linked to difficulties of its
offshore bank.     The irrevocable resolution of Bancafe successfully initiated (the first rapid
resolution case ever implemented without going through liquidation, using the 2002 Banlung
Law) with the transfer of all deposits and an equivalent amount of assets to three other banks,
preserving the majority of banking jobs. While the successful resolution of such a large bank
showed the adequacy of the regulatory and institutional framework, it also pointed to some
important vulnerabilities in the sector, especially the existence of unsupervised intermediation.


6. A new Money Laundering Law was enactedin December2001 aimed at strengtheningprevention anddetection
    of money laundering activities and a package of four basic financial laws was approved by Congress at the end
    of April 2002. This package included a Banking and Financial Groups Law, a Central Bank Law, a Banking
    SupervisionLaw, a Monetary Law inApril 2002;



                                                       32

This was confirmed when the Monetary Board suspended a small bank, Banco de Comerico, in
January 2007 due to problems with its (previously undisclosed) offshore affiliate.             The
irrevocable resolution o f this smaller bank was also promptly initiated and its domestic deposits
were transferred to the country's largest bank. Nonetheless, public confidence in the system has
been tested. To date, reported data do not show any runs on the system but the situation
continues to be closely monitored andthe deposit insurance fundhas been replenished.
54.     Actions in the process of improving the supervision of financial conglomerates have
progressed more rapidly than anticipated, partly motivated by the recent bank failures that
alsopointed to the needfor other actions-many        already in progress. A draft new manual on
risk-based and consolidated supervision i s being tested on a pilot basis on some financial entities
prior to its adoption stating in 2008 (supported by IDB-FOMIN funding and Bank technical
support), while the interrelationships between financial groups, known subsidiaries, and related
parties have been mapped, including presumed related parties, implementing recommendations
from the joint IMF-WB FSAP Update 2005-2006. Based on this mapping, analysis is being
conducted on the risk of capital becoming ineffective due to concentrated lending above
regulatory limits and on the potential effects on the solvency o f the financial group o f the
incorporation or withdrawal of related entities. The SIB i s starting to design specialized
supervisory tools to model the effects of these risks on regulatory capital (with IDB-FOMIN and
FTAL support). The SIB is also finalizing a circular that will provide additional oversight
powers to review the workmg documents of external auditors as a way of verifying reports and
deterring fraud. The data in the SIB Credit Information System data base has improved
quantitatively and qualitatively with the newly required reporting by the banks of the financial
information of their large debtors (with debts of over US$650,000) and the banks' evaluation o f
their corporate portfolios of large creditors entirely based on capacity to pay. This improved
information is being used by the SIB to strengthen its supervisory functions. Another reform to
avoid the problems affecting the two recently failed banks has been the establishment and
operation o f the Special Investigating Unit within the SIB to investigate illegal financial sector
activities (such as fraudulent banking practices, misrepresentation, and theft). There have also
been advances in the modernization of the payments system RTGS. Since late 2006, all the
banks, the Central Bank systems, and the stock exchange have been operating under RTGS for
clearance and settlement of money and foreign exchange transactions. By March 2007, all the
banks and 3 financial institutions have been participating in the RTGS. In addition, in a joint
effort by the Central Bank and the Stock Exchange, the automated clearing house system
(ACH)-an     electronic network for financial transactions-is    in progress and expected to be
implemented inlate 2007.


                11:ENHANCING     CAPACITY FOR INCREASEDPRIORITYSPENDING

11.1ImprovementinTax Administration

55.     A key challengefor Guatemala is raising tax revenues up to the target of 12percent set
in the Peace Accords. Although not a major factor in the maintenance of fiscal stability, given
the country's strong track record on fiscal discipline, higher tax revenues are needed to support
expansion in the quality of, and access to, infrastructure and social services. While overall tax
collections have increased substantially since the mid-l990's, tax revenues stagnated at around



                                                33

10 percent of GDP in recent years (see Figures Al.la and Al.lb). In 2007, tax revenues are
expected to increase to 10.4 percent o f GDP as economic growth continues and efforts for
strengthened tax administration, including passage of an Anti-Evasion Law with provisions, inter
alia, for tax withholding, offset drops in tariffs associated with DR-CAFTA.Despite challenges
inraisingtax revenues inrecent years, Governmenthasmade important gains inincreasingfiscal
space for social spending through reallocation of resources.

56.     Movement on tax policy has had a "stop-go" character under the Berger
Administration, as was also the case under previous administrations.                                     Throughout recent
history, powerful vested interests on both the right and the left have consistently opposed tax
initiatives in Congress or, failing that, launched court challenges to achieve the strike down of
taxes, appealing to Article 243 of the constitution, which protects taxpayers from payment of
taxes which exceed their capacity. The current administration has been forced to play catch-up to
recover lost ground in its efforts to increase tax revenues as a result of two major setbacks
handed down by the Constitutional Court (CC). These include: (i)                             a December 2003 CC ruling
eliminating the minimum corporate tax (IEMA), which had generated about half of all revenues
from enterprises in 2003; and (ii)             a December 2004 CC injunction against the excise tax on fuel.
Inresponse to the first of these decisions, which would havereduced revenues to under 9 percent
of GDP, the Government promoted a new tax package (approved in watered-down form by the
Congress in June 2004) that attempted to compensate for the loss of the IEMA through
reintroduction of excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, introduction of a turnover tax as an option
under the corporate tax regime and reintroduction of a lower, and differently structured
presumptive minimumcorporate tax (IETAAP). This tax package, together with major efforts to
improve tax administration (see below) resulted in tax revenue collections of 10.1 percent of
GDPin2004.
57.      Tax revenues increased in 2006 after the decline in 2005. Tax revenues fell to 9.6
percent in 2005 of GDP from 10.1 percent in 2004 largely due to three factors: (i)                                payment o f
overdue VAT refunds to exporters, significantly reducing the stock (0.5 percent of GDP)
inherited from the previous administration in 2003, (ii)                     introduction o f exceptions on sales to
maquilas and (iii)reduction of import taxes in compliance with Article VI1 of GATT's
agreement and the import tax reduction program with Mexico and Central America. Without the
first two factors, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP in 2005 would have been the same as in



                                                                 34

2004.    In 2006, the reduction in tax revenue from the elimination of some taxes and
improvements in refunding VAT credits to exporters were offset by strengthened tax
administration, generating an increase of tax revenues as percentage of GDP to 10.2 p e r ~ e n t . ~
The increased tax collection i s mainly due to greater VAT collections (0.64 percent of GDP) and
ISR collections (0.54 percent of GDP). These increases largely offset declines collections from
the IETAAP, due to a scheduled reduction in its rate, and customs duties, due to trade
liberalization under DR-CAFTA.
58.     In contrast to the tax policy, reforms in tax administration have been progressing
strongly over thepast two years, supported in part by a Bank TA loan and by the MF. Under
the current administration, the Tax Administration Superintendence (SAT) has made significant
progress in implementing strengthened policies and procedures for tax collection, in line with its
strategic (106 point) plan.
59.     A recent assessment by the Bank and the IMF shows significant progress in achieving
SAT'Sstrategicplan during the last year and a half. Nearly half of the measures identified in
the strategic plan have been fully implemented and nearly all of the remainder are currently in
process. A key finding of the assessment i s that the general government objectives on tax
administration and customs have been met. The main achievement has been the reduction of
Value Added Tax (VAT) evasion, from 35.2 percent in 2001 to 34.1 percent in 2005. Even
though the reduction was not quantitatively large until 2005, preliminary estimates indicate that
VAT evasion in 2006 fell further to 31.6 percent in 200@,confirming the observation that the
decline was due to the successful implementation of tax administration andcustoms policies.

60.     Other tax policy achievements include: (i)            creation of a Large Taxpayers Coordination
unit, responsible for monitoring the country's 300 largest taxpayers and a Special Taxpayer unit
to administer the subsequent 3,000 largest taxpayers (expected to increase to 5,000 by the end of
the year); (ii)   the designation of "account officers'' to manage taxpayer files; (iii)                 required
electronic filing by nearly 3,000 largest taxpayers using SAT software and penalties for banks
accepting paper returns for taxes owed in excess of Ql0,OOO (92 percent o f tax payments are
currently through BancaSat); (iv) penalizing o f taxpayers for noncompliance with deadlines, by
requiring them to make partial payments based on previous returns; (v) electronically linking the
waybills of air and sea carriers to customs declarations to combat smuggling; (iv) complete
overall of staff in customs administration to ensure competency and honesty.' In addition to
these measures already underway, the Government has pushed forward a new law on tax
administration-approved         by Congress inJune 2006-termed          the "Law for Strengthening o f Tax
Administration" which seeks to broaden the taxpayer base by combating evasion and eliminating
loopholes. The Law (see Box D) i s a major step forward in improving tax administration and,
consequently, revenues. Implementation of the law is expected to result in increased revenues o f
around 0.3 percent of GDP (IMFestimate) over time.


           Box D: Key Provisionsof the Law for the Strengthening of Tax Administration

        VAT withholding at 65 percent for exports, 15 percent for large taxpayer's purchases, 25 percent for
        government agency purchases, 15 percent for credit card purchases, and 15 percent for all other goods.
        A new simplified VAT system for small taxpayers, involving monthly payments
        Requiring of payment of invoices over Q50,OOO by bank means of payment (checks, electronic transfers,
        credit and debit cards etc.)
        Authority to seize vehicles found to be transporting contraband
        Authority to revoke tax registration of "suspended taxpayers", many of whom collude to enable false VAT
        rebate claims
        Control by SAT of the printing of tax invoices and other fiscal documents to reduce the use o f false
        invoices.


61.     The Government i s following up with a second law for the Strengthening of Tax
Administration. The new law i s expected to include the following: a) new withholding of VAT
on importers (this follows recent changes to increase withholding on large suppliers, some
exporters, and credit card transactions of retailers), b) more stringent reporting requirements for
exempt VAT activities, and c) elimination of the VAT rebate for purchases from small entities.
These measures are expected to further increase tax collections by over 1.4 percent of GDP in
the first year of implementation. Adding the trend on tax evasion reduction, and expected
growth, tax collection should reach at least 10.4 percent o f GDPin 2007.


11.2ImprovementinBudgetAllocations


62.    A key element of the Government's growth and poverty agenda is the objective of
increasingpublic spending in key areas such as human development (education, health and

9 On November 14 2006, SAT replaced all the personnel of 4 major customs offices which collect about 75
   percent of customs' total tax collections. The new personnel were previously trained in a 4 month program at a
   Guatemalan private university.

nutrition) and on rural economic and social infrastructure, an area where good progress has
been made to date. Notably, since 2004, the government reduced by one-third the size of the
military budget and began a step-wise effort to direct a greater share of the budget to social
programs. Social expenditures (Peace Accords definition) rose from 4.9 percent o f GDP in
2004, to 5.3 percent in 2005, 5.4 percent in 2006, and 5.8 percent has been budgeted for 2007.
While the growth in 2006 social expenditures looks modest, this was primarily the result of
upward revisions to GDP, which reduced the ratio of social expenditures to GDP. In real terms,
social expenditures still grew 8.3 percent in 2006 and is expected grow 10.5 percent in 2007.
Results based budgets were prepared for the Education and Health Ministries for 2007. Social
sector spending now accounts over half of total revenues and almost half of total public
spending, although the share fell slightly in 2006 due to on post-Hurricane Stan reconstruction
spending. Around 78 percent of the increase in social spending has been directed to education
(excluding tertiary level), health and social assistance. The effort to reorder expenditure priorities
i s especially commendable in light of the high proportion (about 41 percent) of legally mandated
earmarks, which leave very little room for maneuver. In addition, there has been a concerted
effort to increase investment spending vis-&vis recurrent spending. In 2006, nominal investment
expenditures increased by 46 percent, following 18 percent in 2005, while the corresponding
increase inrecurrent spending was 14percent in 2006 and 8.68 percent in 2005.
63.     It is worth noting that the Government has launched a strategyfor political transition
and campaign to promote public awareness of, and spearhead a national dialogue on, the
country's social objectives and needs, define their costs, and build consensus on the
appropriate role for the public sector in achieving them. In part, the goal i s to facilitate a
common vision of poverty and social development strategy as well as lay the ground-work for
further tax policy changes in support of that vision.       In parallel, the central government is
working with local authorities to promote revisions to the municipal tax code to enable increases
in property tax revenues, in part through provision of greater autonomy to the municipalities to
set appropriate property tax rates.      This, in turn, would enable a higher contribution by
municipalities to the provision o f key basic and social services in the areas under their
jurisdiction.
64.     I n addition, Government is committedto strengthening budgetary processes in order to
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of core ministries, through adoption of a results-
based and multi-annual approach to budgeting. The Government took a significant leap
towards enhanced planning and accountability in key sectors with the introduction in 2005 of
agreements among MOF, SEGEPLAN and four major Ministries (Education, Health, Agriculture
and Infrastructure, Communications and Housing) to move towards this new budgeting
framework. The process has been undertaken under a well-designed plan that has resulted in the
early communication of institutional budgetceilings to improve the formulation process within a
formal medium-term expenditure framework. To validate and sustain what is, by nature, a long-
term endeavor, a gradual approach is being adopted. The 2006 and 2007 budgets included
results-based allocations for key programs in two of the four pilot Ministries-Education          and
Public Health.
65.     The Government is also committed to improving its monitoring and evaluation systems
as a key component of its results-based budgeting and for strengthening transparency,
accountability and the effectiveness of public sector spending. Through an IDFgrant, the Bank
i s supporting SEGEPLAN in strengthening its capacity for the design and implementation of an



                                                  37

integrated results-based M&E system. It intends to link the well established financial
administration system (SIAF) and government goal monitoring system (SIGOB) to outcome
indictors and impact evaluation. Currently 34 out of 40 public sector entities have implemented
SIGOB. A readiness assessmentof the existing M&E systems i s underway, and technical support
i s being provided in guiding monitoring of indicators and impact evaluation of selected social
sector programs.



111.     PUBLICEXPENDITURE            TRANSPARENCYMANAGEMENTAND


66.      One of the fundamentals of the government's development plan is to improve
governance and credibility of public sector management and institutions, as means of forging
higher levels o f trust between government and the public (in part as the ground work to counter
objections to increased taxes) and in enhancing investment climate. Important steps have been
taken in that regard, such as the creation of the Office of the Commissioner for Transparency, the
issuance of norms for access to public information in the executive branch, the legalization and
thorough implementation of a public procurement transparency portal (Guatecomprus), the
continued expansion of the public financial management and public investment systems, and
efforts to improve customs administration.
61.      At the center of financial management reform is the continued development of the
integrated financial management system (SIAF), which is considered an example of good
practice in the region in terms of a successful IFMS. SIAF i s fully implemented at central
Government level incorporating modem processes and systems in the core areas of budgeting,
treasury, accounting, as well as in other areas such as human resource management. The SIAF i s
complemented by a management system (SIFES), that has the objective of establishing
automatic linkages between the core financial modules and the supporting administrative
systems (e.g., procurement and registers of fixed assets). SIFES has been implemented in2006 in
central government implementing entities and during 2007 in the 38 autonomous entities that
have implemented SIAF.


     Box E: The Relevance of SIAF
    An integrated financial management system with comprehensive coverage has implications for public
    expenditure management at four main levels: (i)     it contributes to fiscal discipline by providing timely and
    reliable information on budget execution and by enforcing expenditure limits in accordance with approved
    budgets and cash flows; (ii) increasesoperational efficiency by expediting and standardizing processes; (iii)
    supports internal and external controls through transactional safeguards and audit trails; and (iv) contributes
    to transparency by facilitating the publication of budget execution reports and other fiscal reports.

   I


68.      An ambitious objectiveof thegovernment's reform program is to implement afinancial
management system throughout Guatemala's 332 municipalities, complementing basic tools
for budgeting, accounting, and treasury with additional modules in areas such as civil registry,
services administration and property tax for pertinent local governments. The first simplified
version for municipal budget recording (SZAFZTO-MUNZ) has being replaced by the second,



                                                           38

more robust version (SZAF-MUNZ). This new version i s already operational in over 250
municipalities and fully implemented in 187 o f a total of 332 (inincrease from the 110, from the
previous DPL). The central government version that was adopted by the two largest
municipalities (Guatemala and Quetzaltenango) has also been implemented in two other
municipalities due to the magnitude of their operations (San Marcos). This progress indicates
that a main part of the process has been completed, leaving only a last effort to complete the
coverage at municipal level with the integration of the remaining 80 municipalities. Regarding
the implementation of SIAF in decentralized autonomous agencies, from the four remaining
entities 3 have been recently created."
69.     Looking ahead, the Ministry of Finance is planning to expand operational coverageof
SZAF to the 3 recently created central government entities and of SZAF-MUNZ to at least 30
additional municipalities in the short term. While the DPL program supports these selective
actions, it should be noted that these are framed in a larger action plan adopted by the Ministry
for   improvement       of   public     financial management.        Through     these    measures,     the
comprehensiveness and availability of public information on fiscal and budgetary performance
will be increased, carrying unquantifiable benefits such as facilitating external scrutiny and
analysis, which in turn enhance the government's financial accountability framework.
70.     By end of March 2007, a total of 132 agencies at the central government level (or 100
percent), and 318 out of 332 municipal governments (a 22.5 percent increase in respect of the
total number compared to December 2005) have implemented the government e-procurement
system (Guatecompras) on a regular basis raising the total accumulated level of system
adoption to 96percent at the municipal level. Through an executive decree, social funds, trust
funds and NGOs using public funds are required by law to use Guatecompras, and the recent
CAFTA Implementation Law modifies the National Procurement Law making it mandatory for
all government entities. Moreover, an interface of Guatecompras and SIAF has been achieved
through the implementation of SIGES. It i s expected that further development of the system will
take place in the context of a comprehensive strategic plan for e-procurement, product
classification and information standards, and use of data for procurement planning.
71.     Mandatory use of Guatecomprasfor allpublic purchases over Q30,OOOper contract. A
strong effort has been focused on raisingthe use o f Guatecompras and the interface with SIAF to
raise implementation of public purchases of goods and works with estimated values of Q30,OOO
or more at all government levels. Consistent with that, the Government committed to incorporate
at least 370 public agencies from all government levels, which includes 280 municipalities. In
the period June 2006-March 2007, central government and municipal agencies have managed
through Guatecompras a total of 5,510 tendering processes for a total accumulated amount of
Q19.2 billion (equivalent to US$2.5 billion) for procurement o f goods and works with use of
both competitive bidding and shopping procedures. In terms o f procurement policy formulation
and oversight responsibilities, it i s expected that short-term priority will be given to the
strengthening of the procurement regulatory body (DNCAE) and to the creation or strengthening
of the institutional procurement units. In the context of implementation o f the Integrated
Financial Management I11Project, the Government will contract out an evaluation of the public
procurement system with the use o f the OECD-developed tool, based on baseline indicators, and

72.      Guatemala has one o f the lowest debt levels as a share o f GDP in Latin America
and among developing countries worldwide, reflecting a tradition of conservative
macroeconomic management. Given the relatively low level o f tax revenue to GDP it i s
nevertheless relevant to analyze the sustainability of public debt. To explore this issue a
medium term debt sustainability analysis was prepared under the key macroeconomic
assumptions presented in Table A2.1 and expected delivery of the US$611 million BRD
CAS envelope.

73.      Even under relatively conservative macroeconomic assumptions in the
baseline scenario, public external debt would decrease from 11.2 percent of GDP in
2006 to 9.1 percent of GDP by 2010 (see Table A2.2). Debt service on external public
debt would decrease from 7.7 percent of exports in 2006 to 6.4 percent of exports by
2010". This is consistent with the Government's strategy of shifting towards domestic
sources of financing. Following the Government's current debt policy, the baseline
scenario assumes no new sovereign bond financing o f the fiscal deficit. The use of less
costly DPLs and budget support lending from other preferred creditors during the
projection period would, all else the same, moderate possible increases in interest
payments. These conclusions are consistent with the debt sustainability analysis of the
IMFas presentedinthe mostrecent 2007 Article IVreport (see Box A2.1 for details).
74.      The analysis also indicates that all external vulnerability indicators would
remain within sustainable margins. The share of preferred creditor debt to total
debt decreases over the period, although IBRD exposure increases marginally. The
latter should not be a cause o f concern because o f the relatively overall low burden o f
servicing Guatemala's total debt. The current account deficit is expected to stabilize at
around 5.3 percent of GDP by 2010 as a result of steady growth in remittances and
stronger nontraditional exports. International reserves would also remain strong
throughout the period and increasing to 4.5 months o f imports o f goods and nonfactor
services in 2010.



11. A one-time increase in amortization payments is expected for 2007, as US$lSO million outstanding
    due inthat year is repaid and financed through new Euro bond issues.

Box A2.1 The IMFand Debt SustainabilityinGuatemala
Inits latest Article IV consultation report of January 31,2007, the IMFfinds that Guatemala's external and
public debt outlook i s sustainable, even under alternative negative shock scenarios for the underlying
macroeconomic variables. While the baseline scenario estimates that total public debt would increase to
19.5 percent of GDP by 2011 from 18.0 percent in 2006, this i s well within the country's capacity to
service its debt. Similarly, Guatemala's total external debt is projected to increase from 31.5 to 35.9 percent
of GDP over the same period, but remains relatively modest and serviceable. Finally, public external debt
i s projected to fall from 11.2 percent of GDP in 2006 to 10.5 percent in 2010, consistent the government's
objectives.
Temporary negative shocks to most key variables (interest rate, GDP growth and primary balance) would
lead to increases in debt ratios for public and external debt of no more than two percentage points of GDP
of in 2011 relative to the baseline. There are two exceptions to this observation, however. Under strong
adverse negative shock scenarios, such as a five percent o f GDP shock to contingent liabilities, the public
debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by ten percentage points in2011compared to the baseline, as it results in
lower growth (2 percent in 2007), a real depreciation (15 percent) and a deterioration of 0.5 percent o f GDP
of the primary balance. Similarly, a one-time real depreciation o f 30 percent in 2007 would increase the
external debt ratio to 48 percent in 2011compared to 36 percent in the baseline.

Ms.Pamela Cox
Vice President for Latin America andthe Caribbean
World Bank
Washington, D.C., USA


Dear Ms.Cox:

After three years of the administration of President Oscar Berger, many of the goals
established in the government's 2004 - 2008 plan have been reached. This i s due to the
creation of the program Vamos Guatemala, which includes concrete actions for how to
implement certain strategies in both the short term and long term. This program has five
strategic components: Guatesolidaria, Guatecrece, Guateinvierte, Guatecompite and
Guateverde. These components establish a series of actions whose objectives are to
promote a favorable climate for productive investment which, in turn, should translate
into better living conditions for the Guatemalan population and will also establish
conditions favorable to reachingthe MillenniumDevelopment Goals.

The assistance strategy agreed upon between the Guatemalan government and the World
Bank establishes, among other points, support to Vamos Guatemala through a series of
three Policy Loans over the 2005-2007 period. Since the approval o f the first and second
loans in 2005 and 2006, the government has demonstrated continued progress in the key
areas defined in the matrix o f program implementation.       This is why we now feel
qualified to request the negotiation and approval of the third loan o f US$ 100 million.
Similarly to the first two loans, this loan would support the government's efforts to
increase economic growth, improve governance, reduce poverty, deepen the financial
markets, as well as increasing public spending efficiency and transparency in the public
sector.

The following i s a brief summary of the progress achieved inthese specific areas:

I.EconomicGrowthandImprovementoftheInvestmentClimate

Consolidation of macroeconomic stability and increased confidence in the country
allowed for growth of 4.6 percent in GDP in 2006, higher than the 3.2 percent registered
in 2005. Overall growth of the world economy, particularly in the United States of
America, and the effectiveness of the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade
Agreement (DR-CAFTA) were primary external contributors to this higher growth.
Macroeconomic stability was achieved through sound monetary and fiscal policies. In


                                            50

addition, the Consumer Price Index grew by only 5.79 percent in 2006, 2.78 percent less
than the 8.57 percent of 2005, allowing the achievement of the monetary policy inflation
target for 2006.

A key government objective has been to maintain organized and sound public finances,
which promote economic development and poverty reduction, while not compromising
macroeconomic stability with high, unsustainable fiscal deficits. The government has
tried to raise its fiscal revenues to support a significant increase in public investment,
mainly in social expenditure. The sound fiscal and monetary policies led to a fiscal
deficit of only 1.7 percent of GDP in 2006, less than the 2.5 percent projected in the
budget approved for 2006. Accordingly, in 2006 Congress approved Decree 20-2006
Legal Provisions to Strengthen the Tax Administration (Disposiciones Legales para
Fortalecer la Administracibn Tributaria) which allows the Superintendency of Tax
Administration (Superintendencia de Administracibn Tributaria - SAT) to reduce tax
evasion and elusion by implementing better control andmonitoringmechanisms.

The implementation of the new tax provisions in 2006 resulted in an increase o f 17.4
percent in VAT collections and an increase o f Q4,289.5 million in total tax revenues
yielding a total of 429,250.2 million from Q 24,960.7 million in 2005. This i s an
importantachievement as it represents an increase of about 1.7 percent of GDP in 2006.
In addition, tax collections for the first five months of the current year increased by 19.4
percent compared to the same period in 2006, reaching Q13,706.8 million equivalent to
43.9 percent of the 2007 target (Q 31,197.6 million).

Within its commitment to raise tax revenues, the government has been supporting the
work initiated by the Peace Accords National Council (ConsejoNucional de 10sAcuerdos
de Paz), to facilitate the achievement of the Peace Accords and the MDGs by assessing,
updating andresumingthe discussions on the Fiscal Pact.

The country's external position, as measured by the level of international monetary
reserves, was satisfactory in 2006.       The level of net international monetary reserves
amounted to US$4,061.1 million (equivalent to 4 months of imports of goods and
services), which i s US$278.7 million higher than in 2005 (US$3,782.4 million). This
result was mainly due to the surplus in the balance of services and positive net current
transfers due to an increase intourism andremittances, respectively.

The government also maintained a low level of external debt of US$ 3,958.2 million,
equivalent to 13.1 percent of GDP while the total public debt was US$ 6,606.1 million,
21.9 percent of the GDP in 2006-the      lowest in Central America and one o f the lowest in
Latin America. This external debt management is consistent with the principles of the
Fiscal Pact, which is oriented toward maintaining prudent economic policies and debt
management.

The Guatemalan government i s convinced that the opening of markets can only be
beneficial in terms of the country continually improving its investment and business
climate as well as the supporting infrastructure. In this sense, it completed a process of
simplification and harmonization of the steps for registering new commercial entities


                                              51

under the VentmillaAgil. This new registration process includes: i)the use of a single
form (Form No. FU- 01) to apply for the necessary commercial registration, taxes and
social security; ii)provisional registry of the commercial entities within 24 hours; and,
iii)the finalized registrationandissuance of acommerciallicense for acommercial
entities in a period no more than 11days. It i s important to mention that this process i s
considerably shorter than one that initially took 25 days.

Additionally, the certification of safety o f air transportation (IASA Cat.1) was granted for
the facilities of L a Aurora International Airport.

The Superintendent of Tax Administration has promoted the use of electronic tax-
returning mechanisms that ease the fulfillment o f tax liabilities and allow a better
monitoring of taxpayers. Therefore, during the period covering January to May 2007, 85
percent of the tax returns submitted by the 3,000 biggest taxpayers were sent
electronically; this allowed for cross-control the returns of these taxpayers, and generated
an increase in the Taxpayers Registrar to 45,275 small contributors and 613 business
entities duringthe period covering January 1to May 31,2007.

In the financial area, and in line with the financial reforms that are currently being
promoted, banking supervision is now oriented toward risk management and the
Superintendent of Banks (SB) has initiated a program of legal, administrative and
technical actions aimed at strengthenening the country's financial sector; these include: i)
the preparation (in process) of the Procedures Guide to Risk-Based Supervision,
applicable to Banking Institutions and Off-shore Institutions, which includes one chapter
on Consolidated Supervision which i s already finished; ii)15 of the financial groups that
are currently operating were mapped between April and June 2006, this information i s
used to develop a tool for "Analysis and Scenarios" which allows analysis of the impact
that inclusion or exclusion of their parties could have on the solvency of these Financial
Groups; iii)according to Regulation for administration of Credit Risk, approved by
resolution JM-93-2005 and with the guidelines to send information, it was possible to
improve quantitative and qualitative information about large corporate debtors, reported
by banking institutions to the SB, as is required for the evaluation bank corporate
portfolios, based on debtors' payment capacity; and iv) starting January 26 2007, the
Special Investigations Unit started its operations in order to investigate within the field of
faculties granted by law to the SB, the operations of financial intermediation and others
that might be carried out by non-regulated entities, in order to meet the provisions o f
Agreement 1-2006 of the Superintendent o f Banks.


11. Increaseinthe capacityfor publicexpenditure inprioritysectors

As part of its work schedule, the government has prioritized the actions in sectors such as
education, health, justice and the networks o f social protection. This i s reflected in the
budget allocations of line ministries and executing entities for the government.

The government has adopted the principle that in order for peace to be maintained and
sustained, it must be based on participative social-economic development, oriented


                                              52

toward the common good, which considers the needs of the entire population. Such
development requires solidarity and social inclusion as one of the pillars for national
unity. This is why the Government Plan 2004-2008 resumes the Peace Accords and
defines its accomplishment as a commitment of the whole o f society.         The program
Varnos Guatemala, through its component Guate Solidaria aims precisely at reducing
poverty and exclusion.      Accordingly, during 2006 more attention was given to the
priority social expenditure in the Peace Accords, which corresponds among others, to
those expenditures designated to education, health, and housing, which during that year
increased 15 percent compared to 2005. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that for
2006, the execution of social expenditure reached a level of Q14,604.3 millions, which
represents 40.1 percent of the total expenditure of central administration, and when
measured as a share of GDP it was 5.4 percent compared to 5.3 percent in 2005. It is
worth mentioning that as a result of budget allocation for 2007 and the complementary
dispositions that govern the execution o f the General Budget o f Incomes and Expenditure
of the State, for the Fiscal Year 2007 issued by Law Decree No. 11-207, publishedinthe
Official Gazette on March 19, 2007, it i s foreseen to increase the budget allocation for
social expenditure as a percentage of GDPto 5.72 percent inthis fiscal year.

Ultimately, it is important to highlight that within the efforts to improve the quality of
expenditure, we have initiated a process of results-oriented budgeting, which i s being
accompanied by the World Bank Institute by strengthening the capabilities o f officers in
the executing units. The objective i s to incorporate within the budget the results that are
expected with those resource allocations, by incorporating objectives, goals and
expenditure indicators. This i s reflected in the 2008 budget of the main Ministries of the
Executive Branch. Furthermore, by means of a "Circular Conjunta" dated May 21, 2007,
a triple-party agreement was defined for the physical and financial follow-up of public
investment projects, among the Ministry of Public Finance, Secretariat for Planning and
Programming of the Presidency and the General Comptrollership.


111.Transparency andPublic Sector Administration

The Government continued the implementation of measures aimed at improving the
efficiency and transparency o f public resources use, mainly in the field of accountability,
to cooperate to strengthen the social audit.      As planned, we have accomplished the
objective of enlarging the range of the Integrated System of Financial Administration
(SIAF-SAG) to eight (8) additional public agencies and seventy (70) additional
municipalities duringthe period covering June 1,2006 to May 21,2007.

With respect to public procurement, the Government has registered significant
improvements with the use of the Information System GUATECOMPRAS, which has
extended to at least 370 public entities, among which 280 are municipalities; all of the
above, as a result of Decrees No. 92-2005, 11-2006 and 11-2006 of the Congress of the
Republic, by means of which it i s mandatory to use the referred system for all purchases
made with public resources above Q 30,000 (thirty thousand Quetzales). This has
contributed to clarify the public operations with respect to purchases and contracts and
has also generated a greater number o f participants, in addition to promoting greater


                                             53

competition among companies biddingfor contracts, which, inturn, reduces the price and
improves the quality.

Inaddition to the above, and inorder to strengthen the procurement processes, a program
for strengthening the Directorate of State Norms and Contracts has been initiated, and the
support of the Bank was requested in this respect to prepare a strategic plan for this
Directorate and the standardization of procedures and documents for public procurement,
as well as the preparation of guides and the training o f personnel that participates in the
different procurement processes.

IV. Conclusion

As illustrated, the government of Guatemala is highly committed to the promotion and
implementation of the necessary actions to achieve higher and sustainable economic
growth, an increase in productive public investment prioritized in the areas of health,
education and social protection, as well as the strengthening of transparency and
efficiency in public spending. These actions will increase economic growth and improve
the quality o f life of the Guatemalan population, especially the most vulnerable groups.

In this context, the financial support of the World Bank through a Third Broad Based
Development Policy Loan i s particularly relevant part o f the government's strategy and
financing the of the national budget.

On February 14, 2007, the Executive Boardof the International MonetaryFund (IMF} concluded the Article
IV consultation with GuatemalaaP

 Background

 Economicperformance in Guatemala has trnprwedmarkedly since the last consultation. Growth Increased
to 455 percent in2006, fueled by the increasing flow of tamdy remittances, which spur conwrrnption, and
 higher Exed capital formation For the first time in several years, inflation has declined below 6 percent,

 averall surplus of the balance of payments has perniitted the accumulationof international rexrves,
 the central banktarget. The external current account deficit IS stabbltzing at 4.5 percent of GDP while the

 w t w h remaiii at about 4 months of imports of goads and services

The rmproved performance has heen gmunded on prudent macrixconornic policies, anchored in low public
 debt and deficits, and an the important progress made in many areas of structural refom.

 Vie central government defrctt    15 expected tr, rernarn at around 1%percent of EDP in 2006, below the
 level originally envisage& and non financral public sector debt 15 expected to remain at about 18 percent
 of GDP, one of the lowest levels in the regron On the revenue side, tosses from tbe elimmarmn of some
 taxes and improvements bn refunding value-added tax credits to exporters have been offset by enhanced
 tax administration. Prospects    ifithis area have improved after rhe passage in June 2006 of a tax
 adminifltratm reformthat IS expected to offset rwenue tosses from entry intoCAVA-DR. On the
 expendrture sde, managementand transparency of fiscal operations improved wrth the extension of
 coverageof the Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF) and the expanded reporting af
 tustecompras, increasing competition in public SetKor procurement.

 The central bank has made important progresspreparingfor the implementation of an inflation targe+2ng

 ExacMth Board Assessment

 Directors commended the Guatemalan authorities for the round fsscal framework, improvements in tax
 adrnrnic;tratcon. incremz-e in transparency of fiscal and monetary policies, and structural reforms to promote
 growth and regional economic integration, These policies, together wrth robust rernnances and benign
 external condftions, have contributed to highereconomic growth, macroeconomic stability. and law public
 debt. To consolidate these gains, key priorites are to strerigthen the fmancial system, address soda1
 needs by raising tax revenue. consolidate the decline rn inflation, and gradually allow for more flexibility in
 the exchange rate Downsrde risks to the outlook arise from tensrons in tha financial system and slowing
 growth in tradmg partner countries.

 Directom noted that a key challenge fur the medrum term wilt be to strengthen the banking system. While

the acilhorkkes managed to avert a disruption to financial stability arising from the failure of two banks,
they need to take immediate steps to bokter the bankingresolutionframework and strengthen confidence
