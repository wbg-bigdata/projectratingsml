MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF MALI FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL TRADING AND PROCESSING PROMOTION
PILOT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Mali for SDR 3.9 million, the equivalent of US$6.0 million,
on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance an Agricultural Trading and
Processing Promotion Pilot project. Government and beneficiaries will finance US$800,000, and
CECI, a Canadian NGO, will contribute US$100,000, respectively 12 percent and 1 percent of
project costs. The proceeds of the credit would be made available as a grant to the "Agence de
Promotion des Filieres Agricoles", an implementation entity within the Permanent Assembly of
Malian Chambers of Agriculture.
2.     Country/Sector Background and Strategy. The Malian economy is dominated by the
rural sector, which accounts for 50 percent of GDP, occupies more than 80 percent of the active
population, and provides 75 percent of export earnings. The manufacturing sector is embryonic,
contributing only 6.5 percent of GDP and providing about 5 percent of total employment in the
economy. Informal activities dominate the key sectors of the economy, including agriculture,
manufacturing and the service sector.
3.    Agroprocessing is by far the most important of the manufacturing subsectors. According
to a 1988 census, agroprocessing enterprises constitute half the total number of formal
manufacturing enterprises, and contribute 50 percent of gross production, 73 percent of value
added, and 55 percent of employment in the formal manufacturing sector. These numbers do not
include the few enterprises that specialize in exporting fruits and vegetables. Still, a considerable
share of agricultural trading and processing is handled in the rural areas by small entrepreneurs in
the informal sector, and particularly by women. These activities contribute more than two thirds of
value added and employment in the informal sector. When informal artisanal activities are figured
in, agroprocessing accounts for about 7 percent of GDP, and nearly 10 percent of employment.
4.     Agricultural trading and processing activities in Mali are carried out by a wide variety of
enterprises, which can classified in four major categories:
(a)    a small group (15) of medium and large formal agroprocessing enterprises employing 10
or more persons, most of which were public enterprises undergoing rehabilitation, and
which can now receive support from the Private Sector Promotion Agency (APEP) and the
IFC regional branches, Africa Project Development Facility (APDF/AEF), and need not be
supported by this project;
(b)    a limited number (10) of enterprises specialized in the export of fruits and vegetables;
(c)    a larger number (80) of small formal sector enterprises, mostly small, geographically
dispersed rural entities using low productivity traditional technologies to produce low
quality food and agro-industrial products destined for local consumption; and



2
(d)   thousands of small informal enterprises engaged in marketing and artisanal processing of
agricultural products, mostly part-time family enterprises using rudimentary techniques
and little or no equipment.
5.     Mali's performance in the area of market gains for agro-processed products has not been
satisfactory. The country has either lost or been unable to gain shares on regional or international
markets for grains, meat, hides and skins, fruits and vegetables, and is far from fully exploiting its
domestic market for these products. For example, Malian exports of mangoes plateaued from
1980 to 1990 at an average of 1,200 tons, losing European market share (from 14 percent in 1985
to 6 percent in 1990) to some of its neighbors. According to West Africa Central Bank (BCEAO)
statistics, exports of hides and skins and of shea nuts are stagnant and extremely unstable. They
have apparently ranged in the last two decades anywhere from 150 to 2,000 tons for hides and
skins, and from 300 to 8,000 tons for shea nuts. On the domestic market, Mali has had trouble not
only in diversifying production, but also in managing agricultural surpluses and their high
seasonality, particularly for grains and horticultural products. Losses due to inadequate marketing,
storage and handling range from 30 percent (onions) to 50 percent (mangoes). A wide range of
processed products, cereals (particularly maize), dried fruits and vegetables, dried and smoked fish
and meat, fruits, juices, jams and spices are being produced by small artisanal entrepreneurs who
have difficulty gaining access to markets, appropriate technologies and/or to financing.
6.     The relevant sector and project preparation work has identified key bottlenecks to the
development of private agricultural marketing and processing enterprises:
(a)    Limited access to information on market opportunities, fiscal and investment incentives,
and export/import and transport regulations;
(b)    Limited knowledge of post-harvest and marketing technologies and techniques; and weak
and scattered support to private agroprocessing entrepreneurs;
(c)    Weakness and limited number of professional associations;
(d)    Inadequate access to credit, particularly in rural areas;
(e)    Lack and/or low quality of rural infrastructure; and
(f)    Ineffective quality control for both exported and agroprocessed products.
7.     There is a strong demand on European markets for many Malian agricultural products,
such as mangoes and green beans. Potentially profitable market niches also exist for non-
traditional products such as shea nuts, cashews and gum  resin.  Mali's 1992 household
consumption survey has also shown surprisingly high demand for fruits and vegetables, especially
in urban areas. The high rate of urban population growth, and the anticipated improvements in per
capita incomes, should greatly increase market demand for fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy
products and processed foods, as well as for other agroindustrial products such as animal feed,
soap, shoes, etc. Similar growth is expected in neighboring coastal countries, thus providing
opportunities for increased regional exports of potatoes, onions and livestock products.
8.    These growth prospects have greatly improved since the CFAF devaluation. Livestock
exports to the West African coastal countries have already rebounded, sales of cottonseed oil and
other edible oils on regional export markets have expanded, and the outlook for import substitution
for locally-processed cereals, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, cooking oil, shea nut soap,
leather and textiles is promising.

9.     The promotion of private investment in agricultural trading and processing is one of the
key elements of the Government's rural development strategy. Other key objectives include: (a)
improving the enabling environment needed to enhance business opportunities for the private sector
and encourage disengagement of the State from commercial activities; (b) improving technical
support to producers through more effective research and extension, in order to boost and diversify
production and improve the international competitiveness of Malian exports; (c) enhancing the
training for, and the active participation of, rural groups in the design and implementation of rural
development activities; and (d) improving infrastructure and transport.
10.   In the agroprocessing subsector, the Government's strategy focuses on four policy
orientations: (a) financial rehabilitation, restructuring and/or privatization of public agroprocessing
enterprises; (b) provision of incentives, via the investment code, in favor of rural-based enterprises;
(c) support to the creation of active professional organizations; and (d) the improvement, through
technical and institutional support, of the economics of agroprocessing in order to stimulate private
investment in the subsector.
11.    The Government, with the support of the IDA-financed Agricultural Services and National
Agricultural Research projects, has recently embarked on a rehabilitation program of its research
and extension services to cover areas outside CMDT and ON intervention. As a result, IER and
PNVA, the beneficiary institutions, have seen their support capabilities enhanced and better geared
to demand. However, given the priority accorded other agricultural subsectors, such as cereals and
livestock,  support capabilities in agricultural trading and processing have remained weak.
Training in post-harvest technologies is currently unavailable in Mali.
12.    The Chamber of Agriculture of Mali (CAM), until recently under the strict control of the
Ministry of Rural Development and Environment, has undergone major changes in status and
structure.  There are now eight Regional Chambers of Agriculture composed of elected
representatives of the rural population, which have a broader mandate to promote private sector
initiatives, to support professional organizations and producer interest groups, and to represent the
interests of the rural sector in general. Coordination of policy and programs, and support to the
Regional Chambers, is assured by the Permanent Assembly of the Malian Regional Chambers of
Agriculture (APCAM). With training, technical support, and hands-on experience, the Regional
Chambers of Agriculture should soon be able to play a leading role in providing various support
services to private entrepreneurs in the agricultural and agroprocessing sectors.
13.   There are also specialized professional associations involved with the agricultural trading
and processing subsectors. The Fruits and Vegetables Export Association (AMELEF) was
created by the leading exporters to promote the professional and economic interests of fruit and
vegetable exporters. The Mutual Association of Hides and Leather (MPCP), the Butchers
Cooperative, and the Association of Livestock Traders, also created under private sector initiatives,
are active in the livestock subsector.
14.    Project Objectives. The project's long-term objective is to induce sustained output
growth in the agricultural trading and processing subsector, through increased exports to European
and regional markets, and through import substitution on the local market. This will require that
agribusiness, traders, exporters and producers become capable of a better adaptation of their
products to consumer preferences, improved and more uniform product quality, increased
timeliness and regularity of product delivery, and lower costs throughout the marketing chain. To



4
do so, the prcject will seek sustained improvements in the ability of professional organizations
active in the subsector to select, manage, and finance support services to private entrepreneurs.
This five-year pilot project, conceived as a research and development (R&D) and capacity-
building project, will test the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of delivering support services to
private enterprises by and through Chambers of Agriculture and specialized professional
associations.
15.    Project Description. This five-year pilot project would address key sectoral constraints to
private investment in agricultural processing and marketing, and would focus primarily on
capacity-building and on the transfer of know-how to the private sector through information
networks, training, specialized TA, study tours.  The project would pursue a two-pronged
approach: (a) provision of polyvalent support in three regions to all profitable agroprocessing
private entrepreneurs, upstream and downstream of agricultural production; and (b) transfer of
specialized expertise to enterprises operating in subsectors or product lines with a high potential for
international export and which require high standards of quality, such as fresh and dried fruits and
vegetables, hides and skins, and shea nuts and other exotic products. Project management would
be entrusted to an Agricultural Trading and Processing Promotion Agency (APROFA), an
executing entity to be set up by the Permanent Assembly of Malian Chambers of Agriculture,
which will delegate to it full authority for project implementation and ensure its full autonomy in
managing it. The Government will exercise overall project supervision through the Ministry of
Rural Development and Environment. The Agency will have streamlined operating structures,
comprising a headquarters unit in Bamako, and, in full operation, three regional branches. The
project will provide funding for: (i) the operation of the three regional branches in the Sikasso,
Segou, and Mopti regions; (ii) support packages, including specialized TA, training, studies and
investment funds for three professional organizations promoting vertical integration for the
fruit/vegetable, hides/skins, and oilseeds/shea nut subsectors; (iii) the operation of the Agency's
headquarters unit, responsible for overall project management, monitoring, supervision and
evaluation, and the creation and operation of an agricultural processing and marketing information
exchange network, and (iv) activities aimed at facilitating entrepreneurs' access to investment
financing and credit.
16.    Project Implementation. During the first two years, only two regional branches (Sikasso
and Segou, which have obvious potential for agroprocessing) and one support package to a
professional organization (AMELEF, for the fruit and vegetable subsector) will be launched. A
mid-term review will assess the impact and performance of the first phase and make
recommendations to improve project design and implementation. The establishment of a regional
branch at Mopti and the provision of a support package to the professional association of the
oilseeds and shea nut subsector will start after the mid-term review.
17.    Project Sustainability.  The project is conceived as an R&D and capacity-building
investment which should help local institutions representing the private sector to be strong and
professional enough to select, manage and finance the services needed by private entrepreneurs.
This will be achieved by: (a) gradually reducing, over a five-year period, the need for technical
assistance and other services through capacity-building and knowledge transfer to the benefit of
leading professional associations and local producers organizations; and (b) learning through
experience the most effective services and techniques and helping the same institutions to design
and implement a cost recovery scheme. Long-term needs for these services will be monitored
during the project.

18.    Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. IDA's experience with projects channeling
support to small agricultural trading and processing enterprises through professional organizations
(Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea and Madagascar) is rather recent, hence the pilot format of this
project. Implementation problems in similar projects appear to stem from the following: (a) a
centralized Ministry was given responsibility for implementation, while most activities were
located in rural areas; (b) no representative professional organizations, such as a chamber of
commerce and/or of agriculture, was associated; (c) project management was entrusted to an
international consulting firm; (d) the project was too large and too complex; and (e) the country's
policy environment was not favorable for private sector development. None of these factors are
present in this project. Given the relative success of the Agence d'Execution des Travaux d'Interet
Publique et pour l'Emploi (AGETIPE) approach in providing support to the private sector in Mali
and other neighboring countries, this project will incorporate many of the AGETIPE features that
relate to the institutional set-up, and to management, supervision, monitoring, auditing, and
evaluation procedures. Project preparation has also provided useful lessons. A trial decentralized
unit, set up in Sikasso with support from a local consulting firm, has achieved good results in
helping local entrepreneurs export potatoes and onions to CMte d'Ivoire. Another experiment with
mango exports to Europe by sea shipments demonstrated that sea routes are feasible and less costly
than air freight. Malian entrepreneurs demonstrated that they can, with the right support, master
the whole chain of post-harvest technologies and operations from harvest, to packaging, to
refrigerated land and sea transport, all the way to delivery of a good quality product for auction to
European distributors.
19.    Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project is consistent with the Countrv Assistance
Strategy (CAS) reviewed by the Board on January 15. 1995. This strategy for Mali's rural sector
includes the following objectives: (a) to improve the enabling environment needed to enhance
business opportunities for the private sector and encourage disengagement of the State from
commercial activities; (b) to improve technical support to producers through more effective
research and extension, in order to boost and diversify production as well as to improve the
international competitiveness of Malian exports; (c) to enhance training for, and promote active
participation of, rural groups in the design and implementation of rural development activities; (d)
to promote private investment in irrigation and the selective rehabilitation of existing schemes
rather than the construction of new ones; (e) to promote private investment in agricultural trading
and processing; (f) to support a comprehensive natural resource management program and the
creation of a legal and institutional framework giving local communities more authority and
accountability in its implementation, as well as reforms aimed at intensifying production through
appropriate land use policies; and (g) to improve infrastructure and transport. This project fits
well within IDA's country assistance strategy of promoting more aggressively private sector
development while strengthening local institutional capacity, in order to foster a broad-based and
sustainable economic growth. The IDA strategy for Mali also stresses the need to support the
pivotal role of women in agriculture. Given the predominance of small and geographically
dispersed enterprises, there is real scope for broad-based growth that will help alleviate poverty,
slow rural migration, and increase household food security for both urban and rural populations.
Private sector growth will also significantly increase the participation and productivity of women,
who are traditionally very active in agricultural trading and processing. The proposed project
capitalizes on and supplements sector adjustment programs. The small formal and informal
enterprises to be supported under this project complement the larger privatized firms, as they can
fill market niches inaccessible to the latter. The export promotion component, by capitalizing on
the market liberalization measures and on the trade and exchange policies, will contribute to an



6
improved balance of payments through increased exports. This pilot project will test the feasibility
and effectiveness of providing support to private sector enterprises through local institutions such
as professional associations and Chambers of Agriculture. The lessons to be drawn from this
project will be useful to other IDA programs/projects not only in Mali, but also in Sub-Saharan
Africa.
20.    Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed upon the following actions: (a) as
covenants: (i) establishment of a Consultative Committee with membership, mandate, and
procedures acceptable to IDA; (ii) establishment and use of procurement, accounting, disbursement
and reporting systems and procedures acceptable to IDA; (iii) arrangements for independent semi-
annual auditing of project accounts according to guidelines acceptable to IDA; and (iv)
arrangements for mid-term and end-of-project evaluations and reviews according to performance
indicators and procedures acceptable to IDA; (b) as conditions of effectiveness: (i) establishment of
an implementing entity "APROFA", within APCAM, which will be responsible for project
implementation and will have full autonomy in managing it; (ii) signing of an agreement with
APROFA, by which Government delegates to it responsibility for project implementation; (iii)
signing of a contract for the audit of project accounts; (iv) establishment of the project's
accounting system; (v) authorization for APROFA to set up a special account for deposit of project
advance funds, and (vi) signing of the cooperative agreements between APROFA and the national
agricultural research institute, and the national agricultural extension services.
21.    Environmental Aspects. The project falls within environmental category C. The project
will not finance agro-industries, but will focus instead on providing technical assistance to small
and medium  agroprocessing activities scattered in three regions.  Although no negative
environmental impact is likely, environmental concerns will be addressed during project
implementation as they arise, and during the mid-term review. The potential environmental impact
of activities to be supported in the secor,d phase in the hides and skins subsector will be evaluated
in the context of the subsector study planned during the first phase.
22.    Program Objective Category. The project's main area of emphasis will be private sector
development. Although the project does not specifically target the poorest, it is expected to
contribute to poverty alleviation by enhancing income generation and job creation in rural and
semi-urban areas. The project would also be of particular benefit to women who traditionally
specialize in agricultural trading and processing activities. The project will aim at institutional
development by strengthening local institutional capacity to provide services to the private sector.
23.    Participatory approach. Preparation started in 1993 with participatory ZOPP workshops
involving potential private sector beneficiaries and institutions such as the Chambers of
Agriculture and professional associations, to identify services to be provided under the project.
Export tests were conducted with two professional associations, AMELEF and the Hides and
Leather Export Association, and a test unit in Sikasso was designed, set up and monitored in close
coordination with the regional Chamber of Agriculture. Several ZOPP participatory workshops
involving local private enterprises, professional associations and government officials were held to
review these tests. A local consulting firm was contracted to organize and support all project
preparation activities.

24.    Project Benefits.  The main project benefit would be higher growth rates in the
agricultural trading and agroprocessing sector, and thus greater economic diversification and
increased urban and rural employment. This would be achieved by the project's laying the
groundwork for a strong supply response to the CFAF devaluation through the provision of: (a)
increased opportunities for access to local and regional markets; (b) increased exports, especially
of high-value products; (c) improved capabilities of the Regional Chambers of Agriculture and of
subsectoral professional organizations to provide demand-driven support services to private
entrepreneurs. The project would also reduce the incidence of poverty and enhance women's
participation in and benefits from development, since most of the project's potential beneficiaries
would be small entrepreneurs, many of them women, already involved in agricultural processing.
25.   Risks. The project's main risks are: (a) its reliance upon Chambers of Agriculture and
professional organizations which are still weak and inexperienced; (b) poor management by the
Agency and misuse of its autonomy in project implementation; and (c) the abandonment by
Government of its present policy of support to the private sector. These risks constitute another set
of reasons for the pilot format of this project. Precautions taken to minimize these risks include
provisions for: (a) great selectivity in choosing organizations participating in implementation; (b)
stringent management rules and procedures, similar to those already used successfully in the
"AGETIPE" projects in the region, especially with regard to sub-contracting procedures; and (c)
strong monitoring of management performance, intensive technical supervision, and regular
evaluation of beneficiaries' response.
26.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

more slowly than expected at appraisal. Due to the
devaluation of the CFA Franc, certain expenses
denominated in local currency have decreased in

to be revised.

Progress was related to project financial
management issues, which led to a suspension of
disbursements of the credit as of October 1, 1994.
However, the Government has taken appropriate
corrective actions and, consequently, the suspension
of the credit has been lifted as of April 7, 1995 and
