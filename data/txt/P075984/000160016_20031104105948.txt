I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The broad objective of the ESSP is to mitigate the deterioration of services brought about by the inability
of central institutions and municipalities to meet their non-salary operating costs. The program will
provide support through the direct procurement of works, equipment, services and supplies and also
through direct cash transfers. Its scope would be limited to non-salary operating cost deficits and it
would, therefore, ensure that expenditures financed will be accounted as part of the overall
macro-economic fiscal framework of the Palestinian Authority.

Program Components

The President of the Palestinian Authority established an Inter-Ministerial Committee to work with the
Bank and other donors on identifying needs of the various social service delivery ministries and
municipalities. The needs have been grouped together to correspond to various sectors and these will
constitute the various components of the ESSP program. The needs of the Municipalities have been
defined along service packages, bearing in mind that the specific needs of municipalities may differ. The
actual distribution of funds across municipalities has taken into account criteria that the Ministry of
Local Government has established, with the assistance of donors including the World Bank, for targeting
donor assistance. These criteria include poverty rates, degree of impact of the crisis on the budgetary
situation of each municipality and the community it is serving; and, the level of donor funding that
municipalities have received.

The Inter-ministerial committee also identified needs which included cash transfers and cannot be
financed by the World Bank but have been included in the overall program for potential financing by
donors with fewer restrictions. This includes the social welfare payments under the Ministry of Social
