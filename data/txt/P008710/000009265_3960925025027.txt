PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - CRAIOVA CHEMICAL PROJECT
(LOAN 1634-RO)
PREFACE
The Bank approved a loan of US$40 million equivalent in December
1978, to Banca de Investitii of Romania (Borrower) to assist in the
financing of the Craiova Chemical Project implemented by the Craiova
Enterprise (Beneficiary).
The Project was part of Romania's plans for increasing rapidly
the domestic chemical capacity, for both local consumption and exports, by
putting to more economic use its natural gas resources. The individual
constituent plants included in t1.e Project were commissioned over a period
of time from 1983 to 1985.
After the commissioning of the major production plants, Bank
staff visited Romania in November 1984 to initiate preparation of the
Project Completion Report (PCR). A further mission visited Romania in
February 1986 to finalize the preparation of the PCR with Banca de
Investitii. The Borrower's PCR is also attached. Further comments from
the Borrower were received in December 1986 and have been taken account of
in the preparation of this report.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The project is a part of the overall Romanian strategy for more
economic use of its natural gas resources. It is an extension and
modernization of the preexisting Craiova Chemical complex and includes
facilities to produce methanol, acetic acid, acetic anhydride, vinyl
acetate, polyvinyl acetate and ethyl acetate (paras. 1.01-1.02, 2.02-2.04).
2.        The Bank loan of US$40 million financed roughly 57% of the total
foreign exchange cost ard covered 21% of the total financing needs for the
project (para.1.03).
3.        The project was completed in December 1985, four years later than
planned. The most important reasons for the delays were: the lack of
manpower in construction due to a switching in national priorities in favor
of power projects; late delivery of locally supplied goods;
technical problems with machines leading to a need for their replacement;
modifications of construction technologies halfway through implementation;
difficulties in making Romanian procurement procedures conform to the
Bank's guidelines; and the problems of integrating new facilities in an
existing crowdee site (paras.3.01-3.17).
4.        The commissioning of the units has been undertaken successfully
with the exception of the carbon monoxide (CO) separation and the acetic
acid units, where technical problems still persist (paras. 3.14-3.17,
¶        4.01-4.03).
5.        The financial and economic rates of return are significantly
lower than estimated at appraisal.  The financial rate of return (FRR) is
re-estimated at 15% compared to 212 at appraisal and the economic rate of
return at 72 compared to the original 16%. The declines are due to the
implementation delays, persisting technical problems in some of the units
and input and output price changes (paras. 5.01-5.09).
6.        Lessons to be learnt include:  (i) being more realistic in the
future in assessing implementation schedules of projects in the Romanian
planning system (il.) the need for early missions after loan approval to
explain and speed up procurement procedures; and (iII) making explicit
provision in the Bank loan for post-startup technical assistance (paras.
6.01-6.03).



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Romania has had an established petroleum and gas-based industry
based on its vast hydrocarbon resources since the 19th century. In the
early 1960s, as gas production was levelling off, the Government began
restricting new gas connections solely to the chemical Industry, while
converting utilities and Industries using methane gas as fuel to other
energy forms, in a policy effort to increase the value added in the use of
methane gas. Throughout the 1960s, much of the methane gas was used by the
chemical industry to produce nitrogenous fertilizers and carbon black;
beginning in the late '609 the country's various five-year plans placed
emphasis on use of methane gas for the production of methanol, acetylene
and a wide variety of specialized chemical products. The Craiova Chemical
Project, part of the Government's 1976-80 five-year plan, was among such
new investments*
1.02      The Project was designed to absorb about 360 million cubic meters
of methane gas being di7erted from fuel to chemical feedstock use, thus
increasing the amount of gas processed into chemica's by 11%. The Project
consisted of the installation of an acetylene unit, a unit for the
separation of carbon monoxide (CO), the expansion of existing vinyl acetate
and polyvinyl acetate units, and the construction of several new plants for
chemical products including methanol, acetic acid, acetic anhydride and
ethyl acetate. The project's output was primarily designed for import
substitution, although some exports were envisaged during the initial years
of operation to permit early full utilization of the project's facilities.
Of total production in the first three years of operation, about 30 percent
was expected to be exported; as local demand increased the percentage of
output destined for export was expected to decline to about 8 percent by
1985.
1.03      The project scope was unchanged during implementation.  Actual
project cost was US$183.6 million compared to US$151.5 million estimated at
appraisal. Total financing required, including interest during construc-
tion, was US$192.7 mil'lion compared to US$156.6 million at appraisal.
Actual foreign exchange cost was US$70 million compared to the appraisal
estimate of US$60 million. The Bank loan of US$40 million financed 57% of
the actual foreign exchange cost (compared to the appraisal estimate of
67%) and 22% of the total project cost, in comparison with 26% as estimated
at appraisal.
1.04      The project was completed during the fourth quarter of 1985, four
years later than planned. Serious and as yet unresolved technical problems
remain in the carbon monoxide separation unit and in the acetic acid plant,
resulting in low capacity utilization in these units and in downstream
units which depend on them for feedstocks. Early assessment of the
persisting problems and quick solutions to them will be necessary to permit
full realization of the project's benefits.



II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.   Project Preparation and Appraisal, Loan Approval and Effectivenees
2.01      The project was identified by a Batak mission in May 1976.  During
preparation, the Bank recommended changes of scope to eliminate a polyvinyl
alcohol plant and a butyl acetate plant which preliminary assessment
had shown were uneconomic. The project was appraised in March 1978. The
Bank loan of US$40 million was approved in December 1978 and signed in
January 1979. The original loan closing date was December 31 1982;
disbursement started in the third quarter of 1979 and was completed in the
first quarter of 1983. The loan was made to Banca de Investitii, as the
the borrower, with the guarantee of the Government of Romania; the loan
proceeds were channelled to the Craiova Enterprise as the beneficiary. The
Bank loan had a maturity of 14 years, including four years of grace, at an
interest rate of 7.35X per annum (p.a.) plus a commitment charge of .75%
p.a.
B. Project Description and Technologies
2.02      The Project was designed to divert about 360 million m3 of
methane gas from fuel to chemical feedstock uses, thuis increasing the
amount of gas processed in Romania into higher value chemicals by 11%. It
was designed so as to achieve the best possible utilization of the
feedstock by existing and new facilities incorporated in the Project.
About half of the methane stream is directed to a new acetylene unit which
replaced a pre-existing acetylene plant based on the now non-competitive
carbide technology. One-third of the carbon contained in this stream of
gas is thus transformed into acetylene and thence into a variety of high
value organic chemicals. The remaining two-thirds of the carbon is
transferred in the form of off gas to other units, mainly to existing
ammonia/urea facilities; the composition of the offgas permits direct use
by the ammonia reactor and thus allows the replacement of pure methane
gas. The other half of the original methane stream is used for the
production of methanol. Existing capacities of vinyl acetate and poly-
vinyl acetate were expanded correspondingly, and new plants for the
production of acetic acid, acetic anhydride, ethyl acetate and methanol
were built as part of the project. A new plant for the separation of
carbon-monoxide (CO) provides CO to the acetic acid plant and hydrogen to
the already existing butanol plant.
2.03      The annual production capacities of the units in the project and
the percentages of output transferred to other units in the Craiova complex
or sold outside the complex are shown below:

A flowsheet of the integrated production structure showing the various
process stages and the use of the methane gas, including its by-products
and the various downstream uses, is shown in Annex 1.
2.04      The project location was chosen so as to make the best possible
use of pre-existing investments in the complex, especially the existing
methane pipeline from the Transylvanian fields to Craiova, and other
infrastructure facilities. The technologies for the CO-purification, the
acetic acid and the acetic anhydride plants were imported under licenses of
firms in USA, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German
Democratic Republic (GDR). The other technologies were obtained
domestically.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      Inasmuch as the project is enabling Romania to divert 360 million
cubic meters of methane gas from fuel uses to production of higher-value
chemicals, the project can be said to have met its principal objective.
However with the delay of four years in project completion, and the
persistent technical problems in the CO separation unit and the acetic acid
plant, resulting in low capacity utilization of these units and in
downstream units whxich depend on raw materials from there, the project
cannot be said to have achieved its full economic benefit potential. Only
when the technical problems in the two units are resolved, permitting full
capacity utilization, can the project be considered to have successfully
achieved its objectives.

a/  The unit was started up in 1983 with the reactor coils originally
supplied; these, due to technical problems, had to be replaced later,
leeding to the new start-up in 1985 (para.3.06).
3.03      The project was completed during the fourth quarter of 1985, four
years later than planned. Among the major reasons for the delay were (i)
organization of procurement and conclusion of contracts, due to the
complexity of the project; (ii) technical problems with some items of
equipment leading to their replacement, the major liability for which is
still in dispute; (iii) modifications in domestically-procured technology
midway through implementation; and (iv) problems of integrating new
facilities in existing units, which affected procurement and installation
schedules. Other factota contributing to the delay were (i) lack of
skilled construction manpower, particularly in 1982, due to the switching
of national priorities; and (ii) late delivery of some items of
domestically procured equipment.
3.04      Dela   in Procurement: Shortly after loan approval, the Bank
organized a supervision mission to work with the Romanian authorities
responsible for project procurement on preparation of instructions to
bidders, bid invitations, specifications and evaluation procedures. The
Bank also carried out procurement seminars in Romania, while supervision
missions focussed on procurement issues. Nonetheless, procurement
difficulties, attributed by the Borrower to the technical complexity of the



- 5 -
project and to the large quantities of equipment and materials required for
implementation, resulted in an estimated delay impact (compared with
appraisal estimates) on the project of about 18-24 months. There were
several main causes for this overall delay as described below.
3.05      Technical Problems with Delivered Equipment:  Technical problems
were experienced with some of the equipment for two of the units. These
problems, according to the beneficiary, were observed after delivery. The
steel coils for the acetic anhydride unit were reportedly defective upon
delivery, necessitating their replacement and resulting in an estimated
30-month delay in the start-up of this unit. Technical difficulties have
also been experienced with the CO-separation unit and the carbon monoxitde
compressors in the acetic acid plant; these difficulties have yet to be
corrected and are affecting the capacity utilization of the above-mentioned
plants, and consequently downstream units depending on them for their
feedstocks.
3.06      Modifications in Technology Mid-way Throh Implementation: The
technology for the ethyl acetate unit was procured locally from Romanian
sources. Mid-way through the unit's construction, the technology was
substantially modified, resulting in delays in the commissioning of the
unit by more than 2 years beyond the planned schedule.
3.07      Problems of Integration of New Facilities with Existing Units:
The integration of new facilities into an existing site, chosen to make the
most use of existing infrastructzre, turned out to be cost-intensive and
time-consuming; the possibilities of using heavy construction equipment in
an already crowded site were very limited, necessitating a high degree of
manual work in construction.
3.08      Lack of Construction Manpower:  After the second energy crisis,
and in particular during 1981/82, skilled construction manpower throughout
Romania, by Government directive, was drafted to the construction of
electric power projects to the detriment of other construction projects.
The Craiova Chemical project was no exception. Although it has not been
possible to estimate its impact on the project, this lack of sufficient
construction manpower was a contributing factor to the overall delay.
C.       etaneent
< s,        The Industrial Central for Chemical Fertilizers (CIICH), a
holding company structure under the Ministry of Chemical Industry, had the
general responsibility for project implementation. The Craiova Chemical
Complex, the beneficiary, was in charge of the day to day implementation
supervision. Technological design arrangements were handled centrally by
the Technical Engineering and Design Institute (IITPIC), the engineering
institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry. ROMCHWIM, and since 1980,
Industrialimportexport, the agencies organized under the Ministry of
Chemical Industry were responsible for procurement. Physical construction
of the project was the responsibility of various construction enterprises
under the Ministry of Industrial Construction. Although in the course of



- 6 -
project implementation the Ministry of Chemical Industry was split into the
Ministry of Chemical Industry and the M4inistry of Petrochemical Industries,
this did not materially affect the project implementation management
arrangements.
D.   Employment and Training
3.10      The project is estimated to require about 1,040 people at full
capacity (600 operators, 400 auxiliary workers and about 40 engineers).
This is slightly less than estimated at appraisal. Nine workers and 8
engineers were trained in the FRG, GDR and USA, in the licensor companies.
Although only about 50% of the Bank loan funds assigned to training were
used, (10 million lei), the Craiova management is satisfied that the
training received abroad and in other Romanian plants is adequate for its
needs.
E. Sources of Procurement
3.11      Out of the total cost of equipment and services financed by the
Bank, foreign suppliers accounted for roughly 52% and Romanian deliveries
for 48%. Detailed sources of procurement by country and amounts in US$
equivalent are shown in the following table.

F.   Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.'2      With the exception of (i) the steel coils for the acetic
anhydride plant and (ii) the carbon monoxide compressors for the acetic
acid plant and the CO-separation unit, the borrower and the beneficiary
were satisfied with the performance of equipment, consultants, contractors
and suppliers.



- 7 -
3.13      The steel coils for the acetic anhydride plant were delivered by
a foreign 3upplier in 1980 and installed two years later. Prior to
installation, severe cracks in all coils were discovered. The supplier and
the enterprise could not agree on the responsibility and the liability of
the necessary coil replacement. The coils were later replaced by spare
parts purchased from other external sources, resulting in a satisfactory
plant start-up in 1985. The dispute between the original P"pplier and
the Romanian authorities is awaiting international arbitration.
3.14      The CO-purification technology was procured under a license from
a foreign firm. Due to the unresolved technical problems, the unit has
been operating well below nameplate capacity. The resulting shortfall in
the supply of carbon monoxide to the downstream acetic acid plant
contributes to the latter's low capacity utilization and is affecting
flexibility in operating downstream facilities (vinyl acetate, polyvinyl
acetate and acetic anhydride plants).
3.15      The acetic acid plant, working with foreign technology and
equipment, has never worked satisfactorily since its commissioning.
Both the licensor's and the equipment supplier's businesses have been
subsequently taken over by other firms. Negotiations between the Romanian
authorities and the firms involved, aiming at technical assistance and
remedying the technical problems, had failed by November 1984. In March
1985, the Bank tried, in the interest of the project, to encourage the
Romanians and the licensor/supplier to solve the technical problems
urgently while reserving their position as to the corresponding legal
liability. However, in February 1986 the Bank was informed that no new
negotiations had taken place.
G.   Capital Costs. Financing and Disbursements
3.16      As shown below, the actual total capital costs of $192.7 million
is $35.9 million or 23% above the appraisal cost estimate. The project
cost overrun, excluding interest during construction, represented 21%.
Comparison of appraised and actual capital costs in Lei yields a project
cost overrun of 19% and a total cost overrun of 20%.

3.17      For engineering, license, and technical assistance, the overrun
of 30X is explained by the technology modifications in the locally-procured
ethyl acetate plant and additional safety measures in the acetylene plant.
The high overrun in erection cost is due to price increases in materials
and to wage increases, in addition to supplementary work in the acetylene
and acetic acid units.  The overruns in administrative and preoperational
expenses and interest during construction reflect the implementation time
overruns and price increases.
3.18      In the original financing plan given in the appraisal report,
US$40 million equivalent was to be financed by the Bank loan and US$12.9
million equivalent by a FRG supplier's credit. Except for a slight chaage
to $11.5 million equivalent in the supplier's credit, the only change in
the actual financing compared to the plan is that the cost overruns of $36
million were met from Romanian sources, increasing the Romanian financing
contribution from the appraisal estimate of 66% to about 72%.

allocation of the Bank loan, by categories.

Instead of 40% of the total loan, actual disbursement under category
"Imported Equipment or Local Supply" was 48% as a result of Romanian
suppliers winning more supply contracts than expected.
IV. OPERATING PER70RMANCE
A.   Commissioning and Production Build-up
4.01      The table on page 17 shows the appraisal estimate of the
production build-up by products in the first years after commissioning of
the plants until full capacity is reached, and compares this estimate with
the current Romanian estimate and the current Bank estimate (for 1986
onwards). The Romanian estimate assumes full capacity production for all
products for 1986 and onwards. However, in the light of the persisting
technical problems in late February 1986 in the CO-separation and acetic
acid units, it seems highly unlikely that full capacity can be reached in
1986 and 1987 in the production of acetic acid and the offgases (hydrogen
from the CO-separation unit, residual methane in hydrogen and purge gas
from acetic acid). It is therefore conservatively assumed in the Bank
estimate that full capacity will not be reached until 1988; the capacity
utilization of the acetic acid plant in 1986 and 1987 is estimated to be
68% and 83%, respectively. It is furthermore assumed that out of thhe total
acetic acid production in 1986 and 1987, the complete feedstock needs of
the vinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetate and acetic anhydride plants are met,
so that their production for sale is not affected by the problems in the
acetic acid plant. This acetic acid feedstock supply to downstream units
reduces the acetic acid production available for sale as shown in the
table on the following page.
B. Market Information
4.02      Section 3.02 of the Loan Agreement contained the obligation of
the Borrower to carry out and submit to the Bank a study on domestic and
export market potential for methanol and export strategies for the products



- 10 -
of the Craiova Chemical Complex by December 1979. After extension of the
deadline, the study was received by the Bank in September 1980, reviewed
and found to be satisfactory. During the Bank completion mission, meetings
with representatives of the foreign trade enterprise Industrialimportexport
were requested to review the latest developments in the market for these
products, especially in the export market, but the meetings could not be
arranged. Historical current and forecast information about the relevant
markets was promised but has not yet been received. Discussions with
representatives of the Banca de Investitii, the Ministry of Chemical
Industries and the Craiova Central provided only limited insight. Verbal
statements indicate that the domestic offtake of products from the project
is assured by contracts and current plan targets. Supporting details,
however, have not been received to verify the local market demand. The
export market for methanol, acetic acid and polyvinyl acetate are thin and
prices depressed. Methanol is the only significant export product (80,000
tons out of 172,000 tons production for sale), while acetic acid (6,000
tons out of 28,000) and polyvinyl acetate (4,000 tons out of 13,000 tons)
are relatively minor.
C. Environmental Aspects
4.03      The Romanian authorities have stated that all the project's
production units comply with the Romanian standards of environment
protection, and also comply with west European standards. The results
of an analysis of a Craiova-based pollution control center carried out by a
Bank engineer in 1981 were satisfactory. Pollution control sample results
in Craiova are routinely sent to WHO.
V. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A. Financial Performance
1. Financial Situation of the Craiova Enterprise
5.01      Table 2, Annex 2  shows balance sheets of the Craiova Enterprise
from 1978 to 1980, and Table 3, Annex 2 gives Project-related income
statements for 1983-1997, based on Romanian indications and downscaled
production assumptions for 1986 and 1987 (para 4.01 above). The State
finances, through the Banca de Investitii, the investment program of the
Craiova Central and its enterprises. Since the introduction of the "New
Economic Measures" in 1979 each enterprise is now expected to cover its
operating costs out of its revenues and to repay investment funds provided
by the Central and the State Budget. In addition, the new measures require
enterprises to build-up equity, a development fund for modernization and
debottlenecking, a worker's benefit participation fund and other uses from
their revenues.
5.02      The Borrower has pointed out that the new measures have increased
the competence of enterprises is self-management and self financing,
leading to a closer relationship between the efforts of the enterprise and
its financial results. Nonetheless, domestic output prices are normally
set on a cost-plus basis and domestic market consumption is ensured by

official decisions in the national planning syetem. It is therefore
difficult to assess the project and enterprise performance in the normal
manner ae in other Bank industrial projects. As in previous completion
reports, therefore, financial ratios for the enterprise have not been
calculated and additional financial analysis has not been carried out since
this would have little meaning in the context described above.
2.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
5.03      The estimated financial rate of return has been calculated as
151, compared with 21% at appraisal; sensitivity analysis shows the rate
of return fluctuates between 12% and 17% when sales revenues and operating
costs (in 1986 US constant dollars) are assumed to vary by 10% up and down
for the period 1986 to 1997. The corresponding sensitivity range at
appraisal was 17% to 241. Assumptions used in the calculations and results
are detailed in Annex 2. The lower than expected financial rate of return
and sensitivity results are due to implementation delays and the persisting
technical problems leading to a slower capacity build-up.
B. Economic Performance
5.04      The economic rate of return of the project is calculated at 7% as
compared to 161 at the time of appraisal. Sensitivity tests were carried
out assuming that the operating costs and sales revenues vary by 10% from
1986 onwards, yielding a range of 31 to 10% for the economic rate of
return. Again, the lower than expected economic rate of return is due to
implementation delays and low capacity utilization in the acetic acid
plant, as detailed in Table 2, Annex 3.
5.05      Although some of the financial prices in 1986 have been brought
closer to the economic prices since 1978, comparison between financial and
economic prices as of 1986 shows persisting differentials especially for
vinyl acetate, ethyl acetate, acetylene, methane, diesel oil, power and
industrial water, contributing to the difference of 8 percentage points
between the financial and economic rates of return. Financial and economic
prices are given in Table 1. of Annex 3.
5.06      It has been difficult to arrive at accurate long term economic
prices for the project's outputs in view of the depressed market and the
range of products, for which price forecasts are infrequent. Prices are
based on current prices obtained from the Craiova Central, published
sources and consultants. Prices at the time of appraisal were obtained
from three stuzdies specifically prepared for the Bank. The table below
compares economic prices as of 1978 and 1986:

5.07       Economic prices of power, feedstock and transportation are Bank
staff estimates. Financial prices have been used for labor and chemicals
as these items are of lesser significance in the build-up of costs;
financial prices for these items are not believed to differ significantly
from economic prices.
5.08      A key assumption in the estimated economic return is the value of
methane, the most important input accounting for about half of the
project's variable costs. As stated in the appraisal report, the most
attractive alterrative use of methane in Romania is still as fuel in power
plants. Due to lack of current data on the economic cost of lignite, which



- 14 -
could be the alternative fuel in power plants replacable by methane, fuel
oil price was retained as the basis for the methane value. A crude oil
price per barrel of US$15 over the life of the project has been aS sumed,
leading to a methane value in calorific terms of US$69 per 1000 m .
5.09      The assumptions used in the economic analysis, including the
detailed price assumptions, are given in Annex 3e
VI. LESSONS LEARNED
6.01      Like many Romanian projects initiated in the late 1970s,
including other Bank assisted projects in Romania, the Craiova project took
long to complete. This was so despite the advanced stage of preparation at
the time of appraisal, the considerable prior experience of the enterprise
in similar projects, and the high priority given to the project by the
planning authorities. The appraisal team anticipated the problems which
were foreseeable but, in retrospect, more time contingency should have been
allowed by estimating longer delays in the implementation of this complex
project.
6.02      The length of time required for the implementation of procurement
procedures was a major reason for delay. The priority given after the
second oil crisis to energy production projects at the expense of the
Craiova project was a further cause, but other factors, including
modification of technology midway through completion, technical problems
with some equipment after delivery and difficulties of integrating new
facilities in existing units, were major causes for delay.
6.03      In summary, the lessons learned are essentially three:  (i) the
importance of assessing the impact of the national planning goals, in
situations of capacity shortage, on the implementation schedules for
individual projects, (ii) the importance of starting procurement/implemen-
tation arrangeirents as early as appraisal and continuing with intensive
supervision efforts during the initial project stages, to work with the
newly established project team, particularly in expediting procurement, and
(iii) the need to ensure that foreign exchange funds can be made available
to correct technical problems which might arise after start-up. Providing
a portion of future Bank loans for post-start-up technical assistance,
equipment required for repairs or replacement might be considered in this
context.
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The Bank's economic analysis of the project at appraisal assisted
the Romanians in understanding the use of economic prices. During the
preparation of the project, however, differences of opinion on project
scope caused some delay in project appraisal. In the end some components
that were not economic were dropped from the project,



- 15 -
7.02      The Bank's continuing efforts to help the enterprise overcome
technical problems are hampered by the fact that the loan is fully
disbursed, no new loans or technical assistance funds are currently
available and both the World Bank and the borrower, Banca de
Investitli, do not normally continue active supervision after the loan is
fully disbursed and the Completion Report issued. Until the current
technical problems are resolved, the Bank should continue to follow up on
the situation.

ROMANIA: CRA;OVA CHEMICAL PROJECT
Assu!Mtions Used in the Economic Analysis
A. General
1.        All prices used in the economic rates of return for the project
have been calculated in constant 1986 dollars. All benefits and costs for
tradeable items have been determined by using prevailing international
prices (Western Europe) with the assumption that these prices will remain
stable in 1986 dollars in the foreseeable future. For non-tradeable items,
domestic prices have been adjusted to reflect the international price
levels or production costs in comparator countries. Labor, which accounts
for only 4X of total operating costs, has not been shadow priced and its
financial cost has been used. Prices used are summarized in Table 1 of
this annex.
B. Capital Costs
2.        The capital costs for calculating the financial rate of return
have been used in the economic analyses, after deducting Lei 39.6 million
of duties.
C.  Operating Costs
3.        About half of the total variable cost of the project comes from
methane. The economic price of methane has been determined by assuming the
use of the gas as a fuel in power plants. Methane replaces either locally
available lignite or fuel oils from crude oil refining. The appraisal
report used the lignite equivalent production cost as the basis for one of
the sensitivity cases. However, current information about lignite
production costs in Romamia are not available to the Bank and comparisons
with other countries give only a rough approximation. The fuel oil price
was thus retained as for calculating the base case. In the light of the
current uncertainties in o'l price projections, a crude oil price of US$15
per barrel over the life of the project has been assumed, leading to a
methane value in calorific terms of US$69 per 1000 i3.
4.        The economic costs of electricity have been assumed as U345.5 per
kwh, which is in line with Bank experience with power production from
lignite and hydroelectric sources in comparator countries.
5.        The economic cost of the input polyvinyl alcohol has been assumed
as US$1,700 per ton as compared to US$1,500 at appraisal, based on the
present international price level. This is significantly lower than the
Romanian financial price equivalent of US$3,919 per ton of polyvinyl
alcohol. Other chemicals, labor, maintenance and other operating costs
have been priced according to Romanian financial prices.

D.   Benefits
6.        With the exception of methanol, only minor quantities of the
project's output are destined for export, the bulk being Import
substitution. The economic (ex-factory) prices are shown in Table 1 of
this annex.  As stated in para 3.06, eo-factory prices have been derived
from West Europe delivered prices by taking Into account transportation
costs and EEC tariffs.
E. Project Life
7.        It has been assumed that units which were started up before 1985,
will produce until 1997 together with the units commissioned in 1985.

sl  The attached Romanian report assumes a full capacity production for all products in 1986 and onwards.  In the light of
persisting technical problems in late February 1986, it seems highly unprobable that full capacity in the acetic acid unit
can be achieved in 1986. It is thus conservatively assumed that full capacity cannot be reached before 1988. Since the
downstream units vinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetate and acetic anhydride plants are assumed to reach their full capacity in
1987, the full acetic acid int-.-.ediate needs are to be delivered out of the acetic acid production, which reduces the
acetic acid production available for sale as shown above.
b/ The off-gas volumes have been scaled doun according to the production level of the units from where they come.
e According to indications from Craiova Enterprise engineers, 601 of the foregone finaneial acetic acid production value in
1986-1987 corresponds to the value of saved inputs (variable operating costs) because of the gradual production build-up
In the acetic acid unit. The variable operating costs have been reduced correspondingly.

In order to prevent the wvter pollution there Ws been
installed bio-treatement outfit.
Due to the manufacture tecimolog7 used,there have been
eliminated the pollution problems*The two siz admission ways
to the air separation plantsare placed at 3 k1m fom one another,
thus eliminating the risk of hydrocarbon presence.
Also,the acetylene plant is provided with an adequate
ventilation and automatic shut-off devices aCcor41ng to the

COMbENTS RECEIVED FROM THE BORROWER
Mr. Otto Maiss
Division Chief
Operations Evaluation Department
WORLiD BANK
Re: Draft Completion Report for the Expalsion of tka
Oraiova Chemical Plant (Loan 1634.-Q))
Dear Mr. Maiss:
To your letter of September the 23rd 1986 and in addition
of out telex of November the 1st 1986, we confirm that we have
carefully analysed the draft of the Completion Report for the
Oraiova Chemical Projeoct and which was drawn up by the World Bank.
On tb basis of the respective analyses we send you below
some comments and suggestions we present having the wish to show
as real possible the conditions of the implementation of the Project
the reasons for delays and also other aspects concerning the achie-
vement of the Project, and which we kindly ask you to consider in
drawing up the final form of the Completion Report,
1. As concerns the reasons for delays in implementing
the Project and commissioning the Project facilities, showed in
the Bank's Report in Chapter I,para.l104 and Chapter III B, para,
3.03, 3.04 and 3.05, we oonsider that the main reasons have been
showed in the Draft Report of the Investment Bank in Chapter III P
and have been largely discussed with the Bank misston in February
1986,
We also consider that the delays in organizing the IOB
and concluding the contracts, have been determined by the technical
complexity of the Project, by the great volume and number of equip-
ment and materials required for the implementation of the Project
and not because of the difficulties caused by aligning the procu-
rement Guidelines of the Bank with the Romanian procurement practi-
ces or by different opinions concerning the matter of proaurement.



ATTACHMENT II

Under these circumstances, the projections at the time of
Appraisal concerning the procurement have been too optimistic
(estimated - 24 months, actual - 5o months),
As a result, we would request to delete the respective
comments included in Chapter I, pare lO4, Chapter III B, pare
3.03 and Chapter III S, para 3.12,
Also, the delayed delivery of some items by the local
suppliers, can not be considered as one of the major reasons
of the delayed implementation of the Project, because such cases
occured for a small amount of materials for errection and small
value equipment and which had impact only upon two facilities.
The major cause which has to be emphasized within the
Report, and which unfortunately created much problems in the
implementation of the Project, in commtssioning and even at
present in operating some facilities, was the wrong delivery by
the foreign suppliers, from the point of view of construction
or concept of some equipment, of which we can mention:
- the delivery by welders company of Belgium of 12
steel coils of poor quality which determined the delayed commis-
sioning of the acetic anhydride plant with over 30 months and
the additional expense for the procurement of the respective
equipment from other suppliers;
- the delivery with construction and concept defaults
of the low pressure compressors of the acetic acid and CO sepa-
ration facilities.
After the commiusioning of the acetic acid and CO
separation facilities, besides the repeated broke of the equip-
ment supplied by the foreign suppliers, have occured also very
serious technological cocept defaults which have detenmined the
under capacity operating of these facilities and additional costs
for materials and for the correction of the defaults.
The defaults which occured in some imported equipment
and also the conceptual default of the technology of acetic acid

plant,                                       have created signi-
ficant difficulties in the commissioning of the Project and in
achieving the provided benefits. Some of these problems, 88
you are aware, have not been settled even now.
As concerns the influence of non ensuring the labor
for thu works requested, it is necessary to note that such gap
existed only in some periods, especially in 1982 and,even they
contributed in some way at the delays, it can not be considered
that this was a major fact in delaying the Project.
2. In connection with solving the technical problems
of the acetic acid plant, Chapter III F,para 3.17, we request
to delete the last phrase ("although Craiova Central, the bene-
ficiary is interested in solving the technical problems, the
Borrower . . . .  up to the end of the paragraph), taking into
consideration that the Investment Bank is not directly included
in the contractual relations between the foreign suppliers and
the beneficiary.
3. The statement of Chapter V A, pare 5.02 according
with the fact that the financial results of the Enterprises are
the direct result of the official regulations is not according
to the real facts,As it was explained to the other missions of
the Bank too, the measures which have been taken after 1980 to
improve the economic mechanism, of the planning and price system,
have determined the increased competences and self-management of
the Enterprises in self-financing and self-management. Also,
these measures have determined a close connection between the
efforts of the Enterprise and their financial results.
The domestic market consumtions are established on
the basis of annual plans, taking into consideration the real
requirements of the Enterprise and the possibilities to cover
these from domestic production and in addition from imports,
x
x         x
In accordance with the comments and suggestion pre-
sented above, we would kindly ask you to review also the con-
clusions of Chapter IV "Lessons to be learned", esepecially
those of para 6.02.

On tlhis occasion, we would like to ask you to modify
a small error of Annex 2 - Table 2, respetively to write 42.9
instead of 47.9 for depreciation for 1984.
With best regards,
