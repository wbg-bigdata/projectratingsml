I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Romania has requested a Bank Loan of US$40 million
equivalent for the expansion and modernization of the Craiova Chemical Complex,
located about 10 km west of Craiova (Map 13591).  The expansion will produce
about 350,000 tons per year (tpy) of a variety of chemical products, such
as methanol, acetic acid, acetic anhydride, vinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetate
and ethyl acetate, using locally produced gas as feedstock. A glossary of the
technical terms used in this report is given in Annex 1. The plant's output
is destined mainly for the domestic market. Except for the acetic acid
and an auxiliary carbon-monoxide (CO) separation unit, technology will be
based on know-how previously purchased and adapted to Romanian conditions or
on know-how locally developed. Preliminary work for the implementation of the
Project has begun, and commissioning of the various plants will be spread over
a period of two years, from December 1979 to December 1981.
1.02      Total financing required for the Project is estimated at Lei 2,819
million (US$157 million), including Lei 1,075 million (US$60 million) in
foreign exchange. The proposed Bank Loan would, therefore, provide 26% of
the total and 67% of the foreign exchange financing needs. US$12.9 million
equivalent will be provided through a supplier's credit from the Federal
Republic of Germany and will be used to finance the acetic acid plant.
The Government will provide the remainder of the funds required. The Project
was approved by the Council of Ministers in October 1977.
1.03      The Project was first identified by a Bank mission to Romania in
May 1976, which, from a list of nine industrial projects, gave this project,
together with three others, priority for Bank support. A Project Preparation
Mission in June 1977 recommended that further design work, including some
change of scope, be carried out before appraisal. The Project was appraised
in March 1978 by a mission consisting of Messrs. E. Tortorelli (Chief) and
P. Lietard, of the Industrial Projects Department, and Mr. F. Pederzani,
Consultant. Additional work on the Project's market aspects was carried
out in June 1978 by Mr. D. Caplin, also of the Industrial Projects Department.
II. THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY AND THE BORROWER
A.   Ministry of Chemical Industries
2.01      In Romania, manufacturing of chemicals comes under the Ministry of
Chemical Industries. The organizational structure of the chemical industry
has the same three-step hierarchy as all industrial sectors in Romania, com-
prising of the Technical Ministry, the Industrial Central and the Enterprise.
The Ministry is responsible for the planning and performance of its sector
for which it also approves proposed investments for subsequent submission
to the Council of State, the highest authority for final approval. The



-2-
Industrial Central directs the operations of all enterprises in its partic-
ular sub-branch of the economy (e.g., Central for Cotton Products, Central
for Glass and Fine Ceramics), allocates production programs and coordinates
purchase of raw materials and domestic sales. Also under the Ministry of
Chemical Industries are the following agencies: The Technological Engineer-
ing and Design Institute for Chemical Industry (IITPIC), the Import Agency
for Chemical Equipment and Technology (ROMCHIM), and Danubiana Export Import
(DANUBEXIM), the agency for the exportation of many chemical products.
2.02      The chemical industry has been one of Romania's most dynamic
sectors. Since 1950, it has attained an average growth of 21% a year and
ranks now in third place with a share of about 12% of total industrial out-
put, behind the machine building and metal working industries (33%) and the
food industries (13%). It absorbed about 13% of total industrial investment
and employed 7% of the industrial labor force in 1976.

The development strategy for the chemical industry has been largely designed to
increase the value added to the country's petroleum and methane gas resources.
Accordingly, the fastest growth has occurred in fertilizers, plastics and
synthetic rubber and fibers. Long-term plans continue to attribute a high
priority to petrochemicals which are expected to account for three-fourths of



- 3 -
the chemical industry output by 1990 against about one-half today. Romania's
main competitive advantages in the chemical field are the availability of
local hydrocarbon resources, considerable experience in chemical engineering,
research and development, and the excellence of its manpower development
programs.
2.03      The industry is largely concentrated in the center and the south
of the country, where large refinery and petrochemical complexes have been
developed around Ploesti and Pitesti to produce a broad range of refinery
products, petrochemical intermediates, and end-products. The Government is
making an effort to locate downstream industries, such as fertilizers, tires,
and synthetic fibers, away from these traditional industrial centers, partly
to promote a more balanced regional development (thus also avoiding indus-
trial congestion) and partly because of greater availability of labor and
housing.
B.   Development of the Chemical Industry Based on Methane Gas Processing
2.04      Romania has had an established chemicals industry since the last
decades of the 19th Century, based on its large petroleum and gas extraction
industry. But it is only in the last 15 years that methane gas processing
has become important. This is largely a result of the policy efforts de-
scribed above under which the Government has restricted new gas connections
solely to the chemical industry and is in the middle of a program converting
utilities and industries from gas-based to coal and lignite-based primary
fuels. As a result, the proportion of methane used as feedstock for the
chemical industry has grown rapidly, and the trend is expected to continue
until 1985 when about 30% of the projected more or less constant total
production of methane gas will be used for processing purposes.

lb    Mission estimates.



2.05      In the 1960s, methane gas was primarily used to produce ammonia
(for nitrogenous fertilizer production) and carbon black. But recently,
while ammonia production has remained predominant, production of methanol
and a wide variety of specialized chemicals has become significantly more
important, and production of carbon black has declined in percentage terms.
This trend is expected to continue in the future with an even stronger
combined emphasis on ammonia and methanol production by 1980, as the table
below shows.

2.06      These five methane-based intermediate products and the many end
products derived from them account for all production of such products in
Romania. There is one ethane-based plant in Romania, which, however, produces
other ethylene-based intermediate and end products, which do not compete with
the methane-based products outlined above. But it is expected that this
situation will change in the future as Romania begins to rely to an increasing
extent on ethylene based products from naphtha derived from imported crude oil.
A major new petrochemical complex at Midia for production of ethylene based
chemicals is planned for 1980. This is both because methane output is not
expected to increase in the future (para 2.04) despite extensive efforts at
secondary and tertiary recovery and because ethylene-based derivatives are
expected to remain cheaper than methane-based processes for the foreseeable
future.  This trend will not affect intermediate and end products derived from
methanol and acetic acid, however, on which the proposed Project is based.
C.   The Central and the Enterprise
2.07      The Industrial Central for Chemical Fertilizers (CIICh, or the
Central) was established in its present form in 1973, with a head office
in Craiova responsible for eleven enterprises (plants) in Romania, including
the project plant at Craiova. The two most recent plants are at Arad and
at Bacau and were completed in 1971 and 1974, respectively. In addition
to the proposed Project, the Central is responsible for executing six other
expansion projects, among which is the Bank financed fertilizer project at
Bacau 1/ and two new projects, all to be completed before the end of the
current Five-Year Plan (1976-80). Details of the existing and new plants
are set out in Annex 2-1. The Central produces a very wide range of products,
over 200 in all, but fertilizer production is overwhelmingly important. The
1/   Loan 1020-RO of June 28, 1974.

organization chart for the Central is shown in Annex 2-2. The Central con-
forms to the standard pattern of industrial organization in Romania with four
functional departments (production, technological, commercial and financial)
and a number of staff departments, including personnel, which are also
directly under the General Manager. The Central's senior staff, under the
Deputy Manager, also acts in responsible positions in one of the enterprises,
in this case the Project Enterprise at Craiova. The Central also provides
technical assistance to all the enterprises under its authority.
2.08      The Project will be an expansion of the existing Craiova Chemical
Complex, the Enterprise at which the head office is situated and Romania's
largest center of methane based chemicals production. The Enterprise is an
established organization with the legal authorities and jurisdictions
normal under Romanian law. An organization chart for the Enterprise is
shown in Annex 2-2. Decision making power at the Enterprise level formally
belongs to the Enterprise's General Assembly which includes all the workers
and normally meets twice a year. A Working People's Executive Committee,
chaired by the Enterprise's General Manager and consisting of elected workers'
representatives and some members of the management, is responsible for opera-
tions. The General and Technical Managers of the Enterprises are responsible
for implementing the decisions of the Executive Committee. This type of
organization has worked satisfactorily in the day-to-day operations of the
Craiova plant to date and is expected to be adequate for the future.
D.   Financial Situation and Prospects of the Central
2.09      The Central is the focus for consolidation of the financial results
of the individual enterprises, the overall surplus or deficit of the Central
then being absorbed within the Ministry's accounts and eventually emerging in
the State budget. As mentioned in previous Bank appraisal reports on Romania,
financial analyses and projections as generally applied by the Bank to eval-
uate the performance and prospects of industrial enterprises are of limited
value in the Romanian system. However, to illustrate the scope of operations
under present price and cost relationships, actual and projected financial
statements for the Central and the Enterprises are shown in Annex 2-3. Those
for the Central are summarized below.

2.10      The figures indicate that the Central's profitability is satisfac-
tory, although the latter reflects not only efficient operations but also
Romanian pricing policies.
E.   The Romanian Financial System and the Borrower
2.11      The State determines all prices, and annual financial plans are
made by the Enterprises and the Industrial Centrals so as to meet the targets
contained in the Annual and Five-Year Plans. Since the primary responsibility
of an Enterprise is to meet established physical targets and inputs and out-
puts are calculated at fixed prices, financial profitability for an Enter-
prise - as related to capital employed and output - is established under
the direction of the Central, and the efficiency of an Enterprise's management
is measured by the achievement of the assigned production and profitability
targets. There has been a historical tendency for prices to remain stable
over long periods of time. This implies not only that there is a lack of
close correlation with shifting supply and demand relationships but also that
relationships between costs and prices become distorted as industry expands
and technology and productivity improve. To remedy these distortions,
periodic price resettings are undertaken for the whole economy, each sector
being reviewed separately. The last such price resetting (since 1963) was
undertaken in 1974-76, and the present internal prices for chemicals - which
are now more closely in line with international prices - are expected to be
in force at least through the end of this Five-Year Plan period (1980).
2.12      The Investment Bank (the Borrower) administers and controls all
investment funds of the State Budget (except for agriculture, water resources
and food processing) and acts as the channel for all sources of major domestic
investment financing in industry. Since 1970, the Investment Bank has also
made credits on its own, though funds available for this purpose are rela-
tively small. The President of the Investment Bank is responsible to the
Minister of Finance, who has wide authority in the planning and financing of
all investments. The Investment Bank has wide ranging responsibilities in
the implementation of projects, reviewing the Techno-Economic Studies before
either approving those projects within its authority or submitting all other
projects to either the Council of Ministers or for Presidential approval by
decree, depending on the size of the investment to be undertaken. It also
controls the flow of funds during project implementation. The Investment Bank
has no specific legal authority that enables it to bring its views to bear
directly on the management of an Enterprise, but it can recommend necessary
operational actions to the Ministry of Finance, which in turn can act through
the Ministry concerned with the project.
2.13      Certain aspects of the management and financial planning of Centrals
and their Enterprises may change in 1979 as a result of Romania's new economic
policy of some greater decentralization of economic and financial planning
responsibility for which guidelines were announced in a major policy speech
by the President of Romania in March 1978. Under the new system, various new
indicators will be introduced to reflect the efficiency of each Enterprise



- 7 -
and provide greater incentive to each Enterprise to increase productivity.
Each Enterprise will have greatly expanded responsibility for planning pro-
duction and marketing of output, for concluding import and export contracts,
and for providing housing and other social amenities for its workers, taking
into account its need to meet the new general indicators outlined earlier.
Each Enterprise will also become financially more self-sufficient and will
enter into borrowing and lending relationships and will be responsible for
repayment of all credit obligations, including those in foreign exchange.
The role of the central Government agencies such as the Centrals, Foreign
Trade Enterprises and the Investment Bank will also change. Details of all
these changes and the timing of their implementation remain to be worked out.
However, the Government has indicated that they will not affect the arrange-
ments negotiated for the proposed Project between the Bank and the Investment
Bank.
III. MARKET AND MARKETING
3.01      The products to be manufactured by the complex are methanol, acetic
acid, vinyl acetate monomer (VAM), polyvinyl acetate (PVA), ethyl acetate
and acetic anhydride. All are intermediates which are used in the manufac-
ture of a wide variety of chemicals, which in turn are further processed
before appearing in products in the capital goods or consumer markets.
Methanol, for instance, is a starting material for formaldehyde, which domi-
nates the thermosetting plastics field; methanol is also used in the manu-
facture of polyisoprene rubber and for dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), a basic
intermediate in the synthetic fibre industry. Recently attention has been
focused on some promising new uses for methanol - as a substitute for gasoline
and as a boiler fuel, and as a substrate in the production of single cell
protein for animal feed. The Project will utilize a new process which uses
methanol as raw material for the production of acetic acid.
3.02      Acetic acid, besides being the raw material from which acetic
anhydride, VAM, PVA and ethyl acetate are manufactured, is a basic chemical
intermediate, and has many applications in dyeing and bleaching of textiles,
and in the manufacture of cellulose acetate; this has long dominated the
artificial fibre industry and is a basic input for the manufacture of photo-
graphic stock. Acetic anhydride also finds outlets in the cellulose acetate
market as well as in the manufacture of aspirin. VAM and PVA are major growth
products, being used in the production of synthetic fibres and textile coat-
ings. The major growth areas have been in the formulation of water-based
paints, which have to a major extent eliminated the older lacquer-based
products, and in the production of a variety of adhesives used in such widely
disparate activities as the manufacture of shoes, furniture, industrial con-
struction and transportation equipment. Ethyl acetate is a versatile solvent
used in chemical processes, and in the paints and coatings industries.



-8-
3.03      The Romanian market for chemicals is still relatively small; the
capacities being installed in the Craiova Project are of a minimum economic
size and exceed current domestic requirements in anticipation of a buildup
of domestic demand. It is therefore expected that part of the Project's
output will have to be exported, at least in the early years of operation.
Of total production over the first three years of operation, about one-third
will be exported, much of it to Comecon countries; by 1985, however, only 8%
of output will be exported.
A.   The Romanian Market
3.04      Domestic consumption of the chemicals produced by the Craiova
Project has grown at about the same rate as the total chemical industry,
itself one of Romania's most dynamic sectors (para 2.02). In terms of
methanol and acetic acid, consumption grew at an annual rate of 20% from
1965-77. This rapid growth rate reflects the Romanian authorities' desire
to establish a firm industrial base for the development of basic end use
industries. A logical policy was adopted by first encouraging the develop-
ment of basic intermediates such as methanol and acetic acid, but by the
early 1970s the consumption of more sophisticated secondary products such
as PVA was already established. For the chemicals to be produced by the
Project, the Romanian authorities plan a rate of growth in consumption of an
average of 16.1% until 1983, with ambitious plans for major new outlets for
methanol in the period 1983-1985 which would bring the overall annual growth
rate from 1977-85 close to the growth rate in the last decade (Annex 3-1).

As the above table indicates, Craiova's output can be classified into two
groups: (i) methanol, and (ii) acetic acid and its derivatives, i.e.,
vinyl acetate monomer (VAM), polyvinyl acetate (PVA), ethyl acetate and
acetic anhydride. The following section describes the domestic market (both
past and future) for the major downstream products which can be made from
these two product groups of intermediate chemicals in preparation for the
discussion (starting with para 3.13) of the past and future Romanian pro-
duction, consumption and exports for Craiova's chemicals themselves, i.e.,
methanol as well as acetic acid and their derivatives.
B.   Domestic Markets and Exports for Downstream Products
1.   Methanol
3.05      The major uses for methanol in the Romanian market are synthetic
resins (via formaldehyde and methyl methacrylate), synthetic rubber (via
polyisoprene) and synthetic fibres (via dimethyl terephthalate (DMT)) as
given in Annex 3-2. A major new outlet for methanol is the planned manu-
facture of single cell protein. The following table shows a summary of end
use patterns for methanol.

- 10 -
3.06      The future growth rate for methanol consumption in synthetic resins
is lower than in the past, reflecting a gradual shift towards thermoplastics
rather than thermosetting resins. Romanian per capita consumption of syn-
thetic resins (excluding polyvinylchloride and polyethylene) is projected
to reach 7 kg in 1985, which is comparable to current per capita consumption
in developed countries. Exports of synthetic resins are planned to increase
at a slightly faster rate than local consumption, so that exports will repre-
sent 60% of total production in 1985 compared with 56% in 1977 (Annex 3-3).
3.07      The use of methanol in synthetic fibres will grow at a faster rate
than total synthetic fibre production as the importance of polyester fibre in
the product mix increases. The Bank is financing one of the new polyester
fibre facilities, which require DMT as a raw material (Cimpulung-Muscel Report
No. 1436-RO dated 5-24-77). That report estimated that Romanian mill con-
sumption of synthetic fibres would reach 231,000 tons in 1985, compared with
the current Romanian projection of 205,000 tons (Annex 3-3). The report also
pointed out that, unless new polyester plants were to be built after those
projected in 1977, substantial fibre imports would be required by 1985. The
Government has now initiated new synthetic fibre projects to come on stream in
the early 1980s with the objective of reducing the net fibre deficit, and
maintaining an export position in synthetic fibres. Planned 1985 exports are
small compared with gross imports into the E.E.C. even during the recent slump
conditions which have been prevailing in Western Europe. Thus, it can be seen
that the projections for methanol requirements in the domestic market, as far
as these end uses are concerned, are reasonable.
3.08      The large tonnage of methanol devoted to synthetic rubber pro-
duction arises from the production of polyisoprene rubbers, which are good
substitutes for natural rubber. Romania is following the precedent of the
USSR in reducing drastically its import of natural rubber and replacing it
with indigenously produced polyisoprene. All methanol from the Craiova
Project will be absorbed by the domestic market by 1983; methanol require-
ments for single cell protein production will come from other methanol units
unconnected with this Project.
3.09      Several industrial scale plants for the manufacture of single cell
protein (SCP) have already been commissioned in the USSR, Japan and Italy.
All these units use alkanes as the substrate and yeast as the microorganism.
The SCP produced, however, is about three times as expensive as the protein
contained in soya bean meal. Controversy has also arisen over the presence
of small quantities of unreacted alkanes in the product. In an attempt
to overcome these disadvantages, I.C.I. (UK) are constructing a plant (to
be commissioned in 1980) to produce 55,000 tons per year of SCP using methanol
as a substrate and a bacterium as the microorganism. Any unreacted methanol
should be completely removed from the SCP during the drying stage; bacteria
have a higher protein content than yeast and reproduce more quickly. Although
the cost of production of SCP from methanol is considerably lower than from
alkanes, it is still higher than that of protein contained in soya bean meal
at current prices. There is no doubt that the Romanian market could absorb
the projected production of SCP if it could be produced efficiently. Romania



- 11 -
has a pig population of about 10 million, which will increase to about 15
million by 1985. Their protein requirements would approach 400,000 tons by
1985, compared with a planned production of at most 200,000 tons of SCP.
The principal uncertainties about the SCP project relate to whether methanol-
based SCP will be able to compete with soya bean protein and whether tech-
nical know-how will have reached a stage where a plant of such large capacity
could be brought on stream by the planned date of 1983-84.
2.   Acetic Acid and Derivatives
3.10      A similar analysis of end uses for acetic acid and derivatives has
been attempted (Annex 3-2). For the sake of simplicity, all derivatives have
been converted back into acetic acid, although Craiova ethyl acetate is manu-
factured via acetaldehyde rather than acetic acid. Since D. P. Solventul,
another Romanian chemical enterprise, uses acetic acid as the raw material for
ethyl acetate and because of the flexibility in use between ethyl and butyl
acetates as paint solvents, with the latter being manufactured from acetic
acid, ethyl acetate end uses have been included in the following table.

3.11      Because of the multifarious uses of acetic acid (over 30 primary
derivatives alone are produced in Romania), it has not been possible to assign
a large part of the current production to specific end uses; it is likely,



- 12 -
however, that part of this unassigned quantity will in fact be utilized in
one or other of the end uses identified. For future incremental production,
on the other hand, more certainty exists at least as to the plans for utili-
zation of these derivatives. The major identified outlets for acetic deri-
vatives are for paints and lacquers and in textiles and footwear. Romania
also plans to complete by 1983 a triacetate plant which will utilize a sig-
nificant proportion of acetic anhydride produced by the Craiova Project and
which will manufacture the raw material for certain textiles and photographic
stock which are currently imported into Romania. As shown in the table in
para 3.04, this will help to increase domestic consumption of acetic anhydride
from about 400 tons per year today to over 6,000 tons per year by 1985.
3.12      The Romanian projection for domestic consumption of paints and
lacquers in 1985 is equivalent to a per capita consumption of 13.3 kg com-
pared to a projected 1985 per capita consumption in the F.R. of Germany of
25.9 kg and about 14.3 kg in the UK and Belgium. The Romanian projection
for artificial fibre consumption in 1985 is 30,000 tons higher than the
IBRD projection contained in the Cimpulung Appraisal Report, thus about
balancing out the lower Romanian projection for synthetic fibre consumption
which is 26,000 tons less than the IBRD estimates for 1985. Thus, the pro-
jected domestic consumption of acetic acid derivatives appears attainable.
A lower proportion of end use products from acetic acids are destined for
export than is the case for end use products of methanol (Annex 3-3).
C.   Domestic Production, Consumption, and Exports of Craiova Chemicals
3.13      The table on the following page summarizes the Romanian production,
consumption, exports and imports of the chemicals the Craiova Project will
produce for the past (1965-77) and the future (1980-85) (Annex 3-4). As can
be seen from this table, domestic production of acetic acid, vinyl acetate and
polyvinyl acetate has more or less kept pace with domestic consumption, al-
though acetic acid imports, which in 1977 accounted for 12% of domestic
consumption, are expected to rise until the Craiova Project comes on stream.
Acetic anydride, which has had a static domestic consumption of about 400 tons
per year, is not yet produced in Romania, while production capacity of ethyl
acetate is inadequate and imports are now at a level of about 2,000 tons
annually. Methanol has been exported during several years in the past,
although in 1975 and 1976 some imports were required to supplement domestic
production. Romanian production of all project products grew on average at
about 18% per year between 1965 and 1977, and Romania is planning an equiva-
lent rate of growth through 1983. By the mid-1980's, most of the Project's
output will be absorbed domestically, and any exportable quantities will be
small compared with European consumption and trade in these products
(para 3.17).
3.14      While domestic consumption growth as planned appears in general
reasonable, there is, however, some uncertainty in the opinion of Bank staff
about the methanol projections. By 1985, methanol production is planned
almost to double over its 1983 production level to meet the requirement for
single cell protein production. Three new methanol units would have to be

brought on stream, and 80% of their combined capacity is planned to be dedi-
cated to this use. Bank staff are of the opinion that commitment of such
a substantial capacity may be premature in view of the current state of
technology for single cell protein production and, without such use, it is
expected that methanol requirements will only be 700,000 tons in 1985 rather
than the 1.1 million tons projected by the Romanian authorities. If the
decision is delayed to go ahead with the single cell protein plant, then
the corresponding plants for the production of methanol feed would also be
delayed, since methanol exports are not envisaged in the Five-Year Plan except
for some short term balancing requirements. Without the addition of further
methanol production capacity beyond what is already existing or planned for
the Craiova Project, methanol capacity in 1983 will stand at about 526,000
tons as compared to domestic consumption of 527,000 tons in that year. Under
such an assumption, all Craiova methanol will have been absorbed by the domes-
tic market by the time the single cell protein project may be undertaken. In
view of uncertainties concerning the methanol projections, the Government has
agreed to prepare and submit to the Bank, by December 1979, an update of the
data made available to the Bank during appraisal with respect to the projected
domestic methanol demand and supply and of the export marketing development
plans, and to exchange views with the Bank on these data, their basis and con-
clusions thereof.
3.15      Assuming alternatively that (a) no further methanol units are built
nor the single cell protein plant and that (b) the single cell protein plant
is undertaken and with it the construction of three further methanol units,
the following table gives the quantities of Romanian products of the type
produced by the Project that are planned for export between 1980 and 1985 and
their general destinations (Annex 3-5).

3.16      It can be seen from the above table that, with the exception of
methanol and acetic acid, most of the export surpluses are expected to be
absorbed by COMECON countries and China. Exports of VAM and PVA are also
planned to neighboring countries such as Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey, so
it is unlikely that any significant quantities of those products will have
to compete in Western European markets. The Romanian export organization
DANUBEXIM, after preliminary market contacts, estimates that up to 10,000
tons per year of acetic acid can be placed in countries with which Romania



- 16 -
has established special trading relationships, such as Israel, Singapore
and Malaysia. Thus in 1981, the year in which the largest export surplus
is expected to be available, a maximum of about 12,000 tons of acetic acid
and 55,000 tons of methanol will have to find markets in Western Europe
(assuming that the construction of further methanol plants is postponed).
D.   The Western European Market
3.17      The market for chemicals in Western Europe, which had grown more
or less steadily until 1974, suffered a serious setback in 1975 with consump-
tion falling 15-20% in the space of a year.  1976 showed a return to 1974
levels for acetic acid derivatives while methanol did not reach its 1974
consumption level again until mid-1977. As noted above, the three principal
export items from the Craiova Project are methanol, acetic acid and vinyl
acetate; exports (other than trade with COMECON countries) of each of the
other Project products is not expected to exceed 2,000 tons per year (in all
cases less than 1% of W. European consumption), and no difficulty is antici-
pated in disposing of such small quantities. The following table summarizes
the demand and supply picture for the three principal export products. To
put these figures in perspective, methanol exports would represent 1.4% and
acetic acid exports 1.2% of Western Europe's consumption in the peak export
year of 1981, while peak vinyl acetate exports in 1983 would amount to 0.6%
of Western European consumption.

a/   Methanol consumption and production forecasts have been based on estimates
provided by several consulting firms (including SRI International and the
Pace Company Consultants). Projections for acetic acid and vinyl acetate
are based on a study prepared by the Bank's consultant (ANIC). In
reconciling these different estimates a conservative view has been taken
in estimating the future production deficit.
3.18      As the above table indicates, the 1970-76 growth rates for consump-
tion of methanol and acetic acid are influenced by the 1975 market set back; the
growth rates for the consumption of these products in the period 1970-74 were
considerably higher. The estimated future growth rates of consumption are
well below the pre-1975 growth rates. Vinyl acetate consumption, while



- 18 -
suffering a fall in 1975, recovered in 1976 and slightly surpassed the pre-1975
trend line. As stated in para 3.02, the use of vinyl acetate in paints and
(via PVA) in adhesives is a major growth area, and this is reflected in the
somewhat higher rate of growth of consumption projected for this product in
the future. Production and consumption in Western Europe of acetic acid have
been reasonably balanced on the whole, with only net marginal import require-
ments; however, trading opportunities have led to both exports and imports of
these products out of and into this region; therefore the disposal of the
relatively small quantities of Romanian acetic acid into this market should
not cause any problems. Vinyl acetate has been imported for a long period
into Western Europe; although plans have been announced to increase Western
European production capacity (and these have been included in the above
table), there is already some evidence that some of these capacity additions
will be delayed, in which case Western Europe will remain a net importer
of vinyl acetate to about 1985.
3.19      The methanol picture is rather different, however.  By 1980 name-
plate capacity in Western Europe will stand at about 4.2 million tons. The
consensus of opinion is that, except in unusual circumstances, an industry
wide effective and sustainable capacity utilization of about 85% is realistic;
this would give a production of about 3.6 million tons. Western European
producers are discouraged from planning any major capacity extensions because
of the anticipated change in the supply pattern, with OPEC countries and the
USSR entering the market with large capacity units. Saudi Arabia is planning
to erect more than 1 million tons per year of methanol capacity; this however
will not come on stream until the mid 1980s at the earliest and most of the
production is destined for the Japanese and the US markets. Two large
methanol plants (each of nameplate capacity of 825,000 tons per year) are
under construction in the USSR using British design and equipment from the
Federal Republic of Germany; the plants will be paid for from the proceeds of
methanol sales abroad. Although the output from these plants will have a
significant effect on the European market, their effect on exports of methanol
from the Project are likely to be small; although these units were originally
scheduled to come on stream in 1981, recent information indicates that the
first unit (at Gubaha in the Urals) will not now be completed until mid-1982,
while the second (at Tomsk in Siberia) will not start up until towards the end
of 1982, i.e. close to 1983 when no further methanol would be available from
Romania for exports, unless in fact the single cell protein plant and all
three methanol plants were built (paras 3.14 and 3.15).
3.20      Furthermore, Romanian methanol undoubtedly enjoys a freight advan-
tage over these plants. The Russian methanol will be moved in rail-tank cars
to Ventspils on the Baltic or to Odessa on the Black Sea. The rail distance
from Gubaha to these ports is about 2,600 km, while the distance from Tomsk
is at least 4,300 km; these freight costs must outweigh the economics of
scale enjoyed by the Russian plants. Romanian material, on the other hand,
can be moved up the Danube at a cost of about US$25/ton to North Western
Europe.

E.   Domestic and Export Prices
3.21      Domestic prices are Government controlled in Romania and are essen-
tially based on financial (i.e. controlled) cost of production (raw materials,
utilities, labor, depreciation, etc.) plus a margin which is fixed for
the industry as a whole (para 6.01). Raw materials may be charged at an
arbitrarily low price in order to encourage their use in specific industries
(as is the case with natural gas so that it is used for chemical processing,
rather than as fuel). Part of the margin is retained by the enterprise to pay
bonuses and to finance reinvestment, but the greater part is returned to the
Central Government and added to the State Budget. Some changes are expected
in this system when the new economic guidelines will have been translated
into rules for practical implementation. All prices are quoted on an ex-
works basis. Products destined for exports are transferred at the prevail-
ing domestic price, i.e. the enterprise receives the same revenue whether
it produces for exports or the home market.
3.22      Because of the current depressed state of the European chemical
market, prevailing European prices for certain products do not reflect
the prices which could be expected to be realized in the long term. There-
fore, long term prices have been estimated by the Bank with the assistance
of consultants (including SRI International, the Pace Company Consultants and
ANIC) and have been used for the purpose of evaluating the Project. The table
on the next page shows these long-term equilibrium prices (based on full
recovery of cost plus profit) and compares them with long term prices used in
the economic evaluation of the Project, current list (delivered) prices,
prices provided by manufacturers in Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, and
Romanian domestic (ex-factory) prices.
3.23      The following major conclusions can be drawn from the table:
Firstly, as can be expected in the present depressed market situation for
chemical products in Western Europe, actual market prices are on the whole,
though not consistently, below list prices; secondly, long-term equilibrium
prices have been assumed to be below current list prices (with the exception
of methanol) even when taking into account that the equilibrium prices are
quoted ex-factory while list prices are given on a delivered basis; thirdly,
the prices used in the report's economic evaluation have been derived on
a conservative basis; a discount ranging from 5% to 40% has been applied
to the equivalent long-term equilibrium (delivered) prices; and, fourthly,
the Romanian domestic prices are not too far off international prices, except
for methanol (the price of which is only about half the Western European
price) and for ethyl acetate (the price of which is between 50% and nearly
100% above Western European prices).
F.   Marketing
3.24      Domestic sales are basically determined through the medium of the
Five-Year Plan which effectively sets production offtakes to other enter-
prises. An annual plan is developed to which modifications may be intro-
duced to the provisions within the Five-Year Plan for the year in question.

The modifications may be made because of availability of new resources or
because of variations in the rates of growth of domestic or external mar-
kets from those assumed in the Five-Year Plan. After the Annual Plan has
been drafted, it is made concrete through the arrangement of supply and mar-
keting contracts. Since equilibrium in material balances is crucial to plan
implementation, enterprises must complete contracts for the purchase of in-
puts and sale of outputs which are consistent with the Plan. The enter-
prises are legally bound to their procurement contracts and, in general,
changes in an enterprises' targets cannot be made without prior negotiation
of the procurement contracts and the consent of the suppliers.
3.25      Export marketing of Craiova chemical products will be carried out
by DANUBEXIM, a Foreign Trade Enterprise under the Ministry of Chemical
Industry which is currently trading in fertilizers, explosives, tires, plas-
tics, rubber, and fibres. DANUBEXIM becomes the formal owner of the goods
which are transferred to it from the individual enterprises and undertakes
to sell all the materials of which it takes possession. Some technical
service is provided by the individual enterprises via DANUBEXIM to cus-
tomers. Although preliminary contacts have been made with potential cus-
tomers abroad, no firm commitments can yet be entered into because start-up
dates are still too far in the future. In addition, although DANUBEXIM has
several partnerships with distributors in the main European markets (Federal
Republic of Germany, France, UK and Italy), it has limited market intelligence
capabilities.
3.26      As noted above, Romanian authorities recently announced plans for
giving greater responsibility to individual enterprises, including in the
field of foreign trade. If Romania is to export Craiova products at economic
prices it will need an efficient export marketing organization with a rapid
market intelligence service in order to enable it to establish a continuing
preseace in the extremely competitive international marketplace. In the
case of certain products, there may well be a need for some form of techni-
cal service to customers. DANUBEXIM and the Craiova enterprise are already
cooperating both on technical service and identifying markets. Agreement
has been obtained that an export marketing development plan for Craiova's
products will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by December 1979.
3.27      Most of the Enterprise's products for export will be shipped via
the Black Sea port of Constanza, with which good rail communications exist,
and where bulk storage for liquids has already been installed. Besides normal
shiploading facilities, there will also be facilities for pipeline loadings of
barges of 500-3,000 tons whose products are then in turn transferred to larger
ships for movement to Western Europe and elsewhere. Because of berth limita-
tions, the maximum ship size is 5-6,000 tons capacity today, but extensions
are being made to receive ships up to 10,000 tons capacity. Some barge move-
ments to Western Europe via the Danube are also planned; loading will take
place at the Iron Gates, not far from Craiova.

4.01      The Project, which consists of the expansion and modernization of
the Craiova Chemical Complex, will produce the products at annual capaci-
ties as shown in the flowsheet on page 23 and summarized below:

/a   Net production for sale to other units of the Craiova Complex or outside;
the balance is internally consumed in the Project.
The net production capacities for sale shown above represent the optimal mix,
given the proposed size of the units and the projected market requirements.
The Project, however, has some flexibility to adjust this mix to changing
market prospects, with minimal impact on operating costs. For instance,
production of acetic anhydride could be reduced or eliminated altogether,
with a corresponding increase in the production of acetic acid, in the ratio
of 1.0 ton to 1.3 ton.
4.02      The Project comprises the following major elements: 1/
(i)  The core of the Project lies in the installation of a 30,000
tpy acetylene unit based on methane feedstock; the unit will:
replace the production of the Complex's old 16,000 tpy acety-
lene plant based on carbide which will be taken out of commis-
sion; provide additional acetylene intermediate to new or
expanded downstream units (see below); deliver offgases for use in
an existing ammonia reactor and in the new acetic acid plant; and
allow the full utilization of an existing acetaldehyde unit.
1/   The Romanian authorities have been considering for some time the
possibility of adding a 5,000 tpy polyvinyl alcohol plant and a
10,000 tpy butyl acetate plant to the Craiova expansion program.
No firm decision has been taken so far in view of their marginal
profitability (see Annex 7). Therefore, the Project as described
in this report does not include these two plants; the Bank will
not finance them should the Romanians decide on their implementation.

(ii)  The capacities of the existing vinyl acetate and polyvinyl
acetate units will be expanded.
(iii)  New acetic acid, acetic anhydride, ethyl acetate, and methanol
units will be built. In the case of acetic acid, new technology
will be introduced and acquired abroad.
(iv)  A new plant for the separation of carbon monoxide (CO) will
provide CO to the new acetic acid plant and hydrogen to the
existing butanol plant.
4.03      The Project will divert about 360 million m3 of methane gas from
fuel to chemical feedstock uses, thus increasing the amount of gas processed
in Romania into higher value chemicals by 11%. The Project has been very
ingeniously designed so as to achieve the best possible utilization of the
feedstock. About half of the methane stream will be directed to the new
acetylene unit; one-third of the carbon contained in this stream of gas would
thus be transformed into acetylene and from there into a variety of high value
organic chemicals. The remaining two-thirds of the carbon will be transferred
in the form of offgas to other units, mainly to the existing ammonia/urea
facilities; the composition of the offgas permits direct use by the ammonia
reactor and thus allows the replacement of pure methane gas. The other half
of the original methane stream will be used for the production of methanol.
4.04      The Project's location and design concept have been planned to make
the best possible use of pre-existing investments in the Complex. The exist-
ing methane gas pipeline and many infrastructural facilities will be shared
by the new units, which will be closely integrated with existing process
streams. Spare capacity in some existing units will also be absorbed.
Standardization of plants is to take place wherever possible so as to maximize
the benefits of existing expertise in building and operating similar units.
B.   Location, Raw Materials and Utilities
4.05      The Craiova Chemical Complex is located near the village of Isalnita,
about 10 km west of Craiova, at the confluence of the Jiu and Amarandia rivers.
The Complex hosts facilities for the production of nitrogenous and complex
fertilizers (270,000 nutrient tpy capacity) as well as for the production of
acetylene (49,000 tpy) 1/ and a range of acetylene-based organic chemicals.
The inclusion in the Project of methanol and methanol-based products will
diversify the range of products manufactured in the Complex, away from
acetylene and fertilizer products. The plant layout is shown in Annex 4-1.
4.06      There is sufficient room on the Craiova site to accommodate the
facilities to be built under the Project. Some storage facilities will be
moved closer to the railway at the outskirts of the plant. Water is avail-
able from the nearby Jiu river, and chemically impure water will be processed
1/   a.  Acetylene via partial oxidation:    33,000 tpy
b.  Acetylene via carbide            :    16,000 tpy



- 25 -
through a biological treatment unit. The plant units (mainly the methanol
unit) will generate part of the steam required for the Project, and residual
needs will be filled by existing facilities. Power is available from the
national grid as well as from the Complex network. Methane is readily avail-
able through an existing pipeline which connects the site to the Transylvania
gas fields, some 250 km away, and which has adequate capacity to meet the
demand of the Project. No difficulties are expected to meet the Project's
raw materials and utilities requirements, detailed in Annex 4-2, which, with
the exception of a few chemicals, will all be locally supplied.
C.   Technology, Employment and Training
4.07      The transfer of new technologies from abroad will be sought for
one major plant unit to produce acetic acid and for the CO separation unit.
Local equipment suppliers will be involved as much as possible to facilitate
such transfers. At the same time and as mentioned previously, the existing
acetylene unit, which is based on carbide, will be phased out and replaced by
a more modern partial oxidation unit using methane. The technology for this
unit has been developed in Romania on the basis of foreign know-how.
4.08      Acetylene has been used in metal cutting and welding for many years
and since the early part of the 20th century, has played an important role as a
chemical intermediate. Its maximum utilization was reached in the mid-1960s;
since then, technologies based on lower cost ethylene and propylene from large
naphtha and ethane crackers have to a large extent replaced the processes
based on acetylene. However, for countries such as Romania, with an indige-
nous source of natural gas (methane) and insufficient petroleum feedstocks,
such as naphtha, the use of acetylene-based processes can still be attractive.
Since acetylene is produced typically in units with much smaller capacities
(10,000-80,000 tpy) than have become common for olefines production (300,000-
500,000 tpy), the acetylene-based processes continue to receive attention
when domestic demands for derivatives are at levels which do not justify
large-scale production and where the technologies employed to produce these
derivatives do not exhibit significant economies of scale (Annex 4-3).
4.09      Estimated personnel requirements of the Project amount to about
1,110 people, out of whom 600 are operators, 450 are auxiliary workers, and
60 are engineers and technicians. The latter will be found among graduates
of chemistry schools (which work in close collaboration with the chemical
industry) and/or are trained in the Complex. The number of existing adminis-
trative staff does not need to be expanded for the Project. In line with
the Government's objectives on industrial employment, up to 80% of the per-
sonnel will be recruited in the judet of Dolj where the plant will be located.
Detailed training programs for the expansion have been submitted to and found
acceptable by the Bank. Training for selected personnel has already begun in
the existing facilities at Craiova to fill the needs of those plant units
which will be commissioned first.

D.   Ecology and Safety
4.10      The most important pollutants are organic compounds likely to be
washed away with the cooling water, particularly in the methanol and acetylene
plants. Water pollution, therefore, presents some potential risks. Hence,
the Project authorities have decided to install biological treatment facil-
ities to control the quality of the effluent water discharged into the Jiu
river (Annex 4-4). No problems are anticipated with regard to air pollu-
tion levels on account of the particular process technology selected.
4.11      A variety of different chemicals, hot fluids, and high pressure
fluids will be used in the new plants at Craiova. Such chemicals and fluids
present a potential hazard if not properly handled. However, the operating
standards already employed at the Complex are in line with the most up-to-
date standards elsewhere in the world resulting in safety records which are
remarkably good. No major hazards are expected with regard to the oxygen
separation plant. The two air inlets to the oxygen separation plant are 3 km
apart and so located that one inlet is always upwind from the Complex, what-
ever the direction of the wind, thereby eliminating any risk of presence of
dissolved hydrocarbons in liquid oxygen due to air pollution above the
chemical Complex and thus diminishing any potential risk of explosion.
4.12      Furthermore and also with the objective of avoiding any explosion
risks, the existing acetylene furnaces are fitted (and so will the new fur-
naces) with proper vent and shut down instrumentation according to the present
safety standards of all modern acetylene technologies. Purge acetylene is
handled and transferred according to safety standards which are even more
conservative than those of the USA and Germany. Higher acetylenes dissolved
in diesel oil and liquid ammonia are safely burned without exceeding the
maximum concentration which is actually allowed in similar acetylene plants.
The originally proposed CO cryogenic separation process has been abandoned
and substituted by the COSORB 1/ process which should be quite safe due to
the non-corrosive absorbent liquor it employs. High and medium pressure
units, such as to be used in producing methanol and acetic acid, will be
designed according to a proper and modern technology.
4.13      The engineering and operational standards adopted on safety were
reviewed by a Bank expert and a consultant 2/ and found satisfactory. Agree-
ment has been obtained that the Project facilities will be designed, con-
structed, and operated with due regard to ecological, environmental, and
safety standards.
E.   Project Implementation
4.14      The Project will be implemented under the supervision of the manage-
ment of the Craiova Chemical Complex and the Craiova Central. The Central has

considerable experience in the implementation of new projects and is providing
experienced project management and senior staff to the Enterprise. The
Central, together with the Enterprise, has also direct responsibility for
the procurement of local equipment and raw materials and for the recruitment
and training of personnel. In line with the Romanian system of project imple-
mentation, several areas of Project execution have been delegated to other
organizations which are well versed in their respective tasks. Engineering
and design is the responsibility of the Technological Engineering and Design
Institute for the Chemical Industry (IITPIC), which was established on
February 1, 1977, by joining several design institutes (IPROCHIM, IPUC, and
CPRP). ROMCHIM, the foreign trade enterprise of the Ministry of Chemical
Industries, is responsible for the procurement of imported goods and services.
Construction and erection will be carried out by enterprises of the Ministry
of Industrial Buildings. The Ministry for the Chemical Industries supervises
the work and coordinates the tasks of the other ministries involved. This
scheme for project implementation is standard practice in Romania and has
proven itself in the past. Except for foreign technical assistance required
for the acetic acid plant, overall and detailed plant layout will be done by
IITPIC and the Central. Given the experience the organizations involved have
been gaining on expansion projects over the last ten years, project implemen-
tation arrangements are judged to be adequate.
4.15      Implementation schedules for the various plant units are given in
Annex 4-5. These schedules have been reviewed by the Bank and found satis-
factory. Site preparation is underway. Preliminary process design of some
of the units has been completed. For the acetic acid plant, a contract for
the supply of license and major equipment has been concluded with BASF
(Germany) and will be financed through bilateral credit arrangements. Long
delivery items, such as methanol compressors and the CO separation unit,
have been ordered (para 5.08). The commissioning dates of the various plants
are spread over a period of two years, from December 1979 to December 1981.
V. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
5.01      Total financing required for the Project is estimated at US$156.8
million equivalent, including US$59.7 million in foreign exchange. Details
of the capital cost estimate and of the assumptions made are given in
Annex 5-1 and summarized below:

/a   Includes US$14.5 million in non-convertible foreign exchange costs.
/b   Includes US$16.0 million in indirect convertible foreign exchange.
5.02      The estimates were prepared by IITPIC and the Central in January
1978. Equipment costs for the imports required for the Project are based on
prevailing world market prices and on fixed price contracts already signed for
the acetic acid plant, methanol compressors, CO separation unit and other long
delivery items representing together 18% of the Base Cost Estimate. Local
costs for equipment, civil works, and erection were estimated by IITPIC. A
physical contingency of 3% has been added to the base cost estimate (equivalent



- 29 -
to 4% of BCE not yet covered, by fixed price contracts) and is considered
adequate in view of the advanced stage of Project preparation. Price esca-
lation has been calculated on the basis of 1% annual increase for local costs
and 7.5% annually for foreign exchange costs.
B.   Financing Plan
5.03      The Project is part of the Central's current Five-Year Plan
(1975-80). In establishing its investment and financing plan, the Central
aggregated all approved investments of its enterprises and set them against
the availability of funds from its enterprises' cash generation. However, for
the Plan period, the investment requirements exceed CIICh's cash generation by
about 20%. To ensure that the funds required for the investment program are
available when required, the Central, in accordance with common practice in
Romania, agreed with the Ministries of Chemical Industries and Finance that
CIICh's enterprises will not retain any funds for their individual investment
purposes but transfer nearly all internally generated cash to the State. The
only funds that will be retained are for paying bonuses to workers and for the
reserve fund for working capital increases, together totalling about 2% of total
annual cash generation. In turn, the Central's entire investment requirements
will be funded by the State budget and allocations made as required.
5.04      Interest during construction, which does not exist under the
Romanian system of industrial financing but which will accrue on the foreign
loans, i.e., IBRD loan and supplier's credit, will be borne by the State and
not charged to the Central or to the Enterprise. The financing plan will,
therefore, be as follows:
Financing Plan

- 30 -
5.05      The Council of Minister's approval of a project automatically
includes the provision of funds required for it in the Romanian budget. The
Romanian budget system has no simple mechanism for providing additional funds
once this approval is given, since the Council of Minister's decision is law
and another decision of the Council would be required to authorize addi-
tional funds. Agreement has been obtained that funds will be provided as
needed for carrying out the Project, including prompt allocation of State
funds to cover any cost overrun.
5.06      The Bank loan is proposed to be extended to the Investment Bank for
14 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace, and at a 7.35% interest rate. As in
the case of other Bank projects in Romania, the Investment Bank will pass on
the loan proceeds to the Enterprise, together with the State funds. There is
no formal on-lending arrangement from the Investment Bank to the Enterprise,
but agreement has been obtained that all actions needed will be taken to
ensure that annual remittances of funds by the Enterprise to the State budget
will be sufficient to at least equal payments of interest and principal on the
Bank loan on terms assumed to be identical to those due to the Bank, except
for a notional interest rate of 10%. This arrangement is in line with our
practice in all previous industrial projects in Romania and the 10% interest
rate is the normal rate currently paid by our borrowers in Bank-financed
industrial projects in other countries. The supplier's credit from the
Federal Republic of Germany, providing US$12.9 million to finance the acetic
acid plant will be extended over 8 years, including 2-1/2 years of grace
and at a 7.5% interest rate. Signing of the supplier's credit will be a
condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan.
C.   Procurement
5.07      Equipment and materials to be financed by the Bank will be procured
according to Bank's guidelines in the following manner: (i) international
competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for procuring imported equipment, mate-
rials and the know-how and services connected with such equipment estimated
at US$12.0 million; 1/ (ii) imported long-delivery items available from a
limited number of suppliers and estimated at US$10.0 million may be purchased
through prudent international shopping, subject to prior approval by the Bank
of such procurement procedure and of the list of items involved; (iii) imported
items costing less than US$100,000 each (and up to a total of US$2.0 million)
may be purchased through international shopping on the basis of suitability,
availabiltiy, and price considerations, subject to prior approval by the Bank
of the list of items involved; and (iv) US$16.0 million of equipment and sub-
assemblies which will also be subject to ICB and for which qualified Romanian
suppliers exist and may be expected to bid; for these items, Romanian suppliers
will be accorded a preference of 15% or the applicable custom duty, whichever
is the lower. Procurement of the remaining equipment and services will be
handled in Romania by the agencies responsible for the Project's implementa-
tion (para 4.14).
1/   Services are an integral part of the equipment cost and no reliable
man-month cost can be estimated.

D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
5.08      The Bank loan would cover 26% of the Project's total financing
and about 67% of its estimated foreign exchange requirements. A detailed list
of equipment and services proposed to be financed by the Bank is given in
Annex 5-2 and is summarized below in the following allocation of the Bank
loan:
Allocation of Bank Loan
(in US$ million)
Amount     Disbursement
1.  Imported equipment and services            22       100% of foreign
expenditures
2.  Imported items costing less than            2       100% of foreign
US$100,000                                          expenditures
3.  Equipment and sub-assemblies               16       100% of foreign
expenditures and
100% of local
expenditures
ex-factory.
Total                                  40
It is expected that awards for most of the equipment and sub-assemblies listed
under item 3 in the above list will go to Romanian suppliers after ICB.
Changes in this list will be made only by prior agreement between the Bank and
the Borrower. The Bank loan is expected to be completely disbursed by the end
of 1981. A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 5-3. As already discussed
in para 4.15, advanced contracting of about US$7.0 million is expected for
long-delivery items.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenue and Operating Cost Estimates
6.01      As discussed (paras 2.11 and 3.21), chemical product prices are
set by the State using a pricing principle which takes into account actual
production costs and provides for a margin to cover taxes and benefits which
in the case of the chemical industry amount to 30-35% over production costs,
including depreciation. Prices for all inputs and outputs are administered



- 32 -
by the Government and have remained constant for long periods of time; most
prices were reset in 1974-76. In any case, whatever adjustments in input
and output prices may be made, they are not expected to affect the Project's
financial viability adversely in view of the Government pricing policy out-
lined above. For chemical products exported, the Enterprise will receive
domestic prices for identical products and DANUBEXIM will absorb any price
difference between Romanian and export prices.
6.02      Detailed assumptions used in the financial analysis are given in
Annex 6. Based on input prices prevailing in Romania and conservatively
assumed quantity requirements, the following cost structure results for
the Project:
Product Cost of Full Capacity of the Project
(in constant 1980 terms)
Variable Costs                                 Million Lei
Methane (Feedstock & Fuel)                         37.9           7.7
Fuel and Diesel Oils                               24.2           4.9
Utilities                                         123.5          24.9
Chemicals                                          84.2          17.0
Total                                        269.8         54.5
Fixed Costs
Labor                                              45.0           9.1
Maintenance and General                            64.8          13.0
Depreciation                                      115.8          23.4
Total                                       225.6          45.5
Total Product Costs                               495.4         100.0
Sales Revenue                                   1,095.2         221.1
Variable costs account for about 55% of total product costs before financial
charges, which are not levied at the Enterprise level. The financial cost
of methIne, the Project's main raw material, is Lei 60 (or about US$3) per
1,000 m . Depreciation charges, which under the Romanian system are the
only costs reflecting the value of the initially required investment, are
relatively small with an average depreciation period of about 22 years.
B.   Financial Projections
6.03      Financial projections for the Project are summarized below from
Annex 6:

/a   For this calculation, the Bank loan and the supplier's credit to the
Investment Bank have been assumed to be the Enterprise's debt in spite
of lack of formal on-lending.
The projections are based on a normal production build-up for each individual
product (75% capacity utilization in the first year (12 months) of operation,
95% in the second year, and 100% in the third year and thereafter) and the
gradual coming on stream of individual plant units between December 1979 and
December 1981. This build-up is considered achievable (i) because this type
of plant can normally reach full rated capacity fairly quickly after its
successful start-up; and (ii) because of Romania's history of rapid production
build-up and high capacity utilization. The uncertainties of the export mar-
kets (paras 3.14 and 3.26) have been reflected in the sensitivity tests of
the economic analysis; for the purpose of the financial statements of the
Enterprise, the sales revenues are based on posted Romanian prices, inde-
pendently of domestic or export destination of the products.
6.04      The expected financial ratios of the Enterprise are satisfactory.
Projects in Romania are financed fully on a "non-interest bearing capital"
basis, but funds are recovered by the State through payments from the enter-
prises into several State funds. However, the amount of interest and principal
on the Bank loan and on the supplier's credit is shown in the projected cash



- 34 -
flow statement as a "notional" debt service coverage, relating benefits
(before taxation) plus depreciation to debt service.
6.05      The Craiova Central enterprises retain only 2% of their generated
funds, and the remainder is transferred to the State which in turn finances
through the Investment Bank the investment program of the Central. The finan-
cial projections are made in accordance with these arrangements. These arrange-
ments ensure that the total remittances by the Enterprise to the State will be
sufficient to cover the equivalent in Lei of the interest (at a notional rate
of 10%) and principal to be paid by the Investment Bank in that same year to
the Bank and agreement to that effect has been obtained from the Government.
The table on page 7 of Annex 6, showing the net impact of the Project on the
State budget, demonstrates the net flow to the State budget becoming positive
in 1984.
C.   Financial Rate of Return
6.06      The financial return of the Project, calculated in Annex 6 and based
on present Romanian prices, is 21% and is most sensitive to changes in sales
revenues: lowering them by 10% would reduce the financial return to 17%.
Given the Romanian pricing system, however, this return is not very meaningful
for judging the Project's viability, which is obtained through the economic
rate of return (para 7.04).
D.   Auditing and Reporting
6.07      Romania has an elaborate audit system under which enterprises sub-
mit periodic operational and financial reports to their Central, technical
Ministries, the Investment Bank, and other banks concerned. These reports
serve to ensure achievement of Plan targets and proper use of funds. Though
the contents and presentation of these reports differ from those normally
received by the Bank, it has been possible to adjust them to provide suffi-
cient information for the Bank to adequately monitor the progress of Project
implementation and operations. Agreement has been obtained that the Bank will
receive from the Investment Bank quarterly progress reports prepared by the
Enterprise and annual financial statements in a form satisfactory to the Bank
and, within six months after the end of each year, copies of annual audit
reports of the Enterprise prepared by the Ministry of Finance.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
a
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
7.01      All economic benefits and costs for tradeable items have been deter-
mined by using expected long-term international prices estimated to prevail
in the mid-1980s (Chapter III). For non-tradeable items, domestic prices have
been taken and, where applicable, adjusted to reflect the economic price of



- 35 -
their internationally traded components. Detailed assumptions are given
in Annex 7.
7.02      About half of the Project's total economic cost comes from methane.
As mentioned in para 6.02, the domestic cost of methane is about US$3 per
1,000 m , but such a cost does not reflect its most attractive alternative
use, i.e., as fuel in power plants. In such use, methane would replace
either locally available lignite or residual fuel oils. Lignite accounted for
about 28% of the power produced in Romania in 1975, and its share is expected
to increase to about 48% by 1985; based on a lignite production cosS of US$9-
12 per ton, the corresponding value of methane is US$40 per 1,000 m .   Fuel
oil accounted in 1975 for only 4% of the power produced, and its share
will increase to about 16% by 1985. 1/  Based on an international price of
fuel oil of US$75 per ton, equivalent to US$13 per ~arrel of crude oil, the
corresponding value of methane is US$60 per 1,000 m.   As a base cost of the
analysis presented in this report, the higher value of methane correspo5ding
to the highest substitution cost at the margin, i.e., US$60 per 1,000 m , has
been retained.
7.03      About 17% of the economic revenues expected from the Project are
in offgases; these will substitute for methane in other units of the Craiova
Complex and have been priced in the same way as the methane input, i.e., on
the basis of their energy content. Another 12% of the Project's revenues
comes from acetylene; this acetylene will replace the acetylene currently
produced from carbide, whose economic price is based on the international
price of carbide. The remaining 71% of the economic revenues are due to
methanol and acetylene-based products. Expected long-term economic prices
for these products were discussed in Chapter III. For four major products
representing 59% of the Project's total revenues (methanol, acetic acid, vinyl
acetate, and polyvinyl acetate), specialized consultants 2/ supplied the Bank
with information on capital and operating costs and on future demand and
supply data, and an assessment of long-term equilibrium prices. As mentioned
in paras 3.22 and 3.23, the product prices used in the analysis presented in
this report are based largely on this information, but have been decreased
(conservatively throughout the Project's life) depending on the product by
5-40% to reflect the worldwide oversupply situation which is expected to
prevail in the early 1980s.
B.   Economic Rates of Return and Major Risks
7.04      Using the above assumptions, the Project's economic rate of return
was calculated in 1977 terms, and is 16% versus a financial return of 21%;
the drop stems mainly from a reduction in revenues proportionally higher
than the corresponding reduction in feedstock cost, when substituting inter-
national for Romanian prices. Sensitivity tests (Annex 7) are summarized
below:
1/   During the same period, gas' share in power generation is expected to
drop from 50% in 1975 to 15% in 1985.
2/   SRI International, the Pace Company Consultants and ANIC.



- 36 -
Economic Rates of Return
Overall     Methanol    Acetylene
Project       Plant    Based Plants
Base Case                             16.2%        16.5%        16.0%
Capital Cost up to 10%                14.3%        14.5%        14.2%
Operating Cost up to 10%              12.1%        12.2%        11.6%
Product Prices down 10%               11.8%         9.6%        12.0%
Like the financial rate of return, the economic return is most sensitive to
changes in product prices: it would decrease to 12% should chemical product
prices drop by 10%, while a 10% increase would raise it to 20%. The return is
less sensitive to investment and manufacturing costs, but is sensitive to
delays in Project completion: were, under adverse circumstances, Project cost
to increase by 10% and the Project suffer a 6-month delay, the return would
drop to 14%. Should the domestic market develop at a slower pace than anti-
cipated and the Project have to export 2.5 times more, the return would drop
to 15%. Should, however, the Project not be able to export at all and the
domestic market be equally unable to absorb the respective quantity, the
corresponding drop in capacity utilization (by 10%) would decrease the return
to 14%.
7.05      The major risk faced by the Project concerns the export of some
of its production in the early years of operations (para 3.15) since DANUBEXIM
is expected to face stiff competition from other suppliers in Western Europe
and will have to absorb - as assumed in the export price assumptions - EEC
tariffs, at present equivalent to 10% of products prices on average. Since
the quantities that can, or may have to, be exported will depend on the growth
rate of consumption in Romania and most importantly on the pace of the addi-
tional capacity which will come on stream both in Romania and elsewhere after
the Project start-up, assurances have been obtained from the Government that
it will review the supply and demand projections before the Project's commis-
sioning (para 3.14). This risk will be partly reduced by the operating
flexibility inherent in the Project design of switching production from one
product to another without affecting its overall profitability (para 4.01).
It has been calculated that, should the export market for acetic anhydride not
materialize to the extent envisaged at present, additional acetic acid could
be produced and the rate of return would drop by only 0.3%.
7.06      A second potential risk, related to the first, refers to the limited
market intelligence capabilities of DANUBEXIM (para 3.25). Since an efficient
marketing organization with a rapid market intelligence service is critical if
Romania is to export part of the Project output at economic prices, assurance
has been obtained that DANUBEXIM, possibly with the cooperation of Craiova,
will set up a suitable marketing group and develop an appropriate export
strategy before the various plants of the Project are commissioned (para
3.26).



- 37 -
C.   Other Benefits
7.07      Although most of the benefits have already been largely or entirely
accounted for in the economic rate of return, the following benefits from
the Project should also be highlighted. The Project will result in a transfer
of technology in the chemical sector (paras 4.07-4.08). Direct industrial
employment will increase by about 1,110 persons, corresponding to an invest-
ment per person of about US$141,000.
VIII.  AGREEMENTS
8.01      The following major assurances and agreements have been reached:
(i)   The Investment Bank will cause to be prepared, by
December 31, 1979, or such later date as the Bank and
the Investment Bank may agree, and furnish the Bank
with an update of the data made available to the Bank
during appraisal with respect to the projected domestic
methanol demand and supply (para 3.14) and of the export
marketing development plans for all Project's products
manufactured in Romania (para 3.26), and shall exchange
views with the Bank on these data, their basis and
conclusion thereof;
(ii)  Project facilities will be designed, constructed and
operated with due regard to ecological, environmental and
safety standards acceptable to the Bank (para 4.13);
(iii) funds will be provided as needed to implement the Project
and to meet any cost overruns (para 5.05);
(iv)  goods and services will be procured on the basis of
lists agreed upon (para 5.08);
(v) total annual remittances by the Project Enterprise to
the State will be adequate to cover debt service (para
6.05); and
(vi)  the Investment Bank will submit quarterly project pro-
gress reports and annual financial statements in a form
satisfactory to the Bank. Also, the Bank will receive
within six months after the end of each year copies of
annual audit reports of the Enterprise prepared by the
Ministry of Finance (para 6.07).
8.02      Based on the above agreements reached, the Project is suitable for
a Bank loan of US$40 million to the Investment Bank to be repaid over 14
years, including 3-1/2 years of grace. Signing of the supplier's credit from
the Federal Republic of Germany to finance the acetic acid plant, will be a
condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan (para. 5.06).

ROMANIA - CRAIOVA CHEMICAL PROJECT
GLOSSARY
Acetaldehyde (CH3 - COH). It is a stable and non-corrosive liquid, much
used as an intermediate in chemical synthesis. It may be obtained by a
fermentation process or from charcoal distillation, but most processes use
ethylene or acetylene as a feedstock. Among the synthetic routes, the
acetylene based one continues to lose ground since ethylene represents a
cheaper feedstock. Acetaldehyde is obtained at Craiova in the existing
production facilities by low pressure addition of water to acetylene.
Mercuric sulphate is used as a catalyst.
Acetic Acid (CH3 - COOH). An organic acid, liquid at room temperature,
obtained by oxidation of acetaldehyde or by synthesis of methanol and
carbon monoxide. Major outlets for acetic acid are vinyl acetate, acetic
anhydride, various esters, monochloroacetic acid and terephthalic acid
production, where it is used as a solvent. The catalytic combination of
methanol and carbon monoxide was first used at BASF's plant in a high
pressure process. Then MONSANTO's technology introduced lower pressure
synthesis. A high pressure process will be used at Craiova. Acetic
acid is a highly corrosive chemical and requires the use of special
materials in equipment required to handle it. No major hazards or
environmental problems are due to the acetic acid production.
Acetic Anhydride (CH3 - CO - 0 - CO - CH3). It is a highly reactive
liquid, used as an intermediate chemical for cellulose acetate fibers,
film, plastics and acetylsalycylic acid production. It will be produced
at Craiova by reaction of liquid acetic acid with ketene.
Acetylene (HC - CH). A gas which can be produced by reaction of calcium
carbide with water or by high temperature cracking of natural gas and higher
hydrocarbons (see "Acetylene Furnace Gas"). Acetylene, possessing a
triple bond, is a highly reactive chemical and can be used as the raw
material to produce a large number of common organic chemicals. It has
been used in metal cutting and welding for many years and since the early
part of the zOth century has played an important role as a chemical
intermediate. Its principal end products are vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate
and acetaldehyde. Acetylene is not chemically dangerous nor may cause more
environmental problems than other hydrocarbons. On the other hand, being a very
unstable chemical, it must not be compressed at more than 0.5 bar without
especiallv designed equipment nor heated up to 150C nor exposed to shocks
as pipe hammering, etc. Liquid acetylene is extremely expl* ive; therefore,



- 39 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2
process temperatures must never drop below the acetylene liquefaction
temperature.
Acetylene Furnace Gas. The output mixture of gases from the acetylene
furnace reactors. By reaction of preheated natural gas and oxygen, part
of the natural gas is oxidized, the temperature rises up to about 1400C
and the remaining natural gas is involved in a cracking. If an immediate
quench follows, some unstable products as acetylene and higher acetylenes
can be obtained. In the furnace gas, such acetylene generally ranges from 7
to 8.5% and higher acetylenes below 1%. Small amounts of higher, mostly
aromatic, hydrocarbons are also produced in the furnace reactions. As a
result of the natural gas oxidation, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide
are produced. In the Craiova acetylene plant,the higher hydrocarbons
and part of the higher acetylenes, as well as the residual carbon soot,
shall be removed by diesel oil. Carbon dioxide, acetylene and higher
acetylenes shall be absorbed in liquid ammonia. The remaining gas is
recovered as "Acetylene Off-Gas."
Acetylene Off-Gas. A mixture of gases resulting as a by-product from
the acetylene plant. Its average volumetric composition is 28% carbon
monoxide, 62% hydrogen, 7% methane, 3% nitrogen, argon and various
hydrocarbons. The commonest use of acetylene off-gas is for ammonia
synthesis, or as a source of carbon monoxide and hydrogen for chemical
synthesis. The gas is poisonous due to its high content of carbon
monoxide.
Ammonia (NH3). A compound of nitrogen and hydrogen obtained by synthesis
of nitrogen and hydrogen. It is a gas at normal atmospheric temperature
and pressure. It can be liquefied at -33oC at atmospheric pressure but
it can also be liquefied at ordinary temperatures by application of
pressure. Ammonia is applied as a fertilizer because of its high nutrient
content (82% N) but it is more commonly used as an intermediate chemical
for production of solid fertilizers. It will be used in the acetylene
plant of Craiova as an absorbing liquor to remove carbon dioxide, acetylene
and higher acetylenes from the furnace gas. After carbon dioxide and
acetylene desorbtion, part of the recycled liquid ammonia will be burnt
together with the higher acetylenes.
Butyl Acetate (CH3 - COO - C4H9). A liquid organic ester, mostly used as
a solvent for paints,coatings and adhesives. It can be manufactured by
reaction of acetic acid with butanol, as it is in the existing plant at
Craiova. It can be produced also by trans-esterification, according to
the following reaction:  methyl acetate + butanol F butyl acetate + methanol.
This way of manufacturing butyl acetate allows methyl acetate from the
polyvinyl alcohol plant to be recovered, and methanol to be regenerated.
Carbide (Ca C2). A solid product very reactive with water. By reaction of
carbide with water, acetylene and calcium hydroxide are produced as



- 40 -
ANNEX 1
Page 3
follows: Ca C2 + 2H20 = Ca (OH)2 + C2H2. The carbide itself is manufactur-
ed by mixing lime and coke in a 60/40 mixture and heating it to over
2000C in an electric furnace. The process is extremely energy intensive,
requiring 2,900 KWh per ton,of carbide, that is about 9,000 KWh per ton
of acetylene.
Carbon Dioxide (CO2). The commonest result of a combustion. It results
as a by-product from the partial oxidation of natural gas in the acetylene
furnaces, then absorbed in dilute ammonia and finally stripped by heating
the ammonium carbonate solution. Carbon dioxide is also used in the
synthesis of methanol.
Carbon Monoxide (CO). A result of partial oxidation of natural gas as well
as any other hydrocarbon. High purity carbon monoxide will be produced
in the CO separation unit at Craiova and supplied to the acetic acid plant.
For the CO separation, the COSORB process will be chosen instead of the
more expensive cryogenic process.
Carbonylation. It is the addition of a CO group to a hydrocarbon. In the
acetic acid synthesis, due to carbonylation, acetic acid is produced by
addition of carbon monoxide to methanol: CH3 - OH + CO = CH3 - COOH. The
carbonylation can be done both at low and at high pressure (see "Acetic
Acid").
COSORB Process. A KTI patented process for absorption and desorption of
carbon monoxide. COSORB is a liquid absorption/desorption system which
uses a copper compound to complex the carbon monoxide, but unlike that
used in the conventional copper liquor process, the scrubbing liquor in
the COSORB process is non-corrosive, as the solvent is an aromatic hydro-
carbon and the absorbent is cuprous aluminum chloride. The scrubber
make gas contains up to 82 *. 85% hydrogen, by volume, 10   12% methane,
nitrogen, etc.
Cryogenic Separation of Gases. A separation of gases based on the low
temperatures liquefaction and distillation of the liquefied gases. In the
case of carbon monoxide separation, compressed nitrogen is expanded to low
pressures. Due to Joule-Thomson effect, nitrogen is liquefied and can be
used as a source of frigories as well as a solvent for residual carbon
monoxide. Due to nitrogen compression energy, the cryogenic separation
of gases is more expensive than the chemical separation (see COSORB
process) even if it provides higher purity products.
Diacetylene (HC G C - C E CH). This gaseous hydrocarbon is the most unstable
and hazardous of higher acetylenes. It should never exceed a partial
pressure of 0.05 bar (absolute pressure) in gaseous mixtures, and it should
never exceed 10% by weight in liquid phase. Gaseous or liquid-absorbed
diacetylene is progressively absorbed in solid hydrocarbons, as polymers
and naphthaline and may be abruptly released if the solid phase is hammered,
heated, dried or exposed to air. Released diacetylene may catch fire thus

accelerating the desorption up to a serious explosion. Most of incidents
which are said to happen in the acetylene plants are due to diacetylene
decomposition. About 0.3% by volume of diacetylene is contained in
the acetylene furnace gas.
Diesel Oil. A light petroleum distillate between kerosine and gasoline,
having a final boiling point up to 220C. It will be used for higher
hydrocarbon and residual carbon soot removal from the acetylene furnace
gas, in the new acetylene plant at Craiova.
Ethyl Acetate (CH3 - COO - CH2 - CH3). This liquid, fruit-smelling ester,
shall be produced at Craiova by direct reaction of acetaldehyde on aluminum
catalyst. It is a very good solvent for paints, laquers and varnishes.
Unfortunately, its future growth is likely to be affected by economic
factors(acetates, generally, are higher quality,but also more expensive
solvents) and by the trend towards solventless paints and varnishes.
Higher Acetylenes. A small amount of higher acetylenes is produced together
with acetylene in the reaction furnaces. Methyl-acetylene, vinyl-
acetylene and diacetylene are mostly produced. Their overall content in
the furnace gas does not exceed 1% by volume. Methyl- and vinyl-acetylene
are not more dangerous than acetylene itself, while diacetylene
is likely to cause many hazards.
Hydrogen (H2). A stream of average purity hydrogen shall be produced as
purge gas from the carbon monoxide separation plant. The 82% hydrogen
shall be supplied to the existing butanol plant at Craiova for the hydro-
genation of crotonaldehyde. Then a purge gas from the butanol plant,
containing methane together with all impurities of the original hydrogen
stream, shall be recovered and burnt.
Ketene. It is a product of the acetic acid pyrolysis, according to the
following reaction:  CH3 - COOH --   CH2 = C = 0 + H20.  Ketene is a
very reactive chemical. By reacting with acetic acid, it produces
acetic anhydride.
Methanol (CH3 - OH). It is a liquid alcohol which will be used as a raw
material in a series of processes leading to the production of formaldehyde,
dimethyl terephthalate, acetic acid, methyl halides and other methyl
compounds and is recently growing as a raw material also for the methyl-ter-
butilic ester. Methanol will be obtained at Craiova by the following
reactions: (two step synthesis) 3 CH4 + C02 + 2H20 = 4 CO + 8 H2
(reforming) 4 CO + 8 H2 = 4 CH3 - OH (synthesis). Reforming pressure shall
be about 50 bar.
Nitrogen Monoxide (NO). A product of ammonia oxidation and/or bacteric
metabolism in the process cooling and scrubbing water. A few ppm of nitrogen
monoxide in the acetylene off-gas may cause serious hazards if the gas is
used for cryogenic separation of CO and H2. Unstable nitro-resins may be

concentrated in the low temperature heat exchangers and liquid separators
and may cause serious explosions when heated. This is why the Craiova
cryogenic CO separation has been rejected.
Oxygen Separation. By partial liquefaction of air, achieved through
compressed air expansion and cooling due to the Joule-Thomson effect,
part of the oxygen from the compressed air can be separated at high
purity, the remaining impure oxygen is discharged together with nitrogen.
Also, high purity nitrogen can be produced in the same plant. The
presence of small amounts of dissolved hydrocarbons in the liquid oxygen
may be highly hazardous. To avoid a dangerous hydrocarbon concentration
in the liquid phase, each oxygen separation plant must be shut off every
6 to 24 months, according to the hydrocarbon concentration. Also, the
accumulation of solid carbon dioxide and ice may cause the oxygen
separation plant to be shut off.
Polyvinyl Acetate. It is generally produced by polimerization of vinyl
acetate. Both solution and dispersion polimerizations are possible.
Dispersion polimerization will be used at Craiova, with polyvinyl
alcohol and cellulosic compounds as main disperdent in water. The
reaction shall be promoted by hydrogen peroxide. Polyvinyl acetate
dispersion is a dense, milk-white, viscous liquid, which does not cause
health or environmental hazards. The principal uses of polyvinyl
acetate dispersion are in emulsion paints, adhesives, paper coating,
and textile auxiliaries. A lot of different qualities can be produced,
due to different chemicals, reaction time, temperature, reactor mixing,
etc.
Polyvinyl Alcohol. A dense liquid or solid product obtained by hydrolisis
of a solution of polyvinyl acetate. Bulk polymerized vinyl acetate may
be dissolved into methanol, or simply a solution of vinyl acetate in
methanol may be polymerized. Then a change of pH leads to the following
reaction: Polyvinyl acetate + methanol - polyvinyl alcohol + methyl
acetate. A normal by-product of polyvinyl alcohol is methyl acetate or a
methyl acetate/methanol azeotrope. Polyvinyl alcohol may be produced as
a dense solution or dried up to a fine white powder. It is used for
textile warp sizing, in the manufacture of polyvinyl acetate emulsions,
in paper coatings, etc.
Vinyl Acetate (CH3 - COO - CH = CH2). It is a clear, good smelling liquid,
slightly corrosive if not pure enough, due to small amounts of water
and residual acetic acid. Vinyl acetate will be produced at Craiova by
the reaction of acetic acid with acetylene (vinylation) on active carbon
and Zn salts as a catalyst. It can be produced also by the reaction of
acetic acid with ethylene. However, in Western Europe, most vinyl acetate
production is obtained through acetylene, in contrast to the situation in
the USA, where most production is based on ethylene. Unlike

vinyl chloride, it is not dangerous for human health, nor causes environ-
mental hazards.
Vinylation.   The production of a vinyl compound by addition of an
organic or mineral acid into the triple bond of acetylene. The general
formula is (acid radical) - CH = CH2.

ROMANIA: CRAIOVA CHEMICAL PROJECT
PRODUCTION, DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND EXPORTS OF END USE PRODUCTS
1.        The major downstream products of methanol are synthetic resins
(via formaldehyde and methyl methacrylate), synthetic rubber (via poly-
isoprene) and synthetic fibres (via dimethyl terephthalate). Acetic acid
and its derivatives have many end uses, but the major outlets are in arti-
ficial fibres, paints and lacquers, adhesives (used in many products rang-
ing from footwear to furniture) and as bleaching agents and coatings in
the textile industry. The following table shows production, home consump-
tion and gross exports for these end uses from 1965-1977, with projections
until 1985.
2.        Synthetic Resins.  As can be seen from the table, production,
consumption and exports of synthetic resins (excluding PVC and polyethy-
lene) rose rapidly in the period 1965-1977, but much lower growth rates
are projected for the future. By 1985, domestic per capita consumption
will have risen to 7 kg (compared with 4.1 kg in 1977). This is low com-
pared with current per capita consumption in Western Europe. UK consump-
tion per capita in the period 1974-76 stood at 17.8 kg when the Federal
Republic of Germany achieved a per capita consumption of 37.9 kg. Indeed,
Romania per capita consumption of all synthetic resins (including PVC and
polyethylene) is only one third of the Western European level, and will
not have reached Western European per capita consumption levels by 1985.
Romania has exported a large proportion of its production since the mid-
1960s. Exports in 1976 and 1977 accounted for 74% and 56% respectively
of domestic production; 59% is projected for export in 1985.
3.        Synthetic Rubber.  Methanol is used in the manufacture of poly-
isoprene with which Romania is planning to replace most of its current
imports of natural rubher. A rapidly growing use for polyisoprene rubber
is in the manufacture of radial tyres. Polyisoprene will, however, repre-
sent only about 20% of synthetic rubber production by 1985. Much of the
production of other synthetic rubber is destined for export. By 1985, per
capita consumption of rubber in Romania is projected to reach 13.5 kg, com-
pared with a projected per capita consumption in the same year (1985) for
the USA of 21.5 kg, the UK of 13.9 kg and for the Federal Republic of
Germany of 16.1 kg; thus the projected Romanian per capita consumption
will still be somewhat below more developed countries.
4.        Man Made Fibres.  In IBRD report No. 1436-RO dated 5-24-77, which
dealt with the Cimpulung-Muscel Polyester Fibre Project, estimates were made
of the 1985 fibre production and mill consumption; the report stated that a
large deficit in fibre supplies would develop by 1985 if no new projects
were to be started after 1980. The report's projections, together with the
current Romanian estimates are shown below.

It can be seen that the Romanian authorities are now planning to increase
production capacity in order to prevent the anticipated production deficit.
At the same time, the product mix has changed; while total mill consumption
of man-made fibres is about the same as previously projected, a higher pro-
portion of artificial fibres in the total mix is now contemplated. Romania
has already established export markets for synthetic fibres; the projected
exports of 155,000 tons in 1985 are small compared with international trade
in these products. Gross imports into Western Europe in 1976, for instance,
were over 760,000 tons.
5.        Paints and Lacquers.  The Romanian paint industry is well organized
and product quality is high. Local consumption is expected to grow at about
the same rate as in the past. By 1985, per capita consumption will reach
13.3 kg compared with projected per capita consumptions for the same year
of 25.9 kg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and 14.3 kg in the UK and
Belgium. Gross exports of 86,000 tons are projected for 1985; these will
be mainly to the USSR and other Comecon countries.

ACETYLENE TECHNOLOGY AND USES OF ACETYLENE
A. Introduction
1.        Acetylene has been used in metal cutting and welding for many years
and since the early part of the 20th century has played an important role as
a chemical intermediate. Its maximum utilization was reached in the mid-1960s;
since then technologies based on lower cost ethylene and propylene from large
naphtha and ethane crackers have to a large extent replaced the processes
based on acetylene.
2.        However, for countries with an indigenous source of natural gas
(methane) and insufficient petroleum feedstocks such a naphtha, the use of
acetylene based processes may still be attractive; since acetylene is pro-
duced typically In units with much smaller capacities (10,000-80,000 tpy)
than have become common for olefines production, the acetylene based pro-
cesses continue to receive attention when domestic demands for derivatives
are at levels which would not justify large scale production, and where the
technologies employed to produce these derivatives do not exhibit significant
economies of scale.
B. Production Methods
3.        Formerly, acetylene was produced mainly from calcium carbide.  The
carbide itself is manufactured by mixing lime and coke in a 60/40 mixture
and heating it to over 2,000C in an electric furnace. The process is ex-
tremely energy intensive, requiring 2,900 KWH per ton of carbide (over 9,000
KWH per ton of aoetylene), and was often used where cheap hydroelectric power
was available.
4.        An alternative process, which has been used both in Europe and in
the USA, is via electric arc cracking of hydrocarbons. Also, this process
is extremely energy intensive, requiring over 12,000 KWH per ton of acetylene,
and has been generally abandoned.
5.        The preferred route today for acetylene production is by the partial
oxidation of methane or a higher hydrocarbon, such as naphtha. By reaction
of a preheated hydrocarbon vapor and oxygen, part of the hydrocarbon is oxi-
dized, the temperature rises up to about 1,4000C and the remaining hydrocarbon
is involved in a cracking. If an immediate quench follows, some unstable Pro-
ducts, such as acetylene and higher acetylenes, can be obtained in the result-
ing gas mixture.
6.        In the furnace gas, acetylene generally ranges from 7 to 8.5% if
the feedstock is methane, even more if the feedstock is a higher hydrocarbon.
Higher acetylenes are present as a rule in the range from 0.5 to 1.0%. As
a result of the oxidation of natural gas or naphtha, carbon monoxide and a
small amount of carbon dioxide are also produced. As a result of the crack-
ing, a large amount of hydrogen is produced, as well as carbon soot.

7.        The furnace gas is first quenched and scrubbed by water, then
filtered in electro-filters or in coke-filled carbon scrubbers, to remove
the carbon soot, which can be recovered and burned, thus allowing a worthy
energy saving.
8.        The pyrolysis pressure must be as low as possible, while acetylene
separation requires higher pressure, generally ranging from 7 to 15 bar.
Therefore, before entering the acetylene separation unit, the furnace gas
is compressed in centrifugal, reciprocating or helicoidal compressors.
Increasing pressure allows more acetylenic polymers to build up, together
with residual carbon soot, inside the compressor, to such an extent that
sometimes the compressor itself has to be shut off, opened and cleaned.
No major hazards are due to the presence of dilute acetylene and higher
acetylenes as long as they remain at low concentration within the furnace
gas.   However, the partial pressure of acetylene should never exceed 30
psia (Union Carbide maX4.pressure). In case of a higher partial pressure,
a non-explosive decomposition may occur, leading to very hazardous local
overheating in compressors and pipes.
9.        A further step in acetylene processing is the acetylene separation.
It is achieved by absorption in organic or inorganic solvents, as acetone,
N-methylpirrolidone and ammonia.  After the absorption -- generally at low
temperature and average pressure -- and the desorption -- generally at low
pressure and average temperature -- proper technologies and careful opera-
tion are required, to prevent decompositions or even detonations of
acetylenes.
10.       Pure acetylene must never be handled at high pressure.  The maxi-
mum allowable pressure depends on the inside diameter of pipes and vessels:
the higher is the pressure, the smaller must be the pipe -- and the vessel --
size. No size limits are required for pressure below 0.4 bar (gauge) /1.
Higher acetylenes, as diacetylene, vinylacetylene and methylacetylene are
even more unstable gases. They must never be concentrated and their safe
separation and combustion is a matter of proper engineering and careful
operation. Guidelines for safe handling of acetylene have been published
by specific committees in the USA and in the F.R. Germany. No major hazards
are present today in an acetylene plant, provided that it is properly
designed and operated.
11.       The acetylene off-gas, after complete removal of acetylene and
higher acetylenes, is suitable for use as synthesis gas in ammonia plants;
carbon monoxide and hydrogen may be separated from the off-gas and used
as raw materials in a variety of chemical synthesis products.
C. Uses of Acetylene
12.       Acetylene, possessing a triple bond, is a highly reactive chemical
and can be used as the raw material to produce a large number of common
organic chemicals. The principal end products are used in plastic manu-
facture and in the production of coatings, paints, adhesives, solvents,
textile auxiliaries, and pharmaceuticals. Among the major ones are:
/1    According to the TRAC standards, from Germany.

13.       Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) is the second most important thermo-
plastic today, being used primarily for pipe manufacture, as a leather
substitute, and as a metal substitute in industrial plants and the build-
ing industry. Recent studies have demonstrated a high incidence of cancer
in workers exposed to vinyl chloride monomer, and the future growth of PVC
demand is now in doubt.
14.       Acrylates find outlets as coatings and in the textile industry
where they are used to give permanent press characteristics to fabrics.
15.       Polyvinyl Acetate has become extremely important as the main
component of water based paints which have made large inroads in the
market formerly dominated by lacquers. It is also used in the manufac-
ture of adhesives.
16.       Polyvinyl Alcohol is used for textile warp sizing, in the manu-
facture of adhesives, in paper coatings, and as an emulsifier. A promising
new use is in the production of a fibre with good heat insulation properties
which may find outlets in the manufacture of work clothes for steel workers,
firemen, etc.
17.       Chlorinated Solvents, particularly trichlorethylene, are used for
degreasing metal parts in metal fabrication and as grease solvents in the
dry cleaning of fabrics.
18.       A variety of organic solvents, such as ethyl and butyl acetates,
can be manufactured from acetylene derivatives. They find their main use
in paints, coatings, and adhesives. They lost ground in the nitrocellulose
lacquer field to other cheaper solvents, but have recently gained some
popularity as they cause less air pollution compared with competing products.
19.       Acetic Acid and Anhydride are used for the production of cellulose
acetate, a classical intermediate for artificial fibres, films, and plastics.
The use of cellulose acetate in the manufacture of cigarette filters is still
growing, but in all other uses, it is being displaced by synthetics based on
olefines.   Acetic anhydride is also used in the manufacture of aspirin;
this market is expected to be stable for many years to come.
D. Other Routes to Acetylene-based Chemicals and Future Acetylene Demand
20.       In many cases, however, competitive processes using lower cost
olefines as raw materials have displaced the acetylene routes, e.g., in
the production of vinyl chloride (or PVC) and in acrylonitrile production.
21.       Chlorinated solvents, such as trichlorethane, trichlorethylene,
and perchlorethylene are easily produced by reacting chlorine with acety-
lene. Competitive routes, starting from methane or ethylene, exist, but
more than half of the trichlorethylene produced today is still obtained by
using acetylene as raw material.

22.       Quantities of acrylics (used in the paint and textile industries)
are still manufactured by carbonylation of acetylene, but technologies based
on propylene are popular. Nonetheless, about 40% of acrylics produced are
still based on the route via acetylene.

PROJECT COST AND FINANCING REQUIRED
ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR ESTIMATION OF CAPITAL COSTS
1.        Detailed capital cost estimates have been prepared by IITPIC
together with the Central. They are based on complete process engineer-
ing, carried out up to First Quarter of 1978. Equipment cost estimates
are based on quotations in early 1978. For acetic acid plant, CO-separation
plant, and methanol compressors, with an aggregate cost of US$16.6 million
or 40% of total foreign equipment cost, firm contract prices were used.
2.        Romanian estimates are generally prepared including price
escalation and physical contingencies. To determine whether or not cost
estimates are realistic, physical contingencies and price escalation were
subtracted to arrive at a mid-1977 base cost estimate.
3.        All equipment costs include foreign and local transportation
charges. Detailed equipment lists are provided in the Project File. Under
the Romanian system, spares are not included in the initial investment
costs but are paid out of the operating budgets of the enterprises. Here,
to fully reflect the foreign exchange costs of the project, a relatively
small provision (3% of equipment value) for spares of imported equipment is
included. Duty on imports is included.
4.        Physical contingencies were added at an average 3.2% of the base
cost estimate and are considered to be adequate in view of the advanced
stage of project preparation. For provision of price escalation, locally
procured items have been assumed to increase by 1% p.a. while for imports
7.5% p.a. is assumed.
5.        Interest during construction is calculated on the basis of US$40
million Bank loan at 7.35% interest per year and a supplier's credit of
US$12.9 million at 7.5% interest per year. The estimated disbursements for
the Bank loan are as follows:
US$ million      19791/ 1980   1981   1982   Total
Bank Loan       16.0   15.0    8.0    1.0    40.0

ANNEX 6
Page 1
ROMANIA: CRAIOVA CHEMICAL PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. General
1.        Projections of the likely financial status of the project
are done in current terms, which are practically the 1977 Lei, since domestic
inflation has been and is expected also in the future to be very small. Also, it
is the general pricing policy in Romania to adjust output prices in line with
changes in the prices of inputs. Therefore, it is likely that any future price
revisions, although changing the absolute level of revenues and costs,
will not basically change the structure of the projections made here.
B. Product Mix
2.        The product mix at full capacity is given in the table on page
3, and the production build-up is in the table on page 4.
C. Product Prices
3.        For all project's products, 1977 Romanian prices have been used.
It is the pricing policy in Romania to set prices high enough to cover pro-
duction costs and to provide for chemical products a margin of 30-35% for
taxes and benefits. The table on page 3 gives a summary of the product
prices at full capacity; for comparison purposes, the table also gives
economic price assumptions.
D. Production Costs
4.        The table on page 3 gives the breakdown of the production costs.
Quantities requirements for raw materials and utilities have been estimated
by IITPIC together with the Central and reviewed by the Bank. Prices of
domestic raw materials and utilities are 1977 prices adjusted for delivery
to Craiova.
5.        Labor requirements have been determined by IITPIC and the Central,
and the average annual salary of 40,500 Lei (US$2,250 equivalent) is based
on present pay levels within Romania's industry.
6.        Depreciation of fixed assets is based on the recently revised
schedule resulting for a chemical plant in a rate of 3.6-4.7% per year.
An annual rate of 4.5% has been assumed here.
7.        Other production costs, mainly maintenance materials and adminis-
trative costs, have been estimated by IITPIC and the Central based on the
actual costs of the existing chemical plants.
8.        Again, for comparison, economic costs are given in the same
table.

ANNEX 6
Page 2
E. Production and Income Statements
9.        The table on page 4 shows the projected production and income
statements for the project for the first eight years of operation. Pro-
duction of methanol and of acetic acid is assumed to start January 1, 1980,
while production of other products would start in 1981 and 1982. Revenues
and production costs have been calculated in accordance with the assump-
tions stated above. The benefit tax shown is calculated to limit the
benefits of the Enterprise to 15% of total production costs. The actual
tax rate provided in the decree No. 104 is a function of the profitability
of the enterprise but has, in essence, the effect of siphoning all benefits
above 15% to the budget.
F. Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheets
10.       Tables on pages 5 and 6 show the projected cash flow and balance
sheet accounts. Working capital requirements are as per Annex 5-1, page 3.
Although the enterprise is not paying the debt service on the Bank loan,
these are shown and a notional debt service coverage is calculated.
The Bank loan of US$40 million will be made for a period of 14 years, in-
cluding 3-1/2 years of grace, at an interest rate of 7.35%p.a.; and the
German supplier's credit of US$12.9 million is assumed to be for five
years (with the first repayment due six months after the last disbursement)
at an interest rate of 7.5% p.a. However, for the purpose of the analysis,
it is assumed that the total remittances to the Investment Bank by the Enter-
prise will be sufficient to cover the equivalent in Lei of the interest at a
rate of 10%.
11.       Except for retention of funds to pay a bonus to workers (calcu-
lated at 2% of labor cost) and for the reserve fund for increased require-
ments of working capital (calculated at 1% of net working capital), all
funds are transferred to the State budget.
G. Financial Rates of Return
12.       Financial rates of return are calculated for the expansion project
as a whole. The cash flows and results are given on page 6, all returns
are in 1977 constant terms.

ROMANIA: CRAIOVA CHEMICAL PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. General
1.        The economic rates of return for the project have been calculated
in constant 1977 dollars. All benefits and costs for tradeable items have
been determined by using expected long-term international prices estimated
by the Bank (on the basis of several consultants studies)
to prevail in the 1980s. For non-tradeable items, domestic prices have
been adjusted to reflect the international price level of their foreign
components. Labor, which accounts for only about 5% of total economic
operating costs, has not been shadow priced and its financial cost has
been used. Prices used are summarized in the table on page 3 of Annex o.
B. Capital Costs
2.        The capital costs used for calculating the financial rate of
return have also been used here after deducting duties which represent Lei
36 million, or 1.3% of project cost.
C. Operating Costs
3.        About half of the project's total economic costs comes from
methane. The price of methane is that of its most attractive use, i.e,
as fuel in power plants. In such a case, methane replaces either locally
available lignite or residual fuel oils which are produced during crude oil
refining:
(i)   Based on a lignite production cost of US$9-12 per ton and adjust-
ing for relative transportation cost and lignite's calorific value,
the economic value of methane is US$40 per 1,000 m3.
(ii) Based on international fuel oil prices of US$75 per ton (price
prevailing in Northwest Europe), equivalent to US$13 per barrel
of crude oil, and after adjustment for relative transportation
cost and calorific value, the corresponding economic value of
methane is US$60 per 1,000 m3.
4.        The higher value, iLe, US$60 per 1,000 m3 was retained as the
base case of the analysis, reflecting the substitution for fuel oil, and
sensitivity tests for lower (US$40 per 1,000 m3) and also higher (US$70 per
1,000 m3) were also carried out.
5.        The economic costs of electricity and steam (at 13 Ata) have been
assumed at US2.5 per kWh and US$6.5 per ton respectively (US$5.5 per ton
at 8 Ata) compared to Romanian prices of US1.5 per ktTh and US$1.9 per ton
of steam at 13 Ata (US$1.7 per ton at 8 Ata).
6.        The economic cost of polyvinyl alcohol has been assumed at US$1,500
per ton, based on present and future prices estimated by several consultants,
compared to the Romanian price of US$3,722 per ton. For other chemicals,
labor and other operating costs, financial costs have been taken for the
economic analysis.

D. Economic Benefits
7.        About 80% of the project's output will substitute for imPorts,
while the rest is assumed to be exported. The economic prices (ex-factory) are
shown in the table on page 3 in Annex 6. Prices are discussed in Chapter
III of the main report. Ex-factory prices have been derived as follows:

(i)   the project will export all production in excess of
the projected domestic market- and
(ii)  no additional plants are buili.
b/  On the average, 5% of the ex-factory price.
c/ On the average, 10% of the ex-factory price, including the EEC tariffs.
E. Project Life and Terminal Value
10.       Project life was conservatively estimated at 12 years, and a
sensitivity test for a 15-year life was carried out. No terminal value
was credited to the project except for a notional working capital recovery.
