GUJARAT RURAL ROADS PROJECT
(CR. 1757-IN)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Gujarat Rural Roads Project
(Credit 1757-IN) in India, for which Credit 1757-IN in the amount of SDR 101 million (equivalent
to US$119.6 million) was approved on February 17, 1987 and made effective on August 27, 1987.
The credit was closed on December 31, 1995, one year later than the original closing date.
The final disbursement took place on May 21, 1996. The total disbursed under the credit was SDR
71,226,087 and the credit balance of SDR 10,473,913 was cancelled on May 31, 1996.
This ICR was prepared by a mission" from the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme,
which visited India from March 15 to 28, 1996.
This ICR is based on information from the project files in Washington D.C. and New Delhi.
The implementing agency - Gujarat Roads and Building Department - contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by providing information to the ICR mission in the field.
The Borrower has submitted its comments on the draft ICR and has prepared its
contribution to the ICR (see Appendix B).

GUJARAT RURAL ROADS PROJECT
(Cr. 1757-IN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introducfton
1.    The World Bank's lending to the transport sector in India started in 1949 with the first Loan
to Indian Railways (IR). By the time the Gujarat Rural Roads Project (GRRP) was appraised, over
20 loans/credits including one for rural roads (Bihar Rural Roads Project) had been made to the
sector. Furthermore, in the agriculture sector several irrigation projects have included the
construction/rehabilitation of over 9,000 km of rural roads in various states. The GRRP was in
response to the Government of India's (GOI) objective of improving all weather village connective
in a key agricultural state like Gujarat. Incidentally, the Gujarat Irrigation II Project which was
being implemented at the time had a large rural roads components and suffered initially from poor
construction quality due to outdated construction techniques, materials and payment delays. At the
beginning, the GOG had also problems in planning and managing the implementation of the
project, and this problem was corrected with the formation of a dedicated Project Planning and
Monitoring Cell together with the use of a Gujarat-based consultant firm, which developed and
introduced computerised project planning techniques. Some of the lessons learned in the
implementation of the Gujarat Irrigation II were put to good use in the preparation and
implementation of the GRRP.
Project Objectives
2.    The project development objectives were: (1) provide all weather roads in rural areas; (2)
improve rural road construction and maintenance, road planning and road maintenance
management; (3) development of a higher level of road safety and; (4) training of local staff in the
administration and operation of the road network. At appraisal the project components included: (i)
construction, reconstruction and improvement of about 4,040 km of village roads connecting 1,900
villages; (ii) procurement of equipment and vehicles; (iii) construction of houses, offices,
warehouses and workshops; (iv) engineering and consulting services for project planning, design,
supervision, monitoring and staff training; (v) technical assistance for a road maintenance study;
and (vi) preparation of a road safety program.



Implementation Experience and Results
3.    Project implementation started off slowly; after two and a half years, the project was almost
two years behind schedule2, and was suffering from inadequate funding and poor management (see
Part I, para 3). Starting from 1990, implementation progress started to improve due to increased
commitment by GOG, appointment of an Officer on Special Duty to take charge of the project, and
the lending of funds by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). In 1991, GOG requested
an increase in the physical scope of the project and IDA after monitoring implementation
performance for over a year agreed in 1993 to increase the target length of roads to be improved to
about 6,300 km. When ongoing contracts are completed (mid to late 1996) some 6,250 km of all-
weather roads will have been completed, 50% more than the original SAR estimate of
approximately 4,040 km.
4.    As a result of the project, rural road construction techniques have improved through the
adoption of more modem contracting methods by the R&BD. At present, even for the construction
of rural roads the use of force account has been discontinued. Overall, the construction quality of
the project roads has been satisfactory with some having being built to a very high standard.
However, on a limited number of contracts, construction quality problems such as inadequate
compaction of earthworks, poorly compacted concrete, lack of curing of concrete and cracked or
damaged culvert pipes were reported by Bank supervision missions.
5.    The road maintenance planning study which includes a computerised maintenance planning
system (MPS) was completed substantially behind schedule. Until maintenance funding is
increased for all of the road network and the output of the MPS is used in a systematic manner, it is
unlikely that the condition of parts of the Gujarat road network will improve. However, it must be
stressed that Gujarat even with the current funding constraints is doing a reasonably good job at
maintaining its road network. Although it was listed as an objective of the project, there was no
specific provision under the project to fund the preparation of a road safety program. Improved
traffic segregation, signalling and other road safety improvements introduced by the R&BD during
the life of the project were not financed by the project.
6.    The total project cost to completion is now estimated to be Rs 3,267 million (147% of the
SAR Rs estimate) equivalent to US$126.6 million (74% of SAR estimate). Following a mid term
review of the project in February 1993, SDR 19.3 million (US$22.85 million) was cancelled from
the credit due to project savings caused by the depreciation of the Rs vis-a-vis the US$, and a final
undisbursed balance of SDR 10.5 million was cancelled on May 31, 1996.
7.    The ERR for the project calculated in the SAR was estimated at 28%, and was based on the
economic analysis of 260 individual roads, representing 30% of the total road length (and about
25% of the total estimated project cost). This analysis was based primarily on benefits arising to
2     At the end of FY90, the actual disbursements from the IDA Credit aggregated to just about 30% of the cummulative
disbursement for the period until the end of the FY estimated at appraisal (see Part IlI/Table 4).



iv
the dairy sector (increased milk procurement, reduced wastage and a reduction in milk animal
deaths) and from savings on vehicle operating costs (VOC), but excluded benefits from savings in
dairy transport costs and increased agricultural production attributable to the improved project
roads. The analysis also assumed that there would be no incremental milk production without the
project, and that all incremental milk production was attributable to project roads, although other
factors such as investments in more milk chilling centres and collection centres, improved dairy
farm management methods and genetic improvement of milk animals would also contribute to
increased milk production.
8.    The ERR has been re-estimated at project completion correcting for the above deficiencies
and has included all project roads. The re-estimated ERR of 16% (see Appendix C for details)
though not comparable methodologically to the 28% ERR estimated in the SAR, reconfirms that
the project-supported rural roads program is economically viable.
9.    Because the economic analysis at appraisal covered only 30% of the total project roads, the
SAR expected that the economic returns of the remaining roads would be calculated after credit
approval to ensure that only economically viable road proposals would be accepted for financing
under the project. In actual fact, the relevant analyses were often undertaken by engineering staff
poorly trained in economic analysis and in some cases no economic evaluation was conducted of
the rural roads selected for improvement. This has lead to the inclusion in the project of a small
percentage of project roads with low rates of return that were included for improvement on the
basis of political and connectivity criteria.
10.   The performance of IDA during both the project preparation and implementation phases
was satisfactory, except that IDA allowed Credit Negotiations to be delayed for over two years after
appraisal (see Part II/Table 3) to accommodate the borrower's wish to have the project fully funded
by an IDA Credit instead of an IBRD Loan. During project implementation, IDA was responsive to
the borrowers needs. IDA agreed to extend the physical scope of the project, increased
disbursement percentages and postponed the credit closing date by one year to allow the
completion of several hundred km's of rural roads. The R&BD considers that IDA supervision
missions gave valuable guidance and support.
11.   Delays by GOI in passing on project funds to GOG, slowed down implementation progress
during the first five years of the project. After the initial implementation delays and once the
funding situation improved, the R&BD performance was good, making this one of the few
successful Bank funded road projects in India. However, inadequate planning caused the award of
some contracts to be delayed due to land acquisition problems and low quality of engineering
designs. In some cases, construction quality fell short of agreed standards. Furthermore, the failure
to properly evaluate the economic returns of all roads may have resulted in the inclusion of some
roads with low rates of return in the project.
Summary of Findings, Future Operation and Key Lessons Learned
12.   Whereas the project's dairy benefits are probably less than expected at appraisal, due in part
to the introduction of more milk chilling centres, they are still significant. Considerable benefits



v
have been generated from incremental agricultural production attributable to the improved roads
and there are other social benefits, such as improved access to health and education facilities.
Although implementation was initially slow, project outcome can be considered satisfactory since
the main physical objectives were substantially exceeded, while the non physical objectives were in
large part met, even though there were delays in the implementation of the MPS.
13.   Future Oprations. Although all of the project roads are rural roads, which could be
maintained at the village Parishad level, it is proposed in the outline operational plan that they be
maintained by the R&BD. This would enable a state level maintenance effort, with uniform
standards and funding, to meet in a prioritised fashion the maintenance requirements of the whole
rural road network. However, nothwitsanding the recommendations of the operational plan the
issue of devolving the maintenance of rural roads at the local level should be further studied.
Furthermore, any future road project in Gujarat should make the improvement of maintenance
funding and procedures of the whole road network a major development objective of Bank
involvement in the sector. This should ensure the long term sustainability of the whole road
network in Gujarat, including the 6000+ km of rural roads improved under the GRRP.
14.   Key Lessons. Provided strong political support and project ownership exist to overcome
fiunding shortages and other constraints, a well targeted and focused rural roads projects can be
successfully implemented. However, from a technical point of view, even simple rural roads
require proper engineering design and construction techniques, particularly with regards to
drainage, compaction and quality control of construction by implementing agency3. The design
and construction quality standards required should be clearly and strictly enforced through adequate
supervision mechanisms to obtain uniform construction quality.
15.   Land required for construction must be fully available and utilities should be relocated
before award of contracts for construction or contract terms should be adjusted to take account of
the possible non availability of land for some of the works.
16.   Post qualification of bidders can be an effective procedure for use when selecting civil
works contractors provided the qualification criteria are strict and are clearly defined. However, on
larger construction contracts the use of pre qualification is preferable.
17.   If non-economist are to assess the economic viability of each rural road before it is
sanctioned for construction, clear/specific guidelines on the methodology to use should be provided
and its application should be strictly supervised. Such work should be supported by inputs from
agriculturists and agricultural economists to fully capture the benefits of increased agricultural
production. Selection and design of rural roads would be simplified if up-to-date accurate
topographical maps were available together with strip maps.
18.   A steady flow of contracts over several years encourages contractors to modernise by
adopting more modem construction techniques and through increased mechanisation.
These may be Government staff as in this project or consultants appointed for supervision of construction.

PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
Objectives
1.    The project's development objectives were the: (1) provision of all weather roads in rural
areas; (2) improvement of rural road planning, construction and maintenance management; (3)
development of a higher level of road safety and; (4) training of local staff in the administration
and operation of the road network. At appraisal the project components included: (i) construction,
reconstruction and improvement of approximately 4,040 km of village roads connecting 1,900
villages; (ii) procurement of equipment and vehicles; (iii) construction of houses, offices,
warehouses and workshops; (iv) engineering and consulting services for project planning, design,
supervision, monitoring and staff training; (v) technical assistance for a road maintenance study;
and (vi) preparation of a road safety program. In addition the project aimed to improve road
construction practices (SAR para 2.18) and improve contract management. This was to be
achieved by encouraging larger contract packages including all the works on a stretch of road, the
use of bank guarantees and the use of subcontracting. A minimum contract size of Rs 10 million
was to be achieved from the second year of the project. In 1993, taking account of increased
amounts of rupees available due to the depreciation of the Indian Rupee vis-a-vis the SDR, the
scope of the project was increased to include a total of about 6,300 km of rural roads and SDR 19.3
million was cancelled due to project savings.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
2.    By 1990, two and a half years after credit effectiveness, implementation progress was
almost two years behind schedule and was suffering from inadequate funding ', delays in land
acquisition, delays in technical sanctions, poor contract management, weak enforcement of
contractual conditions and specifications, inadequate R&BD staff and frequent staff turnover.
None of the works started in the previous 30 months had been completed; works were partially
completed on about 400 km of road, less than 10% of the work with about 35% of the project
duration elapsed. Subsequently, implementation progress improved due to an increased
commitment by GOG, appointment of an Officer on Special Duty to take charge of the project and
Due in part to financial constraints resulting from three successive drought years.



-2-
the lending of funds by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB)2. In 1991 GOG requested
an increase in the physical scope of the project, mainly for new milk-collection roads. IDA afier
monitoring implementation performance for over a year, agreed in February 1993, to increase the
target length of roads for improvement to about 6,300 km. When the credit closed at the end of
December 1995, 5,662 km of road had been completed, 140% of the appraisal target and about 87%
of the revised target. It is expected that when all ongoing contracts are completed by mid/end 1996
approximately 6,250 km of rural roads, will have been completed, which is about 155% of the SAR
target.
3.    As a result of the project, rural road construction techniques have improved through the
adoption of modern contracting techniques; contracts are awarded for complete stretches of roads
with subcontracting and the use of bank guarantees allowed, which was not previously the case;
materials and equipment are now procured by the contractors rather than by the R&BD. Partial
mechanisation of construction methods has contributed to higher quality roads with better riding
quality than before. Although average contract size has increased because of the project, the
minimum size of contract envisaged at appraisal has rarely been achieved, with only about 80 of
about 420 contracts (19%) exceeding Rsl 0 million3. Overall construction quality has been good as
reported in Bank supervision mission reports. However, there are also references of inconsistent
construction quality. Examples are given of inadequate compaction of earthworks, poorly
compacted and cured concrete, cracked or damaged culvert pipes. Reasons for this include the
wide variety of contractors used, weak post-qualification criteria and, most importantly, inadequate
site supervision. Nevertheless, the steady flow of contracts over a period of approximately seven
years has enabled a number of contractors to receive a steady stream of work and thereby become
established, gain good experience and build up competent staff and good equipment. A system for
monitoring physical and financial progress of the project was established by consultants and used
effectively throughout project implementation. This was of considerable help to Bank supervision
missions (and to the ICR mission) but R&BD staff do not expect to use it for other projects.
4.    An objective of the project was to improve road planning and programming through proper
economic analysis, including economic analysis of each rural road included in the project. The
methods of economic analysis applied in project preparation and throughout the project, while
correctly valuing transport and savings in VOCs, overvalued dairy-related benefits and did not
adequately quantify all other agricultural benefits generated from the improved rural road network.
According to R&BD staff, economic analysis was applied to all roads which were chosen for
inclusion in the project. The ICR mission saw evidence of economic analysis for 260 (out of 1,025)
roads included in the SAR and of benefit/cost ratio calculations for roads added to the project in
1993. The latter were made by engineering staff in construction divisions, inexperienced in
economic analysis and even these analyses were not always used for screening the roads to be
2
Four loans each of Rs 100 million at 17.5% per year interest were made by NDDB to GOG at six monthly intervals
starting in 1991/92.
If allowance for inflation is made this would reduce to abut 30 contracts (7%) exceeding the equivalent of Rs 10
million in 1989. The Project Agreernent required civil works to be grouped in packages of USS500,000 or more to the
extent practicable. Only about 56 contracts (23%) have exceeded this figure.



-3-
included in the project. As a result and as reported to the ICR mission by R&BD staff, a few roads
with low benefit/cost ratios have been included in the project.
5.    Road maintenance management was to have been improved by implementing the
recommendations of a road Maintenance Planning System (MPS), which was to have been carried
out during the project. The study was completed substantially behind schedule, and the software
required to operate the system is not yet fully operational. Furthermore, until an adequate quantum
of road condition survey data is inputted into system and until the MPS is used in a systematic
manner, it is unlikely to fully generate an improvement in maintenance management practices.
However, road maintenance has been improved to some extent by the provision of equipment and
training of staff.
6.    The quantity of equipment procured is considerably less than estimated at appraisal, due to
a change in policy, whereby contractors are now expected to provide all of their equipment. Also
some equipment, for example hot-mix asphalt plant, are now readily available in Gujarat. The
requirements for buildings were overestimated at appraisal; the number built is about half of
appraisal estimates, partly due to the lack of constructable land.
7.    Although listed as an objective of the project, there was no specific provision under the
project for preparation of a road safety program. Improved traffic segregation, signalling and other
road safety improvements introduced by R&BD during the life of the project were not financed by
the project.
8.    The training component of the project shown in Table 3.4 (page 68) of the SAR to be
carried out at the Engineering Staff College, Ghandinagar has been completed although the total
number of staff trained (293) is somewhat less than the 485 shown in the SAR. Overseas training
was not approved by GOI.
9.    The economic analysis undertaken at appraisal covered 260 individual roads, representing
30% of the total project roads and about 25% of the estimated total project cost. The analysis
yielded high returns ranging from 19% to 42% indicating the project's economic viability. Based
on the analysis of 260 roads, the weighted average ERR for the project was calculated at 28%. This
analysis was based on benefits arising to the dairy sector (increased milk procurement, reduced
wastage and a reduction in milk animal deaths) and from savings on VOC, but excluded beiefits
from savings in dairy transport costs and increased agricultural production attributable to project
roads. Another weakness was that the analysis assumed that there would be no increase in milk
procurement without the project and that all incremental milk procurement was attributable to the
project roads, although other factors such as investments in more milk chilling centres and
collection centres, improved dairy farm management methods and genetic improvement of milk
animals would also contribute to increased milk production'. Further, with the benefit of hindsight,
4     Two senior R&BD staff visited UK in 1994/95.
5     Activities initiated under the National Dairy Projects (Credit 824-IN and Credit 1 859-lN/Loan 2893-IN) have had a
large impact on dairy production not anticipated in SAR.



-4-
the ICR mission found that the assumptions in the SAR regarding the benefits from increased milk
procurement, reduced wastage of milk and reduction in milk animal deaths were over estimated.
10.   The ERR has been re-estimated at project completion correcting for the above deficiencies
and including all completed project roads. The re-estimated ERR of 16% (see Appendix C for
details) though not comparable methodologically to the ERR of 28% estimated at appraisal,
confirms that the project-supported rural roads program is economically viable. It should be noted,
however, that due to the difficulties in precisely segregating increased milk procurement and
agricultural production benefits due to the project roads, the re-estimated ERR should be deemed as
indicative. However, since the relevant assumptions of the ICR mission were conservative, the
actual economic impact of the project would not be less than that reflected in the re-estimated ERR.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
11.   Factors not generally subject to government control. Project implementation was severely
affected in the early years by drought, which caused resources (financial and manpower) to be
diverted to drought relief, and by floods in August 1990, which slowed down construction progress
in large part of the state (see para 3). A shortage of bitumen during 1995 further delayed
construction progress. Sharp depreciation of the rupee vis-a-vis the SDR increased the amount of
rupees available, thereby allowing the physical scope of the project to be substantially increased
from about 4,000 km of roads in seven districts to about 6,300 km in 13 districts with substantial
savings in SDR terms.
12.   Factors generally subject to government control. Particularly in the early stages, the project
suffered from inadequate funding, inadequate numbers of staff and frequent staff turnover (para 3).
Diversion of staff and vehicles to election duties for two or three months during the working
season in 1994/1995 disrupted implementation progress.
13.   Factors generally subject to implementing agency control. In some cases, the project
suffered from delays in land acquisition and in obtaining technical sanctions, as well as from poor
contract execution and weak enforcement of contract conditions and specifications.
14.   At appraisal, the total estimated cost of the 7-year project was Rs 2,220.5 million
(US$170.8 million). This was to be financed by an IDA credit of SDR1O1 million (US$119.6
million equivalent) and by GOI and GOG contributions (US$51.2 million). In February 1993,
SDR19.3 million (US$22.85 million) was cancelled from the credit due to project savings. The
Completion cost is now estimated to be Rs 3,267 million (147% of the SAR estimate), equivalent
to US$126.6 million (74% of the SAR estimate). While the length of roads has increased by 55%
from the SAR estimate, the cost of roads in Rupee terms has increased by about 61%. However, in
US$ terms, it is 18% less than what was estimated in the SAR. Even though project
implementation took two years longer than estimated, the actual cost in Rs per km of road
constructed (Rs 444,000/km) is only slightly (4%) higher than estimated at appraisal (Rs
426,000/km). When expressed in US$ (US$17,000/km) the unit cost was only about 50% of the
SAR estimate. This is quite remarkable taking into consideration the relatively high Indian



-5-
inflation rate (approximately 10%) during the implementation period and the long implementation
period (8 years) for the project.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
15.   Sustainability of the main project component - about 6,000 km of rural roads (out of a total
road network in Gujarat of over 70,000 kIn) - will depend on; (a) the R&BD adequately monitoring
the road conditions to optimise the priority maintenance needs for the network; (b) the continued
availability of adequate funds for the maintenance and repair of the roads and; (c) the efficient use
of the funds available for maintenance (see para 20). For the project roads, sufficient funds for
maintenance have generally been made available6. R&BD has given assurances that the
maintenance requirements of the project roads would be met in full. While the capability to
maintain the roads exists, it is likely that the R&BD maintenance budgets will continue to-be
insufficient and that the maintenance of some of the less trafficked project roads could possibly be
neglected. However public interest and pressure can be expected to ensure that the more heavily
used roads are maintained in reasonable condition and overall it is likely that the project roads will
be sustained. Roads which are at present the responsibility of the project are being transferred to
the State R&BD in good condition. An outline operational plan is shown in Attachment 2 to
Appendix A.
E. PERFORMANCE OF IDA
16.   Performance of IDA during both the project processing and implementation phases has
been satisfactory, except that IDA allowed Credit Negotiations to be delayed for over two years
after appraisal (see Part II/Table 3) to accommodate the borrower's wish to have the project fully
financed by an IDA Credit rather than by an IBRD Loan. An objective of the project was to
increase the size of civil works contracts but this was discouraged by the SAR requirement that
contracts which exceeded US$ 700,000 require prior review, which entailed additional
administrative clearances (and hence delays) that R&BD were reluctant to undertake. IDA was
very responsive to the borrowers needs. IDA agreed to extend the scope of the project, increase
disbursement percentages to take account of drought and the effects of the Gulf war and to
postpone the credit closing date by one year to enable the completion of several hundred km's of
rural roads. The implementing agency considers that IDA supervision missions gave valuable
guidance and support. However, some supervision missions did not adequately monitor whether
the correct economic evaluation criteria was being used to select roads to be funded under the
project.
6     Funds made available are less than the Eighth Finance Commission's norms (see part IVTable 6) but this is to be
expected in the early years of the project. One supervision mission expressed satisfaction with maintenance but others
have only drawn attention to budgetary allocations being less than the norm.



-6-
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
17.   GOI's delays in passing on project funds to GOG, slowed down implementation progress
during the first five years of the project, and the funding situation did not really improve until 1993.
After the initial delays (para 3) and once funding problems had been largely overcome, the
borrower and the implementing agency (R&BD) generally performed satisfactorily, making this
one of the few successful Bank funded road projects in India. The SAR target of physical works
improvements was achieved by mid-1993, six months before the completion date in the SAR, and
was exceeded by more than 40% by the time the project closed. The cost of construction per km of
road was extremely close to appraisal estimates (see para 15) and GOG is to be commended for
obtaining bridging financing from NDDB to speed up project implementation. However, in some
cases, inadequate planning caused some contracts to be delayed due to lack of timely acquisition of
land; the quality of design and construction sometimes fell short of acceptable standards; and the
failure to correctly evaluate the economic benefits of all roads to be funded under the project may
have resulted in the inclusion of some roads (see para 5) with low rates of return.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
18.   Even though project implementation was initially slow, the 'physical' targets of the project
were substantially exceeded. Thanks to a steady supply of contracts over a seven year period,
several small contractors were able to modernise and to improve their road construction
capabilities. However, had the contracts for road construction been larger, as envisaged at
appraisal, larger contractors would have been established with higher levels of mechanisation and
more technical expertise, which would have probably resulted in better quality construction. The
equipment and buildings provided under the project, although less than envisaged at appraisal, are
sufficient to meet the present day requirements of the R&BD. Whereas the benefits from increased
milk production, lower milk-animal deaths, reduced souring of milk and savings on vehicle
operating costs are probably less than expected at appraisal, due to the introduction of more milk
chilling centres, they are still significant. However, considerable benefits have been generated from
incremental agricultural production attributable to the improved roads. Producers' incomes have
risen dramatically through increased mobility and access to primary markets. There have been other
social benefits difficult to quantify, such as improved access to health and education facilities.
Overall the project outcome can be considered satisfactory since the main physical objectives were
substantially exceeded, while the non physical objectives were largely meet even though there were
delays in the implementation of the MPS.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
19.   Although most of the project roads are rural roads, which could be maintained at the village
Parishad level, it is proposed in the outline operational plan (Attachment 2 to Appendix A) that they
be the responsibility of the state R&BD. This is to ensure uniform state level maintenance
standards and funding levels to meet in prioritised manner the maintenance requirements of the
whole rural road network. Since funds available to the R&BD may be used for any road contract, a



-7-
method of prioritising the use of the funds is needed. Even though the MPS completed in 1994 is
supposed to provide a rational system to prioritise maintenance needs, it still requires the input in a
systematic and timely manner of the results of periodic road condition surveys to be fully effective.
To do this for the whole state road network is likely to require a substantial investment by the
GOG in terms of time and money. An initial 'operationalization' of the MPS covering about 2,700
km of the state road network is currently underway on a pilot basis.
20.   Furthermore, any future road project in Gujarat should make the improvement of
maintenance funding and procedures of the whole road network a major development objective of
Bank involvement in the sector. This should ensure the long term sustainability of the whole road
network in Gujarat including the 6000+ km of rural roads improved under the GRRP and the roads
that would be improved under any future road project in the State.
I. KEY LESSONS
21.   Provided strong political support and project ownership exist to overcome funding
shortages and other constraints7, a well targeted rural roads project a la GRR can be successful in a
progressive state like Gujarat. Without political support and project ownership, even simple
projects can suffer from delays and weak implementation, as was the case during the first two and a
half years of implementation of this project.
22.   From a technical point of view, even the construction of simple roads like rural roads
require proper engineering design, particularly with regard to drainage, compaction and quality
control of construction by implementing agency. These design and construction quality standards
required should be clearly and strictly enforced through adequate supervision mechanisms to obtain
uniform construction quality.
23.   Land required for construction must be available and utilities must be relocated before
award of contracts for construction or the contract terms must be adjusted to take account of the
possible non-availability of land for some of the works.
24.   Post qualification of bidders can be an effective procedure for use when selecting civil
works contractors provided the qualification criteria are strict and are clearly defined. However, on
larger construction contracts the use of pre qualification is preferable.
25.   If non-economist are to assess the economic viability of each rural road before it is
sanctioned for construction, clear/specific guidelines on the methodology to use must be provided
and its application should be strictly supervised. Such work should be supported by inputs from
agriculturists and agricultural economists. Selection and design of rural roads would be simplified
if up-to-date accurate topographical maps were available.
7     Such as flood and drought.



-8-
26.   A steady flow of contracts over a long period, such as seven years, enables contractors to
receive regular work and thereby become established, gain good experience. Also it encourages
them to mechanise and adopt more modem construction techniques.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
GUJARAT RURAL ROADS PROJECT
(Cr. 1757-IN)
APPENDIX A
Mission's Aide-Memoire
A. Introduction
1.    A mission from the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme (FAO/CP) comprising R.G.
Paterson (Civil Engineer, Mission Leader), W.J. Sorrenson (Agricultural Economist), N. Olsen
(Economist) and C.S. Nawathe (World Bank Consultant Engineer) visited India from 15 to 28
March 1996, to prepare the implementation completion report (ICR) for this project. After initial
discussions with staff in the New Delhi office of the World Bank (NDO) the mission visited
Gujarat from 19 to 26 March. In Gujarat the mission discussed the implementation of the project
with the Additional Chief Secretary of Finance, the Additional Chief Secretary of Agriculture,
Secretary and staff of the Roads and Buildings Department (R&BD), staff of the Agriculture
Departrnent, Chainnan and Directors of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), staff of
the Sabarkantha, Banaskantha, Mehsana and Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers' Unions
Ltd., Gujarat Milk Marketing Federation Limited, Gujarat Dairy Development Corporation and the
Institute of Rural Management (Anand). The mission wishes to express its appreciation for the
excellent assistance and co-operation which it received throughout its stay in Gujarat.
2.    This aide-memoire, which has been prepared to record the views of the IDA, the borrower
and the implementing agency on project implementation and operation, was amended following
discussion of it at a wrap-up meeting on 25 March in Ahmedabad. It is subject to confmation by
the World Bank. The mission has provided guidance on the preparation of the borrowers
contribution to the ICR (Attachment 1). A brief summary of roads visited by the mission is attached
(Attachment 3, to follow).
B. The Project
3.    The project's main objectives were to provide additional all-weather roads to the rural poor
and to improve rural road construction and maintenance, road planning and road maintenance
management in the State of Gujarat. At appraisal the project comprised: (i) construction,
reconstruction and improvement of about 4042 km of village roads connecting 1900 villages; (ii)
procurement of equipment and vehicles; (iii) construction of houses, offices, warehouses and
workshops; (iv) engineering and consulting services for project planning, design, supervision,
monitoring and staff training; (v) technical assistance for a road maintenance study and (vi)
preparation of a road safety programme. In addition the project aimed to improve practices in road



-20-
construction (SAR para 2.18) and improve contracting practice. This was to be achieved by
encouraging larger contracts including all the works on a stretch of road, the use of bank guarantees
and the use of subcontracting. A minimum contract size of Rs 10 million was to be achieved from
the second year of the project.
4.    At appraisal the estimated cost of the 7-years project was Rs 2220.5 million (US$ 170.8
million). This was to be financed by an IDA credit of SDR 101 million (US$ 119.6 million) and by
the Governments of India and Gujarat (GOI and GOG) (US$ 51.2 million). The credit was signed
on 12 May 1987 and became effective on 27 August 1987. After an extension of one year the
credit closed on 31 December 1995. In February 1993, SDR 19.3 million (US$ 22.85 million) was
cancelled from the credit.
C. Mission's Findings
Achievement of Objectives
5.    The project started slowly. By early 1990, after two and a half years, the project was almost
two years behind schedule and was suffering from inadequate fundingl/ , inadequate equipment,
delays in land acquisition, delays in technical sanctions, poor contract execution, weak enforcement
of contract conditions and specifications, inadequate staff and frequent staff turnover. None of the
works started in the previous 30 months had been completed; works were partially completed on
about 400 km of road, less than 10% of the work in about 35% of the time. Progress then improved
due to increased commitment by GOG, appointment of an Officer on Special Duty to take charge of
the project and provision of funds on loan from the NDDB1/ . GOG then in 1991 requested an
increase in the scope of the project, mainly for new milk-collection roads, and the IDA, after
considerable delay, agreed in February 1993 to increase the target length of roads to about 6,300
km. By the end of December 1995, 5662 km of road had been completed, 140% of the appraisal
target and about 90% of the revised target. It is expected that when ongoing contracts are
completed by about the end of June 1996 some 6250 km of roads will have been completed, about
155% of the SAR target.
6.    Rural road construction has been improved by the adoption of improved contracting
arrangements; contracts are awarded for complete stretches of roads with subcontracting and the
use of bank guarantees allowed, which was not previously the case; materials and equipment are
now procured by contractors rather than by R&BD as previously. Although contract sizes are now
generally larger than before the project, the minimnum size of contract envisaged at appraisal has
rarely been achieved, with only about 80 of about 420 contracts (19%) exceeding Rs 10 million. I/
The quality of construction has been generally satisfactory. Also, the steady flow of contracts over
a period of more than seven years has enabled a number of contractors to receive a steady flow of
work and thereby become established, gain good experience and build up experienced staff and
I/         Due in part to financial constraints resulting from three successive drought years.
21         Four loans each of Rs 100 million at 17.5 % per year interest were made by NDDB to GOG   at six
monthly intervals starting in 1991/92.
If allowance for inflation is made this would reduce to about 30 contracts (7%) exceeding the equivalent of
Rs 10 million in 1989. The Project Agreement required civil works to be grouped in packages of US$
500,000 or more to the extent practicable. Only about 56 contracts (13 %) have exceeded this figure.



-21-
good equipment. A system for monitoring physical and financial progress of the project was
established by consultants and used effectively throughout project implementation. This was of
considerable use to IDA supervision missions (and to the ICR mission) but R&BD staff did not
find it so useful and they do not expect it to be used for other projects. No monitoring of economic
benefits was specified in the SAR.
7.    Road planning was to have been improved by the regular economic appraisal of each rural
road before technical sanction was given for plans and estimates. The mission was unable to find
evidence of improved road planning. Other than the work done prior to appraisal and for the
extension of the scope of the project in about 1991, when about 33% and 20% respectively of the
proposed roads were analysed l/ , no further serious economic analysis of roads was done before
construction and there was no prioritisation on the basis of economic rates of return of the roads to
be included. Other than very limited guidance at the time of project preparation no further guidance
was given to the staff of R&BD in economic analysis and selection of roads for inclusion in the
project. This resulted in the considerable efforts of the R&BD monitoring cell producing results of
limited value.
8.    Road maintenance management was to have been improved by implementing the
recommendations of a road maintenance planning study, which was to have been carried out during
the project. The study was finished about six years late but the terms of reference did not require
the systematic inventory of the condition of every road in Gujarat as was specified unrealistically in
the SAR. Until this inventory is available for at least part of the state, it is unlikely that there will
be any improvement in road maintenance management.
9.    The amount of equipment procured is considerably less than envisaged at appraisal, partly
due to a change of policy, whereby contractors are now expected to provide their own equipment,
rather than use equipment provided by R&BD. Some of the equipment that has been procured has
not been required. The requirements for buildings were overestimated at appraisal; the number
built is about half appraisal estimates, partly due to the lack of easily available land. Consulting
services for project planning, design and supervision were not procured, resulting in often
inadequate planning, design and construction. Although listed as an objective of the project, there
was no provision in the project for preparation of a road safety programme and so nothing has been
done.
10.   Road maintenance has been improved to some extent by the provision of equipment and
training of staff but implementation of the road maintenance planning study recommendations,
which depends on the results of a condition survey of the road network, has so far been
impracticable. The overseas training for middle level staff envisaged in the SAR was not given due
to lack of the necessary clearance from GOI.
4/        In general, the benefits from dairy production were overestimated due to unrealistic physical and price
assumptions and high ERRs, mostly in excess of 20%, were calculated. Due to the high ERRs other agricultural benefits
were not quantified.

Major Factors Affecting the Project.
13.    The project was severely affected in the early years by drought, which caused resources to
be diverted to drought relief, and by floods in August 1990, which delayed construction (see para
5). Diversion of staff and vehicles for two or three months during the working season in 1995
disrupted implementation. A shortage of bitumen in 1995 delayed progress. Alterations in the rate
of exchange between the SDR and the rupee increased the amount of rupees available, thereby
allowing the extent of the project to be increased.
Project Sustainability
14.    Sustainability of the main project works, about 6,000 km of rural roads, will depend on the
diligence of the R&BD in monitoring the condition of the roads to establish when maintenance and
repair are needed, the continued availability of adequate funds for the maintenance and repair of the



-23-
roads and the efficient use of these funds as needed. To date the funds have generally been made
available and repairs have often been made. However the mission found occasions where the
R&BD did not seem to be aware of the need for repairs, which had been neglected. Roads which
are at present the responsibility of the project should be transferred to the State R&BD in good
condition. An outline operational plan is shown in Attachment 2.
Performance of IDA
15.    Performance of IDA during both project processing and implementation phases has been
generally satisfactory. Before the start of the project, by agreeing to delay negotiations from FY86
to FY87, the Bank assisted GOI/GOG to achieve their objective of having the project financed
entirely with IDA resources (rather than an IBRD loan), which had been fully committed for FY86.
Some provisions of the SAR were of little relevance to the project." An objective of the project
was to increase the size of civil works contracts but this was discouraged by the requirement of the
SAR that contracts which exceeded US$ 700,000 would require prior review, which entailed
additional administrative procedures that R&BD were reluctant to undertake. IDA adopted a
flexible approach to project implementation, agreeing to extend the scope of the project, increase
disbursement percentages to take account of drought and effects of the Gulf war and postpone the
credit closing date. The implementing agency considers that supervision missions gave valuable
guidance and support. However, supervision missions did not insist that correct economic
evaluation of each road was made as was required by the Project Agreement. IDA delayed for
nearly two years before agreeing to expand the scope of the project. This was largely due to the
transfer of responsibility for the project within IDA from the Transport and Energy Division in
Washington to the Agriculture Unit in NDO in 1990 and back again in 1991 to the Infrastructure
Division in Washington." This delay caused project implementation to lose momentum. The late
decision by IDA in December 1995 not to extend the closing date of the credit was a
disappointment to GOG and reduced the works financed by IDA.
Borrower Performance
16.    The reluctance of GOI to pass on promptly special account funds to GOG, as was
eventually done in 1993, restricted the flow of funds to GOG in the first five years of the project.
After the initial delays (para 5) and once funding problems had been largely overcome, the
borrower generally performed satisfactorily, making this one of the few successful Bank/IDA
financed road projects in India. The appraisal target of roads improved was achieved by 1993, six
months earlier than anticipated in the SAR, and was exceeded by more than 40% by the time the
credit closed. GOG is to be commended for obtaining bridging loans from NDDB to speed project
implementation. However, inadequate planning caused some contracts to be delayed due to lack of
timely acquisition of land; the quality of design and construction often fell short of acceptable
standards; the failure to correctly evaluate all roads before construction may have resulted in the
inclusion of some uneconomic roads in the project.
5/ Although improving road safety was an objective of the project, there was no specific component in the project to implement this.
The project description in the SAR included a study of road use charges but there was no provision for this in the project; the study
was carried out under another project.
6/ The project remained with the Infrastructure Division until 1995, when it was transferred to the Agriculture and Water Resources
Division in Washington.



-24-
Assessment of Outcome
17.   The project exceeded the appraisal targets for lengths of road to be improved and, by
providing a steady supply of contracts over more than seven years, enabled several small
contractors to become established and improve their rural road construction capabilities. Had the
contracts for road construction been larger, as envisaged at appraisal, larger contractors would have
been established with higher levels of mechanisation and more technical expertise, which would
have resulted in better quality construction. The equipment and buildings provided under the
project, although less than envisaged at appraisal, are sufficient. Whereas the benefits from
increased milk production, lower milk-animal deaths, reduced souring of milk are less than
expected at appraisal, due in part to the introduction of more chilling centres, they are still
significant. However, considerable benefits have been generated from incremental agricultural
production attributable to the improved roads. Producers' incomes have risen through increased
mobility and access to markets. There have been other social benefits, such as improved access to
health and education facilities. Overall the outcome of the project can be rated as highly
satisfactory.
Key Lessons
18.   Provided political will exists to overcome funding shortages and other constraints, simple
projects such as this can be very successful. Without that will, even simple projects can go astray,
as was shown during the first two and a half years of this project.
19.   Even simple roads require proper engineering design, particularly with regard to drainage,
and strict control of the quality of construction. These design and construction quality standards
need to be clearly defined and strictly enforced. This was not always done for this project. The
proposal in the SAR that consultants should be engaged for this task was not adopted.
20.   Land required for construction must be available and utilities must be removed before
award of contracts for construction or the contract terrns must be adjusted to take account of the
possible non-availability of land for some of the works.
21.   Post qualification of bidders can be an effective procedure for use when selecting civil
works contractors provided the qualification criteria are strict and are clearly defined.
22.   If engineers are to assess the economic viability of each rural road before it is sanctioned for
construction, clear guidelines on how to do this must be provided and the application of them
supervised. Such work should be supported by inputs from agriculturists and agricultural
economists. Selection and design of rural roads would be simplified if up-to-date accurate
topographical maps were available.

D. Follow-up
23.   The FAO/CP mission will return to Rome and prepare a draft ICR, in accordance with
World Bank guidelines, for submission to the IDA, which will then transmit the draft ICR to the
borrower for comment. The borrower is encouraged to complete within three months of this ICR
mission an evaluation of project implementation. Advice for preparing this is given in Attachment
1.
Ahmedabad
26 March 1996



-26-
Attachment 1: Guidance on Government's Contribution to the ICR
1.    Government's own final evaluation of the project implementation is an important part of an
ICR. It is attached, unedited, to the ICR sent to the World Bank Board. It can be selective in its
coverage and should address issues and lessons learned in project implementation, from the
borrower's perspective. Topics covered can be the same as in the ICR, namely, project design,
appraisal, implementation and project results. At each stage of the project the contribution should
comment on the performance of both IDA and the implementing agencies, with the observations,
where possible, supported by evidence or reasoned argument.
2.    For poject design the contribution could address such questions as the appropriateness of
the project's objectives, the size of the project and scope of the investments proposed, aspects of
design leading to easy (or difficult) implementation and the effect on government institutions.
3.    For project appraisal comments should concentrate on any significant changes in the
objectives, size and scope of the project and whether these were appropriate.
4.    Project implementatio experience should be divided into an assessment of IDA
performance in supporting and supervising the project and the performances of the implementing
agencies.
5.    Project resulta should include an assessment of the direct physical benefits arising from the
project. Since financial and economic re-analysis of the project will be undertaken by the FAO/CP
mission as part of the ICR, it is suggested, if government so wishes, that the contribution could
most usefully comment on the effects of the project from the government's perspective. Such an
analysis would be a most useful contribution to the ICR.
6.    Based on the foregoing sections, the contribution should list the main lessons leamed from
the implementation experience and arising from the above analysis.
7.    The World Bank suggests that if the contribution is more than ten pages, it should include a
summary. The latter is recommended for all but the shortest contributions.
8.    The mission will be happy to provide any further elaboration or clarification needed to
assist in the preparation of the contribution.



-27-
Attachment 2: Operational Plan
The first draft of the operational plan was given in Attachment 2 to the aide-memoire of the
November-December 1995 supervision mission. This has been revised as shown below.
1.   GOG will ensure that the contracts which were awarded during the project are
completed by 30 June 1996 and any defects rectified during the maintenance period.
2.   Roads constructed under the project will be transferred from the project to the State
R&BD at the end of their contractual defects liability period.
3.   Commissioning of the two crusher plants supplied and installed under the project will
be completed as soon as practicable but not later than 30 June 1996. Adequate funding will be
provided for the operation and maintenance of these crushers.
4.   GOG has agreed to provide adequate funds to maintain the project roads at a level not
less than recommended by the Eighth Finance Commission, the norms for which are:
Asphalt                  Rs 16,000/km/year
Water-bound Macadam      Rs 11,500/km/year.
5.   After further discussion with IDA, the recommendations of the Maintenance Planning
Study will be implemented on a pilot length of at least 2,700 km of state roads by 31 March
1997 or sooner. After assessing the results of the pilot scheme, MPS will be introduced in a
phased manner to cover at least the core road network.

GUJARAT RURAL ROADS PROJECT
(Cr. 1757-IN)
APPENDIX B
Borrower's Contribution to the ICR
Evaluation Summary
A. Introduction
1.       Gujarat Rural Roads Project is the first project in State of Gujarat for giving access to
Rural Areas by providing all weather roads to villages. The project is undertaken to respond to the
need of isolated population of villages.
B. Objectives and Project Description
2.       The project's main objectives were (i) to provide all weather roads to the rural poor
population largely dependent on income from milk animals and agricultural produce, (ii) to
improve rural road construction and maintenance practices by embracing new concepts, and (iii)
improve road planning and road maintenance management in the State of Gujarat. The project
comprises of (i) a program of construction of about 4042 Km. of village roads, (ii) procurement of
construction equipment, vehicle and laboratory equipment, (iii) construction of office buildings,
warehouses and residential housing (iv) engineering and consulting services for project planning,
design, supervision, monitoring and for staff training, and (v) technical assistance for road
maintenance study.
3.       The State Road and Building Department has demonstrated satisfactory technical
capabilities in implementation of previous Bank financed irrigation project which included
construction of Rural Roads (command Area Roads).
4.       Initially the project covered 7 districts viz. Ahmedabad, Sabarkantha, Mehsana,
Banaskantha, Junagadh, Rajkot (Part) and Bhavnagar (Part), where roads of 4042 Km. length were
to be constructed. However, due to long gap between submission of project and its approval, some
of the roads were constructed by the concerned Panchayats, which has reduced the scope of the
sanctioned project to the tune of 3694 Km. These were completed by January 1994 i.e., well ahead
of closing date of December 1994.



-29-
5.       Because of reduction in the scope of the original project and also due to sharp decline in
value of rupee against US$, it was realised that the utilisation of the sanctioned credit would only
be half. Therefore, in March 1991, the COG had requested IDA Supervision Mission to enhance
the scope of the project by inclusion of additional districts, so as to utilise the sanctioned credit in
full. The revised project for construction of 85688 Km. of roads costing Rs. 4805 M and covering
13 districts was submitted to the Bank. However, after series of discussions and protracted
correspondence, the World Bank has agreed in February 1993 for scope of 6300 Km. length with
coverage of six additional districts viz. Vadodara, Bharuch, Panchmahal, Kheda (Part),
Surendranagar and Kutchch.
6.       The objectives were to be met through (a) construction of about 6300 Km. of Rural
Roads length in 13 District of State of Gujarat, (b) procurement of machinery and important
equipment to assist State (R&B) Department to monitor road condition and its usage, (c) technical
assistance and training of state (R&B) personnel, (d) Maintenance Planning Study by
consultant/GOG regarding maintenance of roads.
7.       The GOI in the initial period was reluctant to pass on full reimbursement. Only after
August 1990, the disbursement to the full amount of claims were allowed. Though the sanctioned
credit was of 101 MSDR, it was reduced to 81.7 SDR, due t the variations in exchange rates. It has
further been calculated that even after completing all works, the credit would be utilised partially
and saving of 7 to 10 MSDR would result.
C. Implementation Experience
8.       The overall responsibility for implementation of the project was with State (R&B)
Department including preparation and management of physical work. Although the project became
effective on August 28, 2987, it could not gather momentum till 1989-90, due to financial
constraints caused by three consecutive drought years and shortage of staff which delayed initiation
of project until FY 89-90. Also, GOI in initial stage was reluctant to pass on the reimbursement in
full amount. All this contributed towards initial slow progress.
9.       However, since April 1990, GOG has been able to accelerate the pace of
implementation by ensuring adequate flow of funds through its own resources and through
NDDB's loans and completed original program (reduced 3694 Km.) by January 1994, i.e., much
ahead of schedule time.
10.      The revised project covering 8568 Km. of length in 13 District costing about Rs. 4805
M, submitted to IDA supervision mission in March 1991, has been delayed due to internal change
in the World Bank Office, New Delhi. At one stage it was conveyed by World Bank, Washington,
DC office that only 4500 Km. are acceptable against the proposed revised scope. However, after
series of discussions and prostrated correspondence, the World Bank had conveyed its concurrence
for total scope for 6300 Km. length as late as in February 1993 with coverage of six additional
district viz. Vadodara, Bharuch, Panchmahal, Kheda (Part), Surendranagar and Kutchch whose
principal activity is dairy, farming like the district in original project.



-30-
11.      The implementation record of the project is highly satisfactory. The project provides
components for (D) road and bridge works by contrast, (ii) road construction equipment, vehicles,
laboratory and office equipment, (iii) buildings, (iv) engineering services and training. (v) technical
assistance and studies. The physical progress on civil works up to December 1995 as compared to
original road component of 4042 Km. is 140.80% whereas that compared to restructured road
component of 6300 Km. comes to 89.87%. The financial progress is Rs. 3412.10 M against project
cost of Rs. 3500 M. Due to variation of exchange rates, the final credit for the project is 81.70
MSDR against which the total credit utilised amounts of 72.782 MSDR, leaving the balance of
8.918 MSDR unutilised. On completion of the project roads 1380 Nos. of villages are given new
connection and in addition 1017 Nos. of villages are benefited with asphalt service.
12.      The non civil work component were implemented even though there were delays. All
major items of equipment have been procured and are being used. The building/training
component of project were implemented fully.
13.      The GOG has, through a consultant, completed the maintenance planning study. The
recommendation of the study are yet to be implemented.
D. Project Results
14.      The physical objectives are achieved to the extent of satisfactory level and roads are
under use. The works which are in progress as on December 31, 1995, are likely to be completed in
three to four months. The quality of the civil works that have been completed is very satisfactory.
15.      The average cost per Km. in the beginning was Rs. 3.27 lacs whereas that at the end was
Rs. 5.02 lacs.
16.      The real cost of civil work in US $ with respect to Rupee have been decreased during
the life of the project, especially due to devaluation of Rupee and inflation. The financial progress
of civil works at project closing was about Rs. 2879.5 M, i.e., nearly 167.03 compared to original
road component of Rs. 1723.90 M and 96.62% as compared to revised road component of Rs.
2980.15M.
17.      The project had succeeded in achieving non-physical objectives. It has helped to
introduce modem construction and management techniques, improved detailed engineering
procurement practices for large size packages, which is now widely accepted and used. GOG has
satisfactorily carried out local training program where in as many as 293 Nos. of participants took
part for the courses of Survey and Design, Introduction to MOST Specification, Project
Management for Senior Staff, Contract Management and Project Monitoring. This training helped



-31-
much towards speedy implementation. The Foreign Training was not completed as the matter has
not been materialise with GOI.
18.      The project provides for construction of non-residential and Residential Buildings. Out
of 156 units of residential buildings, 149 are completed and 7 units are dropped. Whereas in case
of non-residential buildings, out of 33 units, 31 Nos. are completed and 2 units are dropped. The
project roads are located interior where accommodation is scarce The buildings constructed are
proved to be useful. Besides, the buildings constructed have added to the assets of (R&B)
Department.
19.      The maintenance Planning Study is carried out under the project. The study was
stipulated to be completed in December 1988. However, this has been delayed due to late
invitation of bids (in 9/89) and subsequent delay in signing the contract (9/92). The final report is
made by consultant in 11/95. The consultant has been asked to demonstrate the developed system.
20.      The works completed under this project are being transferred to state (R&B) for the
purpose of maintenance as per the provisions of SAR.
E. Economic Evaluations
21.      In the staff appraisal report the average ERR was calculated for 28%. The ERR is
recalculated for 1200 Km. length for various districts. The details are shown in the statement
appended herewith (Attachment A).
F. Project Sustainability
22.      All civil works undertaken in the project are completed satisfactorily. It is expected that
these works will met with the design life. The amounts that will be allocated for maintenance of
project roads will be as per norms prescribed by the Government.
- G. Findings and Lessons Learnt
23.      Some of the lessons learnt from the project were (a) the need for stricter and more
thorough post qualification criteria for contractors, (b) proper engineering design befitting the site
situation, (c) stricter quality control right from the beginning, (d) land acquisition and the removal
of utilities and other obstacles well in advance, i.e., before award of contracts, and (e) contractors
must prepare their price bids in a better way after studying the document and site situation.

PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
(I)      Project Design and Organisation
The World Bank had agreed for Credit Assistance for Gujarat Rural Roads Project for
total estimated cost of Rs. 222.05 Crores which has since been revised and updated for cost of Rs.
350 Crores with the objectives (1) to provide all weather roads to rural poor, largely dependent on
income from milk animals and agricultural products, (2) upgradation of technology by using
modem technology, and (3) improving rural roads construction.
As per agreement, local competitive bidding (L<C<B) for large size packages as
compared to prevailing practice and prequalification of contractor procedure was followed for
implementation.
The amount sanctioned under the project was 101 million SDR. The agreement was
made in May 1987 and project is considered effective from August 27, 1987. The original credit
was to be closed in December 1994.
Although the project cost has been enhanced, it could only utilise 81.70 MSDR, leaving
a balance of 19.30 MSDR which has been cancelled by the Bank. Due to devaluation of rupee it
has been estimated that even after completing all works, the final utilisation of credit will be only
partial and saving of 7 to 10 MSDR would result.
The engineering investigation, design and cost estimates for project roads were done by
State Rural Roads Project divisions. In the initial period, due to less staff, delay had occurred in
preparation of plans and estimates but subsequently Circles/Divisions were created were created
and the bottleneck was solved. The requirement of consultant for designing road was not
considered necessary as the design for village category roads was simple.
(II)     Implementation of the Project
For implementation of project, it was decided to follow package size of US$ 5 Million
i.e., Rs. 65 lacs. This was large enough as compared to the usual practice. The packaging under
this project were formed as per geographical proximity. The size of packages were varying from
Rs. 40 lacs to Rs. 90 lacs. The prequalification procedure was followed as per Bank's guidelines
from 1993 post qualification procedure was followed in consultation with the World Bank with a
view to shorten the process of short listing of the contractors in general and to discourage the
practice of cartel amongst the prequalified contractors in particular. Although no foreign
contractors were excluded from participation, during implementation no foreign contractor
participated as the construction was solely for rural roads.
Initially the project covered 7 districts viz. Ahmedabad, Sabarkantha, Mehsana,
Banaskantha, Junagadh, Rajkot (Part) and Bhavangar (Part) where 1025 Nos. of Roads for 4042
Km. length were to be constructed. However, due to long gap between submission of project and
its approval, some of the roads were constructed by the concerned Panchayats, which has reduced



-33-
the scope of the sanctioned project to the tune of 3694 Km. Even though the project became
effective from 27/8/87, it could not gather momentum till 1989-90 for the reasons (i) initially there
was no separate post of Chief Engineer for R.R.P, (ii) due to financial constraints
caused by three consecutive drought, (iii) shortage of staff and (iv) GOI's reluctance to pass on the
reimbursement in full. However, all the difficulties were solved subsequently by creating a
separate R.R.P. network. The problem of funding was solved partly through State's own resources
and loans from NDDB The GOG has completed the original project length of roads, (reduced) by
January 1994, i.e., much ahead of scheduled time.
Because of reduction in the scope of original project and also due to sharp decline in
value of rupee against US dollar, it was realised that the utilisation of the sanctioned credit would
only be half. Therefore, in March 1991, the GOG had requested IDA Supervision Mission to
enhance he scope of the project by inclusion of additional districts, so as to utilise the sanctioned
credit in full. The revised project for construction of 8568 Km. of roads costing Rs. 4805 Million
and covering 13 districts was submitted to the Bank. However, after series of discussions and
protracted correspondence, the World Bank had agreed in February 1993 for scope of 6300 Km.
length with coverage of six additional districts viz. Vadodara, Bharuch, Panchmahal, Kheda (Part),
Surendranagar and Kutchch.
As per agreement only L.C.B. procedure for award of contracts was followed. This
practice was no adopted for Rural Roads construction in the past (i.e., before taking up this project).
In spite of this new practice, the field officials coped up with the details in this document and
carried out the execution to the satisfaction of the Bank. In some few cases, where land acquisition
was a problem, difficulties arose but the field officers with the help of local bodies managed to
solve them to the extent possible. In general, the project was smoothly going on as per revised
schedule but on account of heavy rain in 1994 the W.B.M. work was delayed which also caused
delay in asphalting. Besides the progress has also been hampered as staff and vehicles were
requisitioned for election duty between the spell of December 1994 to May 1995.
The pace of progress was also slowed down in the last quarter of the closing due to
shortage of asphalt in the state. Up to December 1995, 5662 Km. of Road length had been
completed. The Bank Mission in each of their visits has guided the project implementation which
helped immensely in accelerating the progress.
Training:
GOG has satisfactorily carried out local training program as detailed below. The
overseas training program as agreed at the time of negotiations could not be conducted as the matter
did not materialised with GOI.

ii) Project Management for Senior Staff.
iii) Arbitration Act. 1940 an Arbitration Clauses in tender agreement.
iv) Contract Management.
v) Contract Management and Project Monitoring (2 times)
vi) Introduction to MOST specifications.
The training imparted under the project helped much towards preparation of engineering
design, contract management during the course of the execution of the project.
Buildings:
The SAR provides for construction of office buildings and also residential buildings for
the use of the supervisory staff. Out of 156 residential units, 149 units are .completed and 7 units
are dropped. Whereas in case of non-residential buildings out of 33 units, 31 Nos. are completed
and 2 units are dropped.
The project roads are located interior where accommodation is scarce. Therefore,
buildings constructed are useful to the supervisory staff. Besides the building constructed under
this project will be the property of GOG and it will add to the assets of R&B Department.
Study:
As per agreed terns the state has to carry out maintenance planning study and to find
out economic analysis for maintenance of various roads in state. The study was required to be
completed by December 1988. This has been delayed due to late invitation of bid (9/89) and



-35-
subsequent delay in signing the contract (9/92). The final report is made by consultant in 11/95.
The consultant has been asked to demonstrate the developed system.
(]II)    Performance by borrowers
The objective of this project was (i) to provide all weather roads to rural poor, largely
dependent on income from milk animals and agricultural production, (ii) improved construction an
maintenance practice. The lessons learned from command area roads, component of Gujarat
Irrigation II (Credit 101 1-IN) had helped much executing this project.
The performance of borrower is considered to be satisfactory in achieving the above
mentioned objectives as road length of 5662 Km. is completed up to December 1995 which comes
to 140.08% against the original road length of 4042 Km. whereas that compared to restructured
road component of 6300 Km. comes to 89.87%. The completion of project roads is benefiting the
rural poor who are now able to increase their milk supplies to dairy.
This project can be considered to be a beginning of modemisation of Rural Road
network of Gujarat. The project afforded an opportunity for evolving design and specification of
roads to suit new construction methodology of labour intensive with proper mix of machinery.
The project includes Maintenance Planning Study consisting of traffic counts, road
condition inventory and preparation of ten year maintenance program. The final report is received
from the consultant. The consultant has been asked to augment the developed system so as to
obtain the actual results which will give economic analysis for maintenance of various roads along
with priority and subsequent follow up actions.
Various local training obtained by staff has helped engineers to equip themselves with
latest practices and techniques in planning, design and construction of rural roads including
management part. The foreign training was not materialised with GOI and hence could not be
imparted.
At the time of start of this project there were few local contractors capable for quality
road works. Presently, many other local contractors have come up who are capable to execute
works with good quality control. However, there is scope of improvement in site management and
utilisation of machinery.
Most of the deficiencies identified in prequalification criteria in contract documents
during implementation of the project are being taken care of for future projects to be taken up with
help of external assistance.
The land was available for project roads, except in some cases. The availability of land
was delayed but with help of local people and office bearers of Panchayat bodies, this problem was
solved. Only in very few cases the land could not be acquired and ultimately the works were



-36-
required to be dropped. For future externally aided project, this aspect will be taken care of at the
planning stage itself by identifying the problematic stretches.
The works executed under this project were found to have maintained good quality
except in few cases. The executive engineer, deputy executive engineers and assistant engineers
were actively supervising the work and hence requirement of consultant was not felt. The delay in
completion is mainly due to land problems and slow progress by contractors. For future projects,
the availability of land will be ascertain first by speedy land acquisition procedure in advance an by
adopting stricter prequalification measures.
The works completed under this project are being transferred to state (R&B) divisions
as stipulated in SAR.
(IV)     Bank's Performance
The World Bank Mission during each visit imparted valuable guidance and support by
suggesting corrective measures in project implementation and in design of the project. Interaction
with bank and its supervision mission were useful in initiating corrective measures for speedy
implementation of project.
The GOG submitted revised project in March 1991. However, due to internal
reorganisation in the Bank, the responsibility of project management was temporarily transferred
from Infrastructure Division to Agricultural Operation Division an due to transfer of concerned
persons, the approval process was delayed as the bank concurrence for 6300 Km. (against 8568
Krn) was conveyed in February 1993.
Also at the time of apprising the Revised Project, the time extension granted was
insufficient as compared to the additional quantum of work.
Government of Gujarat appreciates the Bank's consideration for increasing
reimbursement of expenditure on roads works from 70% to 90% on equipment from 50% to 80%
on Building and Engineering Supervision from 40% to 80%. This has helped much in financing
the project.
Relationship with Bank
Government of Gujarat would like to place on record its appreciation of the valued
support, guidance and professional advice from successive Bank missions during the course of the
project which indeed went a long way in the successful completion of the project. GOG would
look forward for such co-operation in the future for development activities in the State of Gujarat.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
GUJARAT RURAL ROADS PROJECT
(Cr. 1757-IN)
APPENDIX C
Economic Re-Evaluation
A. Introduction
1.        This appendix details the economic re-evaluation of the Gujarat Rural Roads Project
carried out by the ICR mission. It compares the methodology and the results of the economic
analysis of the SAR with that of the ICR mission.
2.        The economic analysis in the SAR is based on benefits to the dairy sector (increased
milk procurement, reduced wastage and a reduction in milk animal deaths) and savings on vehicle
operating costs (VOC) attributable to the project roads. The ICR analysis is based not only on the
above benefits to the dairy sector and VOC, but also on benefits to agriculture and savings on dairy
transport costs. Field work suggests that the benefits to the dairy sector attributable to project roads
were overestimated in the SAR analysis and that benefits to agriculture even though they were
significant were not included in the analysis.
3.        The ICR mission visited four districts in Gujarat, Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Mehsana
and Kheda. The economic analysis is based primarily on the first three districts which contain 59%
of the total length of roads constructed/improved under the project.
4.        A different economic methodology was used in the ICR because the SAR
methodology was difficult to replicate or was sometimes incorrect. While the description of the
economic analysis provided in SAR is not precise, the ICR mission did, however, obtain a copy of
the GOG/R&BD report of the economic analysis used for the 260 roads, which the SAR economic
analysis appears to be based on. The R&BD report does provide a good description of the
methodology used, as well as the results obtained, but no detailed data on which the analyses is
based is presented. Reasons for why the ICR mission could not replicate the SAR methodology are
given below:
(a)    In the calculation of the benefits of increased milk procurement, the SAR
over-optimistically assumes extra procurement of three liters of milk/cow/day.
This figure assumes an unrealistic increase in milk production (which is 70%
above the average quantity of milk procured per milking animal per day in the
State of Gujarat) and assumes all incremental production is procured and that



- 38 -
it is fully attributable to the project. The ICR analysis more realistically
assumes that 20% of actual increased procurement (data from GOG for the
period) is attributable to the project. Furthermore, the economic value of milk
was overestimated in the SAR. Adjusted to early 1996 prices, SAR uses a
value for milk 40% above the ICR calculated economic value - Rs 3.75/liter
compared to Rs 2.74/liter. The combination of overestimated increased
procurement and economic prices is the major reason for the difference
between the ERRs estimated in the SAR (28%) and the ICR (16%).
(b)    Differences between the SAR and ICR methodologies to calculate benefits
accruing from reduced milk wastage are based on different treatment of sour
milk (which has a use value) and curdled milk (which has no use value) (see
para 13). Furthermore, as benefits from reduced sourage are calculated as a
percentage of total milk procured, and because the SAR and ICR use different
assumptions regarding the percentage of increased procurement attributable to
the project, benefits from reduced milk wastage estimated in the SAR differ
from those of the ICR (for details refer to paras 11 to 16).
(c)    Based on empirical data provided by the Department of Agriculture in
Gujarat, there appears to be little or no reduction in milk animal deaths
directly attributable to the project. Therefore the assumptions made in the
SAR on reduced milk animal deaths are over estimated (refer to paras 17 and
18 for details).
(d)    There are large savings on milk transport costs directly attributed to project
roads. The ICR mission therefore quantified these benefits while they were
excluded in SAR (paras 19 and 20). The major difference between the SAR
and ICR treatment of VOC is that the ICR included also savings to newly
generated traffic attributable to the improvement/construction of rural roads,
for which data was provided. This benefit was not quantified in the SAR.
Details of VOC are provided in paras 21 to 24.
(e)    Field investigations suggested important agricultural benefits attributable to
the project and these were included in the ICR economic analysis (paras 25 to
30). While the SAR acknowledged these benefits, they were not quantified
since dairy benefits appeared at that time to be sufficient to economically
justify the project.

B. Project Costs
Project Investment Costs
5.        SAR. Costs assumed in the SAR and actual costs used in the ICR are presented in
Table 1.
6.        ICR. Investment costs from the start of construction, and costs still to be incurred to
complete the road works, have been included in the cost streams. Future expenditures to complete
ongoing roadwork's are based on R&BD projections. Expenditures have been adjusted to.1996
prices. Project costs include 100% of road and engineering costs. Because equipment and
buildings are also used for non-project purposes by R&BD, only 15% and 50% respectively of
expenditure on these have been included in the cost streams for economic analysis. The costs of
studies have been excluded. These project costs were multiplied by the Standard Conversion
Factor (SCF) for India of 0.9 as an estimate of the project's economic investment costs.
Road Maintenance Costs
7.        Assumptions regarding road maintenance costs used in the SAR and in the ICR are
presented in the table below:
Road Maintenance Costs per Kilometer per Year

Re-evaluation - assumptions used: New Construction - increase from 0 to Rs 16,000/km;
Reconstruction - increase from Rs 4,000 to Rs 16,000/kin; Improved - increase from Rs 14,000
to Rs 16,000/km (Eighth Finance Commission Norm).
8.        Incremental road maintenance costs were also multiplied by the SCF of 0.9 to convert
them into economic costs. In line with SAR, roads have been assunmed to have a useful life of ten
years at the end of which they have a residual value of 50% of the cost of construction.



-40 -
C. Project Benefits
Dairy Related Benefits
Incremental Milk Procurement Attributable to the Project
9.        SAR. The analysis of the SAR overestimates the value of increased milk procurement
by assuming three liters of extra milk procured per day per cow from year seven onwards". It is
assumed that without the project no increase in milk procurement would occur. Incremental milk
procurement has been valued at Rs 1.50 (1985 prices)/liter, which is equivalent to Rs 3.75 in 1996
prices. No details are provided in SAR as to how this value was derived. The ICR analysis
estimates the value of milk, net of processing costs and variable costs of production at farm level, to
be Rs 2.74/liter in 1996 prices (see Table 2). The SAR is unclear whether incremental production
includes potential increases in the number of milk animals.
10.       ICR. The ICR analysis is based on actual milk procurement data for the 13 districts of
Gujarat included in the project for the period 1987/88-1994/95. The impact of the roads project
was established in the following way:
Since milk procurement fluctuates substantially between years, the three-year average
annual procurement for the period 1987/88-1989/90 was compared to the three-year
average annual procurement for 1992/93-1994/95. It was assumed that 20% of this
increment in procurement is attributable to the project (based on Department of
Agriculture animal husbandry officials' estimates) to establish the incremental
procurement attributable to the project in the year 1994/95. (This increment in
procurement is equivalent to 4.1% of the average annual procurement in the final
three years of data available, i.e. 1992/93-1994/95.) The increments attributable to the
project in the years preceding 1994/95 were assumed to be directly related to the
project capital expenditure flow incorporating a two-year lag. It was further assumed
that the 1994/95 incremental milk procurement benefit would increase by 2% per year
for a further two years due to the additional roads constructed in 1995/96 and
1996/97. Benefits would decline on a linear trend from the year 2000/01 as roads
reached the end of their assumed 10-year life.
Reduced Sour and Curdled Milk
11.       SAR. The SAR description of reduction in sour and curdled milk is not clear.
However, according to the R&BD Economic Analysis Report dated November 1984, upon which
the SAR appears to be based, the reduction in the value of milk if it is sour or curdled was
Although not clearly stated in the SAR, it is likely that incremental milk procurement was increased
linearly in the preceding years (i.e. years 1 to 6).



- 41 -
Rs 1.25/liter in 1985 economic prices. Savings in sour or curdled milk as a percentage of total milk
collected were based on the distance of the collection centre from the dairy or chilling centre as
detailed below:
Km from Dairy or Chilling Centre    Savings in Sour and Curdled Milk as
Percentage of Total Milk Collected
20                                   1
30                                   1.5
40                                   2
50                                   2.5
750                                   3
The cost saving due to reduced wastage was overestimated in terms of quantity, but underestimated
in terms of lost economic value (see paras 12 to 16).
12.       ICR. According to NDDB officials, sour milk can be separated and processed into
butter or ghee and skim milk powder, whereas curdled milk is essentially wasted. Although the fat
content of curdled milk can be processed into ghee, this is seldom done.
13.       To calculate the economic value of milk wasted because of curdling, the ICR mission
has used an economic price of milk of Rs 13.37/liter, which is a weighted average of the economic
price of buffalo and cows milk - Rs 14.60/liter and Rs 10.50/liter respectively - weighted according
to proportion of total milk procured provided by each (70% and 30% respectively). Details are
shown in Table 2.
14.       Because sour milk can be processed into skim milk powder, and ghee or butter, a
reduction in sourage does not imply any benefit. Savings in the costs of processing sour milk are
insignificant. On the other hand, as curdled milk is wasted, any reduction in the amount of milk
curdled is treated as a benefit.
15.       The Bureau of Statistics Evaluation Study (1993) found that "wastage" of milk in 33
milk societies was reduced from 5.2% to 2.5% of milk collected before and after the road project.
No distinction was made between sour and curdled milk. According to mission discussions with
milk union officials, most milk considered "wastage" (i.e. classified as sour or curd) is in fact
soured. Estimates ranged from 75%-85% sour, implying 15%-25% is curdled.
16.       The ICR re-evaluation has assumed a reduction in wastage of 2.5% of total milk
procured, of which 20% would have been curdled, equivalent to a reduction of 0.5% of total milk
procured. The cost saving (i.e. benefit) of the reduction in curdled milk was valued at Rs
13.37/liter. This benefit has been phased in proportion to the project construction cost profile,
incorporating a two-year lag between expenditure and benefit generation. The benefit flow
decreases on a linear trend over the final seven-years of the project.

Reduction in Milk Cattle Deaths
17.       SAR. The SAR analysis quantified the expected reduction in milk animal mortality
as:
(a)    for new construction and reconstruction - the without project rate of death
among milk animals was 6%; the construction of roads would reduce this to
3% of total cattle. Benefits occur in year one, and will increase annually at
3% for 10 years;
(b)    for improved roads - improved roads would reduce the death rate from 6%
to 2% with benefits increasing 3% per year for 10 years.
18.       ICR. The ICR mission could not substantiate any significant reduction in milk cattle
deaths due to the improved roads after extensive discussions with beneficiaries, dairy union and
agriculture department officials. These benefits have therefore been excluded from the economic
re-evaluation.
Reduced Milk Transport Costs
19.       SAR. The SAR and R&BD Economic Analysis Report (1984) do not quantify this
benefit.
20.       ICR. One of the benefits of the project has been a reduction in the cost of transporting
milk from village collection centres to chilling centres and dairies. This reduction has been
significant, although it was difficult to obtain data to quantify this given time constraints in the
field. Analysis of transport cost data (by route) provided by Banaskantha Dairy indicate savings in
transport costs of about Rs 0.1 0/liter of milk transported (1996 prices) due to the improved roads.
This figure was used as the basis of the savings in milk transport costs. According to discussions
with beneficiaries, prior to the project considerable time was spent transporting milk to all-weather
roads for collection by trucks, either on farmers heads or by camel cart. The benefits of time
savings have not been estimated directly, although the positive impact of the roads on agricultural
production is in part a result of more time being spent on agriculture activities, such as vegetable
production.
Other Quantifiable Benefits
VOC Savings
21.       SAR. The SAR excludes dairy transport savings and considers only non-dairy related
traffic. VOC were estimated based on a study of the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) in
Delhi. No benefits were assumed for generated traffic.
22.       ICR. Average daily traffic data before and after the project collected by R&BD for
buses, trucks, light motor vehicles and tractors from a random sample of roads in Banaskantha,



- 43 -
Mehsana and Sabarkantha were analysed by the ICR mission. This analysis indicated that daily
traffic movements per road averaged 8, 9, 14 and 16 for buses, trucks, light motor vehicles and
tractors respectively. These averages incorporate the average of the before-project and after-project
daily traffic movements.
23.        VOC were taken from SAR and adjusted to 1996 prices as follows:

NC = New Construction; RC = Reconstruction; I = Improved.
24.        VOC were phased in proportion to expenditure incorporating a two-year lag, and as a
function of the length of each type of road (i.e. 1,313 km new road, 3,199 km reconstructed roads
and 1,714 km of improved roads).
Impact on Agricultural Production
25.        SAR. While the SAR acknowledges that agricultural incomes would likely increase
due to the introduction of new farming methods made possible by improved roads, potential
agricultural benefits were not quantified. For eleven main crops in the seven project districts (phase
I), GOG agricultural statistics indicated a weighted average net profit of Rs 1,260 per ha. While
this figure was quoted, it was not used in the SAR analysis and no explanation was given on why it
was not used.
26.       ICR. Assessments of the agricultural impact of the project were made by the mission
based on information collected from the Agriculture Department in Gujarat and field visits. Field
interviews indicated that farmers perceived significant benefits in their agricultural activities
directly attributable to the construction of rural roads. The expansion of public transport facilities,
and the increased number of private vehicles following road construction/improvement allow
farmers to market their own produce and thus receive better prices and more market information.
Previously, farmers relied on traders purchasing at farmgate to sell their output. Construction of
roads has increased the access of villages to the agricultural extension service, thereby expanding



-44 -
the adoption of new technologies and facilitating the timely delivery of inputs, raising crop yields.
The net effect is improvement in farm productivity and incomes.
27.       Improved transport facilities due to the project roads have contributed to a change in
cropping patterns. Farmers have shifted from production of cereals to higher value crops,
particularly vegetables, castor and cotton. This shift has further raised farm incomes. For example,
a village reported that the number of vegetable trucks going to Ahmedabad from their village had
increased three-fold; the increased marketing of produce appeared to be widespread in the area.
28.        One hectare representative farm models were compiled for each of the three districts
included in the ICR economic analysis. Economic producer surplus per hectare (inclusive of
labour) was estimated to range from Rs 4,470-Rs 5,021 per hectare.
29.        It was not possible to apply a "with and without project" agricultural benefit analysis
due to an absence of project monitoring data. As a result, the analysis is not in terms of incremental
production. Instead, current per hectare economic producer surpluses in the benefiting area were
calculated based on the farm models. Details are presented in Table 2. The ICR mission has
estimated that 20% of the economic producer surplus of agricultural production is attributable to the
project.
30.       Agricultural benefits are phased in proportion to construction cost expenditure with a
two year lag. Benefits continue to accrue until year 20 since each road is assumed to have a life of
10 years and completion of roads is distributed over the initial 10 year period. The benefit flow is
assumed to decrease on a linear trend over the final seven years of the project.
Non-Quantified Benefits
31.       The construction of rural roads has had wide-ranging socio-economic benefits which
have not been quantified due to lack of quantitative data.
32.       Education. Access to education has increased significantly. Villagers attribute a
large proportion of this increase to improved physical access to schools. Prior to the roads, the time
required to reach schools was a strong deterrent to attendance. There has also been a shift from
waLking to bus transport to school following the completion of roads. Time saved in commuting
lowers the opportunity cost of school attendance. The roads have also developed communications
between villages and extension services, family planning centres and markets for agricultural
produce, thereby raising the general level of education of the project beneficiaries.
33.       Health. The construction of roads has increased access to medical facilities and to
emergency medical treatment. Very few villages have medical facilities, so the ability of doctors to
visit villages (by motorcycle or jeep) 24 hours a day and during the monsoon, is a significant
development. Prior to road completion, patients were taken by bullock cart to nearby clinics, or
doctors were contacted, although people were hesitant to travel at night, many villagers rated
improved access to hospitals as a major benefit of the roads. The reduction in dust due to the shift
from earthen to all-weather roads is reported to have decreased respiratory problems.



- 45 -
34.       Increased Mobility/Access. Another significant benefit of the roads is increased
mobility, through improved public transport facilities and an increased number of private vehicles.
The number and frequency of buses has increased. Many villagers have shifted from bullock and
camel cart transportation to motorcycles. The time savings of villagers and access to markets,
towns and medical facilities is substantial.
35.       Gender Impact and Poverty Alleviation. As dairy production in Gujarat is an
activity predominantly undertaken by women, the impact of roads on time spent transporting milk,
on improved animal health and on the increased use of cattle feed ration concentrate rather than
green fodder has helped reduce the work load of women. Dairying has remained a relatively
marginal, although important, activity compared to agriculture. Milk production is dominated by
marginal farmers and the landless; as a result, increased profitability of Dairying has benefited
largely the poorest households. Sale of milk provides a regular and reliable source of income
(payment ranges from daily to every 10 days) while agricultural income is sporadic and more
variable.
D. Economic Analysis Results
SAR
36.     Methodology. While some of the assumptions of the SAR economic analysis were not
explicitly specified, the following assumptions have been identified:
(a)    financial prices for dairy products used were based on average prices paid by
co-operatives after allowing for expenses and wastage. Economic prices of
tradable commodities (milk, butter, skim milk powder) were not calculated;
(b)    potential agricultural benefits were not quantified due to "the absence of an
accurate correlation between improved roads and increased agricultural
production";
(c)    the number benefit people was assumed to be 871 per kilometre of road
constructed
(d)    the cost and benefit streams of individual roads analysed were discounted
over 10 years and the opportunity cost of capital was taken to be 12%;
(e)    no Standard Conversion Factors were applied.
37.     The SAR concludes that benefits to the dairy sector based on increased milk procurement,
reduced sourage and reduced cattle deaths, and savings on vehicle operating costs, would provide
benefits sufficient to justify the project on economic grounds; it was considered unnecessary to
quantify agricultural benefits.



- 46 -
38.     A sensitivity analysis of the 260 roads, testing variations in project costs and benefits,
showed that there was little risk that subproject ERRs would fall below 12%.
ICR
39.     The major assumptions of the ICR economic analysis are:
(f)    economic prices of tradable dairy products and crops (skim milk powder,
butter, wheat, maize, cotton) are derived from World Bank commodity prices;
(g)    economic prices of non-traded crops are derived from current financial prices
in Gujarat by applying a Standard Conversion Factor of 0.9;
(h)    the re-evaluation is carried out in early 1996 constant values. Past investmnent
and maintenance costs, and all benefits, are inflated to 1996 prices by
applying the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for India as shown in Table 4;
(i)    the ICR re-evaluation is "project-based" (i.e. it considers all roads in
aggregate), while the SAR was based on the analyses of a large sample of
individual roads. The phasing of benefits is assumed to be directly in
proportion to expenditure incorporating a two year lag; all roads are assumed
to derive benefits for 10 years and since the construction was until 10 year
after project was initiated, the period of analysis was spread over 20 years;
(j)    the opportunity cost of capital is taken to be 12% as in the SAR;
(k)    as in the SAR, benefits from the project are quantified in terms of increased
milk procurement, reduced milk wastage and non-dairy vehicle operating cost
savings. Unlike the SAR, the ICR has also quantified benefits to the
agricultural sector and reduced dairy-related transport costs, while excluding
reductions in cattle deaths.
40.     Results. The economic benefit and cost flows are detailed in Table 4. The re-estimated
ERR is 16%. The NPV at 10% has been calculated at Rs 785 million and at 12% is equal to Rs 431
million at early 1996 constant prices.
41.     The difference in the ERR calculated in the SAR (28%) and ICR (16%) can be attributed
to increased milk procurement and reduced sourage being grossly overestimated in the SAR. ICR
quantification of agricultural benefits and dairy transport savings (which were excluded from the
SAR) reveal that these benefits do not compensate for the overestimated dairy benefits.
Sensitivity Analysis
42.     To evaluate whether the delays experienced in the initial years of the project significantly
affect the re-estimated ERR, project costs and benefits were shifted forward by two years. This



- 47 -
increases the ERR from 15.9% to 17.1% (the NPV at 10% increased to Rs 1,101 million and at
12% to Rs 680 million). This suggests that the slow start up of the project is a major cause of the
lower ERR estimated by the ICR mission.
43.     On the other hand, the results of the ERR re-evaluation are particularly-sensitive to
variations in the incremental increase in milk procured in agricultural benefits attributed to ihe
roads. If the incremental milk procured during the project period attributable directly to the roads is
raised from 20% to 40%, the ERR rises to 19%.
44.    If the economic impact of the roads on agricultural production is assumed to be 10%
rather than 20% of the economic producer surpluses, the ERR falls from 16% to 7%.
45.     There is no established practice for apportioning benefits accruing to agriculture
attributable to rural roads. In a similar project, the Bihar Rural Roads Project, agricultural benefits
were calculated as follows:
(a)    for irrigated areas - 40% of the value of incremental agricultural production
was attributed to roads and the resulting improved access of farmers to the
inputs required for higher yields;
(b)    where investment in irrigation was planned, costs of both irrigation and roads
were included in the analysis, and 70% of incremental agricultural production
was attributable to this investment.
47.     For both cases, it was assumed that incremental production would take place uniformly
over a seven year period. The Bihar Project analysis of agricultural benefits is cast in terms of
incremental production with and without project. The ICR methodology, on the other hand,
attributes 20% of with-project economic producer surplus to the project. If the Bihar Project
analysis is cast in terms of the ICR methodology, the agricultural benefits attributable to the project
are estimated at approximately 27% (23% where there was no additional irrigation during the
project period and 30% where additional irrigation took place during the project period) of the with-
project agricultural producer surplus. The slightly lower agricultural benefit estimated in the
Gujarat project is due to the more extensive rural road network that existed in the State of Gujarat
before the project, compared to the less developed rural road network that existed in the State of
Bihar before the Bihar Rural Road Project.
48.     The expansion of the dairy sector in India has led to the export of small amounts of milk
products. If the economic analysis is based on an economic value of milk derived from the mid-
point of import and export parity prices (instead of an import parity price), the re-estimated ERR
drops to 8%. The reduction is due mainly to the decrease in gross margins per liter of milk and the
reduced economic value of benefits gained from reduced milk wastage. However, it is unlikely that
India will become a major exporter of dairy products given the large scope for increased domestic
consumption as incomes rise and given the variability of production.



- 48 -
Conclusions on the Economic Impact of the Project
49.     The ERR of the project has been difficult to re-estimate because:
(i)       other factors besides improved rural roads have also had a positive impact
on milk and agricultural output in the project zone, such as improved
farmer extension and animal health services, more milk chilling centres,
etc., making it difficult to segregate the impact of the roads alone;
(ii)      there has been no monitoring of economic benefits during project
implementation. SAR requested only monitoring of physical and
financial progress of the project.
50.    Nevertheless, despite difficulties encountered in re-calculating the ERR of the project, it is
considered that the re-estimated ERR of 16% is realistic and probably underestimating the real
ERR. While the ICR ERR estimate of 16% is significantly lower than the SAR estimate of 28%,
this is largely due to the gross overestimation in the SAR of the dairy benefits (increased milk
procurement and reduced milk wastage). The roads have stimulated agricultural activity and
brought significant benefits to farmers in the project areas. These benefits, which have been
quantified and included in the ICR re-evaluation, combined with the substantial non-quantified
benefits generated by the project (see paras 31-35), indicates that the project can be considered a
success from an economic perspective.
