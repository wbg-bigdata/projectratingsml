Country -Nepal                                                          Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
* To assist the Government in planning and utilizing its water resources in a harmonized, effective and sustainable
manner.
*  To increase productivity and sustainability of irrigation systems on about 59,600 ha of land in the selected
districts of the three Western and Eastern regions (based on the successful pilot experience in the Irrigation Line
of Credit).
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
The proposed Nepal Irrigation Sector Project (NISP) comprises three major components: (a) finalization of an on-
going Comprehensive Water Resources Strategy and formulation of a Consolidated Water Policy; (b) implementation
of a first-time slice of a long-term irrigation sector investment in private and public irrigation schemes covering about
59,600 ha; and (c) institutional strengthening to support the Government's new focus on carrying out the progressive
turnover of operation and maintenance (O&M) responsibilities to user organizations, and on strengthening its
technical and institutional capacity in water data collection, planning and management of irrigated agriculture. The
project components are summarized as follows.
A. Comprehensive Water Resources Strategy and Consolidated Water Policy (KISS 1.43 M. Balanced
development of water resources requires a comprehensive and integrated multi-disciplinary approach. In Nepal,
water resources from each river basin are utilized by the various agricultural, domestic, and industrial users without
any special attention to river basin water availability and quality. Similarly, the planning of water resources has been
addressed in a fragmented manner by different government organizations who, so far, have failed to address the full
complexity and connectivity associated with water resources development. Realizing the need for a holistic approach
to water resources development, HMGN has recently initiated the preparation of a Comprehensive Water Resources
Strategy which is to lead to the formulation of a Consolidated Water Policy. The effort is led by a National Steering
Committee (NSC) in which all concerned ministries are represented. This component includes the completion of the
preparation of a Strategy, which is ongoing, and formulation of a Consolidated Water Policy along with institutional
support for the establishment of a National Water Planning Unit (NWP1U).
Formulation of a Comprehensive Water Strategy and Consolidated Policy (US$ 1.32 million). This component will
finance technical assistance for the implementation of Phase-II of the Study:
(a) Phase I was completed as part of NISP preparation and was financed from the project preparation fund.
The objective was to (i) assess Nepal's water resources potentials, (ii) identify the major issues affecting
water resources utilization and development, (iii) estimate the opportunities and potentialities for
development, and (iv) define the national goals and principles required for the formulation of a
Comprehensive Strategy leading to an integrated Consolidated Water Policy. Phase I report was discussed
in mid-April 1997 at a public forum to obtain a consensus on the prioritization of development issues and
follow-up actions. The consolidated Phase I report was submitted to the Bank prior to appraisal. The final
report includes proposals and terms of reference for the formulation of Phase II.
(b) Phase II is to (i) address the issues, (ii) prioritize the practical options, and (iii) recommend a
comprehensive strategy for implementing the optimal development of Nepal's water resources. The
strategy will review all existing policies, acts, and regulations on hydropower, irrigation, urban and rural
water supply, industrial waste water etc. to ensure their compatibility and consistency with the proposed
strategy. It will also provide guidance to HMGN on development assistance requirements consistent with
the strategy. Phase II will include inter alia, the formulation of a Consolidated Water Policy, leading to the
preparation of a National Water Resources Development Plan, and a Water Related Environmental
Management Plan for the short, medium, and long terms.

Country - Nepal                                                        Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
The project will assist HMGN in implementing the preparation of Phase II Strategy and the formulation of the
Consolidated Water Policy. In view of the importance of this policy, endorsement of the development issues
identified in the Phase I study and commitment for implementing the Phase II were obtained from the Government at
appraisal. The formulation of the Water Resources Strategy is expected to be completed during the third year of the
project. The draft outline of the Phase II strategy formulation submitted by HMGN is shown in Annex 2 Attachment
1. HMGN would have the prerogative to finance this component of the Credit with any bilateral grant or aid funds if
they become available prior to or in the course of project implementation. This component would also finance (i) the
review of HMGN's subsidy policy in irrigation development investment with a view to its gradual reduction over
time, and (ii) the review of O&M requirements in different public irrigation systems and the associated water charges
to cover full O&M in light of joint management of the systems with beneficiary farmers.
Institutional Support (US$ 0.11 M) will be provided to the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) and the National
Planning Commission (NPC) to: (i) establish a NWPU at the central level, and (ii) procure supporting office
equipment, technology, transport, and other facilities includingthe development of computerized management
information systems and GIS for the Unit.
B. Irrigation Sector Improvement and Development (USS 83.63 M). This component is to improve productivity
and sustainability of irrigation on 59,600 ha in accordance with HMGN's Irrigation Policy (IP) of 1988 (and as
amended in 1992 and 1997). The focus of the IP is to develop and improve the management of irrigation schemes
based on the "demand driven" principles and on "participatory management ", which promote local initiatives and
active participation of beneficiaries. The IP encourages creation of legalized Water User Associations (WUAs) in
private and public irrigation schemes, and allow WUAs to involve in the design and construction of irrigation
facilities and, thereafter, to take over for full or joint O&M upon completion.
The feasibility of the IP in the private farmer managed irrigation schemes and in turnover schemes in some small
public systems has been tested satisfactorily through a US$ 20 million pilot ILC program financed under two ongoing
Bank-funded projects: the Mahakali Irrigation II Project (Cr. 1924) and Bhairawa Lumbini Groundwater Irrigation III
Project (Cr. 2144). Likewise, the practicality of participatory joint management (PJM) between the project authority
and WUAs in large public irrigation systems has been satisfactorily implemented under the completed Mahakali
Irrigation I Project (MIP-I) (Cr. 1055) and the Sunsari Morang Irrigation Project Phase -II (SMIP-II) (Cr. 1814). In
these joint management projects, portions of the larger system, i.e tertiary canal network (less than 1000 ha blocks),
were successfully turned over to WUAs: 4,800 ha in MIP-I and 16,700 ha of SMIP- II.
To date, more than 300 small and medium surface farmer irrigation schemes on about 33,250 ha, and 217 medium and
deep tubewell schemes covering about 4,220 ha in 18 clusters have been implemented successfully under the ILC
pilot program. Also, full turnovers of small and medium schemes to legalized WUAs have been achieved in 20 small
and medium public schemes covering over 2,000 ha. Based on these successful experiences, NISP would continue
financing viable private and public irrigation schemes on 59,600 ha as a first stand alone project.
In accordance with the IP principles, private and public schemes would be considered eligible for funding under NISP
only upon written applications of beneficiary farmers backed up by their financial contribution to investment costs.
The "no payment-no project" policy would be applied. However, prior to financing, viability of each scheme would
be tested based on specific technical, economic, social, and environmental criteria. The minimum farmers'
contribution either in the form of labor or cash or both would be as prescribed in the IP (see Annex 2 Attachment 2).
These contribution rates vary according to the: (i) type of schemes (private or public), (ii) kind of development
(rehabilitation or new), (iii) source of water supply (surface or ground water), and (iv) the location of schemes (Hill or
Terai). This component comprises three different types of schemes as follows:
(a) Rehabilitation, Improvement and Development of Small and Medium Scale Farmer Managed Irrigation
Schemes (FMIS) on 39.500 ha (US$ 38.81 M). There are over 20,000 FMIS in the country which, if taken



Project Appraisal Document                                                               Page 4
Country - Nepal                                                         Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
individually, are too small to justify investment, but as a whole constitute about 70 percent of the nation's
one million hectares of irrigated land. The project would finance about 39,500 ha of surface or
groundwater small and medium sized FMIS located in the three Western Regions of Nepal (see Map 1).
The participatory approach would be implemented through legalized WUAs formed at each FMIS of
surface water and groundwater schemes. This sub-component would include:
(i) Rehabilitation and Improvement of existing FMIS on 31.500 ha in the Hill and the Terai including
temporary headworks and intake structures, main and secondary canals, and conveyance systems of
viable FMIS. The existing rudimentary headworks and related structures for surface water schemes
built by farmers are vulnerable to the destructive torrential rivers of Nepal. The temporary nature of
these structures necessitates their replacement more than two or three times a year costing the farmers
labor, time, materials, and at times loss of prime cropping season. In addition, make-shift nature of
brushwood diversion and intake structures pose a threat to the environmental sustainability of the
region. The rehabilitation works to be financed under the project are those beyond farmers' technical
and financial capacity to implement on their own.
(ii) Rehabilitation and Development of New Tubewell Schemes on 8,000 ha in the Terai. Most of the
lower Terai areas is underlain by more than 450m of alluvial deposits of clean sand forming high
yielding acquifer. Properly designed shallow tubewells to depths of about 40m or less, yield about 12-
15 I/sec with modest drawdowns. But experience in Nepal with individually owned shallow tubewells
is comparatively less encouraging than group-owned shallow tubewells mainly because of small and
scattered land holdings. Clustered type shallow tubewells of 10 ha/well has proven successful in ILC
and would be continued under the sub-component.
(b) System Improvement and Farmer Turnover in Public Irrigation Schemes on 20,100 ha (US$ 40.65M).
There are over 250 public irrigation schemes developed and managed by the Department of Irrigation
(DOI), covering nearly 30 percent of the nation's irrigated area. The performance of these schemes without
users' participation is comparatively poorer than FMIS, partly due to technical deficiencies in design, and
partly due to inadequacy of O&M support. The IP mandates that, after reaching agreement with
beneficiaries, larger public schemes (over 2000 ha in the Terai and over 500 ha in the Hills) be jointly
managed by WUAs and DOI, and smaller public irrigation schemes are to be totally turned-over to
beneficiaries. Turnover of all or part of the schemes to beneficiaries will improve the management
efficiency, relieve public resources from O&M liability, and induce a sense of farmer ownership of the
irrigation systems. This sub-component would finance both types of SIFT. Beneficiaries will provide
their contribution to investment cost, participate in the design and construction of tertiary canal units,
which in most cases are missing in the original systems, and take over O&M of such tertiary canal units
after completion. Under this sub-component the project would finance:
(i) Sunsari Morang System - Phase III (US$ 39.12 M). The objective of this sub-component is to
rehabilitate and improve irrigation on 15,100 ha in continuation of the Bank-funded SMIP II (completed
in March 1995) (see Map 2). Financing of the proposed Phase m would include: (i) improvement and
rehabilitation of the main canal of the system beyond the completed Sunsari Morang Phase II area; (ii)
rehabilitation and modernization of secondary canals and related structures, drains and inspection road
networks; (iii) development of distribution networks through construction of sub-secondary and tertiary
canal systems; (iv) construction of 5.5 km Kosi Flood Embankment on the east bank of the Kosi River;
(v) technical assistance and institutional capacity-building for staff and beneficiary-WUAs in project
implementation; (vi) other miscellaneous works and infrastructure necessary for proper O&M of the
developed system, and (vii) institutional development to strengthen DOI central and, in particular, its
project office, the WUAs, and local non-governmental organization in management transfer process of
tertiary and higher order canals to users; and

Country - Nepal                                                       Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
(ii) Other Turnover Irrigation Schemes (US$ 1.53 M) in the eastern and western regions over an area of
about 5,000 ha. This component would finance full turnover and/or joint management of other
medium public irrigation schemes based on the "demand-driven" principle.
(c) Infrastructure Support Development (US$ 4.17 M). This sub-component would finance the following
infrastructure and environmental protection measures required in the above FMIS:
(i) construction of farm roads, river protection works. and environmental mitigation measures required in
a number of FMIS in accordance with findings of the environmental impact assessments carried out in
each scheme; and
(ii) integration of micro-hydropower generation and water supply schemes on a pilot basis in irrigation
schemes where and when there is demand, based on the "participatory" principle, and where such pilot
efforts are technically and economically viable. Alternative average cost-sharing ratio of 50-50
between the Government and beneficiaries is applied. It is estimated that, in about 20 percent of
FMIS, integration of rural water supply (for about 50,000 population) and/or hydro-power (about 10-
12 schemes of about 300 kW) generation would be feasible.
The NISP program excludes four districts (Dailekh, Surkhet, Banke, Kalikot) in the Mid-Western Region where
irrigation development is currently funded by other donors, and the entire Central and Eastern Regions for private
FMIS currently funded by the Asian Development Bank's Second Irrigation Sector Project.
C. Institutional Strengthening (US$ 17.96 M) This component would support the strengthening of the
implementing agencies to ensure the proper implementation of components (A) and (B). It would finance consulting
services for project implementation, training, investigation studies for investments, office buildings, equipment and
vehicles, and limited incremental staff and O&M expenses on a declining basis for the following project
implementing agencies:
*   Department of Irrigation (DOI) (US$ 9.55 M!. DOI will have primary responsibility for construction of
project-related infrastructure. The project would finance consulting services for design and construction
supervision, water planning and studies, O&M planning and scheme implementation, and strengthening of
the DOI's Training Branch. It would also finance construction of buildings, procurement of equipment,
vehicles and materials, and pilot on-farm water management activities in completed FMITS (covering about
10 percent of the developed area). Due to SMIP-III's location in the Eastern Region and the size of the
tasks involved, consulting services for its detailed design, construction supervision, and O&M studies
would, however, be arranged separately from FMIS component which generally are located in the
Western Region.
*  Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) (US$ 5.52 M) DHM is the country's sole agency
responsible for hydro-meteorological data collection, collation, and management. Currently, DHM is
operating with sub-optimal facilities and observation sites. The project would finance the hardware and
software required for improved data collection, processing, storage, and dissemination. It would also
support the strengthening of DHM's data collection networks on a river basin basis, and resources
inventory planning in 77 sub-basins within three of the four major country river basins which cover the
three Western Development Regions.
*  Department of Agriculture (DOA) (US$ 2.03 M) In view of the recently approved Agricultural Research
and Extension Project (AREP) which would cover a wider range of agricultural extension and related
activities at the national level, NISP will provide only limited support to DOA. It would focus on the
strengthening of the District DOA's capacity to prepare and jointly appraise NISP schemes with DOI and

extend specific agricultural training services to NISP irrigated areas which are not covered under AREP
(AREP covers 14 districts out of 36 districts under NISP).
WUAs. Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) (US$
0.86M). The project would finance training of staff in selected regional and district WUAs, NGOs, and
CBOs in such topics as NISP principles and procedures, systems O&M, participatory environmental
protection in hill irrigation schemes (PEPEH), irrigated water management, fanner organizations, financial
management, credit accessing, and marketing. Training will be based on a program designed by the
project consultants in collaboration with DOI's Human Resources Training Branch, DOA's Regional
Training Center, Agricultural Development Bank (Nepal) (ADBN), FAO/CP special program and the on
going German Development Service program for PEPHI.

3. Benefits and target population:
*   The formulation of a National Water Resources Strategy and the resulting Comprehensive Water Policy would
assist Nepal in laying the foundation for sustainable management of water resources through integrated river-
basin planning. It would, in particular, provide the much needed basin-wise comprehensive water resources
development and environmental management plans. The strategy would also guide bilateral and multilateral
donors in directing development assistance in a more coordinated fashion consistent with the nation's short,
medium, and long-term development objectives. In addition, the country will establish (or reorganize the
existing Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS)) a permanent NWPU to assist the existing
National Water Development Council (NWDC) (chaired by the Prime Minister) in fornulating new policies
and adjusting existing policies, and making planning, budgeting and management decisions related to execution
of water resources activities. The existing water related sub-sector policies would be improved to ensure their
consistency with the Comprehensive Water Policy.
*    The Infrastructure Development component, along with the associated institutional and operational measures
to upgrade the quality of water data, water management and O&M, will enhance the sustainability of irrigation
systems, and will ensure improved reliability and equitable distribution of water leading to increased
agricultural production, creation of job opportunities, and increased farm incomes. It will, in particular,



Project Appraisal Document                                                           Page 7
Country - Nepal                                                      Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
benefit about 132,200 small and marginal farners whose landholdings is less than 1.0 ha and 53,200 medium
farmers whose landholdings are 1.0 to 3.0 ha representing a total population of about one million persons.
Migration from the Hills to the Terai will gradually diminish as employment opportunities in the Hills are
enhanced. Promotion of groundwater irrigation in the form of clustered tubewells will resolve the issue of
underutilization of individual tubewells due to fragmentation of landholdings and exploit the rich Terai
groundwater for production.
*   The project will benefit farmers of different ethnicity. Majority of the population in hill schemes come from
diverse ethnic backgrounds, but are mainly from the Gurung, Magar Kami or Chhertri ethnic group. Brahmins
and other castes are, to a lesser extent, also represented. In the case of Terai schemes, major groups of farmers
are Tharu, Brahmin and Chhertri and the Occupational Caste represents less than 7 percent. Over 70 percent of
farmers are owners and owners-cum-tillers.
*   The Institutional strengthening component will assist DOI in relinquishing some of its more traditional
responsibilities for construction and O&M and is expected to result in increased mobilization of resources from
the private sector and their active participation in water resources development. This component will also help
to strengthen the central DOI in O&M planning and budgeting and resources allocation. Coordination between
staff of DOI and DOA at the regional and district levels would be strengthened with respect to identification
and operation of irrigation systems. WUAs in private and public irrigation systems would be legalized and
their management, operational, production and marketing activities strengthened.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: The project will be implemented in five years. (FY 1997/98-FY2001/02)
Executing agencies: Formulation of the Water Resources Strategy would be carried out under the overall
responsibility of MOWR with direct guidance from the NSC. HMGN would establish a core unit (or reorganize the
existing WECS) charged with the formation of a NWPU aloft from line agencies. At negotiations, it was agreed that
NWPU would be formed by December 31, 1997. The NWPU would be assisted by a team of national and
international consultants in developing the Water Resources Strategy.
Implementation of the project's Infrastructure Development and Institutional Strengthening Component would be the
main responsibility of the DOI under MOWR, DHM under the Ministry of Science and Technology, DOA under the
Ministry of Agriculture, and the relevant WUAs.
Project Coordination: Due to the involvement of various departments under different ministries, policy decisions
would be taken by an apex body at the ministerial level and implementation would be carried out by a three-tiered
management structure at the departmental level in accordance with Nepal's existing administrative structure in
general, and the pilot ILC organization structure in particular.
Project Central Coordination Committee (PCCC). Project policy decisions would be taken by a PCCC which has
been established prior to the Negotiations. Chaired by the Secretary, MOWR, its members will consist of
representatives of the Financial Comptroller General Office, Ministry of Environment & Population, and concerned
ministries, and heads of the implementing departments. The PCCC will formulate policies on inter-ministerial and
inter-departmental matters relating to project responsibilities of various departments, budget allocations, and major
procurement issues. The Director General (DG), DOI, will act as member-secretary of the PCCC.
Project Implementation Commitee (PIC) chaired by the DG, DOI, with members consisting of the Deputy Director
Generals of the implementing departments, would be established and would have responsibility for coordinating with
inter-departmental regional offices on matters related to budget preparation, disbursement compilation, progress
reporting, and other project-administration related matters. A Project Coordination Office (PCO), headed by a high-



Project Appraisal Document                                                                Page 8
Country -Nepal                                                           Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
ranking officer of Class I level, would also be established to serve as the secretariat of the PCCC and PIC. The head
of the PCO would be empowered on behalf of the Regional Project Implementation Units, DHM, and DOA to submit
progress reports and withdrawal applications to IDA. The PCO has been established and is the main government
counterpart for Bank's missions.
SlIflP III sub-component, however, will be implemented by the existing Sunsari Morang Irrigation Development
Board (SMIDB), which is also chaired by the Secretary, MOWR, with participation of most of the members of the
PCCC.
Project Imlementation Units (PIUs). The four existing PIUs setup under the ILC pilot project in each of the three
participating regions, i.e. Western, Mid-Western, and Far-Western Regions and in Sunsari Morang Irrigation Project
in Eastern Region would be strengthened. Each PIU would be headed by the Regional Irrigation Director (RID) in
the case of FMIS and turned over schemes, and by the project manager of the SMIDB in the case of the Sunsari
Morang Irrigation System for the SMIP-III sub-project. The members of the PIUs would consist of the Regional
Directors of DOAs, representatives of DHMs, ADBN, and NPC. The PIU would function as the NISP's Regional
Appraisal and Approval Committee (RAAC) for the selection and approval of the schemes to be financed under the
project. The RAAC would be responsible for submission of NISP's annual implementation program to the PIC and to
the concerned District Development Committees (DDCs).
District Appraisal Committees (DACs) Existing DACs will be strengthened as district supporting units to PIUs and
these units will be chaired by District Irrigation Offices (DIO), with members consisting of the District's Agricultural
Development Officer, and the district representatives of ADBN and the NPC. DACs are the working units for
identification, preparation and submission of FMIS under NISP. A Regional Mobile Irrigation Team (MIT)
comprising engineers, a hydro-geologist, environmentalists, an agro-economist, a sociologist, and the district
agriculture officer, will assist DACs in the sub-project identification, design, approval, and implementation of
schemes at the district level.
Project Implementation Cycle
NISP implementation will be in accordance with the rules and procedures outlined in HMGN's IP (as amended in
1997) and the "Procedural Guidelines for Surface Water and Ground Water Irrigation sub-projects" prepared by the
ILC Technical Assistance team (attachment to Annex 2 and Schedule 6 to DCA). These guidelines require that:
*   The DAC, with the assistance of the regional MIT and Consultants would prepare the NISP individual
schemes. Schemes costing up to NRs 1.0 M would be approved by RID, schemes costing between NRs 1.0
M and NRs 10.0 M would be approved by the concerned RAAC (PIUs) and schemes costing more than NRs
10.0 M would be approved by the DG of DOI upon recommendation of the PIC.
*   Implementation of sub-projects would only commence after receipt of beneficiary's written commitment
backed by cash contribution in accordance with the schedule specified in the IP.
*   The cash collected will be deposited in the joint account of DIO/WJUA, and 0.5 percent of the estimated cost
of schemes will be returned to the WUA upon successful completion of the scheme for the WUA's use as
seed money for future O&M.
* In the case of cost overruns of more than 10 percent beyond the agreed original estimate, the construction
will be discontinued until the farmers' agree to additional contribution (in kind/cash/labor) on a pro-rata
basis for their share of the cost overrun.

Country - Nepal                                                      Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
* A register of completed schemes (ILC and NISP) will be prepared by the concerned RID and approved by
the DG, DOI. Completed schemes shall not be eligible for further funding by the Governnent during the
next fifteen years after its completion, except in cases of catastrophic acts of nature.
Procurement Plan and Packages: Procurement of works, goods, and services would be carried out in accordance
with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines and IDA's standard bidding documents for ICB and NCB tenders agreed
with the Government. All implementing agencies have prepared draft procurement plans which were reviewed by the
Bank.
Minor civil works costing less than US$ 20,000 per contract but not exceeding an aggregate amount of US$ 5.0
million equivalent, and Minor procurement of spares, vehicles, goods and equipment amounting to less than US$
10,000 per contract but not exceeding an aggregate amount of US$ 300,000, and various short-term consultancy
services of less than six person months will be procured in accordance with local shopping procedures (such as force
account, unit rate, NGO and beneficiary participation) acceptable to IDA.
Medium size civil works under the FMIS sub-component which are geographically dispersed in nature and exceeding
US$ 20,000 but less than US$500,000 per contract will be procured by National Competitive Bidding (NCB).
Major civil works exceeding US$500,000 per contract will be procured in accordance with the ICB procedures. In
particular, civil works for Sunsari Morang Irrigation III sub-project amounting to about US$ 24.3 million will be
procured in one ICB package. Procurement would follow IDA's guidelines and standard procurement procedures.
Detailed procurement arrangements are provided in Annex 6.
Project oversight: (policy guidance, etc.):
Water Charg. The current level of O&M of public irrigation schemes is sub-optimal resulting in unsatisfactory
performance of public irrigation systems. Consequently, it is difficult to enforce water charges. This problem is
endemic and cyclic. Unless the level of O&M is prioritized according to availability of funds and nature of irrigation
systems, it is unlikely that the performance of public irrigation systems will improve and investments will provide
meaningful returns. Studies would be carried out under the project to define: (i) the optimum level of O&M
requirement for different types of public irrigation systems before and after hand over of parts of the systems to
WUAs, (ii) the funding requirement to achieve the optimum level, and (iii) the appropriate level of water charges, and
a plan for its collection. HMGN has increased water charges by 100 percent starting from FY 1997/1998 in major
public irrigation systems.
Irrigation Subsidies. HMGN's current level of subsidies for irrigation development in private and public irrigation
schemes as per IP is high and government's capacity to finance such subsidies on a long-term basis cannot be
sustainable. However, because of the country's geographic and economic diversity, a uniform subsidy for the whole
country may not be applicable. A review of the subsidy policy will be carried out as an integral part of the project
design. HMGN has agreed to revise the subsidy over time in accordance with the outcome of the study.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: Each implementing agency will keep separate
project accounts. All transactions will be compiled on a monthly basis and submitted to the PIC. During
implementation, the borrower would submit periodic Project Financial Management Reports (four monthly basis).
The financial management report would include: (a) project accounts based on Project Charts of Accounts grouped or
classified according to expenditures by project component activities, disbursement categories and source of funds, and
appropriate accounting standard and reporting formats; (b) arrangements for recording monitorable physical and other
indicators for comparison with related costs; (c) procurement contract management information; and (d) internal
control arrangements to ensure proper segregation of duties, documented procedures for authorizations, and levels of
supervision.

Country - Nepal                                                      Nepal Irzigation Sector Project
In accordance with the Bank's new guidelines on auditing, an assurance was obtained and covenanted that all
implementing agencies would: (i) submit to IDA consolidated unaudited annual project accounts and financial
statements within six months after the end of each fiscal year, (ii) have their accounts audited annually by independent
auditors; (iii) submit to IDA a certified copy of the audited project accounts no later than nine months after the end of
each fiscal year, and (iv) retain all supporting records and documentation for at least one year after IDA has received
the audit report for review by supervision missions. In this regard, HMGN has submitted a Financial Management
Plan to IDA. The Financial Management Plan is given in the PIP.
In order to avoid delays in submission of withdrawal applications, the accounting functions of the PIC (in PCO)
would be strengthened by the establishment of a separate Project Accounts Unit (PAU) headed by an Accounts
Officer of at least Grade II level together with the required supporting staff. Additionally, an assurance was obtained
from HMGN to avoid untimely transfers of senior accounts staff and project personnel and, in case of unavoidable
transfers, reasonable overlapping period should be provided. The PAU in PCO would be responsible for compiling all
project accounts and submitting the corresponding disbursement applications to IDA.
Budgeting: Each implementing agency at the District level would submit, through regional PLUs, annual work
programs and budget requests to the central PIC. The PIC would consolidate all programs and requests into an annual
project work program and budget. The consolidated annual work programs and budgets would then be submitted for
approval by the PCCC and funds would be allocated by HMGN's Ministry of Finance after necessary review by NPC
to the implementing agencies. It is important that the formulation of annual work programs and budgets be based on
real demand of farmers and should contain only the schemes which are technically and economically viable. It is also
important that the process be transparent and involve all parties concerned. An assurance to this effect was obtained.
An assurance was also obtained for providing sufficient budget allocated for the first year's project implementation
program.
Retroactive Financing: The ILC/IDS pilot operation currently financed under the ongoing Mahakali Irrigation II
and the Bhairawa-Lumbini III Groundwater Irrigation projects have been expanded from 15,000 ha to 30,000 ha due
to growing farmers' demand. It was agreed at the negotiations that incomplete subprojects under the pilot ILC would
be carried over to the proposed NISP. As the funds allocated for the initial pilot operation were fully disbursed by
July 15, 1997, retroactive financing in an amount of SDR 1.5 million would be provided to allow the continuation of
these sub-projects. Retroactive financing would only be available for eligible expenditures incurred from July 16,
1997 up to signing of the proposed credit. A list of on-going ILC surface and groundwater schemes in three western
regions which will be carried over to NISP are given in Annex 2 Attachment 3 (a) (b) (c) and (d).
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The Management Information System established under the IDS Pilot
project would be strengthened and utilized for the preparation of project progress and performance reports. The
project's PCO would also submit, on a four monthly basis, Project Financial Management Reports consisting of: (a)
Financial Statements of Project; (b) Project Progress; and (c) Procurement Management Report. Standard reporting
formats for tracking on a monthly basis the project's physical and financial progress, have been developed by the ILC
technical assistance team. At the regional level, DAC would be responsible for reporting to the RID on progress in
NISP and RID will submit the progress reports to PCO regularly.
A Regional Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)Team under the Regional Director of Agriculture will monitor and
evaluate performance of completed irrigation schemes. In the case of SMIP-III, a separate M&E unit would be
established in the proposed Water Management Division of the sub-project. Similar monitoring and reporting
systems would also be implemented for SMIP-II. It was also agreed that an independent consulting agency and NGO
would be hired to carry out the external monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement procedures under SMIP III.
M&E will be assessed on the basis of the project output indicators presented in Annex 1 and performance indicators
mentioned under the PIP.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the  Document number and date of latest CAS discussion:
project                               15508-NEP of April 30, 1996 and CAS Update of November 25, 1997
The Bank's Water Resources Management Policy (1993). In order to ensure the equitable, efficient, and sustainable
development of water resources, the policy advocates the preparation of state and river basin water resources plans
covering all aspects of water development including domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses. It also recommends
that these plans be prepared in a participatory manner taking account of the fact that water should be considered as an
economic good. Additionally, the principles of: (a) beneficiary contribution to the investment costs, (b) full recovery
of O&M costs, and (c) turnover of O&M responsibilities to farmers' organizations are also recommended. These
principles and recommendations have been covered under NISP through: (i) the preparation of a national water
resources strategy and formulation of a comprehensive water resources sub-sector policies; (ii) the emphasis on
farmers' participation and contribution in all proposed irrigation works, (iii) the formation of WUAs and the turnover
of O&M responsibilities to WUAs, (iv) the setting up of a National Water Planning Unit at the central level, and (v)
the strengthening of the hydrological data collection, collation and processing systems.
The CAS for Nepal identifies poverty alleviation as an important strategy for the country's economic development.
With low per capita income fairly evenly distributed and no surplus to redistribute, the CAS suggests that poverty
alleviation can only be achieved through economic interventions that will result in more rapid income and output
growth resulting in reduced population growth, and preservation of natural resources and enviromnental sustainability.
The CAS identifies agriculture as the key sector presenting the highest potential for growth, as it accounts for almost
40 percent of gross domestic product and 80 percent of employment. The potential of agriculture has not been fully
tapped as about 492,000 ha in Terai and 208,000 ha in the Hills still remain largely non-irrigated. The CAS has
endorsed a package of policy reforms, technology improvements, and participatory investments in the irrigation sector.
The project would contribute to the potential growth of agriculture by promoting efficient irrigation of existing and
new irrigation systems. In particular, it would contribute to the assistance strategy in three key areas: (a) poverty
alleviation through increased production in irrigated agriculture; (b) effective utilization of public resources by
gradually transferring O&M responsibility from the public to the private sector; and (c) enhance participation of the
private sector, NGOs, and farmer-beneficiaries in the investment decision process and systems' ownership. This will
encourage private investment with greater assurance for the users to have control over natural resources management.
IDA involvement. IDA has been a lead agency in helping Nepal develop its irrigation potential (accounts for more
than 40 percent of investment) since the issuance of a new IP in 1988. Similarly, over the last five to six years, IDA
was instrumental in increasing HMGN's emphasis on groundwater development based on beneficiary participation.
The Bank's financial and technical assistance provided under the ILC, and other projects, have proven the viability of
implementing the IP on the ground. The experience gained under ILC has led HMGN to revise the IP twice, in 1992
and in 1997. IDA has also contributed to IHMGN's effort to hand over O&M responsibility of tertiary units to
beneficiaries in surface irrigation schemes. Much success has been experienced in the Mahakali, Bhairawa Lumbini
and Sunsari Morang Projects. Under the proposed project, IDA would continue to assist HMGN to apply its IP to both
groundwater and surface water irrigation schemes through improved beneficiary participation and cost recovery
measures. By gradually handing over the higher order canal system, IDA is assisting enhancement of management
transfer towards Self Financing Irrigation and Drainage Districts (SIDD) in large public irrigation systems.
The project also supports HMGN's development focus on agriculture through, inter alia, facilitating investments in
private farmer-managed irrigation systems, which are endemic in Nepal, and in improving water management in public
irrigation schemes through greater reliance on user groups. Although the experience with farmer-managed irrigation
systems is still evolving, many lessons have been learned from IDA's ILC pilot projects and ADBN's Irrigation Sector
Project which have been incorporated in the design of NISP. Similarly, PJM is being tested in all large-scale public
irrigation schemes, including those currently supported by IDA projects. The proposed project would carry this work
further and expand into existing public irrigation systems. It can be expected that by the end of NISP about 30 percent

of tertiary networks of major public irrigation schemes would be handed to farmers.
The proposed project will also follow-up on the institutional development efforts undertaken in the ongoing
Institutional Development Support Project (IDS) designed to orient DOI towards relinquishing part of its O&M
responsibilities to the private sector. More importantly, the project will support training beneficiary farmers in water
management and O&M of irrigation systems that are to be handed over to them after rehabilitation.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
* Among Nepal's few natural resources, water is the most promising resource for development. Because of the
uneven spatial, temporal, and seasonal distribution of river flows on the one hand, and the riparian issues on the
other, its development poses complex challenges. This is compounded by the country's lack of effective
national level water resources planning and management initiatives. Each government department involved in
water resource development operates in isolation of others, lacking coordination, but preparing policies and
regulations based only on its own needs. Population pressure and the ad-hoc development of water resources
have resulted in some adverse impacts on the country's ecological systems, e.g. groundwater mining in the
Kathmandu valley, pollution of the Bagmati River, increased frequency of freak floods and droughts in many
parts of the Terai. These adverse ecological impacts highlight the need for preparing a comprehensive and
integrated water resources strategy to tackle the issues in a prioritized and an organized manner. Although
HMGN has promulgated in the past many sub-sector policies and acts, these are to be reviewed in a
comprehensive and integrated manner. The staff skills and capabilities required to implement the concept of
multi-purpose and integrated river basin planning are lacking and sufficient and reliable data base are non-
existent impeding the country's ability to achieve its development objectives.
*   Despite the Government's efforts in promoting beneficiary participation in irrigation development, the sector
continues to rely heavily on subsidies which are not sustainable in the long-term. Under the project, HMGN
would assess the level of subsidy required for different types of schemes and review its investment subsidy
policy. The Government would also assess current water charges, determine the appropriate levels of
beneficiary contributions, and establish a program for improved collection of water charges. In the case of
jointly managed major public irrigation schemes, the Government has increased water charges by 100 percent
before the start of NISP and agreed to include in NISP only those systems in which cost recovery rates have
improved over time.
*   O&M of major public irrigation schemes is sub-optimal due to financial constraints. Collection of water
charges is hampered by the systems' low operational efficiencies due to lack of minor distribution networks
below the sub-secondary level. More than one-third of the irrigable area remains virtually rain-fed and are
under mono-cropping. Turnover of tertiary systems to legalized WUAs would only be possible with the
introduction of tertiary canal systems and rehabilitation of dilapidated irrigation structures. This would relieve
HMGN of the financial burden that O&M entails and would forge a strong partnership with beneficiaries for
more sustainable development. It is envisaged that the WUAs would be organized to take over higher order
canals in the future.
*   The country has limited financial resources which need to be effectively utilized through prioritization of O&M
funding in the public sector and by imposing strict regulation on public resources utilization. IDA's continued
assistance is required to help redirect the country's supply driven irrigation development orientation towards a
more demand driven farmer managed form of development.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
* Integrated Water Resources Strategy and Comprehensive Water Policy Component: This component aims at
addressing the country's lack of planning and coordination in the implementation of water resources
development projects which have led to the deterioration of available water resources and the degradation of the

Country - Nepal                                                       Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
environment. The project would finance HMGN's continuing effort to formulate a national water resources
development strategy through identification of prioritized multi-sectoral development issues and integrated
interventions. These would lead to major institutional reforms by instituting a national water planning unit, the
revision of the country's water resources act, and its sub-sector policies, if necessary.
*   Water Rights with downstream riparian nations: The most difficult constraint facing HMGN's long-term
irrigation strategy is the issue of water rights with the downstream riparian nations. This has prevented Nepal
from fully developing its water resources and IDA from supporting promising investments on some major
rivers. The preparation of the Water Resources Strategy and the fomulation of the Comprehensive Water Policy
will enable Nepal to be in a better position when discussing water rights with its riparian states. The present
project will involve rehabilitation and modernization of the existing surface schemes with no additional water
withdrawn over the existing amount. Within the present diversion amount (as observed during scheme
formulation), expansion of new irrigation area would be allowed using water savings from improvement under
the project. New irrigation schemes would be allowed only in case of groundwater development.
*   Irrigation Sector Improvement and Development Component: This component would continue to support
policy reforms in HMGN's Irrigation Sector through investments in infrastructure and O&M using the demand
driven approach to ensure that the changes become irreversible. Poverty alleviation would be addressed through
higher incomes resulting from the rehabilitation of existing systems and the construction of new ones. The issue
of low water charges recovery would be addressed through the turnover of O&M responsibilities to WUAs
including collection of water charges.
*   Institutional Strengthening and Development: This component would address the issues of inadequate cost
recovery through a study of current subsidy policies in both the private and public sector irrigation. The
expected outcome of the study would be to reduce: (i) the current investment subsidy level of 85 percent on
average to a reasonable level over a period of time, and (ii) the current O&M subsidy level of over 90 percent in
public irrigation systems to almost nil at least in the project supported subprojects.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
(a) Integrd Water Resources Strategy and Policy Development:  The only option for Nepal's economic
development is an integrated multi-sectoral strategy which revolves around water, the country's largest resource.
The high level NWDC has not functioned for several years for lack of a technical advisory body dealing with the
development of water resources in an integrated manner. The existing WECS attached to MOWR mainly
concentrates on energy and irrigation issues. The role of WECS could be expanded to cover all water uses such as
water supply, industry, health, environment, etc. so that it could provide adequate technical assistance to the
NWDC. HMGN should have a clear and well articulated water policy for the short, medium, and long terms prior
to making any further sizable investments in multi-purpose river development projects which will have far-
reaching impacts on the regions.
(b) Irrigation Sector Improvement and Development Component: Until the promulgation of the IP in 1988, no
significant investment was made in FMIS. The only sensible approach to solve the inefficiencies of public
irrigation systems is to involve beneficiaries in the systems' management and operation. Although FMIS is in
existence since time immemorial in small scale village surface irrigation schemes in Nepal, the participatory
approach and investments in FMIS were never promoted prior to the IP. Investment in FMIS was therefore a new
approach to irrigation development in the country. In the case of public irrigation, sustainability has been thwarted
by the proliferation of new construction, and inadequate attention to O&M. Irrigation development was caught in a
vicious circle of "construction-destruction-and-rehabilitation". It is against this background that the SIFT
component of the project was identified as the only viable solution for sustainable development. Involving farmers
in the decision-making process of planning, design, construction implementation, and O&M of irrigation systems
will help ensure this. This approach had been tested on the ground and found to be successful in achieving full

privatization of public irrigation systems over time.
Most public irrigation systems in Nepal are affected by various technical and design issues which have resulted in
costly development and O&M interventions. For example, the inflow of sediments in the run-of-the-river surface
irrigation systems is a serious problem because of Nepal's torrential and heavily sediment laden rivers. Unless
important desilting operations are organized at regular intervals, the discharge capacity of canals are reduced. The
problem of reduced canal discharge is compounded by system's design which was based on Western India's
extensive irrigation concept that provides water far below the optimum irrigation requirements of fields. The
problem of getting enough water is getting worse without irrigation systems at tertiary distribution level.
Under these circumstances, different technical options were considered to resolve the problems of high silt inflow,
expensive O&M, and inadequate supply of water to fields. In each case, the most technically sound and cost
effective option was adopted such as: (i) the provision of large desilting basins equipped with sediment removing
dredgers, (ii) the construction of irrigation canals below the tertiary level outlets, and (iii) the introduction of
rotational water supply at the tertiary level outlets which allows for the doubling of specific unit discharge at tertiary
outlets to satisfy peak demand.
(c) Instittutional Strengthening and Development: The agricultural support component was designed to avoid any
overlap and duplication with the recently-approved AREP (FY98 Lending). To this effect, the project will
complement AREP and finance limited institutional support to DOA for: (i) the joint identification of irrigation
schemes, (ii) farmers' training, (iii) vehicles, equipment, and (iv) on-farm water management extension work which
has been specifically targeted to the completed ILC/NISP pilot schemes. In addition, the project will finance
irrigated agricultural support and extension only in the Districts which AREP does not cover (AREP covers only 14
districts of NISP).

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
*  The major lesson learned from previous IDA-supported projects in public irrigation sector was that the lack of
participation of water users in project formulation, constructions, and operations led to schemes which did not
respond adequately to the needs and local farming communities. This supply-driven approach hampered the
development of irrigated agriculture and affected the sustainability of irrigation systems. Since 1988, all IDA-
supported projects have assisted Nepal in implementing its new IP which promotes the participatory approach in
public and private irrigation sectors. The pilot ILC programs have shown that this approach could be expanded to
the country as a whole to reduce the burden of development and O&M costs on HMGN's budget and to improve
the sustainability of systems.
*  Previous projects also demonstrated that self-standing, supply-driven projects did not adequately promote the new
participatory approach in small and scattered FMIS and related technical improvement in the public irrigation
systems throughout the country. As a result, the concept of self-standing project to implement Nepal's new IP was
relinquished in favor of the sector program approach. In particular, the proposed project will cover public sector

irrigation as well as private sector village irrigation and groundwater schemes under the same principle in both
plains and hills.
*  Under the SMIP II, the concept of tertiary irrigation units (TTU) was introduced to facilitate the turnover to WUAs.
The success of this operation has permitted this concept to be applied in a systematic manner to the project. As a
result, TIUs of about 1000 ha and below will be constructed with their system of minor canals and watercourses to
deliver water to each and every field. This will greatly facilitate water management by the WUAs and enhance
system efficiencies. Ownership of such tertiary units as well as responsibility for O&M after a period of joint
management will eventually be transferred to WUAs.
* Riparian issues are avoided by financing only rehabilitation of existing surface subprojects with no additional
water drawn over the original designed values. Limited number of new sub-projects will be allowed using
groundwater.
11. Indicators of borrower commitment and ownership: [Note: Includes measures already taken by the borrower
prior to Board presentation, as well as planned actions.]
*  HMGN is strongly committed to the formulation of a Water Resources Strategy to consolidate its water resources
sector under one policy and one coordinated planning body. Phase I of this undertaking was completed and
discussed at a public forum attended by representatives of government departments, international donor
community, NGOs, community based organizations, and other stakeholders. Phase II preparation is included in
the project.
*  HMGN has also agreed, in principle, to revise its subsidy policy in irrigation development based on a study to be
funded under NISP. A time bound action plan terms of reference (TOR) has been proposed by HMGN.
*  HMGN increased the water charges by 100 percent in major public irrigation system prior to the commencement
of NISP.
12. Value added of Bank support:
*  The Bank's involvement in the preparation of the National Water Resources Strategy and Comprehensive Water
Policy will enable Nepal to have access to the best international experiences and practices in this field. As
indicated previously, this will permit Nepal to open a dialogue with downstream riparian countries as part of the
Bank's on-going "development triangle" sector work. This regionalization concept could be introduced only by an
international organization like the Bank.
*  The Bank has been- involved with IMGN for the past years as a leading donor in developing Nepal's irrigation
sector program. Although this program is still evolving, IDA will not only continue to be instrumental in
promoting the participatory approach of the new Irrigation Policy, but also in introducing several technical
innovations, such as introducing TIUs and other improved water management systems. In addition, with the
lessons learned from the Bank's extensive irrigation operations in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, it can adjust
and apply them to Nepal's irrigation sector.

Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the Implementation Volume. See Annex 8)
13.EconomicAssessment
(see Annex 4):
Prject costs: The total project cost is tentatively estimated at about NRs. 6,375 M (US$ 103 M equivalent) including
physical and price contingencies of about NRs. 1,352 million (US$ 13.3 M equivalent). Cost estimates are based on
1996 prices and include physical contingencies ranging from 5 percent to 15 percent. Standard Bank's local and
foreign inflation rates have been used. Of the total project costs, US$ 98.9 M would be for investment (development
costs) and US$ 4.1 M for incremental recurrent costs.
Project Benefits. Based on the ILC experience, the project will allow substantial increases in: (i) cropping intensity by
at least 30 percent mainly in the dry season; (ii) the use of HYVs by 47 percent; (iii) the use of chemical fertilizer by
22 percent; (iv) average yields by 40 percent; and (v) farm incomes by 117 percent. Under FMIS, overall cropping
intensities with the project have been estimated to increase by 20 percent to 60 percent, and yields of crops by 17
percent to 130 percent; e.g. 17 percent to 46 percent for paddy, 50 percent tolOO percent for wheat and 50 percent
to130 percent for oilseeds. At full development, the FMIS component would increase paddy production by 76,500
tons, wheat 42,660 tons, oil seeds 3,130 tons, sugarcane 2,880 tons, lentils 3.310 tons, potatoes and vegetables to
54,280 tons annually. In the case of Sunsari Morang Irrigation III sub-component, it is expected that the cropping
intensity will increase by 38 percent from 160 percent to 198 percent, and yields of crops by 40 percent to 150
percent; e.g. 40 percent for paddy, 67 percent for wheat, 14 percent for sugarcane, 63 percent for jute and 150 percent
for oilseeds. Annual incremental production is estimated at 29,460 tons paddy, 13,140 tons wheat, 2,950 ton oilseeds,
1,815 tons lentil/pulses, 13,140 tons vegetables and potato and 16,610 tons of sugarcane.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR). The economic analysis of the 10 FEMIS model schemes and SMIP III resulted in the
following base case ERRs.
Major Rehabilitation (Surface Irrigation Scheme) in Hill  = 14.5% and   in Terai  = 19.2%
Minor Rehabilitation (Surface Irrigation Scheme) - in Hill = 14.9% and   in Terai   = 16.0%
Groundwater (shallow tubewell) cluster            = 19.2% and (deep tubewell)  18.6%-20.3%
Turnover schemes (hill)                           = 18.2% and   in Terai   = 19.0%
Joint Management schemes                          = 18.0%
SMIP III                                          = 15.0%
Based on possible unit and type of different schemes at the time of implementation, the estimated ERRs are all
favorable, ranging from 14.5 percent to 20.3 percent for all FMIS sub-projects to 15.0 percent for SMIP III. Including
sunk costs of SMHP and benefits from the hydropower and savings in O&M costs (desilting costs), ERR of the SMIP
III is estimated at 13.3 percent. Extrapolation of the combined ERRs of the ten sub-project models and SMIP III have
been used as a basis for the calculation of ERRs for the EMIS component and the whole project, which are estimated
at 17.1 percent and 16.2 percent respectively. Including sunk costs of SMHP and benefits from the hydropower and
savings in O&M costs, ERR of the whole project is estimated at 15.3 percent.
The economic sensitivity and risk analysis of all schemes, including SMIP III, was carried out for the following
scenarios: (a) decline of O&M level after implementation; (b) larger areas coming under paddy; (c) prices of major
commodities dropped by 20 percent; (d) level of inputs reduced by 25 percent; (e) implementation delays resulting in
20 percent cost escalation; and (f) benefits lag by 1-2 years. In all cases, ERRs of most sub-projects are above the
opportunity cost of capital (OCC) of 12 percent. However, ERRs of the hill major and minor rehabilitation sub-
projects would fall slightly below the OCC of 12 percent when incremental yields of all crops decline by 25 percent,
prices of all crops decline by 20 percent or irrigated areas decline by 40 percent due to inadequate O&M. It should
be noted that the above risk assumptions are highly conservative because the project's incremental production is
small and dispersed in the four regions. Therefore it is unlikely that prices of all crops and incremental yields of all
crops would fall drastically at the same time. In addition, farmers are unlikely to increase paddy areas at the expenses
of all other crops, particularly oilseeds and pulses as these crops are grown mainly for on-farm consumption.

Country - Nepal                                                        Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
Although the risk of inadequate O&M of sub-projects is likely to occur, this would be minimized through WUAs
organized under the project.
The switching values for increased costs and reduced benefits were also tested. The analysis shows that in most cases
benefits are more sensitive than costs. The results indicate that ERRs of sub-project, SMIP III, the FMIS component
and the whole project would fall to 12% when incremental benefits decrease by 17%-38% or total costs increased by
20 percent to 62 percent. Details are shown in Annex 4.
Fiscal impact. As per the project financing plan, the IDA Credit would cover 77.6 percent of the total project cost,
the beneficiaries 8.6 percent, and HMGN 13.8 percent which is about US$ 14.1 M equivalent, inclusive of about
US$4.3 M equivalent of duties and taxes, over five years. HMGN's net contribution would therefore be about US$
2.0 M equivalent (about NRs 124 M) per year. In the last five years (FY93-FY97), annual development expenditures
in the irrigation sector averaged 6.8 percent of the country's total annual expenditures. However, the fiscal impact of
NISP on DOI annual development budget would be significant as per the Three-Year Rolling Budget projected by
DOI. The estimated three year average of DOI's budget including NISP is about US$65 million (NRs 4,042 million).
NISP's annual budget requirement is NRs 1,158 million on average per year and NRs 1,852 million in peak year.
This would represent about 29% and 46% respectively of DOI projected annual development budget. Considering
only HMGN's counterpart funds, annual budget requirement for NISP would be minimal, representing an increment
of about 4.7 percent of DOI's annual development budget on average year and 7.5 percent in peak year.
Annual development expenditures of DOA and DHM comprised less than 1 percent of the country 's total annual
expenditures. Similarly, the fiscal impact of NISP project on DOA would be minimal, but for DHM it would be
significant. Annual development budget, including NISP annual cost, is estimated to average.at NRs 765 million for
DOA and NRs 248.9 million for DHM. NISP annual budget requirement of NRs 25 million on average year and
NRs 30 million in peak year would add about 6% and 8% respectively to DOA annual development budget. For
DHM, the average annual NISP budget requirement of NRs 68 million and peak year requirement of NRs 90 million
in peak year would add about 16 percent and 22 percent respectively to its annual budget. Considering only
HMGN's counterpart funds, NISP's annual budget requirement would represent an increment of only 0.4 percent of
DOA's and 2.6 percent of DHM's annual development budgets.
To ensure smooth project implementation with minimal financial burden on the Government, an assurance was
obtained at Negotiations that HMGN would provide annual budget allocation and timely release of funds to the
concerned implementing agencies,would compile project accounts in a timely manner and promptly submit
withdrawal applications for reimbursements.
During project implementation, a review of HMGN's irrigation subsidy policy of 1997 would be undertaken with the
view to an eventual reduction of subsidies in a phased manner. The study will determine the adequacy of current and
future levels of beneficiary contribution to investments in irrigation development on the basis of farmers' incomes
and the different types of schemes.
A detailed review of O&M contribution in jointly managed public irrigation system would also be carried out to
reassess farmers' capacity to contribute to O&M for the portion maintained by them and for the portion maintained
by the government agency. In public irrigation systems the current water rate of NRs 200 per ha is insufficient to
cover full O&M. It is estimated that about NRs 550 per hectare would now be required even after the turn over of
tertiary systems to farmers. The area-based water rates are assessed uniformly without taking into account the fact that
many farmers are receiving little or no water due to system deficiencies and lack of proper maintenance. The present
rate of collection nationwide is understandably low (about 5%).
The water rates collected are deposited in the Treasury Department, with no effect on actual O&M expenditures. A
study would explore the possibility to: (i) collect water charges on a volumetric basis at the head of the secondary canals

Country - Nepal                                                         Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
covering the full O&M of the main and secondary distribution systems, (ii) keep in a separate account in the system area
the amount collected less a suitable allowance for overhead, and (iii) impose penalties to WUAs in the rehabilitated
areas that do not collect and pay adequate water charges. The penalties could be the cut off of irrigation water pending
an agreement on the resolution of the arrears issue. While it is premature to predict how much of the desirable reforms
of the O&M policies and practices can be achieved under this project, the Bank will push to obtain significant reforms in
this area.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)    NPV= ranges NRs 0.3-37.5 million per scheme; and FRR= 12% to 19%
Although financial analysis is not applicable to public irrigation schemes to be financed under the project, such
analysis has been carried out for private sector schemes based on project cost estimates. FRRs to all financial
resources are estimated to range from 15 to 19 percent for all terai sub-projects and 12-13 percent for hill major and
minor sub-projects and SMIP III as shown below.
Major Rehabilitation (Surface Irrigation Scheme) in Hill   = 11.9%  and in Terai  = 17.1%
Minor Rehabilitation (Surface Irrigation Scheme) - in Hill  = 13.2% and in Terai  = 15.6%
Groundwater (shallow tubewell)                     =  19.1% and (deeptubewell) =14.8%-18.9%
Turnover schemes (hill)                            = 16.2%  and inTerai        = 16.6%
Joint Management schemes                            = 15.4%
SMIW                                                = 12.0%
The project will also increase beneficiary farmers' income thus enabling them to raise their incomes above the
poverty line. A total of 52,930 farm families will directly benefit from the project. It has been estimated that farm
incomes per family at full development would increase by 41 percent to 247 percent for farms in the Terai, 59 percent
to 129 percent for farms in the Hills and 137 percent for farms in SMIP III. At full development, annual net farm
incomes are estimated at NRs 30,610-NRs 49,400 for farms in the Terai, NRs 32,730-NRs 34,460 for farns in the
Hills and NRs 57,415 for farms in SMIP III.
15. Technical Assessment:
The design of the project is based on demand-driven principle which involves farmers' participation from project
concept to implementation and takeover of O&M responsibilities. The design of the systems have been adjusted in
such a way that the WUAs will be able to manage these in an efficient and productive manner.
In the case of FMIS, the rudimentary headworks and intakes made of brushwood and direct open cut intake would be
replaced with semi-permanent structures based on improved but not sophisticated materials such as masonry work,
gabions, and other simple concrete works. In terms of distribution system improvement in FMIS, only excessive
seepage and leakage in the hill schemes would be reduced by lining and dilapidated structures replaced or
rehabilitated. No alteration or modification would be made to their well established distribution networks. Use of
simple piped conveyance system would be encouraged to avoid induced pore pressure leading to land slides. Open
cut benching canals would be avoided as much as possible and instead replaced with covered culvert or pipe outlets.
In the plains, groundwater potential will be modeled and mapped and the minimum distance between wells would be
determined.
The issue of low hydromodulus (I/s/ha) in public irrigation would be partly resolved by introducing rotational water
supply at the tertiary level. Conjunctive use through the development of shallow tubewells to irrigate clusters of
farms would be promoted at tail ends of public irrigation systems where water supply is inadequate. Frequent
fluctuations in water levels, which affect the discharge of outlets, would be reduced by the installation of composite
gates and overflow cross regulators.

The project would also intensify irrigated agriculture extension with the assistance of DOA to promote the benefits of
the green revolution to the most remote regions of Nepal. This would include the extension of improved on-farm
irrigation methods as well as the use of HYVs and increased amounts of fertilizers and pesticides. Water management
at farm level would be introduced to pilot schemes in every district of the project.
16. Institutional Assessment:
(a) Executing agencies: Coordination between implementing departments and organizations would be enhanced
through: (i) the revival of NWDC headed by the Prime Minister, and (ii) the expansion of the role of WECS
currently under MOWR as NWPU, to deal with all aspects of water development.
(b)  p ject Managemen: To avoid the excessive interference of district and village level political institutions
(DDCNillage Development Committee (VDC) during the selection and approval of schemes the project
implementation will be based on a three tier structure (i) a PIC to consolidate all project activities at the center,
(ii) PIUs at the Regional level, and (iii) DACs. This arrangement worked well under the ILC pilot program.
(c) Beneficiaries: Depending on the size and type of schemes, beneficiaries would be organized into one to four tier
WUAs. For large schemes, WUAs include: (i) Water User Groups at the lowest level, (ii) Water User
Committees at the tertiary canal level, (iii) WU Coordination Committees at the secondary canal level, and (iv)
Central Water Users Committees at the subproject level. Smaller hill schemes or tubewell schemes would have
only: (i) the Water User Groups at the watercourse level, and/or (ii) WUAs at the scheme level.
17. Social Assessment:
Women in Development (WID): The new IP mandates that WUAs must have at least 5 percent women in executive
committees. The actual average percentage under pilot ILC is about two percent. Further promotion in this area is
necessary and will be addressed by the project. A WID program now being carried out under SMIP will also be
continued.
The creation of democratically elected WUAs with clearly defined rules and regulations will help in preventing the
excessive appropriation of water by the large and powerful land holders located in the head reaches of schemes. The
use of clear selection criteria and approval process will help prevent political and other interference. Finally, the
development of a strong WUA system backed up by frequent dialogue between DIOs/District Agriculture
Development Offices and WUAs will also prevent undue interference.
However, the project will give recognition to existing water rights, and detailed discussions through WUAs will serve
to clarify these rights. Any changes in water rights will have to be agreed to prior to sub-project implementation for
greater social order and justice. Under the project, a social sector review would be carried out for every new FMIS and
the results would be attached to the corresponding feasibility study of each scheme.
Social Development Plan. Majority of the FMIS schemes are located in areas with ethnic diversity where the project
will benefit farmers of different ethnic backgrounds and different size of landholdings. The Government has
complemented the feasibility studies of NISP with a further social impact assessment for each of the ten model
subprojects and SMIP III. A report was made available for IDA's review and comments. In future, a similar review
would be carried out for every new FMIS and the results would be reflected in the final scheme design.
Economic Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons. As NISP is limited to rehabilitation of existing irrigation
systems, and is based on the demand-driven principle, there will be no involuntary resettlement. However, there will
be limited land acquisition for the SMIP III sub-component (about 382 ha, 2.5 percent of total SMIP III area), and
most, if not all, of the families affected by land acquisition will benefit from the project. According to the field survey
in the pilot area of SMIP III, there will not be any displacement of households since all the land to be acquired is

already in existing irrigable area. It was estimated that about 123 families will lose more than 25 percent of their
holdings. Irrespective of whether the system is public or FEMIS, DOI's current land acquisition policy has been
reviewed by the Bank to ensure its consistency with the Bank's policy. A detailed land acquisition plan for SMIP Im
was made available to IDA. Review and comments have been provided which were incorporated in the revised
version, and a detailed Resettlement Action Plan and Framework for the pilot area of 1,350 ha was prepared and
submitted to the Bank for review and comment In future, a similar review would be carried out for the remaining
area of SMIP-III before the construction. The agreement was covenanted in DCA.
18. Environmental Assessment:  Environmental Category      []   A  [X] B       []   C
Envirornental Impact Assessment (EIA). Majority of the FMIS schemes, particularly those in the hills, are located in
environmentally fragile areas and inadequate investigation, design and construction may lead to adverse impact. To
avoid this happening, all FMIS schemes, particularly in the hills, will be required to complete an EIA as per the
country's environmental guidelines. The PCCC will have a member representative from the Ministry of Population
and Environment to oversee implementation of policy on environmental assessment.
Recently HMGN has adopted an EIA procedure for all types of infrastructure project in the country. An EIA report
will be prepared following the procedure for every major hill rehabilitation scheme and submitted with the feasibility
report for every major sub-project. The required mitigating measures will be defined and costed and will be financed
under the project (Section 2 - Project Components). It was agreed that PEPHI program will be continued in every
NISP district in collaboration with Hill Community Forest Program with the support of the project and INGO/NGOs
involvement. The mobile irrigation team would also be strengthened with the inclusion of one environmentalist.

(a) Water Resources Strategy Formulation. The strategy will be approved at the highest level of the Government.
Public consensus building including political commitment would be sought at every phase of the strategy
formulation. For example, a public seminar was held in April 1997 to discuss development issues and formulate
an appropriate plan for the development strategy under the project. The NWDC Council chaired by the Prime
Minister will be revived to approve the Consolidated Water Policy.
(b) Irrigation Schemes. The project will apply a participatory approach to the rehabilitation and construction of each
and every irrigation schemes to be financed under the project. Throughout the project cycle farmers will
participate through their WUAs. In addition, the concerned VDC and DDC will be informed for all FMIS and
small and medium turned-over and JM schemes. For SMIP-III, a separate Irrigation Development Board has
been in existence.
20. Sustainability:
HMGN's current level of subsidy in private (FMIS), as well as public irrigation schemes is not sustainable in view of the
Government's limited financial resources. For that a separate subsidy study has been proposed in the project to analyze
the HMGN's fiscal sustainability. Likewise another study funded under the project will review HMGN's O&M policy
and water charges. A risk analysis has been made for possible aspects that can affect to the sustainability of the project in
medium term and are discussed in details in section 13 and in Annex 4.

Furthermore, the infrastructure created or rehabilitated under the project is expected to be much more viable and
sustainable than the earlier type of investments in the irrigation sector in view of the participatory approach followed
under the project. Experience in the pilot ILC proves that the WUAs concept will also become viable and sustainable as
they follow the traditional concept of village irrigation schemes which has existed since time immemorial in Nepal.
Through the participatory approach, fanners are expected to develop a higher sense of ownership and protect the
infrastructure to which they contributed either cash or labor.

minimized by the participatory approach which will be reviewed under the subsidy study.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
No major controversial aspects are expected on the physical implementation of the project as these are all
rehabilitation schemes which are to be implemented in consultation with the majority of farmers. However, some
controversial ideas could arise in finalizing the water resources policy and the water and enviromnent management
plans which are sensitive issues in Nepal. Reduction of state subsidy and water charges may also prove to be
controversial due to political sensitivity.

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
1.    The proposed project to be implemented over a five year period will comprise the following
components:
A. Project Component 1. Development of Comprehensive Water Resources Strategy and
Consolidated Policies and Plan (US$1. 43 million)
2.    The component would be implemented by MOWR under the guidance of a NSC constituted for
this purpose. The NSC would establish a core technical unit or reorganize the existing WECS to form a
National Water Planning Unit (NWPU), which would carry out the task with the assistance of
international and local consulting teams.
3.    The task is divided in two stages: Phase I. completed during the project preparation, considered
the national goals and assessed the water resources and potentialities; defined the opportunities and
constraints affecting their development; and identified major issues requiring attention and action. Phase
II would define practical options to address the prioritized issues of Phase I, and recommend a
comprehensive strategy for implementing the optimal development. Completion of the Phase II Strategy
Formulation is planned under the NISP.  The details are provided in the borrower's Project
Implementation Plan and the implementation schedule of the Phase II strategy formulation is shown in
Attachment I of this annex.
Al. Formulation of Water Resources Strategy and Development of Consolidated Policy (US$1.32 M!.
4.    This sub-component would finance technical assistance for the Phase II strategy formulation. To
facilitate budgetary management, the task would be carried out by the core NWPU. The NWPU will
comprise a group of professional staff appointed by the Government, attached permanently either to a
central governmental organization or to the existing NSC chaired by the Member of the National
Planning Commission. A new NWPU can either be established or the existing WECS reorganized into
an NWPU no later than December 31, 1997 to cover the whole scope of the water sector. It is ultimately
aimed that the unit be attached to the National Water Development Council chaired by the Prime
Minister.
5.    The national consulting team will consist of about 220 person-months to cover an inter-
disciplinary expertise in the fields of hydrology, engineering (civil, irrigation, environmental, water and
energy systems, river management), hydrogeology, geology, economics (agricultural, energy and macro),
regional planners, morphology, environment, information systems, geography, legal (resource law,
international law), agronomy, rural sociology, political science, and business/finance. Until funding by
an international donor of this sub-component is arranged, HMGN has agreed to use the credit for the
consultancy services. The consulting team will then be recruited in accordance with IDA guidelines.

6.    An expatriate consulting team would assist the national consulting team in seeking technical
solutions. The team will comprise a small group of 8 to 10 expatriate personnel for about 35 mm and
will be headed by an expatriate team leader/cum Water Resources Planner. The team's major
responsibility is to bring in international experience in integrated water resources planning and
management and to help develop the framework for policy and development strategy for water resources.
The team leader shall be an internationally recognized senior expert on water resources planning. Other
members will be experts in key areas of expertise to support national members. The services of these
experts would be on an intermittent basis. Short-term consultants on some specific areas (e.g. resource
economic, financing, energy pricing, information systems, institutional specialist, river basin planning
etc.) would also be used as and when required.
7.    The detailed TOR is attached to the Borrower's (PIP) Attachment 1. General scope of the study
and methodology include the preparation of exhaustive studies and basin planning covering, but not
limited to, the following:
*   review of sectoral goals to ascertain their adequacy and appropriateness in achieving the
national objectives as defined in the 20-year development perspective outlined in the Ninth
Plan Approach Paper;
*   assessment of sectoral goals in contributing towards water resources development as"an
engine of economic growth";
*   examination and analysis of forward and backward linkages of water resources development
in their specific uses for integration of sectoral goals, policies and priorities into the overall
development;
*   assessment of contribution of water resources in their specific use to economy in terms of
overall GDP growth or sectoral GDP growth;
*   identification of stakeholders and mechanisms for their effective participation at appropriate
levels of policy formulation, decision-making, implementation and feedback systems;
*   suggestion for rationalization of regulatory instruments and institutions, if needed, to ensure
implementation of national and sectoral objectives and policies in a consistent and effective
manner;
*   incorporation of new sectoral components such as the export of hydropower;
*   assessment of changes or improvements required to implement the suggested options -
technical, legal, administrative, financial, institutional, environmental - with reference to the
specific policies adopted by the Government;
*   adoption of a river basin approach to water resources planning and management while
examining issues and assessing options.
8.    The Study would be completed over a 27-month period. However, the target should be to get the
bulk of the development completed within 24 months and to use the remaining 3 months for formulation
of the National Water Plan. Around the end of 19 months, there should be a workshop, hosted by the

National Steering Committee, presenting the framework models of the system and initiating discussion
within the Government of the National Water Strategy and Water Plan.
9.    In addition, the component would finance special studies to revise sub-sector policies, (Water
Resources Acts, Irrigation Regulation 2050, Irrigation Policy 1992 (revised 1997), Hydropower
Development Policy 1992, Water Supply Policy, Industrial Waste Water Acts, etc.) and Regulations to
ensure their compatibility and consistency with the developed comprehensive strategy.  This
component would also finance (i) a review of HMGN's subsidy policy for investment in irrigation
development with a view to gradually tapering-off over time, and (ii) a review of O&M requirement in
different public irrigation systems and its associated water charges to cover full O&M in light of joint
management of the systems with beneficiary farmers. The detailed TORs for the subsidy study and
O&M studies are given in the PIP Attachment 6, Annexes C and D.
A2. Institutional Support to NWPU (US$0.11 M).
10.   This sub-component would assist MOWR and NSC to finance (a) the establishment of a
permanent central NWPU; (b) the procurement of support office logistics and transport facilities for
NWPU's office; (c) the acquisition of computers and planning tools such as GIS and river basin
economic decision modeling; and (c) miscellaneous expenses for printing and publishing of revised acts
and regulations.
II.   It was agreed that HMGN would have the prerogative to use any bilateral grant or aid funding, if
it becomes available in the course of project implementation, to finance this component . HMGN has
agreed to inform IDA by no later than June 30, 1998 about availability of co-financing of the strategy
formulation by bilateral donars. At the completion of the component, Nepal will have a permanent
NWPU supporting the National Water Development Council (chaired by the Prime Minister) in water
resources planning, budgeting and management.
D. Project Component 2 - Irrigation Sector Improvement and Development Component on
59,600 ha: US$83.63 million (total cost of component).
12.   This component consists of specific investments included in the overall application of IIMGN's
irrigation policy. To improve productivity and sustainability, HMGN promulgated a new IP in 1988
which was revised twice in the last nine years, i.e., in 1992 and in 1997. The IP focuses on improving
irrigation development and management based on "participatory approach" of local initiatives and active
participation of WUAs. The practicality of IP in private farmer-managed irrigation schemes has been
tested satisfactorily by an on-going ILC pilot project since the promulgation of the IP. Likewise, the
practicality of joint management policy (joint management by WUAs and project authority ) in public
irrigation schemes has been piloted successfully in the completed Mahakali Irrigation I Project (Cr.
1055) and Sunsari Morang Irrigation II Project (SMIP-II - Cr. 1814).
13.   To date, 300 small and medium surface irrigation schemes on about 33,260 ha and 217 medium
and deep tubewells in 18 clusters covering about 4210 ha, have been completed successfully under the
ILC Pilot Project. Based on the successful pilot experience, NISP would continue financing viable
private and public irrigation subprojects as a first stand alone project under the sector investment.
Subprojects would be considered eligible for funding under NISP based on the written demand and
financial commitment for investment cost sharing by beneficiary farmers as outlined in the IP (see
Attachment 2). Viability will however be assessed based on specific technical, economic, social, and
environmental merits and criteria.

Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                            Annex 2
The component will consist of the following types of sub-projects:
B 1. Rehabilitation, Improvement and Development of Small- and Medium-scale Farner-owned
and Managed Irrigation Schemes (FMIS) - 39.500 ha (US$ 38.81 M).
14.   The component would comprise of the following sub-projects to be implemented based on the
"demand-driven" principle as outlined in the IP:
*   rehabilitation of FMIS covering about 31,500 ha fed by surface water, estimated at 11,500
ha in the hills and 20,000 ha in the Terai, involving both major and minor rehabilitation
works;
*   rehabilitation of existing shallow and deep groundwater tubewell systems covering about
500 ha (250 ha each);
*   development of about 7,500 ha of new shallow and deep groundwater tubewells (2950 and
4550 ha respectively).
Out of the above areas, some 21,144 ha of surface water and 851 ha of groundwater systems which are
currently being implemented under the on-going ILC pilot program (total about 68% of sub-component
BI) will be carried-over for completion under NISP. Details of the carry-over sub-projects from ILC to
NISP are given in Attachment 3.
15.   The component would finance:
*   rehabilitation and modernization of temporary headworks and intake structures. The
headworks and related structures are often built by farmers in such a rudimentary manner
that these structures are vulnerable to destructive torrents experienced in rivers of Nepal;
* repairs of main and secondary canals in cases of excessive leakage, and conveyance system
structures such as flumes, culverts, outlets, spillways, etc. of viable FMIS fed by surface
water;
*   rehabilitation of clustered tube-well schemes fed by ground water; and
*   development of new clustered tube-well schemes fed by ground water.
All rehabilitation works to be financed are those beyond the beneficiary farmers' technical and financial
capacity to implement on their own. The existing ad-hoc water user groups would be legalized as
registered WUAs at each FMIS implemented under the project.

B2, System Improvement and Turn-over to Farmers (SIFT) of Public Irrigation Systems 20.100 ha
(US$ 40.65 m!
16.    This component would finance:
(a) improvement, rehabilitation and turn-over of 15,100 ha of Sunsari Morang Iffigalion
Phase III (SMIP-III) (US$39.12 m); and
(b) 5.000 ha of fully or partially turned-over (TO) small and medium public irrigation systems
(US$ 1.53M) within the three Western Regions of Nepal after reaching agreements with
fanners to take over the systems after improvement. The rehabilitation and improvement are
of a similar nature to FMIS under this category. Fully TO subcomponent will comprise of
500 ha in hills surface schemes, 1500 ha in Terai surface schemes and 500 ha in groundwater
DTW and joint management of medium sized public irrigation covering 2500 ha in the
hillsand the Terai. The schemes are to be identified based on written demand and financial
commitment from farmers.
17.   SMIPJIII . This sub-component would finance rehabilitation and improvement of the third phase
Sunsari Morang System. This is a continuation of the Bank-funded Sunsari Morang Irrigation II project
(Cr. 1814-NEP completed successfully in March 1995). This sub-component would comprise of:
*   improvement and rehabilitation of the main canal of the Sunsari Morang Irrigation System
beyond the completed Sunsari Morang II area
*   rehabilitation and modernization of secondary canals and related structures, drains and
inspection road networks
*   development of distribution networks through construction of sub-secondary, tertiary and
water course canal systems
*   construction of 5.5km of the Kosi River Eastern flood embankment
*   technical and institutional capacity-building in project implementation and O&M to staff
and beneficiary WUAs
*   works and infrastructure necessary for proper O&M of the developed system
More details about the SMIP-III sub-project is provided in Attachment 4.
18.   Other Turn-over schemes. Improvement of small, medium, and large public irrigation schemes
with technical deficiencies, and turnover of full or part of the schemes to the beneficiaries. Thiswill
improve the system management, relieve public resources on O&M liability and induce a sense of
ownership. Beneficiaries will participate in the design and construction of tertiary canal units which in
most cases are missing in the original systems under joint management schemes like SMIP-III. The IP
mandates that, after reaching agreement with beneficiaries, larger public schemes (over 2000 ha in the
Terai and over 500 ha in the Hills) will be jointly managed by WUAs and DOI (Participatory Joint
Management - PJM) and smaller public irrigation schemes, are to be totally turned-over to the
beneficiary farmers.

B3. Infrastructure Support Development for FMIS and TO schemes in the three Western Regions (US$
3.11 M).
19.    This component would finance other infrastructure support to be carried out in the FMIS areas
such as:
*   construction of farm roads for Terai FMIS and groundwater schemes and trail
improvements for hill FMIS on the basis of beneficiaries' demand and project viability on
the basis of specific criteria.at the feasibility study stage. An estimate of some 45 Km will
be financed under the project;
*   construction of river protection works where FMIS and TO sub-project river intake sites are
threatened, or command areas are under attack through river erosion;
* construction of environmental protection works to stabilize hill slopes, canal alignments,
improve drainage, etc., associated with FMIS and TO sub-projects. Initial Environmental
Examinations (IEE) will be incorporated in each sub-project's feasibility report to identify
the mitigation measures required, and ascertain if a more comprehensive environmental
impact assessment is required;
* mechanical workshops at Biratnagar and Bhairahwa for maintenance and operation of heavy
and mechanical equipment under different projects of DOI, provision pf tools, spares and
equipment and continued support to SMBHP dredger operations;
*   construction of rural drinking water supply schemes on the basis of beneficiaries' demand
and financial commitment and project viability at the feasibility study stage, particularly for
hill FMIS and TO sub-projects where the participatory principle is applicable. An estimate
of some 15,000 people within NISP areas are to benefit;
*   construction of localized micro-hydropower where the topography and site conditions are
appropriate within hill FMIS sub-projects, based on the participatory principles,
beneficiaries' demand and project viability at the feasibility study stage. An estimate of 300
kw will be newly generated within NISP areas;
*   construction or extension of Regional and District Irrigation Offices (12 Nos).
Derivation of Costs of model sub-projects for FMIS, TO and PJM
20.    As the project is demand-based, it is difficult to predict in advance the type of sub-projects that
will be implementated. Therefore cost estimates of the project were based on different types of model
sub-projects, and their costs were applied to the potential NISP sub-projects. The costs include civil
works and other ancillary support works for surface sub-projects in Terai and Hills under major and
minor rehabilitation,' groundwater in Terai under STW and DTW, as well as TO and PJM of surface sub-
projects. The costs of the irrigation system for the selected model sub-projects were identified and
estimated on the basis of actual requirements. The typical cost estimates of irrigation system were
prepared from the costs of model sub-projects andapplied to the potential sub-projects. The cost
estimates of the appraised 12 model sub-projects are summarized in Annex No 3. Based on the model



Project Appraisal Document                                                    Page 34
Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                              Annex 2
sub-project costs, the cost estimates of the various components of the irrigation infrastructure
development were derived. The per hectare costs of irrigation system rehabilitation works were applied
to alternative sub-project areas, for assessing the best combination of types of sub-projects.
21.   Costs of improvements to Sunsari Morang III sub-project were derived from the detailed
feasibility study of the project. The cost estimates of the sub-projects were prepared for a total area of
59,600 ha (including SMIP-III).
22.   Other ancillary costs were included based on percentages of the project base costs for
rehabilitating irrigation systems. The costs of rural farm roads, river training, environmental protection,
micro-hydropower, and drinking water supply facilities were estimated in the same manner. The costs
for planning, feasibility study, detailed design and supervision of irrigation system rehabilitation and
other project related civil works were estimated at three percent of the total civil works cost. Provision
was made for recurrent support costs for DOI and DOA during the five-year implementation period at
NRs. 320/ha/year, based on the past expenditures. The incremental O&M costs were taken at NRs. 950
per hectare per year for the surface sub-projects, NRs. 2,45 1/ha/year for STW and NRs. 1,739/ha/year for
DTW, based on the results of the model sub-project studies. The project base costs (including SMIP-III),
for the irrigation infrastructure development component, were estimated at NRs 4,048.0 million.
C. Project Component 3 - Institutional Strengthening US$17.96 million (total cost of the component)
23.   This component would finance institutional strengthening and development to ensure
achievement of the objectives of the project is met. It would finance consulting services for the project
implementation, training, investigation and studies for investments, buildings, equipment and vehicles,
and limited incremental O&M and staff support to the following implementing agencies of the project.
Cost estimates for this component were derived from actual requirement for consultancy services, goods
and materials, and training and studies.
(a) Department of Irrigation (DOI) (US$9.55 million):
DOI will have primary responsibility for implementing the project's infrastructure development.
To support this component the project would finance institutional strengthening of DOI by
providing:
*   foreign and local consultants to assist in the design and supervision of the NISP
implementation and to monitor quality control. A total of 60 and 343 manmonths
respectively for international and national consultants will be required over the full
five year period of the project
*   funds for training at the central, regional, district and sub-project levels, with the
supply of associated equipment, machinery and vehicles to make it effective
*   groundwater monitoring works in 8 districts involving investment costs for shallow
(100 Nos) and deep (14 Nos) investigation bore holes, rehabilitation of investment
in DTW (20 Nos) and STW (50 Nos) associated geohydrological survey equipment,
training of operatives and recurrent costs for staff and machinery O&M,
procurement of a drilling rig with supplemental machine and equipment.

Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                            Annex 2
*   on-farm water management activities on a pilot basis within completed FMIS (to
cover at least 10 percent of the developed area) in selected districts of NISP, to
expand crop intensification. Included will be separate foreign and local consulting
services, training, provision of vehicles and recurrent staff and operation costs
*   studies to determine the optimum level of O&M requirements for different public
irrigation systems prior to and after handing over parts of the system to the
beneficiaries, the funding requirement to achieve this optimum level, and the
appropriate level of water charges to be implemented
*   a subsidy study to assessHMGN's financial burdenes and the capacity of the
beneficiaries to pay in accordance with an agreed plan to reduce the subsidy over
time to 50 percent
*   funds for improving the management information system within the central and
regional offices through procurement of computers, software and hardware and
training of staff.
(b) Private Sector Strengthening (WUAs, NGOs and CBOs) (US$0.86 million):
The project would finance training of selected regional and district staff and WUAs, NGOs, and
CBOs in such topics as NISP principles and procedures, systems O&M, participatory
environmental protection in hill irrigation (PEPHI), irrigated water management, farmer
organization, financial management, credit accessing, and marketing. Training will be based on
a program designed by the project consultants in collaboration with DOI's Human Resources
Development Training Branch, DOA's Regional Training Center, ADBN, FAO/CP special
program and on going program for PEPH[.
(c) Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) (US$5.52 million)::
DHM  is the country's sole agency for-hydro-meteorological data collection, collation, and
management. Currently, DHM is operating with sub-optimal facilities and a number of
observation sites. The project would finance institutional strengthening in data collection,
collation and dissemination functions, support the strengthening of DHM's data collection
networks formed under basin-wise boundary, and basin-wise resources inventory planning in
about 77 sub-basins (within three of the four major country river basins) covered in the three
western development regions.
(d) Department of Agriculture (DOA) (US$2.03 million):
The project would provide limited support to DOA's intensified efforts to strengthen district
DOA's capacity for preparation and appraisal of NISP schemes and extend specific agricultural
training services to NISP irrigated areas which are not immediately covered by the recently
approved Agricultural Research, and Extension Project ( AREP). The project would include the
provision of improved planting materials, field trials, demonstrations, training, and purchase of
vehicles (8 Nos), motorcycles (26 Nos) and bicycles (10 Nos).

Implementation Arrangements
(a) Organizational functions of the project
24.    Except for the Water Resources Strategy (WRS) and Integrated Water Resources Policy
Development component which will be implemented under the overall guidance of NPC and the
administrative responsibility of MOWR, DOI, DOA and DHM will implement their component of the
project.
25.   The Irrigation Sector Infrastructure Improvement and Development component and some of the
sub-components under Institutional Strengthening and Development will closely involve the
beneficiaries organizations (men & women farmers) in project implementation with assistance from
CBOs/NGOs. The district level offices of DOI and DOA will be accountable and responsible for project
requirements and implementation. Under District Agricultural Development Officers (DADO), the
subject matter specialist (SMS) and JT/JTAs of Agriculture Service Centers and Sub-Centers
(ASCs/ASSCs) working at village level will be the key players in irrigated agriculture extension
activities, whereas the irrigation engineers, Overseers and Association Organizers under DIO will be the
main actors for project preparation, design and rehabilitation and construction of sub-projects. The
administrative and supervisory control will be under the organizational and managerial set-up of the
implementing agencies through their regional offices.
(b) Participating Agencies
26.   The Water Resources Strategy and Integrated Water Policy Development (WRSF) component
will be implemented by a NWPU to be established by MOWR under the guidance of NSC of NPC. The
credit funds would be handled by MOWR.
27.   MOWR would have overall responsibility for guiding and directing the implementation of
project activities under DOI and SMIP-HI. Hydrological networks and water resources inventory
planning will be implemented by DHM under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MST), and
irrigated agriculture development activities will be implemented by DOA under MOA.
28.   The SMIP-III sub-project will be implemented by the existing SMIP Board under the overall
technical guidance of DOI. The role of SMIP Board infostering PJM will be limited to taking
expeditious decisions related to procurement of ICB, LCB, etc and other project management matters.
The RD/DOI of the eastern region will be consulted on who will be responsible for monitoring and will
facilitate coordination with other regional offices, mainly Regional Agriculture Directorate.
29.   Implementation of FMIS and TO sub-projects would under the guidance of the relevant divisions
of DOI through RIDs, DIOs, GWFOs and/or through other project offices where appropriate. It is not
envisaged that GWDB will be involved in the projects' management. If consultation with the Board is
required, it will be done by DDG of GWD/DOI.
30.   A PCO would be set up in DOI under the direct supervision of a Project Coordinator (PC). Full
time coordinators of major components will assist the PCO in all project matters related to their
respective components. The PC would be responsible for compiling the progress reports and project
accounts of all the activities under the project.

Nepal Irigation Sector Project                                             Annex 2
31.   Hydrological studies including water resources data and monitoring (basin/sub-basin studies)
would be implemented by DHM in close consultation with the Planning, Design Monitoring &
Evaluation Branch of DOI which would function as co-implementing agency. The agricultural extension
services and related training and other agricultural support required, i.e. sub-project preparation, base-
line data collection, BME etc., would be provided by the DOA through their existing RADs & DADOs in
close co-ordination with RIDs, DIOs/GWFOs. The DOA will function as co-implementing agency for
agricultural extension and related activities.
32.   The NISP organization chart is shown in Attachment 5. The functions of the various committees
and implementing units are spelt out in the PIP and briefly described below:
(i) Project Central Co-ordination Committee (PCCC)
To liaise between project executing agencies and relevant Government agencies, an apex Project
PCCC would be set up under the chairmanship of the Secretary, MOWR, and will include
representatives from NPC, MOA, MOF, MOPE, MST, and the Directors-General (DGS) of
implementing departments such as DOI, DHM, DOA. The PCCC will coordinate inter-
ministerial and inter-departmental project activities relating to policy, budget and major
procurement issues. The DG, DOI as Chairman of PIC, will function as secretary of PCCC
assisted by PCO.
(ii) Project Implementation Committee (PIC)
For implementing the project components a PIC would be set up under the chairmanship of DG
of DOI. Its members will consist of the DDGs/DGMs of the concerned divisions of the
implementing departments along with representatives from ADBN and AIC. This committee
will be responsible for assuring inter-departmental regional offices coordination on matters
related to budget preparation, disbursement compilation, progress reporting, and other project
management related matters. The PC will function as the secretary of this PIC.
- Project Co-ordination Office (PCO)
To assist the PIC, DOI at the center would establish a PCO headed by a full time senior first
class officer, the PC. The PC would be staffed with representatives from implementing
departments and a technical assistance team (the Consultants). The PC would be a senior
qualified and experienced individual, capable of co-ordinating a vast number of activities in the
three regions. The PCO will be the focal and contact point for all purposes, inter-alia the Bank,
other donors and associated visiting missionsand will be responsible for compiling project
accounts, expenditures, withdrawal applications, progress reports and audit reports of all the
components of NISP. However, consolidated withdrawal applications, will be preparedby the
concerned Project Managers (PMs). The PCO will function in close consultation with relevant
divisions of DOI and would maintain regular linkages with them and co-ordination with other
implementing agencies.
A team of expatriate and national consultants will assist the PC in the implementation of the
project's components in accordance to the PAD. The PC will be responsible for all matters
related to procurement of goods and services and will be guided by the World Bank's
procurement guidelines. This PCO will serve as a secretariat of the PIC for its meetings and
transmission of its decisions.



Project Appraisal Document                                                  Page 38
Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                            Annex 2
For the SMIP-IHl sub-project, the PC of the SMIP project team will be responsible for
maintaining separate project accounts, timely progress reporting, and submission of audit reports
and withdrawals applications.. The PM of SMIP-III will function as PC of this sub-project.
Similarly DHM and DOA will be resonsible for maintaining separate project accounts, timely
progwess reporting, and submission of audit reports and withdrawal applications of their
respective components.
(iii) Project Implementation Units (PIU) and Regional Appraisal and Approval Committee
(RAAC)
PIUs would be established in each of the three Western regions. Its project activities would be
coordinated by the Regional Irrigation Director (RID), who will be designated Project Manager
of NISP. PIU membership will include the Regional Agriculture Director (RAD), the Director
of National Planning Commission (Regional Office), the Regional Controller of ADBN and a
representative of the regional office of DHM. The PIU will also serve as RAAC and as such
may invite other relevant officials of regional/zonal level offices in the locality of the RID. This
is deemed essential in order to establish good linkages and to assure their support at the required
stages of the sub-project development.
The main responsibility of the RAAC will be to appraise sub-projects that have been
submitted by the DIOs/GWFOsafter scrutiny by MIT. The RAAC members should
review and approve those aspects of the sub-project relevant to their area of expertise.
Each member will provide written comments and recommendation separately. The
RAAC members will in particular:
*   appraise and approve sub-projects of a minor rehabilitation type costing up
to Rs. 1.0 million as defined in the PAD.
*   appraise and recommend to DG/DOI for approval all those sub-projects of
major rehab type or deep tubewell clusters and those costing above the limit
mentioned above.
The individual TOR of members of the RAAC responsible for implementing respective
components of NISP are provided in the PIP.
Administrative Arrangements
33.   Project implementation would require proper management and administration. The deployment
and redeployment of staff and personnel would follow the normal administrative and financial rules and
staff regulations of HMGN, but would need to abide by agreed legal covenants spelt out in the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) between the Bank and the Borrower (HMGN). The roles and
responsibilities of implementing agencies and entities have already been discussed in detail in the PIP. It
should be emphasized that for project-related procurement and disbursement, the Bank's procurement
and disbursement guidelines should take precedence over rules and regulations followed by accounts
staff deployed by the FCGO. In this regard, it is important that knowledge and skill in withdrawal
application and accounts keeping need to be imparted to the designated accounts staff. It will also be
critical for project accounts staff to be in place for the full term of the project and that they should be
responsible to the implementing units and officials for timely submission of withdrawal applications.



Project Appraisal Document                                                 Page 39
Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                            Annex 2
Similarly engineers who will be trained in sub-project implementation based on NISP principles and
procedures need to be in position for their full term as per administrative rules and staff regulations.
Frequent transfers have hampered progress in the past.
Implementation Plan
(a) Time bound detailed implementation plan
34.   The proposed project will be implemented over a five-year period. In the first year, completion
ofsub-projects carried-over from the ILC will be continued, along with the preparatory work of selection,
identification and feasibility studies for new pipe-line sub-projects in accordance with the guidelines for
NISP implementation. Appointment of consultants, as well as procurement of equipment and vehicles
and other logistic supports required for the effective implementation of the project, particularly for first
year requirement, will be completed during the first year of the project as per the procedures specified by
the World Bank guidelines.
35.   Based on the overall implementation schedule (ref. Borrower's PIP Attachments 9 and 10), the
estimated annual project expenditure, including physical and price contingencies are summarized below.

Implementation Schedule
36.   The NISP components are to be implemented over five years. Implementation of FMIS sub-
projects would normally be completed in two consecutive years after completion ofall the preparatory
works, including WUA's organization. For budget programming purposes, construction works of FMIS
would not normally be scheduled in the first year except where the WJUAs are already organized and
have fulfilled their financial commitment and the DIO has prepared and received approved detailed
designs. Typical implementation schedule for Surface Water (minor & major rehab) and Groundwater
schemes are shown in Attachments 6, 7 and 8.
Stages of Implementation
37.   Each Sub-Project (schemes) under NISP will be implemented in the following stages. Quality
has to be assured at all the stages. The process should strictly follow IP 1997 in general, and in
accordance with the Procedural Guidelines for Surface Water and Groundwater Irrigation Schemes
(Attachment 9) prepared by ILC TA Team, in particular, for the following stages of implementation.
(i)    Pre-construction stage

Works
39.   The works related to the improvement/rehabilitation of FMIS and construction of Groundwater
schemes are civil works in nature. The number and types of sub-projects are still not fixed as this would
depend upon the demand of the farmers. It is anticipated that there will be almost 390 sub-projects in the
three regions. The works will be very small in nature, scattered in several districts of the three regions
and scheduled at various times over the five years. Therefore these works have to be executed through
NCB procedures and wherever possible by the beneficiary groups. The works would consist mainly of
diversion structures, water conveyance structures, canal excavation, canal linings, retaining walls and
many other rehabilitation works required for irrigation systems, farm roads, river training, tubewell
drilling, pump house, pumping installations, environmental protection measures, drinking water, micro-
hydropower generation, etc. There may be some instances where works are situated in remote
locationswhich may require that theworks are executed on a piece meal basis or by awarding the works
contract on the basis of three quotations.
40.   The works under SMIP-III would be divided into ICB and NCB and Farmers' contribution
portions. The ICB works would be related to major works for rehabilitation of main, secondary and sub-
secondary or tertiary canals and related structures. The water course networks each covering 28 ha to30
ha and below would be carried out by NCB contractors (procurement package are to be planned after
obtaining farmers' agreement and final design in the course of implementation) up to filling of earth
formation and construction of related structures. The farmers have to contribute their land for the water
course constructions free of cost and participate in box cutting of the earth formation. Experience in the
other projects (Mahakali Stage II, Bhairawa-Lumbini III) would be tested in the pilot area (1350 ha) in
the first year. Based on that outcome, the remaining area would be developed in the following years.
Goods
41.   The goods to be procured under the project include vehicles, equipment, machinery and office
equipment and accessories. These will be procured through ICB, NCB, LIB and local shopping
procedures.
Studies, Training and Services
42.   All Consultants required for studies, training and other services under the different project
components will be selected and appointed by the implementing agencies according to IDA guidelines.

Nepal Irigation Sector Project                                            Annex 2
Technical Assistance
43.   Consultant services totalling US$ 11.5 million I will be required toto assist MOWR, DOI and
DHM in implementing the project. This would include both long term and short term expatriate and
local consultants. Agreed TA staffing schedule is provided in the PIP.
Contract Review
44.   The details of the various expenditure categories' threshold for different procurement methods
and limits that required standard IDA previews are provided in Annex 6 - Procurement and Disbursement
Arrangement for sub-project preparation, hydrological studies, other studies, standard contracts for use
with prequalified consultant frms will be based on agreed terms of reference and contract documents
and will be pre-approved by IDA. Standards and Procedures specified in the Bank's "Guidelines for
Procurement" will be followed. HMGN has developed standard ICB and LCB bidding documents for
works and goods. These documents have been agreed with IDA. These will be used for procurement as
well as for executing works. Standard IDA procurement preference will be given to domestic contractors
and manufacturers when ICB procedures are to be used.
Detailed Schedule of Disbursement of each component
45.   The different components of NISP are planned to be implemented during the project period as
explained above in section-I of this chapter. Based on the time-bound detailed implementation plan,
annual expenditures required have been worked out and shownAnnex 6 Table A.
Project Accounting and Financial Management
Accounts and Audits
46.   To facilitate disbursements IDA will establish a Special Account (SA) of (US$ 3.00 million) in
the Nepal Rastra Bank after the Credit is declared effective. The funds from the SA will be used for
project expenditures to the greatest extent possible. Expenditures less than US$ 300,000 equivalent, both
foreign and local, under all categories for the project implementation, will be financed through this
account. All other expenditures above US$ 300,000, may either be submitted directly to IDA for direct
payment or may may be paid from the Special Account. All expenditures from the Special Account will
be promptly reported to IDA.
47.   The Auditor General of Nepal is responsible for auditing all accounts. All accounts will be
maintained according to sound accounting principles and audited according to appropriate auditing
standards and principles consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to the Association. For
NISP implementation, DOI, DHM and DOA will maintain separate records and accounts for all project
expenditures, by individual project component and subcomponent, and in accordance with appropriate
accounting principles. PCO will furnish to IDA the consolidated report on the Special Account, audited
by an independent auditor appointed by Auditor General of Nepal and acceptable to IDA in accordance
with accepted auditing standards. PCO will compile and forward to IDA such accounts, together with the
auditor's reports, within 9 months after the end of each fiscal year. The report will also include separate
opinion from the auditor as to whether the disbursements made on the basis of statements of expenditure
were for goods and services received and incurred for the purpose and scope of the project. Agreement
was obtained at the Negotiations that during project implementation, the Borrower would submit

periodic Financial Management Reports(FMR) every four months during the fiscal year. The
FMR consists of: (a) Financial Statements of the Project; (b) Project Progress; and (c)
Procurement Management Reports. PCO will also furnish to IDA such other information concerning
audits and accounts as IDA shall from time to time reasonably request, including unaudited project
accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year, duly certified by an independent auditor as to their
accuracy and authenticity within six months after the end of each fiscal year.
Monitoring and Evaluation
48.   Given the specific objective of developing efficient irrigation systems through participatory
approach and providing agricultural extension to the newly-irrigated areas with active involvement of
beneficiary farmers, and in order to continuously upgrade technical skills and management capabilities
of project staff, a scientific system of M&E needs to be established under the project. Such a system
must incorporate all the key processes, input and output indicators, and impact evaluation parameters for
monitoring progress in achieving project development objectives. The following paragraphs briefly
describe this process.
49.   The project would attempt to design an M&E system that would enhance the M&E tools
currently adopted by the implementing agencies, and the institutional arrangements presently operating
under them. The ultimate aim of the M&E system to be installed under NISP should be to increase the
opportunity to maintain continuity of the M&E process that would be sustainable in the Nepalese
context.
50.   For monitoring at program level, efforts will be made to increase the effectiveness of the role of
DADOs which will monitor the project activities of ASCs/ASSCs from the-Sub-Projects feasibility at
preconstruction stage and extension activities at post construction stage. Similarly the project will also
emphasize building the capacity of the DIOs to supervise and guide WUAs in the O&M of their
improved system and water management at farm level.
51.   To further support program level monitoring, the roles of Regional Agriculture Directorates
(RAD), and that of Regional Irrigation Directorates (RIDs) will be clearly defined. Under the
chairmanship of RAD a regional PBME committee will be setup to continuously monitor the impact
evaluation of completed NISP/ILC Sub-Projects. Required budget would be provided in the concerned
DADOs along with the budget for extension activities for the completed Sub-Projects.
52.   The M&E section under RIDs would monitor the progress of ongoing activities under the
DIOs/GWFOs and would assist them in the performance evaluation of completed physical facilities at
O&M stage. The DIOs would provide technical guidance to WUAs in the O&M of their completed
systems.
53.   At the Central level the PIC will be involved in monitoring. The roles of the different
implementing units and agencies in this regard will complement each other. The M&E divisions of DOI
and DOA will keep track of the progress made by the project. The PIC may direct any division of either
department (DOI and DOA) to carry out special studies to measure the impact of the project.
54.   Within their overall monitoring framework and on the basis of indicators identified for the
assessment of project progress, DIO, DOA and DHM will supervise and monitor their respective
activities. They will also take initiatives to carry out needed evaluation studies.

55.    The PCO will have a central role to play as far as M&E functions are concerned. It will drive all
the involved agencies to timely and properly monitor project activities as planned and safeguard project
interest using the indicators identified for the project impact monitoring. The PCO will also be mainly
responsible of preparing periodical and annual reports of programs and expenditures. It will be fully
involved in the mid-term review of the project.
56.   Thetools that will be used for M&E at different levels would be as follows:
-      Semi annual/annual reports by DOI, DOA & DHM
-      Financial Management Reports
-      Audited annual financial reports
-      Review Meeting reports
-      Observation & supervision tour reports
-      Evaluation studies reports.

NEPAL - SUNSARI MORANG IRRIGATION III SUB-PROJECT
Backgwund
1.    The Sunsari Morang Irrigation System is the largest public irrigation system in the eastern region of
Nepal. The Sub-project diverts water from the Kosi River and commands a net irrigable area of about
68,000 ha. The NRs 200 million worth of construction of the Sunsari Morang Irrigation System was started
in 1964 by the Government of India (GOI) in accord with the Kosi Sub-project Agreement of 1954 between
the GOI and the HMGN'. After trial operations starting in 1970, the Sub-project works were handed over
to the HMGN in 1975. The original distribution system terminated at turnouts serving areas of over 200 ha
(minor canals) and typically over 100 farmers. The lack of minor distribution networks below these
turnouts of 200 ha meant the system was inefficient and could not irrigate the whole command area. Water
distribution was unreliable and inequitable.
2.     From inception, the Sub-project faced a massive siltation problem because the Kosi River carries a
heavy load of sediment during the flood season. Hence, significant amounts of sediment settled in the
newly opened canal systems and reduced their water carrying capacities to almost half in an irrigation
season. The rate of siltation outpaced cleaning of watercourses by farmers. As a result of these
deficiencies, the Sub-project did not fulfill its objectives and in 1975, HMGN requested IDA assistance to
overcome these shortcomings.
3.    IDA involvement in the Sub-project has been divided into stages: Stage I, known as SMIP-I, was
approved in 1978 and provided US$30 million to rehabilitate and complete minor irrigation networks
(known as command area development - CAD) on 9,750 ha and the Sub-project was completed
satisfactorily in 1987. Later in 1987, IDA processed a second stage (SMIP II) in the amount of US$40
million for CAD on a further 16,700 ha, which was completed satisfactorily in 1995. Both of these credits
provided infiastructure to eliminate the siltation problem. However, the steps taken were not sufficient and
effective. In early 1991, while SMIP-II was under implementation, HMGN obtained advice of an
international Panel of Experts (POE) to deal with the siltation problem. The POE recommended that the
Sub-project be modified by: (a) moving the intake structure 1,300 m upstream of the existing intake site, (b)
constructing a larger capacity desilting basin, (c) utilizing dredgers to remove silt from the desilting basin,
and (d) constructing a micro-hydro unit in the headreach of the main canal to provide power for the dredger
operations.
4.     A new IDA credit, Sunsari Morang Headworks Sub-project (SMHP- Cr.2430) in the amount of
US$28 million, to provide these additional works was approved in early 1993. The SMiHP is on track for
completion in December 1997. The larger desilting basin constructed in 1992 under the SMIP-II has
proven successful and been operating. well with dredgers taking out silts from the basin. At the same time
the water management problems have been significantly reduced by introducing a simple structured
irrigation design for SMIP-II and partly in the SMIP-I. The resulting layout has proved to be acceptable to
farmers. The implementation of SMIP-I & SMIP-II is consistent with the HMGN`s Irrigation Policy of
facilitating water users' participation in all stages of the Sub-project implementation. Legal WUGs have
This bilateral agreement dated April 25, 1954, as amended on December 19, 1966, states that "HMGN shall have
every right to withdraw for irrigation and for other purposes in Nepal water from the Kosi River and from the
Sun-Kosi River or within the Kosi Basin from any other tributaries of the Kosi River as may be required from
time to time. The Union shall have the right to regulate all the balance in the Kosi River at the barrage site thus
available from time to time and to generate power in the Eastern Canal".

been formed in every developed tertiary irrigation unit (mostly about 28-50 ha in size) in the SMIP-I and II
areas. To date, the whole tertiary system of SMIP-IH has been turned over to the respective WUGs who has
been successfully carried out O&M on their own. Higher order WUAs at the secondary canal level have
been formed and a Water User Central Coordination Committee to represent beneficiary farmers at the Sub-
project management level has been established.
5.    The 1954 Kosi agreement does not limit water from the Kosi river for development works in Nepal.
The soils of the Sunsari Morang Sub-project are good and the farmers are competent. Since the present
technical solutions and the newly introduced Joint Participatory Management (JPM) operation have proven
successful, completion of the system can proceed on the technically feasible portions of the remaining
41,500 ha of the system, which are still as originally designed and constructed. Hence, the proposed Sub-
project would extend IDA support for CAD in the Sunsari Morang Irrigation Sub-project to a further
feasible slice of the remaining command area. The technical feasibility study for the determination of a
viable size of SMIP-III for another phase in the form of JPM has been completed since December 1995.
The study includes a final design of first year pilot area and ICB tender document for the whole phase of
15,100 ha.
Sub-proJect Objectives
6.    The Sub-project would aim to (a) raise agricultural production and incomes through investment in
rehabilitation and modernization of further 15,100 ha of the Sunsari Morang irrigation system, (b) further
strengthen and firmly establish JPM of the large public irrigation system, (c) improve construction,
operation and maintenance activities with beneficiary participation in every phase to increase productivity
and sustainability of the irrigation system, (d) reduce public expenditures for O&M of the irrigation system,
(e) strengthen the capacity of DOI for implementing the HMGN's irrigation policy for JPM in large public
irrigation systems.
Sub-project Description
7.    The proposed Sub-project would finance (a) rehabilitation and improvement of a portion of the
main canal and its appurtenant structures beyond that covered by Stages I & II and up to the tail end of the
system, (b) rehabilitation and modernization of secondary canals and related structures, drains and
inspection road networks covering a net command area of 15,100 ha of the Sub-project, (c) development of
command area distribution networks through construction of Sub-secondary or minor canal system, (d)
construction of 5.4 km of Kosi east embankment to protect the irrigable areas, (e) technical and institutional
building assistance to beneficiary WUGs for construction of water courses and field channel systems, (f)
other miscellaneous works and infrastructure necessary for proper operation and maintenance of the
developed system, (g) technical support, through consulting services, during implementation, for
monitoring and evaluation, and for strengthening DOI and WUGs by providing in-house and on-the-job
training.
Sub-project Size and Implementation Schedule
8.    The technically and economically viable proportion of the remaining 41,500 ha of the system
suitable to be covered by a Sub-project was determined by a feasibility study. The feasibility study
examined issues of implementations capacity to determine the size of the Sub-project that can be effectively
implemented within a 5 year construction period. However, based on past experiences, a Sub-project
covering an area of 15,000 - 17,000 ha is anticipated due to capacity limitation, with the remainder of the

Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                       Annex 2/Attachment 4
suitable area deferred to SMIP IV and onward. The feasibility study included a review and assessment of
the present irrigation system's performance under the facilities and CAD provided by the SMIP I, the SMIP
II and the SMHP and was undertaken by a consulting team financed by a PHRD grant. The study also
tested the economic viability of the proposed Sub-project, taking account of sunk costs, and of the larger
SMIP program including the SMIP-I, the SMIP-I1 plus the SMHP. The output of the study also included a
feasibility design, cost estimates, ICB bidding documents for a viable SMIP IH Sub-project and a sample
detailed engineering design for a slice of the first year pilot civil works on 1350 ha to test the joint
contractor-famiers construction. The study was completed in late November 1995. The details on the Sub-
project costs and implementation schedule are shown in the attached tables.
O&M Cost Recovery
9.     The current water rate of NRs 200 per ha was established about 8 years ago on a national basis and
has not been adjusted subsequently. It is estimated that NRs 530 would now be required to cover full
O&M. With the WUGs taking over O&M of the tertiary distribution system in the rehabilitated portion of
SMIP, about NRs 400 per ha could be required for the remaining expenses for adequate O&M. The area-
based type of water rates are assessed uniformly to all beneficiaries, without taking account of the fact that
many farmers are receiving little or no water due to system deficiencies and lack of prior maintenance. The
present rate of collection nationwide is understandably low (about 5%). The water rates collected go to the
Treasury, with no effect on actual O&M expenditures. HMGN under the NISP is requested to design an
improved system to be applied to the rehabilitated portion of the SMIP Sub-project area under which (i) the
water charges would be increased to cover full O&M of the main and secondary distribution systems, (ii)
the rates collected by the WUGs, less a suitable allowance for overhead, would be kept in a separate
account in the Sub-project area and would be used to finance O&M for the SMIP, and (iii) any WUG in the
rehabilitated area that does not collect adequate water charges (minimum percent to be defined) would be
cut off from receipt of irrigation water pending satisfactory resolution of the arrears issue. While it is
premature to predict how much of the desirable reforms of the O&M policies and practices can be achieved
under this Sub-project, it is an intention to try to obtain significant reforms in this area. A detailed O&M
study for the whole country would be carried out under NISP.
Sub-project Financing
10.    The recently revised HMGN's IP introduced a 25 percent beneficiary contribution to capital costs of
rehabilitation of the tertiary system. Therefore, SMIP III would only be implemented in areas where WtUAs
have agreed and collected at least 70 percent of the required beneficiary cosharing of costs. The current
cost sharing 25 percent by beneficiary farmers could perhaps be increased under future Sub-projects
(particularly after the potential benefits of the SMHP Sub-project in reducing siltation and the effectiveness
of the improved Joint Participatory O&M systems have been demonstrated). However, for the time being
one should concentrate cost recovery efforts on the more crucial issues of O&M. The financing plan for
the Sub-project assumes that IDA would provide 80 percent of the total Sub-project costs, with HMGN and
the beneficiary farmers contributing 10 percent each.
Sub-project Implementation
2 HMGN has asked IDA to execute the preparation of Sunsari Morang Irrigation III Sub-project for which purpose a PHRD
grant of 108,200,000 Japanese Yen (about US$0.97 million equivalent) was approved in December 1993. A consulting firm,
Nippon Koei Co. Ltd., was hired in July 1994 for a detailed feasibility study which is planned to complete in November 1995.



Project Appraisal Document                                                  Page 54
Nepal Irnigation Sector Project                                   Annex 2/Attachment 4
11.   The Sub-project would be implemented over a five-year period including one year for preparatory
works to allow WUG formation and arrangements to be made for beneficiaries' participation in construction
of water course systems. The Sub-project would be implemented by the existing Sunsari Morang Irrigation
Development Board with support from DOI, MOWR, HMGN, with a joint participation of WUAs. The
proposed Sub-project is consistent with IDA's country assistance strategy which emphasizes the role of the
private sector farmers in agricultural development. Turn-over of tertiary systems to the farmers to relieve
the Government of the O&M responsibility is impossible until and unless water course systems are
introduced, the dilapidated distribution networks are rehabilitated, and beneficiary WUAs are formed and
legally institutionalized for O&M.  The proposed Sub-project also supports HMGN's irrigation
development strategy, which gives priority to improving the performance of existing systems and
improving water management in public irrigation schemes through greater reliance on WUGs -- the central
objective of the HMGN's IP 2049. The WUGs would become the contact farmer group for extension
services in irrigated areas and would be supported under an improved extension system currently being
developed with support from the Agricultural Reaserch and Extension Project (FYI 998).
12.   IDA has been involved with HMGN for many years as a leading donor in developing the modalities
for efficient operation and maintenance of the country's public irrigation sector. Although the JPM program
is still evolving, some of the schemes being tested under the on-going ILC program as well as the current
performance of JPM in the Stage II area of SMIP show positive results. The proposed Sub-project would
carry these innovative developments further with improvements designed to orient DOI and WUGs towards
sharing joint responsibilities, not only in O&M but also during implementation. IDA has played a
leadership role in the sector, has introduced CAD into the system, and has been instrumental in helping
H1MGN design and implement its new irrigation policy.
Riparian Issues and Actions
13.   The extension of CAD to the Stage III area would not be affected by any developments in China, as
the Kosi river rises in the high Himalayas where consumptive use is not possible and diversion unlikely.
The proposed Sub-project is of a rehabilitation nature and is in accordance with the Kosi Project Agreement
of 1954, as amended in 1975, between GOI and HMGN and would implement the original intent of the
Agreement by making it possible to irrigate efficiently the area which was constructed by GOI. There
would be no change of impact on Bangladesh as the dry season flow is already diverted by India at the Kosi
barrage. For these reasons, the Sub-project which involves only the alteration to an on-going scheme,
would not cause appreciable harm to the other riparian countries, nor would the Sub-project be so harmed
by feasible use of the Kosi River water by such countries.
14.   Under the SMIP, there will be two types of Sub-project affected families (PAFs) on about 380 ha
of the land to be used for canal intensification. For all cases where PAFs are also Sub-project
beneficiaries, the current arrangement whereby farmners voluntarily contribute portions of their land is
satisfactory. In the case of non-beneficiary PAFs, irrespective of whether the system is public or FMIS,
HMGN's current land acquisition action plan is being reviewed by the Bank to ensure its consistency
with the Bank's policy. According to the field survey during FS it was observed that there will not be
any displaced or affected household in the SMIP-III area since all are in the irrigable area. Anyhow a
detailed Land Acquisition Plan (LAP) has been prepared and reviewed by the Bank. Based on the pilot
area survey it was estimated that about 45 farm families could have loss of land more than 25 percent of
their holding. It was agreed that the project management will submit to the Bank a satisfactory
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for these SPAF in each year before the actual land acquisition and carry
out the physical acquisition satisfactorily as per agreed RAP.

Environmental Aspects
15.   The Sub-project has been given a "B" rating for environmental purposes. The feasibility study has
been charged with bringing the CAD design in line with the Bank's current environmental standards and
ensuring conformity with the requirements of HMGN's environmental impact assessment guidelines.
Compliance with this requirement will be ensured through a monitoring system to be established during
implementation of the Sub-project.
Benefits
16.   Irrigated area, production, farm incomes and employment are expected to rise in the Stage III area,
where about one third of the area commanded currently gets no irrigation due to system deterioration and
inequitable distribution of water. Assuming that a viable size of SMIP III would be about 15,000 ha, the
incremental food grain and oilseed production would be about 30,000 ton/year and 1600 ton/year
respectively. Over 8,000 farm families would benefit by the Sub-project, while the construction would
generate about 6,000 jobs per day during the five to six-year construction and about 25-30 man-days/ha
increase at full development under farming. Operation and maintenance of the system are both expected to
improve due to WUG responsibility and decreased government liability for O&M. A major institutional
benefit would be a shift in DOI's orientation away from construction towards policy setting, planning and
monitoring. The ERR of the Sub-project is found to be about 14.0 percent.

Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                     Annex 2/Attachment 9
Sub-Project Implementation Procedural Guidelines
GENERAL
1.    NISP is the first stand alone irrigation sector project. It covers all the lessons learnt from the
implementation of the ILC Pilot Project in the three Western Regions of Nepal and incorporates tested and
proven process and procedures for implementing an irrigation sector investment program for sustainable
operation and maintenance by user groups.
2.     The Sub-Project covering main Irrigation Infrastructure Development with or without Supporting
Infrastructures would be selected and implemented according to the Principles and Criteria established for
NISP. These are to ensure that the Sub-Projects development would enhance agriculture production and
productivity; that the support demanded by the users group is beyond their internal capacity, and that the
support extended would not create any dependency for future O&M. Implementation quality is to be
assured through adoption of all the steps as set out in the detailed Procedural Guideline Documents, a
concise version of which is presented below.
Step 1        Information Dissemination: The District Irrigation and Agriculture Offices (DIO,
DADO) and their sub-centres (ASC) would be responsible for disseminating information
on NISP type of Sub-Projects, principles and procedures for their selection and
implementation, to all beneficiaries in those areas having the potential for enhancing
irrigated agricultural practices utilizing surface or underground water resources. The RID
with assistance from the local office of DHM would keep and update the sub-basin water
resource inventories. At the Central level policy makers, politicians, and the media would
be briefed about the program through workshops and meetings.
Step 2        Application: Farmers Group or existing water users organization in need of assistance to
improve or extend their irrigation system or supporting infrastructure would form an Ad-
Hoc WUA committee and then collectively complete an application form. The application
to be signed by all beneficiaries before submission through the nearest ASC/SSC to the
DIO, along with an upfront cash deposit of NRs 50 per ha for surface irrigation or NRs 200
per ha for groundwater Sub-Projects.
Step 3        Initial Screening and Selection Criteria: DIO technicians with the assistance of DADO
staff would screen the application, to verify it met the selection criteria for NISP support.
The screened list of Sub-Projects would be discussed in DAC and a selection made for
proceeding to identification study. The selected list would be communicated to the DDC.
Step 4        Identification Survey: DIO and DADO/ASC staff would form a site visit team to verify
the information given on the application form. The WUA ad hoc committee would liaise
with the visiting team and assist in updating the application form if necessary. The visiting
team would then prepare an identification study report based on the identification
questionnaire filled in when in the field. In case of unviable or illegible Sub-Projects, the
upfront cash deposit would be returned at this stage.
Step 5        Classification as Major of Minor Rehabilitation: Based on field data collected to date,
the Sub-Project would be classified by the DIO into major or minor rehabilitation, using
fixed criteria for hill and terai areas. This would dictate the nature of further studies.



Project Appraisal Document                                                  Page 61
Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                   Annex 2/Attachment 9
Step 6       Sub-Project Prioritization: The DIO would prioritized each Sub-Project according to the
main components influencing the potential development. This prioritization together with
the identification report including major and minor classification would be discussed
in DAC to finalize the prioritization of Sub-Projects for feasibility study.
Step 7       Feasibility Study (Major Rehabilitation): After approval by the RID of the regional
feasibility study program according to budgetary provisions, the DIO would undertake the
feasibility study with the support of DADO staff. If the Sub-Project is large or potentially
challenging a local consultant could be deployed. MIT and RADO staff would extend
technical support to the study team as required. The WUA or beneficiary group would be
closely involved in the field work and discuss the scope of works and preliminary cost
estimates. To ensure uniformity in the feasibility study and its report presentation, the
approach detailed in the procedural guidelines would be strictly followed. The report
would include screening of alternatives as well as describing the optimum solution,
realistic construction cost and benefit estimation for performing an economic analysis and
an environmental assessment of the Sub-Project.
Feasibility Study with Detailed Design (Minor Rehabilitation): A similar procedure as
for major rehabilitation would be followed, but the feasibility study would include detailed
design of the proposed infrastructure works, including appropriate site investigations,
drawings and quantity take-off, to enable an accurate cost estimate to be derived. The
WUA would be involved and the cost estimate discussed with the WUA for their approval
on cost sharing arrangements.
Step 8       Appraisal and Detailed Design (Major Rehabilitation): The feasibility report would be
scrutinized by MIT members, and to include a site verification if felt necessary, before
being technically reviewed and endorsed by the Technical Assistance (TA) Team. If found
technically feasible and economically viable the Sub-Project would be recommended to
DAC and RAAC in turn for their appraisal. If the cost estimate in the feaibility report is
more than NRs 10.0 million then the feasibility report would be submitted to the Project
Coordination Office for technical review, before submission to the DG/DOI for approval.
After RAAC appraisal or DG/DOI approval of the feasibility study, detailed engineering
designs of the proposed infrastructure works would be undertaken by the DIO or local
consultant with assistance from the WUA, including their approval on cost sharing
arrangements. The detailed design would include site investigations, drawing preparation
and quantity take-off, to enable an accurate cost estimate to be derived. The MIT would
check the designs before a final technical review and endorsement from the TA Team.
Appraisal (Minor Rehabilitation): The feasibility study report along with detailed
designs and cost estimate would be site verified by the MIT and then sent with a
recommendation to DAC for their appraisal and onward transmission to the RAAC.
Step 9       Approval and Tender Document Preparation: If the Sub-Project cost estimate is less
than NRs 1.0 M, then RID would approve. If the cost estimate is between NRs 1.0 to 5.0
M, then RAAC would approve the Sub-Project only after a site verification, if felt
necessary, by the MIT. If the cost estimate is between NRs 5.0 and 10.0 M, then RAAC
would approve the Sub-Project only after a compulsory site verification by the MIT. If the
cost estimate is more than NRs 10.0 M, then the RID or DG/DOI would approve according

Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                    Annex 2/Attachment 9
to the authority vested in the financial rules. Also for Sub-Projects costing more than NRs
10.0 M, if after detailed design the revised cost estimate was found to exceed the original
approved feasibility study cost estimate, then the Sub-Project designs would be re-
submitted to the DG/DOI for approval.
The approval information would be communicated to RAD, DADO and DIO who in turn
would inform the concerned WUA and the DDC. DIO would then finalize cost sharing
arrangements with the WUA and prepare tender documents based on model LCB
-A                    documents for those works to be undertaken by contract.
Step 10 Resource Mobilization and Implementation Plan: The DIO would discuss with the WUA the
program for Sub-Project rehabilitation and include in their District implementation plan of
approved Sub-Projects. These to be submitted to RID who would include in their annual
work (budget) program, to be then forwarded to Central DOI for approval by the National
Planning Commission. The WUA would be required to participate with DIO in
implementation planning. The plan would specify inter-alia individual responsibilities of
WVUA, DIO, DADO and RID staff during Sub-Project implementation period.
At this stage the WUA would be required to deposit balance of upfront cash to make up
0.5% of the investment cost, otherwise no further works would be undertaken by DOI.
Step 11 Formalize Farmer Organization and Participation: The WUA constitution and its by-laws
would be formalized by the general assembly of users and the WUA registered with the
District Water Resources Commission under Water Resources Regulation (1993).
Technical support and training of the WUA at this time would be provided by the MIT,
DIO & DADO staff and NGOs if required. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
between DIO & WUA detailing the cost sharing arrangement and work breakdown
agreement of all the construction works would be finalized and signed in front of the
General Assembly.
Step 12 Construction: Tenders would be floated for the DIO parts, and contract(s) awarded as per HMGN
financial rules keeping transparency with the WUA. A construction committee would be
formed by the WUA to supervise and monitor the quality of works being carried out both
by DIO contract as well as by WUA according to the work-breakdown agreement.
After confirmation that WUA have completed 15% of their work contribution according to
the MOA, then DIO would proceed with the Sub-Project implementation.
Training would be conducted by DIO/RID staff for construction committee members on
quality control and supervision of works. WUA would be encouraged to take part in the
final measurement of contract works. WUA part of works would also be recorded and
evaluated by DIO. If during construction, variation in the scope of works demands a cost
overrun of more than 10% from the original estimate, then the works would be suspended
until the WUA contributes in cash or labour, on a pro-rata basis, their share of the cost
over-run. MIT would check on construction progress and quality of works.
Step 13 Commissioning: After physical completion of works according to the MOA, DIO technicians
along with WUA members would conduct a walk through of the system during test runs of



Project Appraisal Document                                                  Page 63
Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                   Annex 2/Attachment 9
the system, to identify any defect and operational problems. During the contract
maintenance period, the contractor would rectify the defect.
DIO would prepare a completion report and organize the signing with the WUA of the
certificate of work completion. A copy of the report, signed by the WUA, would be
forwarded to RIDIDOI for recording in their management information system.
Step 14 Operation and Maintenance: After completion, the WUA would receive back the 0.5% upfront
cash deposit from DIO as potential seed money for future O&M of the system. Thereafter
the WUA would assume full responsibility for O&M of the system. With the assistance of
DADO/ASC/NGO, the WUA and farmers would strengthen their linkages with other
support agencies. DIO/RID staff would carry out O&M and water management trainings to
WUA members as needed. An NGO would provide to the WUA continuing advice to
ensure future sustainable agriculture practices. RID would make provision for budgetary
support to completed Sub-Projects in case of natural unforseen disasters.
Step 15 Monitoring: DIO would assist the Regional Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation Team (RBMET)
under RADO in conducting the PBME of Sub-Projects and monitor the O&M and water
management status of the completed Sub-Projects. The WUA would be required to supply
factual data and information to the RBMET during household and group surveys. Central
PIC would be responsible for the overall impact assessment of the rehabilitated improved
Sub-Projects on a sector basis.
GROUNDWATER SUB-PROJECTS
For the implementation of groundwater irrigation Sub-Projects all the steps would be similar to the above
except that particular attention would be given to the following:
step 1       Hydrogeological Study: Prior to the information dissemination step, potential areas for
groundwater development would be identified based on existing and ongoing groundwater
resources investigation studies and monitoring activities being conducted under the Ground
Water Resources and Development Project (GWRDP) of DOI.
Step 7       Feasibility Study: To support the recommendations for groundwater development, the
GWRDP Central Office are to make provision for undertaking geophysical studies of
potential sites through slim hole borings to confirm the groundwater potentiality.
Step 12 Construction: WUA contribution to the construction to be either in cash or through in kind labour
contribution to the construction of the distribution works

Estimated Project Costs
1.    The project base costs have been prepared using the detailed feasibility level estimate for all
three components of the project. Details are presented in Attachments. A summary of these base cost
estimates are:
COMPONENTS                             US$ million
Water Resources Strategy & studies               1.25
Irrigation Infrastructure Development           72.43
Institutional Strengthening                     16.0
TOTAL        89.70
Further details of each component are given below.
Water Resources Strategy Base Cost Estimate
2.    A base cost of US$1.25 million is provided to finance preparation of the phase II water
resources strategy component. Of that US$1.10 million will be utilized for technical assistance to
prepare a national water resources policy, national water plan, O&M and Subsidy Studies in Irrigation
sub-sector and revise other sub-sector policies and regulations (if necessary) to ensure their compatibility
and consistency with the agreed strategy. US$0.11 million is provided to establish a central water
resources planning unit in the Government, to finance the support facilities of office, transport, and
computing equipment including GIS and river basin modeling computer programs.
Irrigation Infrastructure Development Base Cost Estimate
(a) Costs of Model Sub-Projects For FMIS. TO and PJM
3.    The cost estimates for different types of Sub-Projects have been prepared and applied to the
potential NISP Sub-Projects on a cost per ha basis. The costs include civil works and other ancillary
works for surface Sub-Projects in Terai and Hills under major and minor rehabilitation, groundwater in
Terai under STW and DTW, as well as TO and PJM of surface schemes.
4.    The costs of irrigation system for the selected model sub-projects are identified and estimated for
different types of sub-projects on the basis of actual requirements. The typical cost estimates of
irrigation system are prepared from the costs of model Sub-Projects to enable them to apply to the
potential Sub-Projects.  The cost estimates of the twelve model Sub-Projects as appraised are
summarized in Annex 3 Attachment No 1. The costs include all other supporting infrastructures and
technical support costs on prorata (area proportion) basis.
(b) ro.JectCosts
5.    Based on the model sub-project costs in the case of FMIS and TO sub-projects and on a detailed
design costs for a pilot area covering 10 percent of the command area for SMIP-III, the cost estimates of
the various components of the irrigation infrastructure development are derived. In the case of main and

rehabilitation. The per hectare cost of irrigation system rehabilitation works are applied to alternative
sub-project areas, for assessing the best combination of types of sub-projects. The cost estimates of the
project are prepared for a total area of 59,600 ha (including SMIP-III). These costs include for
rehabilitating irrigation systems, rural farm roads, river training, environmental protection, micro-
hydropower, drinking water supply facilities, and improvements to Sunsari Morang III sub-project.
6.     The costs for planning, feasibility study, detailed design and supervision of irrigation system
rehabilitation and other project related civil works are estimated at 3 percent of the total civil work cost.
A provision is made for recurrent support costs for DOI and DOA during implementation period of 5
years at NRs. 320/ha/year, based on the past expenditures. The incremental O&M costs are taken at
NRs. 950 per hectare per year for the surface sub-Projects, NRs. 2,451/ha/year for STW and NRs.
1,739/ha/year for DTW, based on the results of the model sub-project studies.
7.    The project base costs (including SMIP-III), for the irrigation infrastructure development
component, are estimated at US$72.43 (NRs 4,055.8 million equivalent). The cost estimates are based
on 1996 constant values with an exchange rate of US$1.00 = NRs. 56.0. Physical contingency is taken as
per degree of precision of the estimate and ranges in most cases as 5%-15% of the base cost.
(c) Institutional Strengthening Base Cost Estimate
8.    This component comprises the costs for financing the institutional support to DOI, DHM, DOA
and associated private sector organizations. The estimates are based on the details given in Borrower's
Implementation Plan (project files) and the prevailing unit rates of items involved. Based on that, the
following costs are derived.
US$ 8.59 (NRs 480.85 million equivalent) is estimated for DOI to cover the costs are for
providing consulting services, training, vehicles, machinery and equipment, groundwater
monitoring, on farm water management, and support to the MIS.
US$ 4.91 (NRs 274.76 million equivalent is estimated for DHM to cover the costs for improving
the hydrometeorological network and institutional strengthening of the data collection and
reporting, through provision of consulting services, training, vehicles and equipment.
US$ 1.82 (NRs 102.06 million equivalent) is estimated for DOA for strengthening their capacity
to support the NISP program, through provision of improved planting materials, extension
services, training and vehicles and support to DOI in Sub-Projects preparation and PBME of
completed Sub-Projects.
US$ 0.706 (NRs 39.6 million equivalent) is estimated to be provide for strengthening of private
sector including Water User Associations, and provision of Non Government and Community
Based Organizations for the training of beneficiaries in NISP principles and procedures, Sub-
Project 0 & M, farner organization, financial management, credit assessing and marketing.
The summary of the project's total costs is given below.

9.     The total project cost, including physical contingencies and expected price increases, is
estimated at US$103.02 million equivalent. The direct and indirect foreign exchange component is
estimated at about US$ 27.93 million equivalent, or about 27.36% of total costs. The cost estimates are
based on mid 1996/97 prices and include local taxes and duties computed at about US$ 4.183 million
equivalent. Cost estimates for works are derived from costs of activities recently completed or updated
to the feasibility costs. Costs estimate for equipment, material, and vehicles are based on recent prices
quotation from suppliers, or prices of similar goods recently purchased. Consultant staff costs are based
on the experience in the country with recent consulting contracts for similar works. Physical
contingencies vary from 5% to 15% depending upon the degree details in feasibility estimates. Price
contingencies were applied to the foreign exchange component at 2.4 % in 1998, 2.5% in 1999, 2.5%
in 2000, 2.5 % in 2001, 2.4 % in 2002, and thereafter. For local costs, price contingencies were applied
at 7.0 % in 1998, 6.0 % in 1999 and thereafter. The cost estimates take into account the expected
changes in the currency equivalent (from NRs 56.0 at appraisal to NRs 66.2 per one US$ at 2002) over
the project period. The summarized componentwise costs are given in the above table and the itemised
detailed cost estimates are shown in the attached tables (Attachment 2 - Tables I to 17).

FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Agricultural Production
FMIS Sub-Projects
1.    The improvement and development of FMIS surface and groundwater irrigation would result in
substantial increases in cropping intensities and yields. This would come from the increased paddy in
kharif season, wheat and oilseeds in rabi season and the diversification into vegetables and others in all
seasons. Based on ILC experience, the increased cropping intensities and yields are due to irrigation
coupled with intensive agricultural extension, improved water management and more farmers' involvement
in the planning and management of the FMIS sub-projects. Without Project (WOP) situation, there would
be little or no change in the present cropping patterns. Average cropping intensity in With Project situation
(WP) have been estimated to increase by 20 percent to 62 percent in terai and 20 percent to 43 percent in
hill areas. Cropping patterns and yields of sub-project models in WOP and WP are detailed in Project
Implementation Volume - Economic Analysis Section -Tables 1-9.
2.    Projected yields based on ILC actual experience are estimated to increase substantially at full
development; e.g. by 17 percent to 46 percent for paddy, 50 percent tolOO percent for wheat, and 50 percent
tol31% for oilseeds. Based on a total command area of 32,500 ha to be developed in terai areas, the project
would increase annual production of 46,140 tons paddy, 31,700 tons wheat, 21,110 tons potato, 18,390 tons
vegetables and 7,935 tons other crops (pulses, oilseeds and sugarcane) as shown below:

3.    A total command area of 12,000 ha to be developed in hill areas would increase annual production
of 30,360 tons paddy, 10,960 tons wheat, 8,540 tons vegetables and 6,240 tons potato, but decrease annual
production of 6,240 tons other crops (maize and millet) as shown below:

4.     The present cropping intensity in the potential SMIP III sub-project area is 150 percent. In WOP,
cropping intensity has been estimated to increase slightly by 10 percent to 160 percent, particularly in rabi
season. In addition, farmers would prefer to grow more irrigated paddy in the kharif season. Based on
experience in SMIP I and II, future cropping intensity with irrigation development has been estimated to
increase by 38 percent (Project Implementation Volume-Economic Analysis Section - Table 10). Future
cropping intensities would reach 198 percent. Yields of crops have been estimated to increase by 40
percent for paddy, 150 percent for oilseeds, 67 percent for wheat, 14 percent for sugarcane and 63 percent
for jute. Based on a total command area of 15,100 ha to be developed under the project, annual production
would increase by 29,460 tons paddy, 13,140 tons wheat, 6,795 tons vegetables, 6,345 tons potato, 16,610
tons sugarcane and 5,125 tons other crops (oilseeds, pulses and jute) as below:

B. Market Prospects
5.    Annual incremental foodgrain production from the project would be small and dispersed in the four
regions. Given the rapid population growth and high rate of migration in terai and the prevailing food
deficit in hill areas, the project's incremental production would be easily absorbed by on-farm consumption
and domestic markets. Since market networks are well established in the terai, marketing problems are not
foreseen. In addition, resolution of the trade and transit dispute with India will also open trade with markets
across the border. In hill areas where markets are not yet widely established, and therefore some marketing
difficulties would arise particularly for those perishable agricultural produces. However, experience under
ILC indicates a strong markets for vegetables, with wholesalers sending trucks from large market centres to
purchase these produces from many hill areas. Therefore, it is expected that the relatively small increased
production of vegetables (8,500 tons) and potato (6,200 tons) is unlikely to pose serious marketing
problems.
6.     Prices of agricultural produces in Nepal follows closely the market prices in India. Agricultural
produces are sold across the border when market prices are higher and vice versa they are imported when
the domestic prices are higher. Domestic markets are almost handled by a number of private traders
operating at various levels down to the villages. The Nepal Food Corporation (NFC) also procure foodgrain
of mainly rice at support prices for supply to the food deficit areas in hills. However, the support prices are
in general 20 percemt lower than market prices. Therefore, only a fraction of total foodgrain production is
procured by NFC. Fertilisers and seeds are supplied by the Agricultural Input Corporation (AIC) through
the agricultural co-operatives. Urea is heavily subsidised in compensation for the low procurement price of
foodgrain.
C. Farm Incomes and Impact on Poverty
7.     Ten farm models representing the FMIS sub-project models and SMIP have been used to calculate
the project's impact on farm incomes. The average farm holding sizes of 1.3 ha in terai, 0.7 ha in hills and
1.4 ha in SMIP have been used in the analysis as they represent about 76% and 67% of total farms in terai
and hill areas respectively. The average 1996 financial farm gate prices prevailing in the project areas
(Project Implementation Volume - Economic Analysis Section -Table 11-12) were used to value outputs
and inputs. Cropping patterns are given in Project Implementation Volume - Economic Analysis Section -
Tables 1-10 and the per ha financial crop budgets in Project Implementation Volume - Economic Analysis
Section -Tables 13-33. Loan servicing have been estimated from farmers contribution, stipulated in the
1997 Irrigation Policy, for the investment costs of the improvement and development of surface and
groundwater irrigation schemes (para. 13), amnortised at the prevailing commercial interest rate of 15% per
year over 7 years. The results are detailed in the Project Implementation Volume - Economic Analysis

i/ Net farm incomes after water charges, O&M costs and loan servicing.
2/ Participatory joint management public irrigation scheme.
8.    At present, almost all the farms in the project areas live below the poverty line estimated at NRs
4,400 per capita. The impact of the project on farm incomes would be substantial and help to raise farmers
incomes above the poverty line. A total of 52,930 farm families will directly benefit from the project. At
full development, annual net farm incomes in with project net of water charges, O&M expenditures and
loan servicing, are estimated to increase by 41 percent to 247 percent for farms in terai, 59 percent-129
percent for farms in hills and 137 percent for farms in SMIP areas. Annual net farm incomes are estimated
at NRs.30,610-49,490 for farms in terai, NRs 32,730-34,460 for farms in hill and NRs 57,415 for farms in
SMIlP III areas. Net farm incomes after loan servicing would increase by 2 percent to 8 percent for farms in
terai, 4 percent to7 percent for farms in hills and 8 percent for farms in SMIP.
9.    At full development, the project will generate about 74 percent increases in annual farm labour
employment from 7.8 man-days million to 13.5 man-days million. Although much of this represents
greater utilisation of family labour, especially marginal and small farms, there will also be a significant
increases in demand for hired labour, mainly on a larger farms. As providers of hired farm labour, the
poorer segments of the population would be the main beneficiaries of the increases in labour demand.
D. COST RECOVERY
10.       Background. In Nepal, cost recovery is applicable to only 30 percent of the irrigated areas as
majority 70 percent of-the irrigated areas are under farmer-owned and managed irrigation schemes. The
main sources of cost recovery are land taxes, water charges and capital cost recovery on system
improvement and development. Indirect agricultural sale taxes are virtually non-existent. Land taxes are
nominal and the rates have remained unchanged since 1967, ranging from NRs 5-NRsI3/ha/year in terai for
the land holding size up to 2 ha, and NRs 2-NRslO/ha/year in hills for the land holding size up to 1 ha.



Project Appraisal Document                                             Annex 4/ Page 87
Country - Nepal                                                 Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
Similarly, since 1987 the water rates have remained unchanged at NRs 200/ha/year for public surface
irrigation and NRs 400/ha/year for groundwater irrigation. The present rates of water charges comprise
only 44 percent and 22 percent of the average FY96 actual O&M expenditures of NRs 450/ha/year for 24
surface irrigation schemes and NRs 1,810/ha/year for 5 groundwater schemes. Moreover, because of
inadequate level of O&M funding for public irrigation schemes resulting in unsatisfactory performance of
the irrigation systems, it has been difficult to enforce the water charges. Of the total 25 public surface and
groundwater schemes, water charges were collected from only 8 schemes. The overall collection rate in the
same year was extremely low at only 5 percent. This problem is endemic and unless the level of O&M
funding is prioritised according to the availability of funds and nature of irrigation systems, it is unlikely
that the performance of public irrigation systems will improve and investment made will be lost. However,
the collection was 100 percent in the West Gandak surface irrigation scheme. This indicates that full O&M
cost recovery can be achieved through a strong collecting agent, WUA, given that irrigation services are
reliable and timely provided. Studies would be carried out under the project to define: (i) the optimum level
of O&M requirement for different types of public irrigation systems before and after handing over of parts
of the system to WUAs; (ii) funding requirement to achieve the optimum level; and (iii) the appropriate
level of water charges, and a plan for its action implementation.
11.       In Sunsari Morang Project, water charges were collected initially in FY94 in the Stage II areas
where the systems were improved and WUAs organised. Subsequently, it was expanded to the Stage I
areas. Although 50 percemt of the areas in Stage III have access to irrigation water, water charges have
never been enforce. In FY97, the collection rates were 15 percent in the Stage II area and 2 percent in the
Stage I area. It should be noted that 70 percent collection rate was achieved by a few WUAs in the Stage II
areas.
12.       New Irrigation Policy. HMGN's policy is to privatise irrigation, or otherwise to maximnise
farner participation in the remaining 30 percent of irrigated areas and recover full costs of O&M born by
the Government. As stipulated in the 1997 Irrigation Policy and effective from July 16, 1997, the capital
cost recovery have been raised to: (i) 5 percent of the investment costs of terai and hill turnover surface
irrigation scheme; (ii) 10 percent for DTW development; (iii) 12 percent for terai and hill minor surface
irrigation rehabilitation; (iv) 15 percent for terai and hill major surface irrigation rehabilitation and DTW
and STW rehabilitation; and (v) 40 percent for STW development. HMGN is also to raised the current
water charges. The current water charges will be double to NRs 400/ha/year for public joint management
surface irrigation system and NRs 800/ha/year for groundwater irrigation system.
13.   Farmers' Ability to Pay. The farm incomes analyses based on the above farm models (para. 7)
show that project investments generate substantial increases in the net farm incomes for all groups of
farmers (see Project Implementation Volume - Economic Analysis Section -Tables 30-31). The estimated
incremental annual farm incomes due to the project are financially attractive and provide adequate
incentives for farmers to participate in the development investment, take over the full responsibility for
O&M and to pay for the increased water charges. The upfront farmers contribution for system
improvement and development comprise about 0.5 percent to 8 percent of the estimated farm net value of
outputs. The full O&M costs comprise about 2 percent of the farmn net value of output and the increased
water charges comprise I percent of the farm net value of output.
E. Financial and Economic Analysis
14.       To assess the financial and economic viability, the financial rates of return (FRRs) and
economic rates of return (ERRs) have been calculated separately for 11 sub-project models as follows:

Financial Analysis
16.       FRRs to all financial resources are estimated to range from favourable (150/o-19% ) for all
the terai irrigation sub-projects to acceptable (12%-13%) for hill major and minor irrigation sub-
projects and SMIP III. The marginal FRRs for the latter sub-projects are due mainly to the relatively
high investment costs. FRR of SMIP I1I, including sunk cost, savings in desilting costs and hydropower
benefits, is estimated at 11 percent.
17.       The underlying assumptions used in the analysis are:
(i)     The analysis has been undertaken in 1996 constant prices;
(ii)    Opportunity cost of capital (OCC) in Nepal is 12%;
(iii)    Economic life has been assumed at 20 years for all FMIS and PJM and 30 years
for SMIP irrigation civil works, and 10 years for equipment and vehicle;
(iv)    Investment costs included taxes and duties and physical contingencies (see
Tables Project Implementation Volume - Economic Analysis Section - 36-46).
Total investment costs include civil works, vehicle and equipment, hydrology
study, WUO and private sector/NGO strengthening, agricultural extension, staff
local training and technical assistance for sub-project supervision. The supports
for hydrology study under the project would benefit the total existing and
potential irrigable areas of about 1.6 ha million in the country, including 44,500
ha (3% of total irrigable area) under this project. Therefore, only 3% of the total
cost of the hydrology study have been included in the financial and economic
analysis of the sub-project models;

Country -Nepal                                               Nepal Irrigation Sector Project
(v)     Annual operation and maintenance costs (O&M) are estimated at NRs.600/ha for
terai surface irrigation sub-projects, NRs. 900/ha for hill surface irrigation sub-
projects, NRs. 2,991/ha for open channel DTW, NRs. 2,452/ha for buried pipe
DTW, NRs. 3,234/ha for STW; and an incremental O&M of NRs. 245/Ha/year
for SMIP;
(vi)    The sunk costs of Sunsari Morang new headwork and the benefits from the new
hydropower plant and savings in O&M of the headwork, particularly the savings
in desilting costs, have been tested. Based on the share of the SMIP III, phase I
in total sunk costs and benefits of the whole SMIP, 21 percent of the sunk costs
and potential benefits have been included in the analysis. The expenditures of the
new headwork have been based on actual expenditures, adjusted to 1996 constant
prices. The potential benefit from the new hydropower plant has been estimated
by the Sunsari Morang Project office;
(vii)   Prices of outputs and inputs have been based on the average 1996 farm gate
prices prevailed in the sub-project areas in the terai and hill;
(viii)   Hired labour and draft power have been assumed at 30 percent of total
requirements in WOP and WP in terai; and none in WOP and 20 percent of total
requirements in WP in hills; and
(ix)    Incremental yields in WP have been assumed to be achieved over 5 years and
irrigated area over 3 years.
Economic Analysis
18.       The estimated economic rates of return (ERRs) are favourable for all FMIS sub-projects
(14.5%-20.3%) and SMIP III (15.0%). ERR of SMIP III, including sunk cost, is acceptable at 13.3
percent. ERRs are also favorable at 17.1 percent for the FMIS component and at 16.2 percent for the
whole project (Tables 73 and 74). Including sunk costs of SMHP, ERR of the whole project is
estimated at 15.3% (Project Implementation Volume - Economic Analysis Section -Table 75).
19.       The economic analysis followed the assumptions used in the financial analysis. The
differences are:
(i)     Investment costs excluded taxes and duties but included physical contingencies.
Local costs and unskilled labour were converted to economic values by a
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.90;
(ii)    Because the O&M costs comprise mainly the local cost, their financial values
have been adjusted to economic values by SCF;
(iii)    Traded commodities (paddy, maize, wheat, jute, sugar) and fertilizers have been
based on the import parity prices. The average 2000-2005 world market prices
forecasted by the World Bank, adjusted for transport and handling charges to
farm gate prices have been used throughout the economic analysis (Project
Implementation Volume - Economic Analysis Section - Table 59-60). Non-traded
commodities and inputs including unskilled labour were based on the average
financial farm gate prices, adjusted by SCF of 0.90 (Project Implementation
Volume - Economic Analysis Section -Tables 11-12);
(iv)    All labour and draft power (family and hired) were included in the analysis; and

(v)     Extrapolation of the combined ERRs of the ten sub-project models and SMIP III
have been used as a basis for the calculation of ERRs for the FMIS component
and the whole project.
Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
20.       Switching values were computed to determined the effects of deviations from the main
assumptions on the economic viability of the project: i.e. the value of the variables tested which
would reduce the present value of the net incremental benefits to zero when discounted at the OCC
of 12 percent. The analysis shows that in most cases benefits are more sensitive than costs. The
results indicate that ERRs of sub-projects, SMIP III, the FMIS component and the whole project
would fall to 12 percent when incremental benefits reduced by 17 percent to 38 percent or total costs
increased by 20 percent to 62 percent, particularly the investment costs, as summarized below:

21.       Various sensitivity and risk analyses were carried out to test the different possible
scenarios, such as institutional, financial, technological, implementation, etc. shown below:
(a) ' Decline of O&M level after implementation due to insufficient budget funding.
In general this assumption captures the possible risks in ERR calculation for
Sunsari Morang Irrigation Sub-project (SMIP) under NISP. The project being a
public irrigation system larger than 15,000 ha and the rehabilitation works are to
be carried out basically by an ICB contractor that O&M liability of the contract
(termed as O&M during construction) spans up to (5)construction years plus (1)
additional year under warranty. The system being a big system such that the
system would be jointly managed by farmers and government after rehabilitation,
and if O&M will not perform optimally by the Government in the main and

secondary canal, it will start deteriorating by year seven and onward with an
estimated rate of 10 percent per year on irrigated area;
(b)   Similar assumptions can be made to the case of turnover schemes in Terai and
Hill on the decline of level of O&M, but with some differences. Turnover
schemes, by its nature are small, less than 2000 ha and therefore, with the
agreement in between farmers and the Government, the entire scheme will be
turned over to farmers from the Government management and ownership after
the rehabilitation project.  Being a smaller system, the time required for
rehabilitation works by NCB contract, is only 2 years. The O&M liability
extends up to (3) years. After that the system becomes private system operated
by farmer association. Since it is operated by farmers, it is more rational that all
will get water equally even if the system deteriorates due to lack of O&M. Even
if thereis slack of O&M, the extent would be smaller, as the farmers own and
operate the system and the reduction in getting less water would be slower may
be 3-5% per year inextreme case. But the effect could not be prolonged as the
farmers would mend the situation (major rehabilitation) as soon as the system
deterioration went down to a certainlevel, say 50%-60% of 60 % serviceability
(can reach in 6 years time);
(c)   The same thing is true for farmer managed irrigation schemes (FMIS) where the
schemes are originally owned and managed by farmers and after rehabilitation
also would be owned and managed by farmers. But the construction can be
finished in one year; and
(d)   Paddy area increases over the other crops. Because of the farmers' preference
when availability of water is assured and secured, the pre-project dry land crop
areas can be replaced with paddy in to commensurable extent as the crop water
requirement allows. The general rule is for every 1 ha increase to paddy, the loss
on other crop area will be 2 ha as paddy water consumption is double of the
others.

(i)    a combination of cost overrun by 20% and benefit lagged by 1-2 years.
22.         In all cases, ERRs of most sub-projects and SMIP III are still above the OCC of 12
percent. However, ERRs of the hill major and minor rehabilitation sub-projects would fall slightly
below the OCC of 12 percent particularly when prices of all crops dropped by 20 percent,
incremental yields of all crops reduced by 25 percent or irrigated areas reduced by 40 percent due to
inadequate O&M works. However, it should be noted that the above risk assumptions are highly
conservative because the project's incremental production is small and dispersed in the four regions,
therefore it is unlikely that prices of all crops would fall drastically at the same time. In addition,
fanners would unlikely to increase paddy areas at the expenses of all other crops, particularly
oilseeds and pulses as these crops are grown for mainly on-farm consumption. Although the risk of
inadequate O&M of sub-projects is likely to occur, this would be minimised through WUAs
organised under the project. Details are shown in the following table.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
I.    Bank financed works, goods and services would be procured following the Bank Procurement
Guidelines and the agreed standard bidding documents for Nepal. The procurement plans and packaging
were finalized at appraisal.. All implementing agencies involved in procurement have prepared draft
procurement plans which are consolidated as presented in the following table A.
2.    Procurement methods applicable to the various expenditure categories as well as the
administrative levels at which the different types of procurement would be done are summarized in the
following table.
3.    Civil works
(a) It is envisaged that the project would support a large number of small contracts for civil
works which has a wide geographic spread over the project area, each costing less than US$ 20,000
(about NRs 1.0 million or less) and up to an aggregate amount of US$4,000,000 (about NRs 220.0
million or less). These small works may be procured either under lump sum, or fixed-price contracts
awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a
written invitation. Out of that total aggregated amount, work contracts estimated to cost less than
$20,000 equivalent per contract for works, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,000,000
equivalent may also, with the prior agreement of the Bank, be procured by direct contracting or by
community participation. As a last resort, completion by Force Account of the small works would be
allowed up to an aggregate amount of $ 200,000 equivalent.
(b) The project will have one ICB procurement of civil works for Sunsari Morang Irrigation III
subproject amounting to about US$24.28 million. Other than the SMIP-IIl package, all FMIS
subprojects are geographically widely dispersed and are of small value in most cases (less than about
US$200,000 equivalent per scheme) and therefore will not be attractive for ICB tendering. All civil
works will therefore be procured under NCB except for the small works mentioned in above para (a).
4.    Goods
(a)    Some drilling, survey and investigation, and hydrometeorological equipment are of specialized
nature and therefore some of them of costs less than $50,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate
amount not exceeding $300,000 equivalent, and goods which the Bank agrees may be procured under
Limited International Bidding.
(b)    Goods, equipment and spares estimated to costs less than $20,000 equivalent per contract, up to
an aggregate amount not exceeding $500,000 equivalent, may be procured under International and
National Shopping procedure.

Nepal Irrigation Sector Project                                                  Annex 6
(c)    Goods under contracts estimated to cost less than $10,000 equivalent per contract up to an
aggregate amount not exceeding $300,000 equivalent may be procured, with the Bank's prior agreement,
by direct contracting.
(d)    Goods, equipment, vehicles and spares in group of each contract cost less than $200,000 per
contract up to an aggregate of $ 1.5 million may be procured by National Competitive Bidding. For
contract more than $200,000 per contract must be procured by ICB.
5.    Services
(a)    Consultancy services estimated to cost more than $200,000 equivalent per contract must be
awarded to international consulting firms. National consultants can be employed for contract cost less
than $200,000 per contract or less up to an aggregate of $2.0 million.
(b)    Consultancy services estimated to cost less than $20,000 per contract up to an aggregate of $1.0
million can be awarded for short-term consultancy services. Consultancy Services estimated to cost less
than $20,000 per contract up to an aggregate of $100,000 may be awarded to individual with the Bank's
prior agreement. The above-mentioned procurement of works, goods and services in terms of relevant
NISP components are tabularized below.
