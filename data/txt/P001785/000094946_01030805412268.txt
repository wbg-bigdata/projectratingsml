EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
Mozambique is a large, sparsely populated country whose people rely mainly on agriculture for their
livelihoods. In the late 1980s the Government of Mozambique initiated an economic rehabilitation
program to revitalize the country's economy. This involved addressing the country's severe transport
constraints and led to the development of the IDA-financed Roads and Coastal Shipping (ROCS)
projects. The proposed project is the third IDA project addressing Mozambique's transport issues.

(Impacto), was commissioned by the Administraccao Nacional de Estradas (ANE) to undertake an
environmental assessment of the next road sector program in Mozambique.
Terms of reference and methodology
The main elements of the terms of reference were to:
- Provide comprehensive environmental assessments for the phase 1 roads proposed for IDA
funding. Principal environmental issues associated with other phase 1 projects were to be
identified.
* Identify environmental (biological, physical, and social) characteristics relevant for road
maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading projects within Mozambique. Where possible the
country is to be subdivided into zones of similar ecological or social characteristics.
* Develop guidelines for the environmental management of individual projects. These guidelines are
to be relevant for all phases of the roads program.
* Propose monitoring procedures, mechanisms, staff, training, equipment and resources to ensure
that the environmental factors relevant for works undertaken under the roads program are
implemented.
*  Ensure that proper guidelines, procedures, information flows and capacities related to
environmental matters are put into place at the project development stage.
To respond to the terms of reference a methodology was developed involving:
* Consultation with a wide range of government and non-governmental organizations.
*  Field investigations for 11 of the World Bank subprojects. These were undertaken by specialists in
ecology, sociology and physical environmental science.
* Inputs from specialists in the fields of environmental impact assessment together with local
Mozambican specialists in ecology and sociology.
* Production of a report structured to respond to each of the principal issues defined in the terms of
reference.

Consultation
Consultation was undertaken with 21 government and non-governmental organizations. This involved
interviews with 36 people from these organizations. Discussions were also held with local villagers
and chiefs during field inspections. Outputs from the consultation included:
* Improved understanding of the roles of both government and non-governmental organizations in
developing and maintaining road infrastructure
* Knowledge of concerns about the adverse effects of road development
* Knowledge of the perceived or measured benefits of road development
* Access to background information relating to various aspects of the biological, physical and social
environments
* Improved understanding of the importance and relevance of road infrastructure to local villagers.
Findings were incorporated into the report.
Environmental characteristics of Mozambique
Mozambique contains a varied physical and biological environment, from mountain areas in the west
and north to mangrove forests and coral reefs along the coast. Eight regions were identified as "areas
of special concern" for physical or environmental reasons.
There is some uniformity in socioeconomic characteristics across the country. A majority of the
population is poor with a significant minority considered very poor. Poverty varies across the country,
with three provinces Tete, Sofala and Inhambane, having higher percentages of their populations poor
or very poor.
The variation in environmental conditions is not correlated between environmental factors. As a result
it was not possible to subdivide or characterize the country into zones or regions with similar
characteristics. Instead individual factors need to be examined. Key factors or issues for each
province were identified.
Initial environmental evaluations of 11 Phase 1 roads
Initial environmental evaluations were completed for 11 phase 1 roads. Seven of these subprojects
were for the EN 1, the main north-south road link. The other four roads involve one primary road, two
secondary roads and one tertiary road. One of the secondary roads serves what is probably the most
isolated district capital in Mozambique, the town of Chinde.
A range of environmental issues was investigated during the evaluation of 11 IDA-financed
subprojects and 28 phase 1 subprojects being financed by other donors. These were:
* Biological and Physical Impacts
Ecology
Land use change
Erosion and sedimentation
Water quality

Investigations found that work carried out under the IDA-financed subprojects could potentially
damage the environment. The risk varied depending on subproject. Environmental management
measures were developed and environmental management guidelines presented. However, overall
potential impacts are minor and easily mitigated or managed.
None of the IDA-financed subprojects are located in sensitive ecological areas. The subprojects do not
require resettlement and no minorities are affected. In-migration (and associated effects) was
identified as a potential effect of providing improved transportation access. Specific measures to
mitigate its impact were developed. The only potential for the spread of HIV/AIDS was found to be
associated with construction workers. ANE has already developed and implemented mitigation
measures for this effect. The overall conclusion is that the subprojects proposed for IDA funding can
proceed with no significant adverse effects.

Screening guidelines
Screening guidelines were developed for the other 28 phase 1 subprojects. These considered the
range of environmental assessment issues developed for IDA-financed subprojects and identified
five primary issues for which other road projects could be screened. Using the screening
methodology revealed the necessity for a hierarchy of environmental assessment for periodic
maintenance and rehabilitation projects.
Application of the methodology reveals that five of the 28 projects have potential of causing
significant adverse environmental impacts, and were classified as being of special concern. Eleven
roads were considered to have potential for some adverse effects, while the remainder would cause
no significant effects.
Projects were classified as of special concern if they involved two of the following:
* Location in an ecologically sensitive area
* Location in an area of high erosion potential
* Location in an area of high forestry production potential.
Categorization of a road as of special concern does not mean it should not be built. However,
decision makers should note that there are potentially significant environmental issues that need to
be addressed. The screening methodology was considered a reasonable method for broad
comparative evaluation of road projects.
A methodology was also proposed for ANE to use while undertaking environmental assessment.
This consists of:
* An overview of the legislative requirements for environmental impact assessment (EIA) in
Mozambique
* A screening method, similar to that described above
* An initial assessment pro-forna to use in classifying projects for environmental impact
assessment purposes
* Where an EIA is required under Mozambique legislation, an outline of the process to be
followed
* Where no EIA is required under Mozambique legislation, recommendations for the procedures
that ANE should follow.
Environmental management guidelines
Environmental management guidelines for road periodic maintenance and rehabilitation projects
were developed. They apply to any periodic maintenance or rehabilitation project. A more
detailed environmental management guidelines document (intended for practical use) was prepared
as a separate output from this study.
The environmental management guidelines are intended to be practical for use in the field. The
guidelines therefore treat road maintenance and rehabilitation subprojects as a series of defined
activities. Analysts identify possible environmental impacts for each activity, specify mitigation
measures, and designate responsibility for implementation.
It is proposed that ANE incorporates the environmental management guidelines in contract
specifications for periodic maintenance and rehabilitation projects. Their implementation would be

IMPAU'(U
part of the road works contract and immediate enforcement would be the responsibility of the
company supervising the contract. ANE's role would be to audit the environmental management
of projects and update the environmental management guidelines when required.
It is intended that the environmental management guidelines be a live document, with impacts or
mitigation measures updated to suit field experience. The adoption of an approach based on
activity rather than area of the environment will facilitate updating.
Monitoring and evaluation
Capacity needs to be established within ANE to effectively assess and manage environmental
aspects of road construction and rehabilitation projects. This will require strengthening human
resources and additional resources to support activities for environmental management.
ANE has a fledgling social and environmental unit, the Gender, Poverty Alleviation, and
Environment Unit. The general area of the environment was recently added to the unit's
responsibility. The unit is stronger in the area of social studies, which reflects its origins.
The development of the unit into a section with a broader environmental capability is proposed.
This would require employment of a senior specialist in environmental impact assessment as part
of the unit. This person would also have a role in capacity development within the unit.
The unit would have the responsibility for determining the level of environmental assessment
required for all of ANE's work and ensuring the work is completed to an appropriate standard.
This does not mean that the unit would undertake all the work but that it has responsibility for
ensuring its quality. This can be achieved by adopting an audit and review role for the
environmental assessment or management stages of a project.
The broader environmental capabilities of ANE were also assessed, as ANE's environmental
management skills will need to extend beyond the unit. Personnel such as delegates and field
engineers or technicians to must have, at a minimum, some understanding of environmental issues.
Resource and training needs were identified. Short-term training modules in ten different areas for
ANE staff are proposed. Selected staff from the following ANE groups would participate:
*  Environment unit
*  Training department
*  Supervision department
*  Department of studies and projects
*  Provincial delegates.
Support for master's degree studies in environmental impact assessment for members of
the ANE environment unit is also proposed. A budget of is proposed for training and other
capacity building measures, as follows:
* US$203,600 for training over the life of the Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance
Program
* US$360,000 for employment of a senior environmental specialist
* US$61,000 for equipment.

Benefits and costs
The project would generate the following benefits:
* Restoration of traffic on the classified roads network
* Rehabilitation of high volume roads and mechanisms to ensure their maintenance
* Prioritization of the use of local resources and the employment of modern and efficient
planning and control systems.
The program also has benefits people living near the project roads by reducing their transport and
transit time and improving their access to services and markets. This is particularly important for
subprojects undertaken on tertiary and secondary roads.
The costs of the project are:
* Actual construction costs.
* Environmental costs. There were no significant impacts identified for the 11 subprojects
Evaluated provided the environmental management guidelines were implemented.
- Costs of development and training for ANE personnel. These total US$624,600.
The actual costs of implementing the environmental guidelines for a road project were not
estimated. Provided these are incorporated into the project design and reflected in the works
contracts then these costs would be borne by the contractors. The government would bear costs of
monitoring compliance with agreed measures and enforcing laws, regulations and covenants.
These costs are included in the development and training costs for ANE.

1 BACKGROUND
1.1 INTRODUCTION
SMEC International (SMEC), in association with Projectos e Estudos de Impacto Ambiental,
Lda (Impacto), was commissioned by the Administraccao Nacional de Estradas (ANE) to
undertake an environmental assessment of the next road sector program in Mozambique. The
program aims to rehabilitate and upgrade portions of the Mozambique road network over ten
years (2001 to 2010). It is divided into three distinct phases:
u Phase I - 2001 to 2004 for confirmed and defined projects and interventions;
Li Phase II - 2005 to 2007 for currently estimated projects and interventions; and
o Phase III -2008 to 2010 for the currently anticipated projects and interventions.
Detailed design of the individual road components will be developed gradually over this
period.
Funding is being sought from the World Bank for sections of the program. The program will
be subject to Environmental Assessment (EA) in compliance with requirements of the World
Bank and the Government of Mozambique. The EA will build on ANE's existing
environmental policy and legislation and the institutional framework developed during earlier
roads programs.
This document is the EA produced for the project by SMEC and Impacto.
1.2 THE INTEGRATED ROAD STRATEGY FOR MOZAMBIQUE
1.2.1    Historic Background
Mozambique is a large, sparsely populated country whose main economic activity is
agriculture. In the late 1980s the Government of Mozambique initiated an Economic
Rehabilitation Program to revitalise the Country's economy. The Program addressed both
external factors (for example debt rescheduling and use of foreign assistance) and also internal
factors (for example sectoral reform). A part of the Program involved activities to stimulate
the recovery and growth of the rural sector. This was aimed at improving rural incomes and
providing surpluses for urban areas and export.
These initiatives highlighted the Country's severe transport constraints and led to the
development of the Roads and Coastal Shipping (ROCS) Project. This had three elements:
1. investing in the rehabilitation and maintenance of physical infrastructure;
2. reforming the policy and institutional environments; and
3. developing institutional, organisational and human resources capacity.
58602rptO1                        February 2001                             1-1



IMPA C'O
There have been two phases in the ROCS Project, referred to as ROCS I and 2. ROCS I
concentrated on urgent road and shipping projects and initiated a long term institutional
development program. ROCS 2 implemented road rehabilitation and maintenance projects,
concentrating on the emergency opening of priority roads. It was envisaged that if ROCS 1
and 2 went well then a third phase would concentrate on the further rehabilitation and periodic
maintenance of the road network.
The Mozambique road network consists of:
Li 25,300 kilometres of classified roads;
co 10,000 kilometres of unclassified roads; and
ci 1,000 kilometres of urban roads.
Prior to the ROCS Project only three percent of the network was classified as in good
condition while 44 percent was considered not passable. Towards the end of ROCS 2 these
percentages had changed to 23 percent in good condition and only 9 percent not passable. A
third stage of the ROCS Project is now proposed. The third stage is referred to as ROADS3.
1.2.2    The Roads Policy
The Mozambique government has prepared a road policy and strategy. This identifies two
essential roles for the road network in the development of the country. Firstly to support the
movement of people and goods and the social link of production and distribution; and secondly
to ensure the development of regions and development projects which require secure links to
markets, suppliers and consumers.
The roads policy has five main areas of focus:
o  agriculture and marketing;
EL ports;
Li industry and energy;
o  tourism; and
Li employment creation.
Against this background the roads policy seeks to:
o  complete the restoration of traffic on the classified roads network;
o  continue to expand the rehabilitation of high volume roads and ensure their maintenance;
and
oL prioritise the use of local resources and the employment of modem and efficient planning
and control systems.
1.2.3    ROADS3 Strategy
The ROADS3 Program is designed to support the Government's Road Policy. It is seeking to
concentrate in four areas, institutional capacity, roads (this project), bridges and funding. A
priority list of roads has been developed for Phase I of the Program and those projects are
considered in this environmental assessment. The overall program extends over the period
58602rptO1                        February 2001                            1-2



IMPAC 'V
2001 to 2010. It is ambitious and involves expenditure of some 1.7 billion dollars ($US) over
the life of the Program.
The World Bank provided support to ANE to develop an Integrated Road Strategy for the
period 2001 to 2010. That Strategy was being prepared at the same time as this environmental
assessment by the consultants the Israel Institute of Transportation Planning and Research
(International) Ltd (IITPR). This section was developed from information provided by IITPR.
As a wholistic strategy the key aims are to integrate:
o the needs for additional rehabilitation of roads to bring them to their designed level of
service;
o the needs of the national road network to ensure country-wide and international
connectivity combined with the needs for regional and rural access to production zones and
markets;
o and link the road sector with other modes of transport;
o and involve all stakeholders in the development of the road sector strategy.
The fundamental requirement of the Strategy is sustainability focussing on two aspects of the
road management system, works and resources. On the works side priority is given to
maintaining roads that are already in good or fair condition before additional roads are added
to the network. On the resource side revenues must be collected from road users in a manner
that ensures a sufficient and assured flow of funds to cover maintenance needs.
Focussing on the road network main elements of the strategy are to:
o ensure connectivity on the priority trunk network. Priorities here include:
-   completion of an all-year, all weather and well maintained trunk road along the main
north-south corridor;
- connection of provincial capitals and the trunk system; and
-  connection between provinces.
• expand rehabilitation in the densely populated and economically productive regions of the
central and northern regions of the country. Much of this work will involve the secondary
and tertiary road network to provide people with access to markets and basic social
services;
o provide access to high priority economic poles such as agriculture, mining, industry fishing
and tourism. Commerce and trade would in particular be encouraged by development of
links to ports, rail lines and inland border crossings; and
o improve and expand rural accessibility.
A priority list of 59 rehabilitation projects was identified by IITPR. This listing excluded
periodic maintenance projects based on the strategic assumption that periodic maintenance
takes precedence over rehabilitation. The listing is further discussed in Chapter 4. It was from
this listing that the rehabilitation sub-projects proposed for World Bank funding were
developed.

1.3 THIS ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
1.3.1    Terms of Reference
The Terms of Reference (ToR) for the environmental investigations are attached as Annexure
A. The intent of these ToR was further clarified during the initial weeks of the project. In
summary the environmental project was to:
o  identify environmental (biological, physical, and social) characteristics relevant for road
maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading projects within Mozambique. Where possible
the country is to be subdivided into zones of similar ecological or social characteristics;
o  provide comprehensive environmental assessments for the Phase 1 roads proposed for
funding by the World Bank. Principal environmental issues associated with other Phase 1
sub-projects are to be identified;
o  develop guidelines for the environmental management of individual projects. These
guidelines are to be relevant for all phases of the Roads Program;
o  propose monitoring procedures, mechanisms, staff, training, equipment and resources to
ensure that the environmental factors relevant for works undertaken under the Roads
Program are implemented; and
oi ensure that proper guidelines, procedures, information flows and capacities related to
environmental matters are put in place at the project development stage.
The findings of the investigations were reported in three documents:
1. this environmental assessment report, which is the main output;
2. an environmental management plan guide. This identifies environmental impacts and the
means of control and mitigation; and
3. a training program.
A significant constraint for the project was the short time within which the project was to be
completed. The project commenced on 1 October 2000 and the environmental assessment
report was to be completed by 20 December 2000. This was a very tight program given the
size of the project and the logistical difficulties in travelling within a country the size of
Mozambique.
The Phase I road sub-projects and the sub-projects proposed for World Bank funding were
selected by others prior to and during the environmental studies. The sub-projects were
selected as an output of the ROADS3 Strategy and included inputs from ANE and the World
Bank. Selection was based on a range of factors including road location and condition,
strategic importance, cost and the expected rate of return of the investment in the road.

2 METHODOLOGY
2.1 EA STRUCTURE
The EA report was structured to contain seven Parts plus a series of Annexures.
i   Executive Summary
This section presents a summary of the document.
ii   Part A  Introduction
The introduction (in three chapters) presents:
o an overview of the road strategy for Mozambique and the aims of the EA;
co the methodology used to undertake the EA; and
o3 the institutions and legislation applicable to the EA.
iii   Part B Description of the Phase 1 Roads Program
The description of the roads program has two chapters. The first chapter describes the
derivation of the Phase 1 Roads and identifies the road sub-projects considered for this
Phase. The type of Work proposed for each project is also described.
The second part describes the existing condition of the Phase I roads and the types of
work proposed. A more detailed description is provided for the Phase I roads proposed
for World Bank funding.
iv   Part C  SEA of the Roads Program
Part C is a Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) examining the overall roads
program proposed for the next 10 years. It includes:
oL an overview of the environmental characteristics of Mozambique concentrating on
those areas potentially affected by the roads program. A detailed environmental
description is included as Annexures B, C and D to the main document and a brief
summary is included in the text;
oL an overview of the environmental effects associated with the different categories of
road projects; and
oL a screening level analysis of the non World Bank Phase I road sub-projects
examining broadly their potential to cause significance environmental impacts.
This leads to a discussion of a method for screening sub-projects and types of
environmental assessment.
An outline environmental management plan to eliminate or mitigate identified adverse
environmental effects is presented in Part D. This plan was developed from the
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             2-1

detailed investigations completed for the Initial Environmental Evaluations but was
prepared to be applicable to any periodic maintenance or rehabilitation project.
v   Part D  IEE for Phase 1 Sub-projects
Part D contains an environmental assessment of the Phase I World Bank projects.
These take the form of an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) for each project. The
projects involving the EN 1 were examined in a single evaluation.
The IEEs are included as Annexures E and F to this document which contains a
summary of the evaluations.
Outline environmental management proposals are presented, applicable for the
construction of any of the projects.
vi   Part E Monitoring and Enforcement
This section examines the capacity of government agencies and private environmental
industry to implement the identified environmental management requirements. It
concentrates on the capacity of ANE but also considers other agencies. The capacity
of the local private environmental industry to fulfil specific roles (for example on-site
environmental management or auditing/monitoring of specific projects) was also
considered.
vii   Part F Conclusions
This part presents a summary of the project's benefits and costs.
The report also contains a series of Annexures presenting either detailed information
(environmental overviews and the individual IEE) or supporting information such as the Terms
of Reference and references.
2.2 CONSULTATION
Consultation with a range of people and organizations was undertaken during the course of the
environmental investigations.  Consultation for the project generally involved arranging
meetings with government and non-government organizations and by impromptu discussions
with local villagers and chiefs during field inspections. Tables 2.1 and 2.2 summarise the
consultation undertaken.
Consultation materials included a short briefing note that was distributed to most of the people
contacted. A copy of the briefing note is contained in Annexure G. A more detailed briefing
paper was prepared for the Ministry for the Coordination of Environmental Affairs (MICOA).
The outputs from the consultation included:
o improved understanding of the roles of both government and non-government agencies in
developing and maintaining road infrastructure;

o knowledge of concerns relating to the adverse effects of road development;
o knowledge of the perceived or measured beneficial effects of road development;
u access to background information relating to various aspects of the biological, physical and
social environments; and
Eo an improved understanding of the importance and relevance of road infrastructure to local
villagers was obtained from impromptu discussions and meetings during the field
inspections.
These outputs were incorporated into the text of this report. Grateful acknowledgment is made
to all the people who made their time freely available, often at very short notice.

2.3 FIELD INSPECTION
Eleven of the Phase I road sub-projects proposed for World Bank funding were surveyed
during the course of three field inspections. These inspections were:
o An initial field trip was undertaken to investigate construction techniques used on road
projects in Mozambique. An experienced roads engineer undertook this field inspection
over the period 31 October to 3 November 2000. Road construction projects on the EN 1
north of Vilanculos were visited.
L3 A field trip surveying roads north of Beira was conducted over the period 4 November to
14 November 2000. A team consisting of an environmental engineer, an ecologist, an
environmental scientist and a social scientist undertook this trip. Roads examined were
the:
- EN 215 from the corner of EN 1/215 to Maringue;
- EN 8 from Nampula to the corner of EN8/104 (lapala); and
-  EN 224 between Quelimane and Chinde. Because of difficult access, most of this road
was examined from the air using a small aircraft. The initial 14 kilometres of road
from Quelimane to the village of Mucupia was also surveyed from a combination of
bicycle and tractor.
During this field trip discussions were also held with government and non-government
organizations in Gorongosa, Beira, Chinde, Quelimane, Nampula and Pemba. Informal
discussions were also with local village representatives located along the road routes.
L3 A second field trip was conducted over the period 20 November to 27 November 2000.
Roads examined were the ENI from Maputo to Inchope and the ER 405 from Ch6kwe to
the border with Maputo province. During this field trip discussions were also held with
government and non-government organizations in Inhambane, Massinga, Pambarra and
Muxungue.
A variety of information was recorded during the field inspections including:
Li land use along the road route;
Li the existing condition of the road formation (width, type of drainage, materials used);
oi ecological communities alongside the roads;
Li the type of crops observed growing adjacent to the road; and
ci the density and type of habitation (for example villages or scattered farms).
This information is contained within the individual IEEs for each project.

3 INSTITUTIONS AND LEGISLATION
3.1 MOZAMBIQUE LEGISLATION
3.1.1    Environmental Law
In this section the legal framework for environmental management in Mozambique is
summarised. The key elements of the framework are the:
o National Environment Management Program
o Environmental Law
o EIA Regulations
o EIA Guidelines
These elements are discussed in the following sections. Also of relevance to road projects is
the Land Law. This is also outlined in this section.
3.1.2    National Environmental Management Programme (NEMP)
The National Environmental Management Programme (NEMP), approved by the Council of
Ministers in 1995, seeks to promote and implement sound environmental policy. It was
formulated by the Ministry for Co-ordination of Environmental Affairs (MICOA) as the master
plan for the environment in Mozambique. It contains a National Environment Policy, a
proposal for Framework Environmental Legislation and an Environmental Strategy.
The NEMP consists of Sectoral Plans, for the medium and long term, which are intended to
lead to sustainable development in Mozambique. Three policy areas are defined Rural, Coastal
and Urban. For rural areas, agriculture and forestry issues are considered the most important.
In coastal areas mangrove degradation, coastal pollution and erosion are the main issues to be
addressed. For urban areas the degradation of sanitation systems and poor water quality are
the most urgent issues.
MICOA has been given the authority to oversee the implementation of the NEMP. As part of
this authority environmental rules and regulations are being devised and enforced. MICOA
also needs to evaluate the policies of other ministries as well as their capacity to promote and
implement sound environmental policy.
The implementation of the NEMP requires a range of actions at all levels and across sectors.
In accordance with the NEMP, MICOA, in close co-ordination with other ministries, private
and civil groups, is working towards the:
o  development of inter-sectoral policies for sustainable development (including roads);
o  development and promotion of integrated resource-use planning;
o  promotion of sector legislation and of establishment of norms and criteria for
environmental protection and sustainable use of the country's natural resources; and
o  creation of conditions for law enforcement and environmental monitoring.

IMPA 'C0
3.1.3    The Framework Environment Law
The Framework Environmental Law was passed by the Mozambican Parliament in July 1997.
This law acknowledges the responsibility of the Government of Mozambique in the promotion
and implementation of the National Environmental Management Programme. The aims of the
Law are to provide a legal framework for the use and correct management of the environment
and its components and to assure the sustainable development of Mozambique.
The Environmental Law is applicable to all public or private activities, which may influence
the environment either directly or indirectly. Salient features of the Law include:
o  Those who pollute, or in any way degrade the environment, are liable and under obligation
to rehabilitate the environment or to compensate for the resulting damage.
u  The Law forbids the pollution of the soil, subsoil, water or atmosphere by any polluting
substances, or any other form of degradation of the environment, which fall outside the
limits stipulated by the Law.
L  The Law also forbids the importation of dangerous residues or dangerous waste, except for
that contained in specific legislation.
L  Projects and operations that are likely to have a negative impact on the environment are
subject to an environmental impact assessment by independent assessors.
The Law also forbids all activities that may threaten the conservation, reproduction, quality
and quantity of biological resources, especially those in danger of extinction. To protect
environmental components that have a recognised ecological and socio-economic value,
environmental protection zones can be created. These protected zones may be national,
regional or local and may cover land areas, lakes, rivers, marine waters and other distinctive
natural zones.
Licensing of activities that are liable to cause significant environmental impacts is required.
The issuance of an environmental license is dependent on an appropriate level of
environmental impact assessment being completed and accepted.
A National Commission for Sustainable Development (NCSD), linked to the Council of
Ministers, was created by a provision in the Framework Environmental Law in October 2000.
This was to ensure the effective co-ordination and integration of sectoral policies and plans related
to environmental management at the highest level.
3.1.4    EIA Regulations
The Framework Environmental Law establishes the regime of environmental licensing based
on an environmental impact assessment. Decree no. 76/98 of 29 December 1998 defines EIA
Regulations for Mozambique. The Regulations are contained in 19 Articles. Key Articles are
outlined below.
Article 2 specifies the scope of application. The provisions contained in the Decree are
applicable to all public or private activities that may have a direct or indirect impact on the
environment. Activities that relate to emergency situations resulting from natural disasters are
exempt from the requirement for an environment impact study. They must, however, receive
the guidelines from MICOA and may be subject to a later audit.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             3-2



IMPA  70'
Under Article 3 MICOA's responsibilities include the power to:
a) issue and publicize general directives on environmental impact assessment procedures;
b) approve Terms of Reference proposed by an activity's proponent which will guide the
environmental impact studies;
c) undertake reviews of environmental impact studies, in collaboration with interested
public entities, civil society and affected communities; and
d) issue environmental licenses based on the EIA.
To begin the environmental impact assessment the proponent must present the following
documentation to MICOA (Article 4):
a) a description, location and characterization of the activity;
b) an executive summary of the project; and
c) data on the environment where the activity is located.
All activities not covered in the appendix of the EIA Regulations (discussed below) but
capable of causing significant environmental impact, are subject to a pre-assessment
undertaken by the MICOA (Article 5). The pre-assessment will determine whether or not an
environmental impact study is necessary.
Article 6 refers to the contents of an environmental impact study. The preparation of an
environmental impact study and monitoring program is entirely the responsibility of the
proponent of the activity. An environmental impact study must contain at least the following:
a) geographical location of the area of influence of the activity, as well as a description
the baseline environmental situation;
b) a description of the activity and its alternatives, in the planning, construction, operation
and (in the case of a temporary activity) de-commissioning phases;
c) a comparison of the alternatives and a prediction of the environmental impacts of
each alternative;
d) identification and assessment of mitigation measures;
e) an environmental management program, including the monitoring of impacts, and
accident prevention and contingency plans; and
f) identification of the team that carried out the study.
The environmental impact study must also contain a non-technical summary covering the main
issues and conclusions for purposes of public consultation.
Article 7 refers to public consultation. The public consultation process, including mechanisms
for receiving petitions, must be publicised by a proponent so that it reaches all affected
stakeholders. MICOA must call for public hearings whenever the scale or likely effects of the
project justify, or when this is requested by affected parties, public or private.
Article 8 establishes the criteria for assessing a proposed activity. The criteria are:
a) "The number of persons and communities affected;
b) The ecosystems, plants and animals affected;
c) The location and size of the area affected;
58602rptO1                           February 2001                               3-3



IMPAC')U
d) The duration and intensity of the impact;
e) The direct, indirect, potential, overall and cumulative effects of the impact;
f) The reversibility or otherwise of the impact."
Article 9 deals with the review procedures of the environmental impact study. On receipt of an
environmental impact study MICOA undertakes a technical review provided that the EIA
process is in compliance with the norms established in the EIA regulations. The review is
undertaken on the basis of the Terms of Reference approved during the pre-assessment period.
Based on the review the MICOA makes a decision on the environmental viability of the
proposed activity.
An Appendix in the EIA Regulations lists activities which may have significant impact on the
environment and which require environmental impact studies. Activities relevant to road
projects are:
2. "Clearing, dividing and exploiting the natural vegetation cover of individual or cumulative
areas greater than 100 hectares.
13. Building of new road alignments with a unit cost higher than 100,000 USD per kilometre.
14. Building of new bridges with a span equal to or greater than 250 metres.
19. Programmes and projects that imply the permanent or temporary displacement of populations
and communities.
21. Plans, programmes and projects that may affect, directly or indirectly, sensitive areas such as
a) coral reefs
b) mangroves
c) natural forests
d) small islands
e) zones of potential erosion, including dunes along the coastline
f) areas exposed to desertification
g) conservation or protected zones or areas
h) wetlands
i) zones where the habitats and ecosystems are in danger of extinction
j) zones of outstanding landscape beauty
k) zones of archaeological, historical and cultural value that should be preserved, zones where
plant or animal species threatened with extinction are located
1) ground waters used for public consumption
m) areas for the protection of spring and water sources."
3.1.5     EIA Guidelines for Road Projects
MICOA is currently (at December 2000) preparing specific guidelines for the environmental
assessment of road projects. The guidelines will cover both road construction (new roads) as
well as rehabilitation projects. These guidelines were not at a stage of preparation where an
outline of their requirements could be incorporated into this document.

3.1.6    Land Law
The Mozambique Land Law is of relevance to road sector EIA. This may apply where land is
acquired for road construction, including related purposes such as borrow pits.
The Land Law (1998) determines that all land is State owned and therefore may not be sold. It
also makes provision for the demarcation of particular areas for total or partial protection.
Riparian and coastal habitats are specifically identified to require conservation and
management.
The Land Law includes provisions for the participation of local communities in the
management of natural resources, conflict resolution, the land titling process and the
identification and registration of the areas they occupy. Local communities occupying land
according to customary practices acquire the rights over land except where it is reserved for a
particular purpose or where it is contained within a Partial Protection Zone. Mozambican
nationals who have used a parcel of land continuously for a 10 year period may also acquire
the rights to use and benefit from that land.
Individuals or associations (national and non-national) may also acquire rights for land based
on the authorisation of a formal request. The latter includes a formal consultation process with
local communities and requires that other land users be identified, and agreement obtained
(signatures from three to ten members of the community) for the requested land use. Although
community participation is encouraged it remains in the hands of provincial administrators to
ensure that it happens. One problem with this procedure is that rural communities may not be
aware of their rights under the Land Law.
3.2 MOZAMBIQUE INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN EIA
3.2.1   Identification
There are a number of different government sectors responsible for the management of natural
resources in Mozambique. Similarly different ministries or departments administer their
environmental responsibilities differently. This section concentrates on the Ministry for the
Coordination of Environmental Affairs (MICOA) as the main organization responsible for the
environment. Other ministries with a role in environmental assessment or management of road
projects are ANE (as proponent or funding body) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development. ANE was the commissioning Department for this project and its capabilities are
discussed in Part E.
The National Directorate of Forestry and Wildlife and Provincial Services of Forestry and
Wildlife are under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The Directorate and
Services are responsible for the management of forest resources and their products. These
groups may get involved in road projects because of the potential for increased exploitation of
resources when access into an area is improved.
Other Ministries may get involved but only where a road project directly influences something
in their sphere of operation. For example if a road project had a potential to affect a mineral
deposit then the Ministry of Natural Resources and Energy may become involved.

The Ministry for the Coordination of Environmental Affairs (MICOA) is responsible for
implementing the National Environmental Management Program and associated environmental
policy and legislation. The Ministry, as indicated by its title, has as its primary function, a
coordinating role. The responsibilities of MICOA are:
o to revise and develop policies and sustainable, inter-sectoral development plans;
Li promote sectoral legislation;
Li co-ordinate policy implementation;
Li educate and promote public awareness; and
o create regulations
During the five years of its existence MICOA has been working on the development of its
organization. Currently, MICOA comprises five National Directorates each headed by a
National Director. The Directorates are:
LI Environmental Impact Assessment;
oi Management of Natural Resources;
o Land Planning;
Li Promotion of Environmental Awareness; and
c] Planning.
MICOA is also responsible for regulating and overseeing environmental impact assessment
(EIA) procedures in Mozambique. All projects likely to have significant environmental
impacts are obliged by the new Environmental Law to carry out an EIA prior to authorisation.
Key areas of MICOA activity include:
u Environmental Impact Assessment
o Environmental Audit And Inspection
La Environmental Quality Standard
Li Environmental Management Plans
o Environmental Education And Training
These are discussed below.
i   Environmental Impact Assessment
Regulating Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) is one of the most important roles of
MICOA. This role requires significant interaction and coordination with other government
sectors involved in development and investment projects and, consequently MICOA has
assumed a much more visible and higher profile.
ii   Environmental Audit and Inspection
Environmental audit and environmental inspection are the tools specified in the Environmental
Law for the control of activities that were in operation before the passing of environmental
58602rptO1                        February 2001                            3-6

legislation in 1997. They also cover all activities since 1997 that were implemented with or
without an environmental licence.
MICOA has started to draft environmental audit and inspection regulations for internal
discussion and future external consultation. The present versions of the draft regulations
require technical review and improvement prior to submission to the Council of Ministers for
approval.
iii   Environmental Standards
Since 1997 MICOA has been developing environmental quality standards through the
Environmental Quality Standards of Mozambique Projects (PEPA) with the following
objectives, to:
o define and prepare adequate environmental quality standards for the country; and
o prepare regulations through the establishment of a national committee. The regulations
must be submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval.
Draft environmental standard regulations have been prepared and discussed with
representatives of relevant agencies. The draft is still undergoing revision before submission
to the Council of Ministries.
iv   Environmental Management Plans
The National Institute of Physical Planning (INPF) was, until recently, responsible for urban
and rural planning (mainly the former). After several years of negotiations, the INPF has been
integrated into MICOA as the National Directorate for Land Planning (DNOT)
v    Environmental Education and Training
As a co-ordinating ministry, MICOA is not only responsible for the development of
environmental capacity within its own organization, but for the development for the
environmental capacity of relevant agencies in Mozambique.
MICOA has two administrative units that are largely dealing with human resources: the
National Directorate for Environmental Promotion and Education (DNPA), and the
Department for Human Resources (DRH).  The DNPA  is responsible for developing
environmental awareness campaigns and, in principle, evaluating training needs outside of
MICOA.
3.2.3    MICOA and Other Ministries
Legislation stipulates that it is MICOA's role to coordinate, assess, control and evaluate the
utilization of the natural resources of the country, and in doing so, to promote their
preservation and rational use.
Due to its role as a coordinating ministry, MICOA's performance depends to a large extent on
the degree to which it manages to co-operate with the other ministries and sectors (including
58602rptO1                        February 2001                            3-7

the roads sector) as these sectors remain responsible for the integration of environmental
matters in their own sectoral program. This means that MICOA has to establish a working
relationship with each of the sectors that deal with the environment. Due to the interlinked and
variable character of the environment the significance of the working relationship will vary.
ANE and MICOA should be important partners in dealing with road rehabilitation and
construction throughout Mozambique.
MICOA and the other ministries and sectors are still defining roles, positions and modes of co-
operation.  This in general, has taken time and historically there has been a limited
coordinating role for MICOA with, at times, periods of limited co-operation. The situation has
gradually improved. At the end of 1999, with the closing of the first mandate, MICOA had
become an accepted Ministry. The challenge for the second mandate will be that the Ministry
further consolidates and strengthens its acquired position.
Resolution 5/95 gives MICOA the responsibility for the elaboration of by-laws and regulations
for implementation of the Environment Law. MICOA is also responsible for adjustments to
laws and regulations of sector ministries in order to make them consistent with the
Environment Law. ANE is currently cooperating with MICOA in establishing the rules and
norms for environmental management in the roads sector. Draft environmental directives
("directivas") have been drawn up by ANE and MICOA. The latter will be approved by way of
a "ministerial diploma".
3.3 WORLD BANK REQUIREMENTS
World Bank policy establishes the need to undertake environmental assessment of all World
Bank financed projects. The purpose of the policy is to ensure that development proposals are
environmentally sound and sustainable and that environmental consequences are recognised
early and taken into account in project design. The Bank also recognises that different types of
environmental assessment will be required depending upon the scale and nature of the funding
proposal.
The terms of reference for this project were complex and required environmental assessment at
two levels. These were to:
o identify typical environmental impacts resulting from roadworks in the distinct biological,
physical and socio-economic zones of Mozambique; and
o carry out comprehensive environmental impact assessment on specific Phase I investment
program sub-projects.
The approach adopted was to undertake an environmental assessment at two levels. The first
was a sectoral environmental assessment (SEA). This was to broadly examine the overall
Phase I program and develop assessment guidelines for projects to be developed during Phases
II and III. The second approach was to undertake initial environmental evaluations (IEE) of
the Phase I sub-projects proposed for World Bank funding.
World Bank definitions for these two types of assessment are reproduced below.
SEA. "An instrument that examines environmental issues and impacts associated with a particular
strategy, policy, plan or program, or with a series of projects for a specific sector (e.g., power,

transport or agriculture); evaluates and compares the impacts against those of alternative options;
assesses legal and institutional aspects relevant to the issues and impacts; and recommends broad
measures to strengthen environmental management in the sector. Sectoral EA pays particular
attention to potential cumulative impacts of multiple activities." (World Bank Operational Policy,
OP 4.01, January 1999)
IEE. "In many cases, a more limited environmental analysis is appropriate. This type of study,
referred to as a summary environmental evaluation (SEE) or initial environmental evaluation (IEE),
focuses on specific impacts and their mitigation. While SEEs and IEEs are often the only EA
analyses applied, their function is also to determine what additional EA work needs to be done."

IMPACTO
4 THE ROADS PROGRAM
4.1 IDENTIFICATION
The roads program aims to rehabilitate and upgrade portions of the Mozambique road network
over ten years (2001 to 2010). It is divided into three distinct phases:
Phase I - 2001 to 2004 for confirmed and defined projects and interventions;
Phase II - 2005 to 2007 for currently estimated projects and interventions; and
Phase III - 2008 to 2010 for the currently anticipated projects and interventions.
This environmental assessment and the development of an integrated road sector strategy
(further discussed in Chapter 1) were undertaken at the same time.  To enable the
environmental assessment to proceed ANE and its consultants the Israel Institute of
Transportation Planning and Research (International), Ltd (IITPR) prepared a preliminary list
of priority projects. Forty three projects were identified. Fifteen of these projects were
identified by ANE to be suitable for World Bank funding. These projects are described in
Table 4.1. These projects were examined in specific environmental assessments which are
provided in Annexures E and F and further discussed in Part D of this report.
Some of the projects listed in Table 4.1 were later removed from consideration for World Bank
funding. These were projects 18, 32 and 38. Project 29 was also divided into two and only the
section from the corner of the EN1/ER 520 to Vilanculos was considered for funding. The
roads considered in the environmental investigations were therefore more extensive than the
roads finally identified for World Bank funding. Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show the roads finally
proposed for funding (Figure 4.1) and those considered in the environmental assessment
(Figure 4.2).
A priority listing of 59 road rehabilitation projects was later developed by IITPR. The
subsequent ranking of the projects identified in the preliminary listing is given in Tables 4.1
and 4.2. As discussed in Chapter 1, periodic maintenance projects were excluded from the
priority listing as they take automatic precedence over rehabilitation.
The projects proposed for World Bank funding concentrate on the country's main north-south
trunk road, the EN 1. Seven of the projects involve sections of the EN 1 between Maputo and
Inchope. The other projects involve a mix of primary, secondary and tertiary roads. There has
been no design work completed for any of these projects. The descriptions of work provided
in this document are based on the type of work normally undertaken.
The remaining projects of Phase I are predominantly secondary and tertiary roads. Projects
from the preliminary priority listing are described in Table 4.2. The environmental effects of
these roads were examined in a screening assessment and this is discussed in Part C of this
report.
No specific projects were identified for Phases II and III.

4.2 TYPE OF WORK- PHASE I
There are two types of work proposed, either Periodic Maintenance or Rehabilitation. The
World Bank (World Bank, 1997) provides the following definition of these terms:
"Periodic Maintenance activities are typically scheduled over periods of several years and include
resurfacing and bridge repairs. Other maintenance activities considered to be periodic include
seasonal maintenance, such as snow clearing and flood repairs, emergency maintenance to reinstate
roads after major failures, and the regular upkeep of safety features and road signs."
"Rehabilitation involves more substantial intervention to strengthen a road, repair structural defects,
and restore the road to its initial condition, often after it has deteriorated to an unmaintainable state.
Rehabilitation sometimes also includes changes or improvements to previous characteristics; for
instance, by widening, making small alignment changes, or providing footpaths."
Specific activities for each of the Phase I roads examined in detail are discussed in the next
section. The work to be completed under this program excludes any bridges. Bridge
construction is a separate program under the Mozambique network development.

5 WORLD BANK PROJECTS
5.1 DESCRIPTION OF ROAD ELEMENTS
A road consists of several elements. These are shown on Figure 5.1 and described below. All
the roads for this project are two lane roads (one lane in either direction). The main element of
a road is the travelling lane, or the section normally driven on. Lane widths proposed for this
project are a minimum 3.4m for the EN 1 and a minimum 3.0rm for secondary and tertiary
roads. Adjoining the travelling lane is the road shoulder which is generally similar in
construction to the travelling lane. Shoulder widths are generally between one and two metres.
Running parallel to the road are table drains or side drains. These are designed to carry water
off the road and into the natural drainage. In areas where the road is constructed on fill the
table drain may not be necessary.
The road structure consists of three elements, the:
co sub-base. This is the lowest layer and is laid onto a prepared (shaped and compacted) layer
of in-situ material. The sub-base is of varying thickness depending upon material type, the
quality of the natural material beneath the sub-base and the volume and type of traffic
using the road. A sub-base is usually at least 0.3m thick;
u  base. The base material is of higher quality than the sub-base and usually 0.15 to 0.2m
thick. The design thickness again depends upon material type, sub-base material type and
thickness and the volume and type of traffic using the road; and
u  wearing course. This is the actual material upon which vehicles travel. For sealed roads
this can be either an asphaltic concrete layer or a bitumen seal. The latter is also referred to
as a "two-coat" seal and consists of bitumen sprayed onto the base into which select gravel
is rolled. Two separate layers of bitumen are used, hence the term "two-coat" seal. For
gravel roads the wearing course can be a select layer of gravel although the base material
may suffice.
Culverts are drainage structures located beneath the road. They convey water from one side of
the road to the other and are generally located at natural drainage lines. A culvert is usually
either a concrete or steel pipe structure.
There has been no design work completed for the sub-projects proposed for World Bank
funding. The description of road construction methodology was based on the types of work
usually undertaken.
There were also no specific materials investigations available for the sub-projects. The source
of material (gravels and sands) was derived from discussions with ANE staff. Gravel materials
are expected to be sourced from existing quarries. Sand material will be sourced from frequent
borrow pits located close to the roadworks but there was no information available concerning
specific locations. The position and size of borrow pits is determnined by the availability of
suitable material within an economic transport distance of the roadworks location.
Bridge construction or rehabilitation does not form part of the periodic maintenance or
rehabilitation work. Any bridgeworks required for the roads will be undertaken as part of
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             5-1

separate assessment and construction projects. Where relevant it was assumed that bridges
were in place when examining the effects of providing an improved transport link.
5.2 ROAD CORRIDOR OWNERSHIP
Classified roads are contained within a road corridor that is normally 30m wide. The road
corridor is owned by the State and under the authority of ANE. As previously indicated it is
envisaged that all works proposed for periodic maintenance or rehabilitation projects can be
contained within the existing road corridor. There will be no need to occupy additional land.
In towns and villages the width of the road corridor is reduced where required to suit the
existing town or village street layout. This is to avoid affecting existing buildings and the town
or village structure. A reduced speed limit in urban areas (normal maximum speed is 50
kilometres an hour) enables the reduced corridor width.
5.3 EN 1 NORTH - SOUTH TRUNK ROAD
5.3.1      Existing Condition
This section of road comprises seven of the Phase I sub-projects proposed for World Bank
funding. It includes the entire length of the EN I north-south trunk road from Maputo north to
Inchope excluding only a section between the Rio Save and Muxungue. It involves some 949
kilometres of road. Despite this length, the road is similar in condition throughout. Table 5.1
summarises the condition of the existing road travelling from south to north. Figure 5.2
presents a series of photographs illustrating the existing condition of the road.

5.3.2    Proposed Work
The work proposed for the EN 1 is to bring the road to a consistent standard with lane widths
of 3.4m, sealed shoulders of 1 .5m and effective side drains and culverts. The EN  will be
provided with an asphalt concrete wearing course up to 40 millimetres thick for the traveling
lanes and a single coat bitumen seal for the shoulders.
The total width to be cleared for work on the EN  1 is:
a  generally a nominal maximum of 15m. This is based on 3.4m lanes, 1.5m shoulders and
2.5m for each side drains. This nominal width applies where the road is at the natural
ground level;
o where the road is in cut the area to be cleared is the same as a road at ground level plus the
area of cut. That area will depend on the depth of cut and type of material; and
o where the road is in fill the width to be cleared is 9.8m plus a fill batter at a slope of two
horizontal for each one vertical (for fills up to 1.5m in height) or a slope of three horizontal
for each two vertical (for fills greater than 1.5m in height). Side drains are not provided on
areas of fill.
Generally the ENI road corridor is already established. There will be little need for additional
major earthworks or clearing.

5.3.3    Construction Methods
There are common construction activities for periodic maintenance and rehabilitation on the
EN 1. These are:
El traffic management;
o installation of erosion and sediment controls;
El vegetation removal;
oL drainage structures;
o base and sub-base reconstruction;
oL bitumen sealing of shoulders;
ii asphalt concrete;
oL line-marking and installation of road furniture; and
oL rehabilitation.
For this project significant earthworks (that is the construction of major areas of cut or fill) will
not be required.
Each of these activities is briefly described below.
i   Traffic Management
During construction along the EN 1 traffic from both directions will occasionally be confined
to one lane. Short-term gravel deviations will also occasionally need to be provided where
structures such as bridges and culverts are being repaired or lengthened. At these locations
traffic controls to manage and direct traffic will be implemented.
ii   Installation of Erosion and Sedimentation Controls
Erosion and sedimentation control measures will be installed prior to construction
commencing.
iii   Vegetation Removal
Vegetation within the road formation width will be removed to allow for:
oL widening of the travelling lanes;
oL construction of shoulders; and
oL construction of side drains.
Some clearing outside the formation width may be required at bends and curves in the road.
This is to improve sight distances for vehicles travelling on the road.
iv    Drainage Structures
Effective road drainage is an important component of any road structure. Main drainage
elements are:
58602rptO1                           February 2001                               5-4



IMPA 7TO
o side drains and mitre drains. Side drains run parallel to a road and collect and carry water
from the road surface. Mitre drains are an extension of the side drain that convey water
into natural drainage elements;
• catch drains are drainage lines constructed on the upstream side of a road to intercept water
before it reaches a road. A side drain can also function as a catch drain;
o sub-soil drains. These are slotted pipes within a filter constructed below ground level to
collect groundwater and prevent it saturating the road formation. These are provided in
sections where the road is in a cutting and also in areas where groundwater may affect the
road formation; and
o culverts are drainage structures beneath a road that convey water from one side of a road to
the other.
The work under periodic maintenance and rehabilitation involves the repair or reformation of
road drainage. Where necessary existing culverts will to be lengthened to suit the new lane
and shoulder widths. Existing bridges may also need to be widened to provide the minimum
road width of 6.8m.
v    Base and Sub-base Reconstruction
Where necessary the existing base and sub-base material will be replaced or improved.
Inferior quality base and/or sub-base materials will be modified or stabilised in-situ, then
compacted and shaped to provide the required pavement profile. The base / sub-base will be
stabilised in-situ with either bituminous emulsion and/or cement.
Base / sub-base reconstruction also includes widening the existing formation to allow for 3.4m
lanes and 1.5m shoulders.
Where necessary the existing bituminous surface will be removed. This material can be re-
used by crushing and incorporation into the base layer or recycled in the asphalt wearing
course.
vi   Bitumen Sealing of Shoulders
The road shoulders will be sealed with a single bituminous layer. Bitumen is sprayed onto the
prepared base layer and aggregate spread and rolled into the bitumen. Bitumen is supplied and
stored in 200 litre drums or bulk tanker. Aggregate is pre-treated with a creosote product prior
to spreading.
vii   Asphalt Concrete
Asphalt concrete is laid using a special machine. The basic steps are to apply a "tack" coat of
bitumen to the prepared and shaped base and then lay the asphalt using the machine. The
machine basically mixes and prepares the asphalt concrete and lays it onto the base at a
predetermined thickness. The asphalt concrete is then finished by rolling with a roller.

IMPA  'VU
viii   Line-marking and Road Furniture
The final steps in the road construction are to mark on the road lanes (a centre line and two
edge lines) and install road signs and guard rails.
ix    Rehabilitation
Following, and progressively during construction, completed work areas will be rehabilitated.
Examples of areas to be rehabilitated include:
o exposed faces of cut batters, fill batters and side drains;
o construction compounds (for example aggregate stores, equipment and machinery stores);
o temporary construction camps; and
o temporary detours or deviations.
These areas will be restored to as a minimum their pre-construction condition.
5.3.4    Construction Materials
Construction activity on the EN 1 will require the following materials:
i   Crushed Rock Base
Generally crushed rock base material will be sourced from existing quarries in Maputo
Province, Panbarra Quarry near Vilanculos and Xiluvo Quarry near Inchope. These quarries
will also supply the asphalt and bitumen seal aggregates.
Base and sub-base material for the section from Muxungue to Inchope will be crushed rock
from the Xiluvo Quarry.
ii   Stabilised Sand Base
For the EN 1 between Maputo and the Rio Save the base material will consist of borrow pit
sand stabilised with the addition of either a mixture of bitumen emulsion and cement or cement
by itself. These materials are added at proportions of 4-5% emulsion plus 1% cement or,
where only cement is used, 3% cement.
iii   Sub-base Material
The sub-base material for the paved or surfaced roads will consist of borrow pit sand stabilised
with the addition of cement (2 or 3% by weight).
iv    Asphalt Concrete and Bitumen
Bitumen materials for asphalt concrete and the bitumen seal is procured in drums and bulk
tankers, usually from South Africa. Bitumen emulsion for addition to base or sub-base is
procured from South Africa also in drums or bulk tanker.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             5-6



IMPACtIV)
v    Cement
Cement is normally procured in 50 kilogram bags from plants in Mozambique (at Maputo,
Dondo or Nacala) or from South Africa.
vi Water
Large volumes of water are required during road construction. Water is used for a variety of
construction activities such as:
o addition to sub-base and base materials. These materials have specific requirements for
water content to facilitate construction;
o addition to bitumen to form a bitumen emulsion;
o dust suppression; and
o worker use.
Where possible water is pumped from rivers. Where surface water is not available sumps are
dug into the dry beds of rivers to access groundwaters.

A high traffic growth is expected for five of the roads. This indicates a growth rate higher than
historic growth. A low traffic growth, indicating a fall in the historic rate, is expected for the
ER405 and ER455.
5.4.2    ER 405: Maputo Province to Ch6kw6
i   Existing Road
The condition of this road is variable. Travelling south from Ch6kwe the road is a single lane
track, occasionally wider. The road crosses very wet areas and there was standing water
adjoining much of the road length. The road gradually deteriorates becoming a single lane
track crossing wet areas. The last six kilometres of the road was unable to be traversed as it
became too wet. Figure 5.3 illustrates the existing road condition.
ii Proposed Work
The work proposed for this road is to provide a basic two-lane road, width 6.Om with no
formed shoulders. Much of this road will have to constructed on fill to maintain the road
structure clear of the wet areas. In wet areas the road formation is built by placing material
from the edge of the existing road and extending the road progressively.
iii   Construction Materials
The sub-base and base materials for this road will be borrow pit sand stabilised with either, or
both, cement and emulsion,

i   Existing Road
This road consists of a single lane track extending from the intersection with the new
Gorongosa to Caia Road through to Maringue. It is consistent in size and condition throughout
its length. Very little remains of the original road structure and the road surface generally
consists of in-situ material although there were sections with a coarse sand surface which may
have been imported material. The road contains no drainage structures. Figure 5.4 illustrates
the existing road condition.
ii   Proposed Work
The work proposed for this road is to provide a basic two-lane road, width 6.Om with no
formed shoulders. There are several small watercourses to cross and culverts will be provided
at each crossing.

5.4.4    EN8: Nampula to lapala
i   Existing Road
This road has been recently constructed to provide a gravel road with nominally 3.2m lanes
with narrow or no shoulders. Effectively side drains were available along much of the road
length. The last 20 kilometres of the road were being re-constructed at the time of the field
inspection. Work on the road has included a major deviation to the west of Namina where the
road follows the railway track between Namina and Mutivaze. A second deviation of the road
was to the west of lapala where the road heads south-east from lapala initially before turning to
the north-east to reconnect with the existing road to Ribabue. Figure 5.5 illustrates the existing
road condition
ii   Proposed Work
The basic formation for this road has been constructed over the last year under a separate
contract. That contract has involved clearing, constructing drainage (side drains and culverts),
placing the sub-base and placing a partial base course. Under this project, it is proposed to
complete the base course layer and seal the travelling lanes with a two-coat seal. The
pavement width will be 3.2m lanes with 1.Om shoulders.
iii Construction Materials
The base material for this road will be sourced from quarries established for the previous road
construction. Bitumen will be sourced in bulk tanker or 200 litre drums. Sealing aggregate
will be sourced from an existing quarry at Namialo, about 80km west of Nampula.
5.4.5   EN 224: Quelimane to Chinde

The Quelimane to Chinde road is in variable condition. Travelling from north to south the
following road sections were evident:
o Quelimane to River languene crossing. The road here is in reasonable condition and
nominally two lanes with a sand surface;
o River languene to River Mucarau. A major river crossing is required at the River
languene. The road does not cross the River Mucarau but a major bend in the road adjoins
the river. From the air this section of road appeared to be a single lane road and water lay
at or close to the surface;

o River Mucarauto to River Nhangone. This section appeared to be a reasonable, sand
surfaced road up to two lanes wide. It passes through the village of Micaune.
o River Nhangone to Chinde Bay. The road here is narrow, degrading to a walking track.
Two major river crossings are required at the River Nhangone (there appeared to be a
collapsed bridge here) and the River Inhamiara. The last few hundred meters of track
crosses mangroves on the edge of Chinde Bay.
The existing road passes through flat country containing, or formed by, the deposition of
material from several river systems. Figure 5.6 illustrates the existing road condition.
ii Proposed Work
The work proposed for this road is to provide a basic two-lane road, width 6.Om with no
formed shoulders. The road will require three major bridges, over the languene, Macaranto
and Nhangore Rivers. These structures do not form part of the work for this project,
iii Construction Materials
The sub-base and base materials for this road will be borrow pit sand stabilised with either or
both cement or emulsion.

The environmental assessment team could not visit these roads. The following descriptions
were reproduced from information provided by ANE.
The works proposed for all four roads is to provide a basic two-lane road, width 6.Om with no
formed shoulders.
i   EN 239: Nametil to corner of EN239/60
This is a secondary gravel road that is currently badly degraded. The road runs over silty sands
that form good to fair sub-base materials. There are no gravel sources for this road and
construction materials will be borrow pit sand stabilised with either, or both, cement or
emulsion.
ii   ER 455: Estima - Magoe
This is a tertiary gravel road that is currently badly degraded. The road runs over silty to sandy
gravel materials that provide a good sub-base. There are no existing quarries but there are rock
sources in the area that could be developed to provide gravel for base and wearing surface
materials.
iii EN 221: Bene - Fingoe
This is a secondary gravel road that is becoming seriously damaged. There are no existing
quarries but there are rock sources in the area that could be developed to provide gravel for
base and wearing surface materials.

iv    ER 572: Meconta - Corrane
This is a tertiary gravel road that is currently badly degraded. The road runs over silty to sandy
gravel materials that provide a good sub-base. There are no gravel sources for this road and
construction materials will be borrow pit sand stabilised with either, or both, cement or
emulsion.
5.4.7    Construction Methods
The construction activities for periodic maintenance and rehabilitation on the other Phase I
roads will be similar to those described for the EN 1. These are:
Li traffic management;
o installation of erosion and sediment controls;
o vegetation removal;
o drainage structures;
o base and sub-base reconstruction;
o installation of road furniture; and
o rehabilitation.
Each of these activities was previously described.
The only road that is to be sealed is the EN 8 between Nampula and lapala. This will have a
two-coat seal which involves spraying bitumen onto the prepared base layer and spreading and
rolling aggregate into the bitumen. Bitumen is supplied and stored in 200 litre drums or bulk
tanker. Aggregate is pre-treated with a creosote product prior to spreading. Two separate
coats of the seal and aggregate are applied.
5.5 COMMON CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES
5.5.1    Borrow Pits for Sand
Sites for borrow pits are selected using the following criteria:
o location on marginal or disturbed land;
o proximity to the road works. A maximum haul distance of five kilometers and a site more
than 1 OOm from the road formation are preferred;
o material quality. Sand quality is very consistent throughout the lowlands of Mozambique.
Finding suitable material is usually an easy task; and
o the agreement of the traditional landowners is obtained, although legally all land is owned
by the Government.
Current management practices for borrow pits include:
o clearing vegetation from the site. This is usually pushed in piles using a bulldozer and
burnt;
58602rptO1                         February 2001                            5-11



IMPAC' LI
o stripping and stockpiling topsoil for later spreading over the borrow pit area prior to re-
vegetation. In most areas a layer of unsuitable material referred to as overburden,
underlies the topsoil. This consists of sand mixed with organic material including roots.
The topsoil and overburden layer is up to 0.5m deep. A bulldozer is usually used to strip
topsoil and overburden;
o in most borrow pits sand is won using an excavator. It is loaded onto dump trucks for
hauling to the road construction site;
o borrow pit side slopes of up to a maximum slope of 45 degrees are used; and
o after a borrow pit is used it is restored by respreading the topsoil and organic layer and
replanting. This leaves an area that is lower than surrounding land. Sometimes a borrow
pit is used for the disposal of unsuitable pavement materials, including existing sub-base or
base material which has proven unsuitable. This material is spread in the borrow pit and
covered with the topsoil and overburden material.
The presence of groundwater will normally cause the working of a borrow pit to be stopped.
Pumping of water from a borrow pit, to allow the continued winning of material is
uneconomic. It is also usually not necessary due to the availability of sand of consistent
suitable quality over a large area of Mozambique. Normally the borrow pit operation is moved
sideways once excessive groundwater is encountered.
5.5.2    Construction Camps and Works Compounds
Construction camps will need to be provided for workers on each of the road projects. Works
compounds for storage of equipment and materials will also need to be provided. The location
of these facilities is left to the construction contractor to select but is subject to the formal
approval of both ANE and provincial authorities. Basic location requirements for camps and
compounds are:
o they must preferably be located in already disturbed areas;
o the location must not affect people living in their vicinity; and
o they must not require significant alterations to natural drainage patterns.
All sites must be rehabilitated after construction is complete.
Generally for the road lengths involved in the Phase I sub-projects only a single main
construction camp will be required. Where the road length exceeds lOOkm a second, smaller
construction camp may be provided.

6 ENVIRONMENTAL OVERVIEW
6.1 SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
6.1.1    Broad Description
Mozambique is a large country located in south-east Africa sharing borders with Tanzania,
Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. It has a land area of 784,090 square kilometres
(kM2) and an Indian Ocean coastline in excess of 2,700 kilometres long. Mozambique gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
The population of Mozambique according to the 1997 national census was 15.3 million. The
population growth rate is 2.2 percent per annum which will result in a Mozambican population
in 2004 of about 18 million inhabitants. Approximately 35 percent of Mozambican's are under
the age of 30 years of age. The age structure is as follows: 0-14 years constituting 46% of the
population (male 4,141,915 and female 4,115,191); 15-64 years constituting 51% of the
population (male 4,324,102 and 4,868,518 female); and 65 years and over 3% of the
population (male 184,606 and 243,595 female). Household sizes are large at 5.5 members, and
the ratio between economically active and passive members (less than 15 years or more than
60 years) of the population is high with a dependency ratio of 1:1.
Mozambique is a relatively sparsely populated country with an average population density of
19 persons per km2. Some Provinces such as Niassa have population densities below 10
persons per km2. The most populous Provinces are Nampula with 2,977,233 inhabitants and
Zambezia with 2,891,809 inhabitants. The greatest population concentration is to be found in
Maputo Province in the contiguous urban area of Maputo City and Matola City where
approximately 20 percent of Mozambique's population live. Most Mozambicans, over 80
percent, live in rural areas.
6.1.2    Administration & Economy
Since the peace accords of 1992 and the first general elections of 1994 Mozambique has been
successful at establishing and maintaining political stability. The 1999 elections were close
with the ruling party FRELIMO receiving 52.3 percent of the vote. The result also divided the
Provinces of Mozambique politically between support for FRELIMO (Maputo, Gaza,
Inhambane, Niassa, and Cabo Delgado Provinces) and support for RENAMO (Sofala, Manica,
Zambezia, and Nampula Provinces).
At independence, in 1975, Mozambique had extremely limited trained human resources to
draw upon. Nevertheless, the first Government of Mozambique under the political party
FRELIMO adopted policies, which drew heavily on Marxist ideology, succeeded during the
first five years of independence to make significant progress particularly in the education and
health sector. This progress was abruptly halted with the beginning of an armed struggle
instigated from outside the country, which ultimately lasted for almost fifteen years. During
this period Mozambique's infrastructure was extremely badly damaged with economic damage
estimated at $20 billion (10 times annual GDP in 1992).
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             6-1



IMPAC' L
The peace accords signed in 1992 followed by general elections in 1994 laid the foundation for
a period of recovery in Mozambique, which can only be described as dramatic. Even before
the elections of 1994 FRELIMO had adopted more market orientated economic policies. Since
1994 the liberalization of the economy has continued. The main effects have been to privatise
many previously state run enterprises and encourage significant foreign investment into the
country. Economic success has resulted in an annual growth rate as defined by gross domestic
product (GDP) in the last three years of 8.8, 9.7 and 7.3 percent respectively. Inflation has
fallen from almost 50 percent in 1996 to a current level of below 6 percent.
Despite significant economic growth international aid remains absolutely essential to the
Mozambican economy. Development assistance levels are falling more slowly than had been
predicted. Grants and loans to Mozambique declined from $1,141 million in 1995 to $835
million in 1998 and are believed to have fallen to $800 million in 1999. With the near total
phasing-out of emergency assistance, food aid and resettlement assistance, there has been a
shift towards longer-term development goals. The assistance provided in 1998 consisted of
$593 million (71 percent) in grants (of which $448 million was bilateral), $93 million from the
European Union and $52 million from the United Nations system. The remaining $238 million
comprised loans, of which $133 million came from the World Bank. One third of donations
and all loans are for investment projects while nearly one third of grants are direct balance-of-
payment support to the Government.
Mozambique remains one of the most aid-dependent countries in the world. Declining aid
levels and the recalculation of GDP meant that aid in 1999 was only 19 percent of GDP,
compared to 49 percent in 1995. This is still well above the average for sub-Saharan Africa (7
percent in 1997) and for low human development countries (10 percent in 1997).
6.1.3    Poverty and Food Security
An estimated 80 percent of Mozambicans live in rural areas. Of this group, 98.5 percent have
at least some land and 90 percent gain most of their living through subsistence agriculture.
Nearly all use only a hoe as their main farming implement and fewer than 10 percent use
fertiliser or incorporate irrigation practices. Raising the productivity of peasant farmers is
considered critical to combating poverty while securing their land occupancy rights is seen as
the essential first step.
The food security and nutritional status of inhabitants in the Northern Region of Mozambique
are the highest in the country due to the occurrence of relatively fertile soils and good rain
conditions. The Central and Southern Regions are characterised by lower food security and
nutritional status due to poor soils and lower rainfall amounts. Farm sizes in the Northern
region on average are greater (greater than two hectares) than the Central and Southern regions
(less than one hectare). Poor agricultural production over large areas of the country has
resulted in the dynamic that 98 percent of crop production is subsistence and small holder
based with only 16 percent of households having a surplus stock of produce to sell
commercially.
Despite impressive economic growth, Mozambique remains one of the 10 poorest countries in
the world. The First National Poverty and Well-being Assessment, published in 1999, showed
that 69 percent of all Mozambicans live in poverty, with poverty higher in rural areas (71
58602rptO1                         February 2001                              6-2



IMPAC'fO
percent) than in urban areas (62 percent). There are considerable variations in poverty rates
across Mozambique. The Central Region consisting of Sofala, Manica, and Tete Provinces has
the highest poverty rate (74 percent). The poorest Provinces in Mozambique are Sofala (92
percent), Tete (82 percent), and Inhambane (82 percent).
Mozambique was ranked 169 of 174 countries in the human development index for 1997.
Increasing life expectancy, higher enrolment rates and rising GDP are beginning to push up the
human development index at an increasing rate, with improvements of more than 3.5 percent
expected for both 1998 and 1999. Mozambique is well below the sub-Saharan average for
most development indicators. Approximately two-thirds (69%) of the population fall into the
category of poor (live on an income of less than US$1 a day), one-third of the population is
considered to be very poor, which translated into monetary terms means they live on less than
40 US cents a day.
6.1.4    Health
Mozambican life expectancy at birth is estimated at 42 years. Infant mortality per 1,000 live
births is 134. Malaria, measles, diarrhoea, and acute respiratory infections are the biggest
killers of children. Nutritional status is low with national estimates of stunted growth high at
10.8 percent of infants indicating excessive levels of malnutrition. One of every six children
born in Mozambique has a low birth weight, defined as less than 2.5 kilograms. Low birth
weight typically reflects poor health or nutritional status of the mother during pregnancy.
The war cut Mozambique off from the neighbouring States, and delayed the arrival of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic, although the return of refugees and the new opening to trade led to rapid
change. Malaria remains a bigger killer, and adult HIV infection rates are about 15 percent,
significantly less than in some neighbouring States (South Africa 25%, Zimbabwe 26% and
Malawi 23%).
Mozambique was unable to make the maximum use of the extra window of opportunity, and
HIV/AIDS gained real prominence as an issue only in 1999. One reason for the rising
prominence was the increasing death rate, at present over 60,000 per year, and the recent
acknowledgment of AIDS as the cause of death in the obituaries of prominent people.
The national strategic plan to combat sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS was
approved in 1999, and aims to keep HIV/AIDS levels at 17 percent of the adult population.
Even so, the impact of the rising incidence of HIV/AIDS on the country will be dramatic. In
the absence of effective measures to curb the spread of the virus, new projections suggest that
by 2005 there will be 150,000 adult deaths and 20,000 child deaths each year. This will
actually reduce life expectancy in Mozambique from the present 42 years to 37 years, and will
halve the rate of population growth. The number of orphans caused by AIDS will exceed
700,000 by 2005. The economic impact is expected to be significant; peasant-farming families
(the majority of the population) will have fewer workers and more dependants, while industry
and the state apparatus will lose skilled people.
6.1.5    Services
Mozambique's education system is divided into pre-primary school and educational schools.
Schools consist of general, technical or professional, and higher education. General education
58602rptO1                        February 2001                            6-3



IMPA CO
consists of two levels. Primary education consists of 7 years of schooling divided into two
levels. Level I up to grade 5 (EPI) and level two from grade 6 to 7 (EP2). Secondary
education consists of five years divided into two cycles, first cycle secondary from grade 8 to
10 (ESG1) and second cycle from grade 11 to 12 (ESG2). Approximately two-thirds (67.8%)
of households live in villages with a primary school. In contrast, only two percent of
households live in villages with a secondary school.
Access to basic communications services, such as a post office or public telephone, is
extremely limited, with only three percent of rural households living in villages with such
services. The most commonly available services are markets and transportation services.
Medical services, other than traditional healers, are remote with households averaging 20 to 30
kilometres from a health post and 45 kilometres from a doctor. Below twenty percent of rural
households live in villages with a nurse, midwife, health post, or health centre and only two
percent of households live in a village with a doctor.
Access to clean drinking water for most Mozambicans is a major problem. Currently only 12
percent of the rural population have access to a piped water supply and 31 percent have a
latrine in their home, compared to 66 and 68 percent, respectively, in urban areas.
6.1.6    Summary Statistics
Summary statistics for the Provinces of Mozambique are presented in Table 6.1. The statistics
used were population density, staple food production, poverty and health care availability.
These were selected to determine if there were differences in basic socio-economic
characteristics across the country. Some distinguishing characteristics are:
o Population density is variable. The Northern Region has two of the most densely
populated provinces (Nampula and Zambezia) but also the least populated (Niassa). The
Central and Southern Regions (excluding Maputo Province) are relatively consistently
populated with a population density between 11 and 19 people per square kilometre.
o Staple food production is variable but lowest in the Southern Region. Farm sizes tend to
be larger in the Northern Region and this, combined with above average yields for some
staples, indicates the greater food security of this area.
L  Three provinces are clearly distinguished. Tete, Sofala and Inhambane are much poorer
than the rest of the country. More than 82% of the population in these provinces is classed
as poor and 54% as very poor. Maputo City and the Province of Cabo Delgado are the
most prosperous areas.
u Health care availability is variable. It is greatest in the Southern Region where 39% of
people have access to a Health Clinic. It is lowest in the Central Region where only 14%
of people have access to the same level of service.

6.2 BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
6.2.1    Flora
i   Vegetation Types
In Mozambique the main broad vegetation type, based on structure, is savanna woodland. The
most common woodland type is miombo covering much of Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Nampula,
Zambezia, Sofala, Manica and Inhambane Provinces. There are several different types of
miombo determined by variations in rainfall and soils.
The second most extensive woodland is mopane woodland occurring in the Limpopo-Save area
and in the mid-Zambezi Valley.
Together these two types of woodland cover approximately 70% of Mozambique.
Other vegetation types include:
o Acacia woodland. There are two extensive areas of Acacia woodland, a southern formation
(in the area of Moamba, Magude and Guija) and a central formation running approximately
in a north-east direction through Manica and Sofala Provinces;
o  dune forest on high dunes along the coast between Ponto do Ouro and Bazaruto Island;
o  sub-littoral woodland occurs in the sub-littoral zone between Ponto do Ouro and Macia
inland from the dune forest;
o  lowland palm savanna in coastal areas containing badly drained soils of Nampula, Sofala
and Inhambane Province;
o  vegetation on alluviums in the Zambezia Delta and the lower Limpopo and Nkomati
valleys. A seasonally-inundated lowland formation (the Gorongosa "tandos") links the
Zambezi Valley with the Pungue River in the south via the Urema trough (Rift Valley);
and
o mangroves are well developed in the northern and central sectors of the coast and less so
along the southern sector.
ii  Indigenous Production Forest/Woodland
Several of the Mozambique woodland forest types contain valuable hardwood tree species.
Around 19,000 square kilometres has been identified as high and medium potential for forest
production. These areas occur mainly in the northern and central provinces. One of the
densest forest formations occurs on the Cheringoma Plateau, between Beira and Caia, in Sofala
Province.

IMPA LT
iii   Plant Conservation Status
The conservation status of Mozambique's flora is imprecisely known. A preliminary estimate
indicates that, of the 5,500 plant species recorded for the country, some 247 plant species in 67
families may be of conservation concern.
6.2.2    Fauna
i   Terrestrial Mammals
Mozambique has rich diversity of mammal fauna; 211 terrestrial mammal species and 11
marine mammals have been recorded.
Only one mammal species considered endemic to Mozambique, a white-bellied red squirrel
confined to Namuli Mountain. There are several endemic sub-species including the blue
Niassa Wildebeest, a sub-species of Burchell's Zebra and Johnson's Impala. All three sub-
species occur in the Niassa Reserve.
Although the mammal species diversity is high, the populations of these species, especially the
larger mammals, have been significantly reduced both inside and outside of protected areas
due to lack of enforcement during the armed conflict (1981 - 1992). Gorongosa National Park
and Marromeu Reserve suffered massive declines in large mammal such as elephant, buffalo
and waterbuck. Niassa Reserve in northern Mozambique was less affected by the armed
conflict. This is the only protected area that still supports significant populations of large
mammals such as elephants, buffalo, sable antelope, greater kudu and leopards
At a national level several large mammal species are believed to be extinct or on the verge of
extinction. These include the black and white rhino, giraffe, roan antelope, tsessebe, the
mountain reedbuck and the African wild dog.
ii   Birds
Approximately 900 species have been recorded for southern Africa. Of these 581 have been
recorded in Mozambique. There are a number of near endemic and restricted range species,
mostly associated with isolated montane habitats such as Gorongosa, Chimanimani, Chiperone
and Namuli Mountains.
The freshwater and marine wetlands of Mozambique are important sites for migratory and
resident aquatic bird species. One of the most important wetland sites in Mozambique is the
Zambezi Delta where over 50 species of aquatic birds have been recorded. The Delta supports
numerous vulnerable and threatened bird species of global concern.
The conservation status of the birds of Mozambique is currently being determined. A
preliminary estimate indicates that at least 24 bird species are of conservation concern.

IMPA C'O
iii   Reptiles
One hundred and sixty reptile species (including marine turtles) have been recorded for
Mozambique. The conservation status of reptiles, with the exception of sea turtles, is largely
unknown. Three endemic reptiles are known for Mozambique the flat rock lizard (Chimanimani
Mountains) and a new snake and gecko species (Pebane coastal forests).
One snake species, the African Rock Python is believed to endangered and is protected by law.
All five species of Indian Ocean sea turtles nest on beaches along the Mozambique coast. These
are the Loggerhead Turtle, the Leatherback, the Green Turtle, the Hawksbill Turtle, and the Olive
Ridley Yurtle. All species are protected in Mozambique.
iv    Amphibia
The amphibia of Mozambique are not well documented. The Natural History Museum has
records of only 39 species. Thirty-five amphibian species were recorded for the Chimanimani
Massif of which two are endemic.
v    Riverine Fish Fauna
Only fish species in the major river systems such as the Zambezi, Limpopo, Pungue and
Nkomati Rivers have been documented. The lower Zambezi has by far the greatest fish
biodiversity. The conservation status of fish species in Mozambique is not known.
6.2.3    Protected Areas
i   Gazetted Protected Areas
Mozambique possesses a number of protected areas in different categories. Their numbers (in
parentheses) are National Parks (4), Game Reserves (5), Controlled Hunting Areas or Coutadas
(13), Vigilance Areas (2) and Forest Reserves (16).
A new Forestry and Wildlife Law (1999) recognises three categories of protected areas
o National Parks
o National Reserves
o Historical - Cultural Use Zones
The current protected areas will be reviewed and where necessary reclassified according to the
new law.
ii   Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs)
The Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCA) Project is being implemented by the National
Directorate of Forestry and Widlife. The project is developing conservation areas that will
straddle national boundaries. A TFCA is defined as a relatively large region of land
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             6-8



IMPAL'IU
incorporating one or more recognised conservation areas. The idea is to develop these areas in
an integrated fashion for both conservation and also the economic benefit of local communities
without loss of biodiversity.
Three TFCAs based an biodiversity and social criteria are being developed:
1. The Lubombos TFCA is located in southern Mozambique, Maputo Province. This is
contiguous with the Tembe and Ndumo Reserves in South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal).
2. Gazaland TFCA is located in south-west Mozambique, Gaza and Inhambane Provinces.
This area is contiguous with Kruger National Park in South Africa and Ghono-Re-Zhou
National Park in Zimbabwe. The Gaza TFCA covers 20,700 km2 and includes three main
conservation areas, Zinave National Park (3,700 kM2), Banhine National Park (7,000 kM2)
and Coutada 16 (10,000 kM2). The latter is contiguous with the Kruger National Park in
South Africa. In November 2000, the Government of Mozambique signed an agreement
with the Governments of South Africa and Zimbabwe to incorporate Coutada 16 into an
expanded transfrontier national park to be named the Gaza-Kruger-Gono-Rhe-Zou (GKG)
Transfrontier National Park.
3. Chimanimani TFCA is located in western Manica Province. This area is contiguous with
the Chimanimani National Park in Zimbabwe. The area is recognised for it's high
biological value.
6.2.4    Areas Of Outstanding Value
Eight areas of outstanding ecosystem, biological and/or scenic value were identified as part of
the environmental investigations. These warrant special attention and are:
i   Gorongosa Mountain - Rift Valley Complex.
This area encompasses the isolated massif of Gorongosa Mountain and the southern-most
section of the African Rift Valley. The mountain supports montane forests and heath
grasslands on its summits. Several endemic and near-endemic plants and animals occur within
the mountain's habitats.
The Rift Valley in Mozambique is a floodplain ecosystem comprising a variety of wetlands
habitats. The diversity of habitats in the Rift Valley makes it one of the finest wildlife grazing
ecosystems in Africa. The southern portion of the Rift Valley is protected within the
Gorongosa National Park.
ii   The Cheringoma Plateau
The Cheringoma Plateau comprises tropical forests containing a mixture of local endemics
with Equatorial and southern African flora. The forest on the Plateau contains several
commercially important hardwood species.

IMPA LW'
iii   Zambezi Delta Grasslands and Swamps
The Zambezi Delta covers an area of about 18,000 km2. The Delta is of great socio-economic
and cultural value. Marromeu Buffalo Reserve is located on the southern portion of the Delta.
In addition to buffalo, elephants, water buck and reedbuck are found in the Delta although their
numbers have been much reduced by hunting.
The Zambezi Delta represents an important wetland for resident and migratory bird species.
Wetland scientists believe that the Zambezi Delta qualifies as a Wetland of International
Importance under the Ramsar Convention.
iv   The Great Inselberg Archipelago
This series of habitats occurs south of the Lurio River occupying a rectangular area
approximately 500km by 160km. This Inselberg archipelago presents a remarkable landscape
of tall granite core remnants in a savanna plain. Several of the montane areas have high
biodiversity moist forests.
v    The Chimanimani Massif
The Chimanimani Massif although relatively small in area is characterized by an exceptionally
high diversity of habitats and species. The Massif supports a rich endemic flora. Endemic
fauna are two frogs and one reptile. Large mammals are well represented in the area and
include: buffalo, eland and sable.  Over 160 bird species have been recorded for the
Chimanimani Massif some which are considered endemic to the Afro-montane regions of
eastern Africa.
There are well preserved Rock Paintings throughout the area depicting all the local and
lowland big game of the region.
vi   The Maputaland Centre (MC) of Endemism
The MC (26,734 km2) is defined as that part of southern Mozambique and north-eastern Natal.
It is bounded in the north by the Inkomati-Limpopo River, in the west by the western foothills
of the Libombos, in the south by the St. Lucia estuary and in the east by the Indian Ocean. It
contains extensive wetland areas.
The MC flora comprises 2,000 to 3,000 species of which at least 168 species/infraspecific taxa
are endemic/near-endemic to the Centre. Of the more than 472 species of birds in the MC, 47
subspecies are endemic/near-endemic.
vii   Coastal Barrier Lakes
A characteristic feature of the Ponta do Ouro to Bazaruto coast is the extensive system of
coastal lakes which occur behind the dunes. The coastal lakes provide habitat for many bird
species.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                            6-10



IMPALT O
Besides their importance biologically these coastal systems have a high scenic value. A
proposal has been developed to declafe the Maputaland wetlands (between Ponta do Ouro and
Inhaca island) a Natural World Heritage Site.
viii   Pebane Evergreen Coastal Forests
The Evergreen Coastal Forests in northern coastal Zambezia Province are of high biological
importance. A new (and possibly endemic) tree species was discovered in these forests in
1998.
A rich and diverse reptile fauna occurs in the coastal forests of Pebane. In 1998 two new
reptile species were discovered; a new snake and a new dwarf day gecko. The two new reptile
species are, at present, endemic to the area.

6.3 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
6.3.1    Topography
Mozambique can be divided into three broad topographic regions: north, central and southern.
The northern part of Mozambique is a mountainous block with maximum elevations along the
western border. Several of the country's highest mountains occur in this area including Mts.
Jeci, Chiperone and Namuli (2,054, 1,836 and 2,419m above sea level respectively). From
these western heights the land slopes gently eastwards towards the Indian Ocean.
The central region is dominated by the Zambezi Valley and Delta. In the interior, in Tete
Province, the rims of the Valley are mountainous, reaching elevations of 2,095m at Mt. Domue
on the border with Malawi. The Rift Valley bisects the Zambezi River in a north-south
direction near Caia and continues south to Nova Sofala. The Rift Valley is still experiencing

IMPACT'V'
tectonic movement causing seismic events that mainly affect central and north-western
Mozambique.
The southern part of the country, south of Beira, comprises a broad coastal plain mostly below
a height of 200m backed by mountains along the western national border. Along the western
border with Zimbabwe, the land rises up sharply to form the Chimanimani Mountains where
the highest elevation in Mozambique is attained (Mt. Binga at 2,436m).
6.3.2    Geology and Soils
i   Geology
The following brief summary describes the basic geology in age sequence.
A Pre-Cambrian basement complex (about 600 million years old) comprising granitic and
migmatic gneisses covers almost the entire northern and central western areas of the
Mozambique. This is in the provinces of Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Zambezi, Tete and parts of
Nampula and Manica. In the Provinces of Niassa, Nampula and Tete and, to a lesser extent,
Cabo Delagdo, towering outcrops of granite rock (known as inselbergs), rise sharply above the
plains. The oldest rocks are Pre-Cambrian granites, quartzites and schists (more than 1,600
million years old) of the Chimanimani Mountains along the Zimbabwe border.
In the centre of the country the Karroo system (350 - 130 million years old) is represented by
basalts that run north-east between Espungabera (on the border with Zimbabwe) and the
Zambezi River. In the south the same system forms rhyolites and basalts associated with the
Libombo Mountains along the border with South Africa.
Cretaceous red sandstones and mudstones run approximately northwards from Gorongosa
Mountain to the Zambezi River. Red sandy clays and clays are produced from the weathered
products with a calcium rich sub-soil.
To the south-west of Beira and to the west of the sandy plains are Marine Cretaceous
sandstones. These are the source of hydrocarbon minerals.
Late Tertiary sandstones (7-26 million years) occur in sub-littoral Inhambane Province and the
Cheringoma Plateau.
Quartenary to Recent non-sedimentary sands and alluviums, occur through much of southern
Mozambique south of Beira and the Zambezi Delta.
ii   Soils
The northern and some parts of the central and western areas have red soils of varying texture
(from light sandy soils to clay loams). These are associated with the Pre-Cambrian granitic
basement complex.
58602rptO1                         Februaiy 2001                            6-13



IMPA CLI
Low fertility red soils occur in Sofala Province north of Beira (Cheringoma Plateau) and
between Inhambane and Vilankulos.
Yellow sandy soils of marine and aeolion origin, very low fertility, cover large areas of
southern Mozambique. These are associated with the Quaternary formations.
Alluvial soils occur in the Umbeluzi, Maputo, Incomati, Limpopo and Zambezi river basins.
Though prone to salinization, particularly in delta areas, these soils have a high potential for
agriculture.
Lithic soils are associated with montane areas (e.g., the Libombos and Chimanimani
Mountains and the granitic inselbergs of northern and central Mozambique. Due to slope,
shallowness of soil ands high rainfall there is a high potential for soil erosion in these areas.
6.3.3    Climate
There is great variation in mean annual rainfall across the country. Most of the coastline receives
750 to 1,000 mm of rain per year. The north of the country is generally more humid than the
south except for the Zambezi Valley, in Tete Province, which receives less than 600 mm
average annual rainfall. In the south, rainfall decreases rapidly travelling inland and annual
rainfall in the interior of Gaza Province is less than 400mm. There are a series of very humid
pockets associated with montane areas e.g, Mt. Binga, Mt. Gorongosa and Mt. Namuli which
receive more than 2,000mm of rainfall per year.
Although mean annual rainfall varies markedly at different locations, there is a striking similarity
in rainfall patterns during the year. There is a distinct rainy season between November to March
followed by a distinct dry season between April and October. This rainfall pattern is characteristic
of savanna biomes in general.
Cyclones are generated in the south-west Indian Ocean some of which reach the Mozambican
coast especially in February and March. Over the last forty-five years, there were 24 cyclones
that strongly affected the north-central sector of the Mozambican coast. A combination of high
rainfall followed by Cyclone Eline that swept inland through central Mozambique in February
2000 resulted in catastrophic flooding and damage to road and railways in the Nkomati,
Limpopo and Buzi River floodplains.
6.3.4    Hydrology
Thirty-nine major rivers drain into to the Indian Ocean along the 2,700 km coastline. Salient
features of the main rivers, from north to south, are described below.
In the north the Rovuma River, with a catchment of 155,400 km2 forms the border with
Tanzania. The Rovuma is the third largest river in Mozambique. The Messalo, Montepuez,
Megaruma, Lurio, Mecuburi and Monapo Rivers discharge along the northern coast in Cabo
Delgado and Nampula Provinces. These rivers have seasonal flows and sediment loads are
low. Consequently, marine turbidity is low and extensive coral formations occur in the coastal
waters.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                            6-14



IMPA C'U
The major perennial rivers of Zambezia Province are the Licungo (Lugela), Raraga, M'iela,
Molocue, Ligonha and Meluli. The largest, the Licungo has a catchment of 22,726 km2 and is
336 km long. The other rivers are significantly smaller.
The most important River in Mozambique is the Zambezi. The Zambezi River enters
Mozambique at Zumbo where it immediately swells into the impoundment of Lake Cahora
Bassa. For much of its course between Tete and the delta, the bed of the Zambezi is between
one and five kilometres wide. At Chupanga the Zambezi begins to spread over a vast
triangular area known as the Zambezi Delta which covers an area of about 18,000 km2. The
most important tributary of the Zambezi is the Shire River, which drains Lake Malawi via the
Rift Valley. The huge dual impoundments of Kariba and Cahora Bassa are believed to have
affected the downstream flooding regime and the ecology of the Delta.
The Pungue River rises in Zimbabwe and discharges into the Indian Ocean south of Beira,
collecting numerous tributaries en route. The most important of these is the Urema River
which flows southwards through the Gorongosa National Park. The Pungue River forms the
southern boundary of Park.
The Buzi River rises in Zimbabwe and receives several major tributaries in the upper
catchment most notably the Lucite and Revue Rivers. It shares a common estuary with the
Pungue River south of Beira.
The Gorongose River (not to be confused with Gorongosa National Park) drains 13,150 km2 of
lowland flowing through swampy lands for 100 km to the muddy coast south of Beira.
The Save River forms the common boundary between Sofala and Inhambane Provinces. The
River is impounded in Zimbabwe and is now seasonal.
There is little surface water in most of the interior of Inhambane Province. The southern
portion of the Province is drained by the Inharrime River system via Lake Poelela.
The Limpopo River, in southern Mozambique, is the country's second largest river. Flows in
the Limpopo River are extremely variable and it is often dry over long sections during the
winter. Between the South African border and Macarretane, just above Ch6kwe, the floodplain
is narrow. At Macarretane the river flow is checked by a barrage which controls the flood
waters to some extent. From Macarretane the floodplain widens as the river approaches its
confluence with the Changane near Chibuto. Thereafter it meanders over a broad swampy
floodplain to the coast where it discharges through a narrow break in the dunes.
The major rivers of Maputo Province are the Maputo, with a catchment area of 29,800 km2,
flowing from Natal in South Africa; the Umbeluzi with a catchment of 5,622 km2, flowing in
from Swaziland; and the Nkomati which drains some 45,875 km2 and enters from South
Africa. These Rivers discharge into Maputo Bay. There are multiple impoundments in the
upper reaches of the Nkomati River in South Africa and it is now a seasonal river in
Mozambique. The Umbeluzi is impounded near Boane (the Pequenos Libombos Dam which
was filled in 1989) and now floods irregularly in its lower reaches.

IMPAL'f()
6.3.5    Land Use
In comparison with neighbouring countries, the population density of Mozambique is
relatively low (19 individuals per kM2). Most of the country still comprises natural/semi-
natural vegetation. The major land use is agriculture. Agricultural production comprises two
main socio-economic sectors: the small-scale family sector (the majority of the rural
population) and the commercial sector (mainly large companies).
i   Small-scale Family Farming Sector
The planting of crops in small plots (I to 5ha) derived from secondary or primary woodland by
slash and burn is the most common agricultural practice for the family sector. It is estimated
that approximately five percent of Mozambique is under active cultivation by the small-scale
sector. Although the percentage under active cultivation at any one time is low, the area of
natural habitat affected by small-scale farming is significantly higher. After several years of
cultivation soil fertility declines and a new cropping area is derived from natural or secondary
vegetation. The small-scale farming system comprises an arable (cropping) area as well as
fallow fields of varying ages.
In the medium altitude (200 to 1OOOm above sea level) regions of Zambezia, Nampula, Tete,
Niassa and Cabo Delagado Provinces cassava is widely cultivated.
In semi-arid regions (e.g., interior of Gaza and Inhambane Provinces and Central Tete
Province) maize is replaced by drought resistant crops such as sorghum and millet.
Cotton is an important cash crop for the small-scale sector in medium altitude regions of Sofala,
Zambezia, Nampula and Cabo Delgado Provinces. Cashews are also an important cash crop in
the these areas as well as coastal areas of Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane, Nampula, Zambezia and
Cabo Delgado Provinces. In coastal areas Zambezia and Inhambane Provinces coconut is an
important component of the small-scale sector.
In low-lying wetland areas rice is grown. This is especially important in the floodplains of the
Limpopo River, the Buzi-Pungue floodplains and the Zambezi Delta.
ii   Commercial Sector
This sector is traditionally associated with large companies dedicated mainly to specialised and
intensive agricultural production such as coconut plantations, fruit trees, tea, cotton, sisal,
sugar cane and livestock production. Several of these companies have a long historical
association with Mozambique including MADAL, Sena Sugar Estates, Companhia da
Zambezia (Zambezia Province), Marromeu Sugar Estate, Buzi Sugar Estate (Sofala Province)
and Maragra Sugar Estate (Maputo Province).
The total land area occupied by the private sector is relatively low (144,550 ha or about 0.2%
of Mozambique). However, private sector farms occupy some of the country's most fertile
soils most notably the alluvial soils of the Limpopo and Buzi/Pungue Valley and Zambezi
Delta.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             6-16



IMPALi'L3
iii   Other Land Uses
Exotic commercial forest plantations (mainly pines and eucalyptus) occupy approximately
8,000ha in high altitude areas of Manica Province.
MADAL has a I 0,000ha forest concession in Nicoadala District, Zambezia Province. Several
large forest concessions are proposed for the Cheringoma plateau in Sofala Province.
The commercial harvesting of firewood and production of charcoal (illegal and legal) for sale
in major urban areas is common in woodland and forests closer to major cities and towns.
Much of the Acacia woodland in southern Maputo Province has been devastated by firewood
harvesters.
Cattle numbers were severely depleted during the armed conflict. Cattle ranching is being
increasingly practiced in Tsetse fly free areas especially in southern Mozambique and the
grasslands of the Zambezi Delta. In semi-arid areas, especially central Tete Province, goat
rearing is an important economic activity. Goat grazing and browsing has had a severe impact
on the natural vegetation in Changara District, near the town of Tete.
6.3.6    Summary
The northern part of Mozambique is a mountainous block sloping eastwards towards the Indian
Ocean. Several rivers drain these highlands discharging along the northern sector of the coast.
These rivers have low sediment load and the sea is not turbid and corals proliferate. Towering
outcrops of granite rock ("inselbergs") rise sharply above the plains. The soils associated with
these montane outcrops are shallow rhyolites very susceptible to erosion.
The central region is dominated by the Zambezi Valley and Delta. Approximately 100km
from the coast the Zambezi begins to spread over a vast triangular area known as the Zambezi
Delta which covers an area of about 18,000 km2. The Rift Valley bisects the Zambezi River in
a north-south direction near Caia. Faulting associated the Rift Valley causes frequent seismic
events in central and north-western Mozambique
The southern part of the country, south of Beira, comprises a broad coastal plain backed by
mountains along the western national border. Most of the area is covered by low fertility
sandy soils of marine or Aeolian origin with low erosion potential. Soils associated with the
mountain ranges on the western border are shallow rhyolites very prone to erosion. High
fertility alluviums occur in the Limpopo and Nkomati floodplains.
The climate of Mozambique is mainly tropical to subtropical. High altitude areas e.g., Niassa
Province and parts of Zambezia Province experience a warm temperate climate. Rainfall varies
between 400mm in the interior of Gaza Province to more than 2,000mm in montane areas. Most
of the country receives between 750 to 1200 mm of rain per year. There is a striking similarity
in rainfall patterns during the year irrespective of location with a distinct rainy season between
November to March followed by a distinct dry season between April and October. Over the last
forty-five years 24 cyclones have strongly affected the north-central sector of the Mozambican
coast.

IMPACIV'
Most of the country comprises natural/semi-natural vegetation. The major land use is
agriculture comprising two main socio-economic sectors: the small-scale family sector (the
majority of the rural population) and the commercial sector (mainly large companies).
6.4 ENVIRONMENTAL ZONES
The three environmental overviews described the environment of Mozambique using a variety
of parameters. From these it can be seen that the Country is extremely variable in all areas of
the socio-economic, biological and physical environments. For example, 22 broad vegetation
types were identified in the biological overview. These do not necessarily correlate with other
factors such as topography, climate or underlying geology.
The project's terms of reference required that the consultant "identify typical environmental
impacts that will result from roadworks in the distinct biophysical/socio-economic zones
identified during the environmental scoping exercise". As can be seen from the environmental
overviews, the division of Mozambique into distinct zones does not occur.
A simple distinction or gradation is evident using topography. Here the Country can be
divided into lowland plains (associated with river floodplains and estuaries), highlands and
mountains. When these zones are compared with vegetation, geology or climate there is no
obvious correlation.
Socio-economic characteristics also do not necessarily correlate with either biological or
physical characteristics. For example the location of major cities or towns relates more to
historic commerce or trade links rather than productivity of the land. Niassa Province in the
north of the country has some of the Country's most productive farmland, yet it is the least
densely populated Province. Conversely Maputo Province and City have some of the
Country's least productive land but is the most densely populated Province.
Rather than considering a series of zones it is necessary to consider each environmental
parameter separately. Typical environmental issues associated with a road project need to be
identified and compared against the individual parameters used to describe the environment
(such as vegetation, soil type etc). Environmental issues associated with the Phase I sub-
projects not considered for World Bank funding are considered in the next Chapter (Chapter 8)
using this approach.
Road projects have not been identified for Phases II and III. To allow environmental screening
of sub-projects during these phases an approach highlighting primary environmental issues was
developed. Recommendations were also developed for the need and type of environmental
impact assessment during Phases II and III. This approach and methodology is discussed in
Chapter 9.

7 ROADS3 PROGRAM EVALUATION
7.1 METHODOLOGY
An evaluation of the ROADS3 Program was undertaken with the aims of:
o identifying typical environmental impacts resulting from roadworks;
o undertaking a screening evaluation of the Phase I sub-projects not proposed for World
Bank funding;
o discussing the type of environmental evaluation that may be necessary for those sub-
projects;
o recommending a future method of screening sub-projects and undertaking environmental
evaluation; and
o preparing environmental management guidelines to mitigate negative impacts.
The methodology used to achieve these aims was to first identify the types of environmental
impact that can occur when roadworks are undertaken. The types of roadworks considered
were periodic maintenance works and rehabilitation works. For these types of project a basic
road formation already exists. The environmental impacts were then categorised into primary
and secondary effects. The primary effects were used to screen the non World Bank sub-
projects of Phase I based on the information contained in the environmental overviews
(Annexures B to D). The aim of the screening was to determine if there were potentially
significant issues associated with any of the projects.
The results of this work were then used to develop screening guidelines for future projects.
Environmental management guidelines to mitigate specific impacts were also developed and
these are discussed in part D.
7.2 DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS
Environmental impacts from roads can be divided into two distinct types, direct and indirect.
Direct impacts occur along the specific road alignment largely as a result of the road
construction. These types of impact generally occur during road construction. Most direct
impacts occur along the road right-of-way or immediately adjacent to it. Examples of direct,
alignment-related impacts include:
o relocation of people living within the road corridor;
o a loss of agricultural land;
o loss of forest cover;
o soil erosion; and
o damage to ecological features such as wetlands.
For rehabilitation and periodic maintenance projects the direct impacts can be expected to be
relatively minor. The most potential for direct adverse effects to have occurred would have
been when the road was originally constructed. For the Phase I roads most vegetation

IMPACl'O
clearance along the right-of-way is complete, bulk earthworks are complete and the induced
impacts associated with road access have commenced.
Indirect impacts occur within the "region of influence" of the road generally during the road
operation phase. Indirect biological and physical impacts of a road are potentially greater than
the direct impacts, particularly for rehabilitation or periodic maintenance projects, as these are
aimed at improving an existing asset and facilitating transport links. The region of influence
over which these indirect impacts occur is dependent on the environmental issue.
The region of influence for an impact issue is largely dictated by people's use of natural
resources. For example, the region of influence that the road will have on increasing forest
resource use will be related to the ease of harvest and transport of forest resources to the
roadside and then to the market, as well as the creation of additional markets along the
roadside. Generally a distance of five kilometres from the road was used to define the region
of influence. This was based on discussions with local village representatives who indicated
that their farmlands extended up to four or five kilometres from their village. This was the
distance that they could reasonably walk to, complete some work, and return from, in a day.
Some issues required a larger region of influence. For example a road location within 20
kilometres of a protected area was considered a significant issue. Protected areas are Parques
Nacionais (National Parks), Reservas Especiais (game reserves), Reservas Parciais (partial
reserves), Regimes de Vigilancia (vigilance areas), Coutadas (areas set aside for hunting and
photographic safari) and Reservas Florestais (forest reserves). Protected areas are discussed in
more detail in the Biological Environment Overview (Annexure C).
7.3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND SCREENING ISSUES
7.3.1    Issue Identification
There are a variety of environmental issues associated with the rehabilitation and periodic
maintenance of roads. The World Bank (1994) categorised these as impacts on:
o  soils;
o  water resources;
o  air quality;
o  flora and fauna;
o  communities and their economic activity;
o  land acquisition and resettlement;
o  indigenous people;
o  cultural heritage;
o  aesthetics and landscape;
o  noise environment; and
o  human health and safety.
During the investigations for this project environmental issues were considered as either
"primary" or "secondary" issues. Not all issues will have the same degree of relevance for all

projects or types of project. The relative importance placed on different issues is a function of
the type of work, size of the project and the sensitivity of the receiving environment.
Issue categorisation for the ROADS3 Program was developed during the initial analytical work
undertaken for the Initial Environmental Evaluations for the World Bank projects. Table 7.1
summarises the issues investigated and their categorisation. Each issue is briefly described
below. The specific assessment of each road sub-project against each issue is discussed in
Annexures E and F.

i   Socio-economic Impacts
o  Direct impacts
The direct effects of road construction were identified as:
-  loss of agricultural land;
-  loss of buildings;
-  population displacement;
-  loss of natural resources; and
-  loss of cultural resources (these are discussed separately below).
These direct effects are related to the loss of land required for the road construction. The
roads examined in the IEE are existing roads and any additional land requirements are
58602rptO1                         February 2001                              7-3

small. Generally there is little potential for significant adverse impact from these direct
effects. In particular there are not expected to be people displaced or required to move as a
result of the rehabilitation or periodic maintenance works.
o  Access to Services (health, education)
The improved provision of access to services such as health and education is an objective
of the ROADS3 program.
u  Improved Access to Markets
Improved access to markets is also an objective of the ROADS3 Program. For people
living in the region of influence of the sub-projects the improved access is both for access
to markets to sell surplus production as well as improved access to imported materials.
o  In-migration of People
An indirect effect of a road project is to encourage people or companies to migrate to areas
with the improved access. This is to access both the existing resources of an area (timber,
agricultural production potential) and also the market opportunities created by the roads.
o  Health
Health effects are associated with workers who temporarily move to an area during the
project's construction period and also truck drivers and travellers who use the roads.
L  Archaeology and Cultural
The loss or damage to archaeological or cultural items is usually a direct effect of a road
construction. It occurs where the item is located within the area required for construction.
For rehabilitation or periodic maintenance projects of the type proposed there is limited
potential for significant adverse effects.
L  Construction Camps
There are a variety of issues associated with construction camps. These include:
-  competition for local resources such as firewood, wildlife, food and water supplies;
-  competition for local services such as health facilities;
-  social unrest derived from construction workers caused by factors such as greater
spending power, different ethnic groups, bad behaviour (drunkenness, crime); and
-  damage to ecology and waterways caused by poor construction camp selection and
operation.
ii    Biological and Physical Impacts
o Ecology
58602rptO1                            February 2001                                7-4



IMPAC'UO
There are two types of ecological impact, the direct loss of flora and fauna habitat caused
by clearing for the road construction and indirect or induced effects. Indirect effects
include:
- illegal exploitation of forests and wildlife resulting from improved access to an area. If
a road is close to a National Park or reserve this would be of great concern;
- the increased use of local forests and wildlife caused by in-migration of people; and
- the increased use of local forests and wildlife caused by the existing population
increasing production because of better access to markets.
u  Land Use Change
Land use change is discussed as a social issue. In that sense the main potential for change
is from the in-direct effects derived from in-migration. Those effects are separately
considered under social issues.
As a physical issue it relates to the physical change in an areas condition. For example the
use of an area as a borrow pit may preclude it from some future uses. There is limited
potential for significant change and this is considered a secondary issue.
•  Erosion and Sedimentation
Erosion hazard is determined from a combination of soil type, topography, rainfall and
construction activity. If not appropriately managed, erosion can lead to the transport of
sediment into downstream areas, either land or waterways. The effects of seismic activity
may also play a role here with a potential for landslides in hilly terrain.
•  Water Quality
Concerns about water quality relate to sediment movement and poor management of waste
waters from construction activity (sewage, workshop waste and run-off from work
compounds). During a road's operation concerns relate to the potential for spills of
chemicals or fuels, run-off from a road surface (particularly for high traffic volume roads)
and erosion from the face of cuttings or large fills. This is a secondary issue for the
ROADS3 Program provided appropriate controls are implemented for erosion and
sediment control (a primary issue) and construction practises.
u  Hydrology
Hydrologic affects are related to the alteration of river or stream channels leading to
induced affects either upstream or downstream of a disturbed area. This is a secondary
issue for the ROADS3 Program as the basic road formation already exists.
•  Noise and Vibration
Noise and vibration effects arise from both a project's construction and operation. The
ROADS3 Program examined in this document involves periodic maintenance and
rehabilitation activity. For Primary Roads (such as the ENI) there will be little increased
traffic generated as a specific result of the construction activity. On the secondary roads
58602rptO1                            February 2001                                7-5



IMPA LW
traffic volumes are generally low. There is no potential for significant adverse noise effect
as a result of the program.
• Air Quality
For the same reasons as noise and vibration, the program has little potential for significant
adverse air quality effects during a roads operation. There is some potential for adverse
effects from dust generation during a roads construction.
• Aesthetics
Aesthetic effects can be assessed by determining:
- the number of viewers of a project;
- their sensitivity. Generally people who live in an area are more sensitive to change as
they have permanent views of the change; and
- the type and extent of change.
As the roads are existing structures then the type and extent of change introduced by
periodic maintenance or rehabilitation works is small. The road projects will have little
potential for adverse aesthetic effects.
7.3.2    Primary Analysis Issues
Environmental issues considered in the analysis of the Phase I roads not proposed for World
Bank funding roads were macro-level issues. These were used to determine if there are likely
to be major impacts, adverse or beneficial resulting from the proposed roadworks, or if there
are major constraints to these roadworks.
Five primary environmental issues were identified for the analysis of the roads. These primary
issues relate to potential environmental impacts along the alignment and/or within the region of
influence. The issues are:
o erosion and sedimentation;
o ecology;
o access to services and markets;
o in-migration of people; and
o health
The potential severity of impacts within each of these issues was quantified from the
interpretation of documented site and district data and the local knowledge of the Mozambican
members of the study team. The documented data is presented in Annexures B, C and D.
Each was assessed using the following methodology.
i   Erosion and sedimentation
The potential for erosion and sedimentation was assessed using the mapping of van Wembeke
and Marques (discussed in Annexure D). Their work considered a variety of factors such as
58602rptO1                         February 2001                              7-6



IMPAC'LO
soil type and topography. Rainfall patterns are consistent across Mozambique and during the
wet season rainfalls can be intense.
ii   Ecology
The potential for adverse ecological effects was determined from consideration of:
o the proximity of the road to a reserved area (National Parks, etc);
u the proximity of the road to areas identified as "Areas of Concern" in Annexure C; and
o vegetation type.
The analysis of these factors used the data presented in the Annexures.  Wildlife is
incorporated into this analysis through the consideration of reserves. Forestry potential was
used as one indicator for the issue of in-migration and was not considered under ecology.
iii   Access to services and markets
The ability of a road to allow the potential for improved access to both services and markets
was assessed from:
o the apparent remoteness of the area served by the road. This was assessed from the
proximity of the area to towns or cities and the population density of the Province;
o whether there were alternative roads or transport means (river, ocean or rail) available; and
u the road type (whether it is a Primary, Secondary or Tertiary Road).
iv   In-migration of people
The potential for a road to encourage the in-migration of people and/or companies was
assessed from a Province's population density, the productivity of the Province, and the
forestry resources of an area. This information was largely derived from the mapping
information but also local knowledge of an area.
v    Health
This factor was determined from the potential for a road to encourage the spread of HIV/AIDS.
A single measure of proximity to major transport routes (including one end of a road joining
into a main route) was used.
7.4 PHASE I PROJECT EVALUATION
7.4.1    Evaluation
A screening level evaluation was undertaken of the sub-projects contained in the preliminary
list of priority roads that were not proposed for World Bank funding. These sub-projects were
identified in Chapter 4. Roads already constructed were excluded from consideration. Each of
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             7-7



IMPACT()
these sub-projects were assessed against each of the five identified primary issues and given a
score of:
Li minus 1 where there was a potential for significant adverse effect;
o no score or zero where no significant adverse effect was identified; or
o plus I where there was a potential for a beneficial effect.
Some comments on the assessments are:
o Erosion and sedimentation was assessed as a minus 1 where the erosion potential was in
the range medium to high even if for only part of a road length.
Li Ecology was assessed as minus 1 where the road, or part of the road, was close to a
controlled area (National Park, Forest Reserve etc.). Proximity to controlled hunting areas
was not considered a significant adverse effect on ecology.
u Access was generally assessed as a plus 1 as improved access is an objective of the project.
c In-migration was generally assessed as zero except where there were specific factors (in
addition to just improved access) that would encourage in-migration. The specific factors
identified were tourism potential and proximity to areas described as having a medium to
high potential for forestry production.
Li Health was assessed as minus 1 where the road was, or adjoined, a major transport route.
The scoring of environmental issues only provides a comparative indication between roads of
the relative adverse or beneficial impact of each issue. Tallying of these scores to provide a
single score for a road was not intended.
The assessment of the Phase I sub-projects that were on the preliminary priority listing but not
proposed for World Bank funding is summarised in Table 7.2.

The evaluation of the sub-projects leads to the following conclusions:
1. All roads, except EN 201, Salamanga to Ponto do Oura (road 6), were assessed as having a
beneficial impact from providing improved access. The Salamanga to Ponto do Oura sub-
project was evaluated as having no significant effect for access. This is because the main
populated areas on this road lie at either end. There is good access into South Africa at the
southern end and reasonable access to Maputo at the northern end.
2. Ten of the roads were identified to have a potential for significant impact for an issue in
addition to health.
3. Four roads were identified to have a potential for significant impact for two issues in
addition to health. These were:
Li EN 201, Salamanga to Ponto do Oura (road 6);
o EN 223, from the corner with the EN 223/103 to Col6mue (road 7);
o ER 516 Imala - Nacaroa (road I 1); and
o ER 490/483, Mualam to Gile (road 27).
The issues associated with these roads are discussed below.
4. Ten roads were found to have no significant issue except for health. This does not mean
that there are no environmental concerns related to periodic maintenance or rehabilitation
but that no key issues can be identified from the screening information.
Health was identified as of special concern for 15 of the sub-projects. Of concern is the
potential for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS. This is an
issue of national concern and not solely related to roads or road construction. Improvements in
road conditions are however reported to act as a conduit for an increased potential for the
spread of the disease. These sub-projects were either part of major transport link or joined into
such links and were considered of special concern. Mitigation measures for this issue are
discussed in Part D and apply to all road projects. They involve a combination of worker
education and general education. These measures can only ever be a subset of a broader
national campaign to manage the disease.
7.4.2    Roads of Special Concern
Four sub-projects were identified to be of special environmental concern as two of the four
primary issues (excluding health) were found to present specific concerns for these projects.
Each project is discussed below.
i   EN 201, Salamanga to Ponto do Oura (road 6)
Examination of this sub-project raised concerns for both ecology and in-migration. This area
was categorised as having a low potential for soil erosion. On the dune systems nearer the
coast clearing of vegetation may create problems of mass movement where unstable sands can
migrate in the direction of the prevailing winds.
The road is located either wholly or partly within the following areas of ecological concern:
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             7-11

o coastal barrier lakes. These were identified as areas of outstanding value;
o the Maputaland Centre of endemism, an area of exceptional biogeographical interest; and
o a Protected Area.
Each of these issues is discussed in Annexure C.
Improving the existing road may also encourage in-migration, more particularly through the
encouragement of tourism development.
ii   EN 223, from the corner with the EN 223/103 to Colomue (road 7)
The two issues of special concern for this road were erosion potential and in-migration.
Erosion was rated as medium to very high along much of the road based on a combination of
slope, erodible soils and rainfall intensity. In-migration is of concern as the road traverses an
area of medium to high production potential for forestry.
iii   ER 516 Imala - Nacaroa (road 11)
Ecological concerns for this road relate to its proximity to the Mecuburi Forest Reserve. The
reserve is located at the western end of the road. In-migration is of concern as the road
traverses an area of medium to high production potential for forestry.
iv   ER 490/483, Mualam to Gile (road 27)
Ecological concerns for this road relate to the road's location for much of its length within the
Gile Reserve. In-migration is of concern as the road traverses an area of medium to high
production potential for forestry.
7.4.3    Environmental Assessment Requirements
The screening analysis completed for the non-World Bank projects identifies the need for a
hierarchy of environmental assessment for periodic maintenance and rehabilitation projects.
The simple screening evaluation completed for these roads led to the identification of three
possible levels of assessment:
1. minor assessment, possibly equivalent to a World Bank Category C Assessment. This
could apply to the roads where no significant issues were identified (excluding health).
Standard mitigation measures would apply;
2. medium level assessment, possibly equivalent to a World Bank category B Assessment.
This could apply to the roads where one significant issue were identified. The IEEs
discussed in part D are examples of this level of assessment; and
3. major assessment for the roads where more than one issue of special concern was
identified.
Mozambican environmental legislation specifies the requirements for environmental
assessment of projects. The application of these requirements to periodic maintenance and

rehabilitation projects is discussed in the next Chapter. A methodology for screening and
assessment of that type of project is also discussed in the next Chapter.

8 GUIDELINES
8.1 SCREENING AND EVALUATION GUIDELINES
8.1.1    Process
Under the Framework Environmental Law it is necessary to obtain a licence from MICOA for
projects that are liable to cause significant environmental harm. A licence is issued by
MICOA after submission of an environmental impact assessment and its acceptance as
adequate.
The Regulations to the Framework Environmental Law (discussed in Chapter 3) establish a
procedure for environmental assessment. The Regulations identify specific activities that
require environmental impact studies. The activities relevant to road periodic maintenance or
rehabilitation works were listed in Chapter 3 but are repeated here:
3. "Clearing, dividing and exploiting the natural vegetation cover of individual or cumulative
areas greater than 100 hectares.
15. Building of new road alignments with a unit cost higher than 100,000 USD per kilometre.
16. Building of new bridges with a span equal to or greater than 250 metres.
20. Programmes and projects that imply the permanent or temporary displacement of populations
and communities.
22. Plans, programmes and projects that may affect, directly or indirectly, sensitive areas."
Screening guidelines for the environmental assessment of road projects can therefore be
initially considered by asking the question, "does the sub-project require a formal
environmental assessment under Mozambican legislation?" If a project falls within these
definitions then the procedure is clear, an environmental assessment must be completed in
accordance with the Regulations. MICOA is currently preparing guidelines for the preparation
of environmental impact studies for both road construction projects and also road rehabilitation
projects. These guidelines are specifically for projects covered by the Regulations.
There are periodic maintenance and rehabilitation projects which may fall outside the
definitions in the Appendix to the Regulations. For such projects the Regulations establish a
requirement for the pre-assessment of projects. The Regulations require that:
"All activities not covered by the appendix to the present diploma, and capable of causing
significant environmental impact, shall be subjected to pre-assessment undertaken by the Ministry
for Environmental Coordination"
A key aspect of this requirement is that it applies to projects that are "capable of causing
significant environmental harm". There is therefore a need for ANE to examine its road
projects to determine if they are "capable of causing significant environmental harm". If they

IMPAC IO
are then they must be assessed by MICOA to determine whether or not an environmental
impact study is necessary.
A three stage process is proposed to determine the level of environmental assessment
necessary for road projects:
1. A screening level analysis of proposed projects as part of the selection of alternative roads
to be considered for funding. This level of analysis could be similar to the analysis
completed in the evaluation of the ROADS3 program (Chapter 8). The function of this
analysis is to identify any significant environmental issues potentially associated with a
project. If the potential for significant impacts is identified it does not necessarily mean
that the project should not be considered. It is more an alert to the decision maker that
significant issues may be associated with the road.
2. After roads have been selected for investigation there are two possibilities, either the road
clearly falls within the definition of works requiring an EIA under the Regulations or it
does not. Under the first situation an EIA must be prepared as prescribed.
3. Under the second situation it must be determined if the project has a potential to cause
significant environmental harm. For that situation a pre-assessment procedure is proposed
This is discussed in the next section.
8.1.2    Pre-Assessment of Road Projects
MICOA has prepared an assessment document to assist proponents in the pre-assessment of
projects. This document is general in nature and intended to apply to any type of project. To
assist in the pre-assessment of road projects a simple pro-forma is proposed that is adapted
from the ROADS3 Program evaluation of Chapter 8. This pro-forma is intended for the use of
ANE staff to assist in ANE's environmental evaluation of projects. An outline of the pro-
forma is contained in Table 8.1. Using a different sheet for each issue may facilitate field use
of the pro-forma.
A proposed procedure for using the pro-forma would be:
o  A road project is selected for consideration that does not clearly require an EIA under the
Regulations.
Li An ANE or DEP staff member surveys the road and completes the pro-forma. This is not a
detailed survey at this stage but a simple drive along the road noting and assessing relevant
issues. In assessing the issue the surveyor only has to respond to three questions:
- is the issue of concern (ie are there local factors that mean there is potential for adverse
impacts) for the particular road section?
- is it of no concern (ie there are local factors that mean there is no potential for adverse
impacts? or
- is the surveyor unsure, or is there insufficient information to assess the issue.
The staff member completing the pro-forma does not necessarily need to be an
environmental specialist. Guidelines can be prepared to assist field staff in the completion
of the assessment and training provided.
o Completed pro-forma are sent to the Environmental Unit of ANE for review. There are
three possible actions:

IMPAC"1(U
- The road project was assessed to have no issues of concern. For these projects the
standard environmental management guidelines and Contract conditions are sufficient.
-  There were issues identified which the surveyor could not assess. In this situation a
further assessment is necessary, either by an ANE environmental specialist or an
appropriate consultant.
- There were issues identified to be of concern. For these projects the procedures of the
Regulations are then followed. The project is referred to MICOA for formal pre-
assessment and determination of the level of environmental impact study required.
8.2  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
Environmental management guidelines were developed as part of the assessment of the
specific World Bank sub-projects. These apply generally to periodic maintenance and
rehabilitation sub-projects. The guidelines are discussed in Part D, Chapters 10 and 11.

9 ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
9.1 PRESENTATION OF ASSESSMENT
Initially there were 11 road sub-projects proposed for World Bank funding.  Initial
Environmental Evaluations (IEE) were developed for these roads based on a combination of
fieldwork, field consultation, mapping interpretation, existing information and the knowledge
of the study team. IEE for each of these sub-projects are presented in Annexure E.
ANE and the World Bank later requested the inclusion of four additional roads. The brief for
these new roads specifically excluded fieldwork and associated field consultation. The IEE for
these four roads was based on published information and the background knowledge of the
study team. IEE for each of these sub-projects are presented in Annexure F.
The types of construction work proposed for the sub-projects were discussed in Part B
(Chapter 5) of this document. This Part of the report (Chapters 9, 10 and 11 ) presents:
o  a listing of the environmental issues used to assess each sub-project. These were the issues
identified in Part C;
o  a brief overview of the environment through which each road sub-project is located;
o  identification of the main potential impacts for each sub-project. This has two parts,
impacts common to all sub-projects and effects specific to particular roads. Mitigation
measures for these specific impacts are described in this Chapter following the impact
identification;
o  an outline of general mitigation and monitoring measures (Chapter 10); and
o  a discussion on the environmental management of the road sub-projects (Chapter 11). This
includes a brief discussion of areas where environmental improvements could be made in
the management of periodic maintenance and rehabilitation projects.
9.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
The environmental issues used to evaluate each road sub-project were those identified and
discussed in Chapter 7. In summary these were:
o  Physical Impacts
- Land Use Change
- Erosion and Sedimentation
- Water Quality
- Hydrology
- Noise and Vibration
- Air Quality
-  Aesthetics
o  Biological Impacts, direct and indirect
o  Socio-economic Impacts
- Direct impacts

9.3  SUB-PROJECTS, ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION
9.3.1    EN I
There were seven sub-projects located along the EN 1 between Maputo and Inchope. This is a
single stretch of the EN 1 broken only by a section between the Rio Save and Muxungue.
Work on that section of the EN 1 is being funded by the European Union. The sections of road
investigated were:
o  Maputo to Manhica
o  Manhica to Incoluane
o  Incoluane to Zandamela
•  Zandamela to Maxixe
• Maxixe to Corner ER 520/EN 1
L Corner EN 1/ER 520 to Rio Save
o  Muxungue to Inchope
These seven sections of road cover a length of 950 kilometres and extend through similar
environments. Rather than consider each road section separately it was decided to examine the
EN 1 sub-projects in a single IEE.
After leaving Maputo the environment of the EN I is remarkably homogeneous through to the
Rio Save. It crosses a series of river floodplains and is generally flat and low-lying with
wetland areas associated with the river systems. The Muxungue to Inchope section differs as
here the EN 1 has left the coastal plain and crosses more undulating terrain.
A variety of soil types are traversed. These are mostly alluvial soils which are generally sands
with some clays. The general erosion risk is low.
The road passes through a limited range of vegetation mostly consisting of disturbed miombo
woodlands. The main disturbance is associated with the traditional slash and burn agriculture.
The road does not pass through any conservation areas.
Rural production predominates throughout the study area. Main food crops include maize,
cassava, groundnuts, sorghum, beans, sweet potato and vegetables. Fruit is an important
dietary supplement throughout the region. Wildlife is present, albeit in limited numbers, and
game meat is an important food source to local populations. Use is also made of the
availability of wood for firewood, building materials and charcoal production and this has led
to deforestation. Livestock farming is very limited.
58602rptO1                        February 2001                            9-2



IMPAC'T(
The economy of the Southern Region and in particular Maputo Province has benefited from
the economic growth that Mozambique has enjoyed over the last five years. The effects of this
national economic growth are more difficult to determine at the District and family level.
There have been some tangible benefits such as improved schools, health facilities and roads.
It is more difficult to determine if individual household incomes are increasing. It is probable
that the majority of households in Southern Region have had no significant increase in
household income during the last five years despite strong national and regional economic
growth.
The floods of 2000 had adverse effects on rural households particularly in Gaza and
Inhambane Provinces. The EN 1 road was under water along several sections and the floods
also affected family agricultural output. Families affected by the floods lost on average
between one-third and one-half of all crop production but up to 20% of households in Gaza
Province lost all their crops.
9.3.2    ER 405: Ch6kwe to the border with Maputo Province
The road begins at the town of Ch6kwe, located on the south bank of the Limpopo River. The
road alignment traverses a mostly flat, lowland area for a distance of 31km travelling south
from Chokwe. Use of the road is limited to 4WD vehicles 26 km from Ch6kwe.
The major initial environmental feature is the Limpopo River Valley which is a treeless
floodplain approximately 5km wide. The floodplain is under intensive agriculture and subject
to extensive seasonal inundation.
On leaving the floodplain, the vegetation is moderately open, interspersed with scattered
homesteads and small-scale farms. This is essentially an open grassland environment with
scattered trees. Numerous small pans and wetlands occur in association with drainage lines in
this region. Remaining woodland areas consist of Acacia woodland with denser growth on the
river margins. Most woodland has been heavily disturbed by agricultural activity. There are
no nearby conservation areas.
Ch6kwd is a strong economic District, a consequence of a comparatively good transport
network, proximity to South Africa (for employment) and good natural resources. It is an area
of agricultural activity and main crops include maize, rice, cassava, groundnuts, sorghum,
beans and vegetables. Despite these district characteristics the road traverses an area that has a
very low population density. Except for Ch6kwe there were no settlements adjacent to the
road.
The area was badly affected by flooding in 2000 and at the time of the field investigations
there was still much standing water in areas adjacent to the road.
9.3.3    EN 215: Corner EN 1/215 to Maringue
This road traverses a flat to gently undulating area at altitudes between 100 and 200m above
sea level. There are no major waterways crossed by the road but there are several incised
channels for perennial streams. Soils are variable but predominantly derived from sandstones.
There is a general low potential for soil erosion.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                              9-3



IMPAL'lO
The natural vegetation of the area is dry deciduous tree or shrub savanna. Most of the
woodland has been disturbed for agriculture and the area contains a mosaic of different aged
regenerating areas. This vegetation type is typical of low hilly areas bordering this section of
the Rift Valley.
The road traverses a "Coutada" but the woodland habitat is not suitable for large game and
wildlife populations are no longer well established. There are likely to be residual resident
populations of small solitary antelope species such as duiker, steenbok, and suni. The
Gorongosa National Park lies more than 30 kilometres from the closest approach of the road.
Small farming villages are located at intervals along the road but the population density is
generally low. There are a number of cultivated areas established adjacent to the road corridor
interspersed between regenerating woodland areas. The woodland areas are periodically
cleared for agriculture through slash and burn techniques.
Cotton is the principal cash crop of this district. Maize, sorghum, millet and cassava are also
produced both as cash crops and also as subsistence crops for the local villages.
The woodlands are an important resource for the local villages providing shade, construction
materials, firewood, food from nuts and fruit, a water source during droughts and as a valuable
medicinal source. Traditional bee-keeping is also a common practice in the area. Hives made
from bark are widely seen throughout the region.
9.3.4    EN 8: Nampula to Corner of EN8/104 (lapala)
Major improvements to this road have been undertaken over the last couple of years involving
major diversions and rehabilitation. The works proposed for this project are to improve the
base course and provide a two-coat bitumen seal. No further widening of the formation is
envisaged. Consequently the further works proposed for this project will have little potential
for any significant new impacts.
This road is located in the mid-altitude region of Nampula. For most of its route the road
passes through gently undulating ground at elevations of between 420and 650m above sea
level. Spectacular granitic outcrops rising sharply from the plains are characteristic features of
the landscape. These outcrops, known as inselbergs, achieve heights of 1,500m. The road
usually lies several kilometres from the base of these outcrops except approaching lapala
where it passes over the base of Mt Malasa.
The road traverses sandy and red soils of medium to fine texture. These soils have a medium
to high erosion potential but the erosion hazard is low to medium because of the gentle
undulating topography.
Vegetation along the road is generally miombo woodland of several communities. These
include closed woodland, scattered patches of deciduous forests, tree-shrub savanna in lower
lying areas and deciduous savanna or woodland.
Two forest reserves are relatively close to the project road. The status of wildlife populations
in these reserves is uncertain. It is believed that most species are locally extinct and even the
small solitary forest-dwelling antelope (suni and duiker) may have been eradicated.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                              9-4



IMPALI'O
The road passes through the larger settlements of Mutivaze, Namina, Ribaue and lapala.
Smaller settlements are located at varying intervals along the remainder of the road.
Approximately 15-30% of the area is cultivated by family sectors with an average plot size of
0.5 to 1.5ha generally cleared by slash and burn techniques. The most commonly grown crops
are cassava, maize, groundnuts, sorghum, millet, cotton and sweet potato.
9.3.5    EN 224: Quelimane to Chinde
The Zambezi River has had a major influence on the geomorphology of the area through the
formation of the Zambezi Delta by the accumulation of sediments over several thousands of
years. The Chinde to Quelimane road passes over the Zambezi Delta throughout its alignment.
The delta's plains are flat with an intricate reticular drainage system. Near the coast tidally
influenced drainage lines with a typically sinuous pattern occur. In places the fine Aeolian
sand material of ancient raised beaches has been redistributed and superimposed on the clays
of the Delta. These features, coastal dunes and man-made levees form the only elevated areas
on an otherwise featureless plain.
The Chinde to Quelimane portion of the Zambezi Delta contains a mosaic of plant
communities that vary according to factors such as soil humidity, flooding and salinity. The
two dominant natural communities along the road are grasslands and swamps and mangroves.
Large areas of grassland and swamps occur in the Zambezi Delta. Two distinct grassland
zones occur associated with either the tidal zone or the freshwater zone.
The Zambezi Delta has the most extensive and diverse mangrove forests in Mozambique.
These provide a variety of socio-economic uses including firewood, charcoal production and
construction materials. The mangrove forests also play a fundamental role in protecting the
coast from erosion provoked by the prevailing easterly winds. The positive relationship
between the mangrove areas and production of fish and prawns is well documented.
The diversity of wetland habitats that comprise the Zambezi Delta provide ideal conditions for
large numbers of specialist wetland birds. Good grazing conditions are also attractive to large
mammals but due the long history of human settlement, there are no longer resident
populations of large mammals in this part of the Delta. Nevertheless elephant, buffalo, and
waterbuck are occasionally sighted. The road does not pass through any protected areas.
Access between Chinde and Quelimane is limited and a typical time taken to travel from
Chinde to Quelimane is 2-3 days. Areas adjoining the road support a variety of land uses.
There are five village settlements and people subsist by either or both subsistence agriculture
and/or working for Madal, an agricultural company with large concessions for both cattle and
also coconut plantations in the area.
Small-scale farms use two farming systems each associated with the local topography. This
area is characterised by narrow, elongated slightly elevated dunes, locally called "morrundas",
separated by depressions, "baixas", which lie parallel to the coast. On the morrundas the
dominant crop is coconut intercropped with cassava and beans. In the baixas rice is the

dominant crop during the rainy season and sweet potato and maize during the dry season.
Cultivation of fruit trees (mango, cashew, banana, guava and paw-paw) on the "morrundas" is
also important.
There is a large aquaculture prawn farm belonging to a French company located adjacent to the
road on the banks of the Rio Bons Sinais opposite Quelimane.
9.3.6    EN 239: Nametil - Corner. EN 239/260
The road is located in the coastal region of Nampula Province with a topographic relief ranging
between 10 and 200m above sea level. The road traverses relatively flat to gently undulating
terrain and intersects several small rivers as it approaches the EN 260.
The Nametil road predominately passes through red sandy clay loams, brown sandy clay soils
and sandy colluvium soils. The erosion risk of the area is low as a result of the generally flat
terrain.
The broad vegetation type of the area is tardily deciduous miombo, lowland type. The road
passes through woodland and thicket that has been disturbed for cultivation and settlement.
There are no conservation areas near the road corridor.
The road is located in a highly populated area of Nampula Province with an average population
density of 66 people per km2 (compared to the National average of 19 people per kmi2). A
majority of the population of Nampula Province (more than 75%) depends on subsistence
agriculture for its livelihood. The road traverses an important agricultural area where cash
crops such as cashew, cotton, tobacco and coffee are produced. Despite this there are few
formal sector employment opportunities.
The road is connected to the major town of Nametil and is close to the port town of Angoche.
Angoche was once an important fishing port and there are plans for its rehabilitation. The
location of the road connecting these major centres may realise an economic potential for the
area.
9.3.7    ER 455: Estima - Mago6
The road runs parallel to, and approximately 5km to the south of, the southern shoreline of lake
Cahora Bassa. It traverses generally flat terrain at altitudes between 400 and 500m above sea
level. It crosses a number of seasonal watercourses, mostly flowing from south-east to north-
west that drain into Cahora Bassa.
Soils of the area are sandy, gravel, and red soils of medium to fine texture. Although the soils
have a medium inherent erosion potential, the erosion hazard along the project road is low-
medium and is a function of the gentle undulating topography traversed.
Between Estima and Magoe the road traverses three broad vegetation types, mopane
woodland, mixed baobab woodland and dry deciduous miombo. Most vegetation is either
mopane or mixed baobab woodland.

IMPACI'O
Many farming settlements are found adjacent to the road and in the general area. Magoe and
Estima are the largest settlements. Small cultivated fields are scattered throughout amidst
herbaceous formations of the original woodlands.
Subsistence agriculture is the main activity of families living in the area. The main food crops
grown are maize and sorghum. While livestock production is not very significant, pigs,
chickens, cattle and goats are kept for household consumption, as well as for the market.
Lakeshore fishermen smoke-roast a variety of fish species for sale in Estima and Tete mainly
using mopane as firewood.
To the east of Magoe is a wilderness area extending from the Daque River to the border with
Zimbabwe. This area is under the control of Tchuma Tchato, a community-based sustainable
natural resource management initiative. Tchuma Tchato's vision for the future is to be actively
involved in the development of ecotourism along the southern shoreline of Cahora Bassa and
to promote rural development (e.g. new schools, clinics and agricultural land) through their
partnerships with local communities.
9.3.8    EN 221: Bene - Fingoe
The road is located in a plateau zone generally at altitudes between 400 and 1,OOOm. The area
traversed is a mixture of undulating terrain with steeper areas at either end of the road. There
are some elevations up to 1,500m above sea level to the north of Fingoe where the landscape
becomes more rugged and mountainous.
The road traverses red and brown clayey soils of medium texture. The erosion hazard along
the road is medium to high and is a function of the steeper topography, soils and rainfall
intensity. Erosion and sedimentation potential will be greater during the wet season.
The area has open woodland vegetation, with grasses and some small deciduous trees that lose
their leaves in the dry season, giving the area a semi-arid character. The composition of the
vegetation is predominantly miombo woodland common to much of Mozambique. It does not
include species of biological value or with special conservation status. To the west of Bene
there is an initial area of mopane woodland extending approximately 1 Okm to the east and west
of the Capoche River.
Faunal assemblages are relatively depauperate in the area.  Mammals are scarce with
herbivores such as Impala only occasionally sighted. There are no conservation areas in the
immediate vicinity of the road.
Disturbance for small farms or cultivated areas is concentrated along the road corridor,
particularly in the lower elevation, undulating areas. Adjacent to these areas are extensive
tracts of relatively undisturbed vegetation. Dispersed small settlements and homesteads are
found along the road while larger settlements are found in Fingoe and Bene. Thickets of
shrubs averaging between 0.5 and 3m but with heights to 7m are also found along the road
alignment.
Subsistence agriculture is the main activity of families living in the Districts. The main food
crops grown are maize sorghum, beans and millet. Some sweet potato and groundnuts are also

grown. While livestock production is not very significant, pigs, chickens, cattle and goats are
kept for household consumption, as well as for the market.
9.3.9    ER 572: Meconta - Corrane
The Meconta to Corrane road is located in the coastal region of Nampula Province with a
topographic relief ranging between 180 and 300m above sea level. The road runs south-west
from Meconta traversing relatively flat to undulating terrain and intersecting several small
rivers before approaching Corrane.
The road predominantly passes through red sandy clay loams, brown sandy clay soils. These
soils are characteristically fertile, deep soils of medium texture giving them a relatively low
erosion risk. The erosion hazard along the project road is low to medium according to erosion
hazard mapping.
Between Meconta and Corrane the road traverses moist savanna to mesic forest characterised
by an annual rainfall greater than 1000mm. The broad vegetation type of the area is tardily
deciduous miombo, lowland type, and the project road traverses the subtype characteristic of
Nampula Province. The area has been highly disturbed for agricultural purposes and the
diversity and species numbers in the area are expected to be low. There are no designated
conservation areas located within the road's region of influence.
The road traverses an area of rich agricultural land and subsistence agriculture is the
predominant land use. A variety of crops are grown including cash crops such as cashews and
cotton. There is also some production of semi-precious timber. The road is strategically
important for access to the National road (EN 8), to the railway line at Namialo and to the deep
seaport at Nacala.
The area has a relatively high population with an average population density of 40 people per
kM2, compared to the national average of 19 people per kM2.
9.4 SUB-PROJECTS, COMMON IMPACTS
9.4.1   Introduction
This section describes the impacts that are common to each of the roads studied. As the types
of construction activity for each road are similar then many effects are common despite
differences in the environment through which the roads pass. A following section discusses
effects that are unique to the individual roads.
9.4.2    PHYSICAL EFFECTS
i   Land Use
The proposed road improvement works do not require significant change to land use within the
road corridors. There are no settlements or people residing within the existing road corridors
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             9-8



IMPAC 0'
and little, if any, encroachment of cultivated land. Resettlement will not be required for any of
the sub-projects.
A range of temporary ancillary activities such as borrow pits, workforce camps and works
compounds will be required during construction. These will affect relatively small land areas.
These sites will be rehabilitated after construction is complete. Where possible, existing
borrow areas will be utilised during the road works to avoid additional disturbance.
ii   Erosion and Sedimentation
The dynamic interplay of several key factors dictates the degree of susceptibility to water-
driven soil erosion processes. These are:
o  seasonality and intensity of rainfall in relation to water run-off;
o landscape topography in relation to slope gradients;
o soil profile parameters, notably depth and binding properties;
o degree of vegetation cover; and
o magnitude and frequency of seismic events.
The overall erosion risk is low and is determined by a combination of deep to moderately deep
soils together with gentle slopes of generally less than 6%. The Bene to Fingoe road has some
specific erosion risks and this is discussed separately.
Sedimentation is a secondary process of erosion and can be exacerbated by roadworks due to:
o deliberate and unanticipated modifications to surface and ground water hydrology;
o incomplete rehabilitation of roadside verge areas; and
o road rehabilitation through naturally hilly terrain.
Ground disturbance and the temporary stockpiling of materials during roadworks can trigger
uncontrolled and or accelerated sedimentation processes. The onset of this process will be
coincident with ground disturbance and will continue until sites have been stabilised. The
extent of ground disturbance and clearing along the road corridors will be marginal, with a
maximum width of 1 6m disturbed during construction.
Other areas where ground disturbance and clearing is required during the construction stage are
at stockpile areas, borrow pit sites, construction camps, and work compounds.
iii   Water Quality
Sedimentation and resultant water quality effects were discussed in the previous section. This
section looks at other water quality issues.
Hydrocarbons from used lubricants sourced from improper disposal facilities and poor
operation and maintenance practices for construction vehicles and machinery can contaminate
surface waters. Improper disposal of oil filters and other materials from vehicle and machinery
maintenance can also cause pollution. This can occur during both construction and road
operation, but mostly during the former.
58602rptO1                           February 2001                               9-9



IMPA L7'(U
Spilt petroleum fuel, as well as bitumen and explosives residue, also has a potential to
contribute to the pollution of water bodies, but to a minor extent.
Improper sanitation and waste disposal procedures in temporary construction camps can also
contaminate water resources.
iv    Noise and Vibration
Additional noise will be generated along the road corridors and at ancillary sites during the
construction period, particularly from the increased number of heavy vehicle movements.
Vibration effects will be negligible due to the generally sandy soil substrates. Peak noise
levels generated by construction activities are expected to be greater than the peak noise levels
from road operation.
Construction noise is generally intermittent and depends on the type of operation, location and
function of the equipment and the equipment use cycle. Noise attenuates quickly over
distance. Excavation noise levels, for example, assuming bulldozer and dump truck activity,
yield a level of approximately 85dBA at 15m, but decrease by about 3-4dBA with each
doubling of the setback distance. Such noise levels would be reduced to approximately 7OdBA
at a distance of about 240m.
Noise levels during the operation of the improved road projects will increase due to an increase
in traffic and vehicle speeds. Traffic growth is generally expected to be similar to historic
growth but total vehicle numbers along most roads are low, generally less than 1,000 vehicles a
day on the EN 1 and much lower on the secondary and tertiary roads. Consequently noise
levels from traffic are not significant. The roadworks may reduce existing noise levels in built-
up areas as a result of improved road surfaces.
v    Air Quality
A potential deterioration in air quality during road construction will primarily occur from dust
generated by road excavation, spoil transportation and disposal. Most construction activities
will progressively move along the alignment, so prolonged deterioration in air quality will not
occur at any one location. The minor volumes of dust generated will cause a short-term
localised problem through villages and towns.
Exhaust emissions from traffic utilising the rehabilitated road will be minor as traffic volumes
are low.
9.4.3    BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS
i   Direct Impacts
Vegetation will need to be cleared to undertake the road rehabilitation works and enable road
formation widening and construction of additional drainage. Generally, the conservation value
of vegetation within and adjoining the road corridors is low. Woodland areas crossed by the
road corridors are generally highly utilised, particularly for slash and bum agriculture. The
58602rptO1                          February 2001                             9-10



IMPACIV'
amount of clearing that will need to be undertaken will be minor as the road corridors are
already defined for the majority of their length. The impact of any clearing required for the
road projects will not be significant due to the already highly degraded nature of the woodland
habitat.
Vegetation may also be cleared in areas selected for ancillary sites, such as construction
camps, borrow pits and quarries, to enable the utilisation of these areas.
ii   Indirect Impacts
There is a potential impact associated with the indirect loss and degradation of vegetation,
habitat and species in a road corridor's region of influence. These potential impacts are
associated with:
o improved access;
o in-migration; and
o construction workforce behaviour.
The projects will provide improved access to the neighbouring areas and facilitate natural
resource use. The main potential for increased natural resource harvesting is likely to occur
within the corridors' woodlands. Any population increase along the road corridor would be
derived either from people migrating to the roadside from the immediate area (i.e. the 5km
region of influence and adjacent to this), or from other areas. This in-migration has a potential
to create an increased local demand for firewood and construction timber, as well as other
woodland products to support secondary enterprise activities, such as forage collection for
grazing animals. Hunting may also increase. The proposed road improvements will follow
existing alignments and woodland areas neighbouring these roads are already accessible. The
roads will only increase potential access to these forests, not open them up.
Importing a construction workforce into an area may increase demand on local natural
resources due to competition for firewood, woodland products and wildlife. These increased
demands will be focussed on the areas surrounding workforce camps and work compounds.
Worker camps may also encourage the temporary construction of markets and "barracas" to
service the workers. These temporary facilities may also increase demand on local natural
resources.
9.4.4    SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS
i   Direct Impacts
Improvements to the road will not involve the significant loss of cultivated land and no
resettlement of people is required. No people were observed to be living within the road
corridor of the sub-projects for which fieldwork was undertaken. Similar observations are
expected for the other sub-projects proposed for World Bank funding. Cultivation is not
continuous adjacent to the roads. In very few locations it was possible that sections of a
farmers field may have encroached within the road corridor. Such encroachment was only
associated with the secondary and tertiary roads. These fields, or machambas, are farmed
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             9-11



IMFA(TO
under slash and burn agriculture and are not under continuous use. Most machambas are used
for four or five years before being allowed to lie fallow. There is sufficient land for any
portion of affected machambas to be realigned.
Borrow pits, storage and equipment areas, and construction camps will be located on marginal
quality or already disturbed land. The acquiring of land for such purposes is subject to ANE
and Provincial approval.
ii   Indirect Impacts
a    Access to Services and Markets
Improvements to the roads will improve the availability of services to the populations of the
area by improving access. Improvement of the roads will facilitate the ability of, for example,
sick patients to access health services.
Goods and services will flow more easily into the areas. A better quality road will also reduce
transport costs both fuel consumption and vehicle wear.
b    In-migration of People
Improvement of roads in other rural areas within Mozambique often leads to in-migration
increases (of people and companies) as advantage is taken of the improved communications
and improved access. It is probable that some in-migration will take place particularly in areas
in close proximity to the secondary and tertiary roads.
c    Health Issues
It is likely that the road projects will necessitate the inflow of construction workers from other
parts of Mozambique. The inflow of road gangs, particularly in remote areas, has a potential
for adverse effects with the most often cited problem HIV-AIDs and other sexually transmitted
diseases. Areas adjoining roads that form parts of major transport corridors have also been
found to have higher incidences of HIV-AIDS due to their use by transient populations,
especially transport workers.
d    Construction Worker Camps
A concentration of workers attracts other inward migrants who attempt to exploit new market
opportunities. In other parts of Mozambique this has often resulted in the creation of small-
unplanned roadside shops. Such informal sites are often poorly managed in terms of adherence
to health regulations and waste disposal.

9.5 SUB-PROJECTS, SPECIFIC IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
MEASURES
9.5.1   Introduction
No specific or distinguishing areas of impact were identified for the following roads:
ci EN 215: Corner EN 1/215 to Maringue
o EN 8: Nampula to the corner of EN8/104 (lapala)
Li EN 239: Nametil to the corner. EN 239/260
o ER 455: Estima - Magoe
Li ER 572: Meconta - Corrane
A discussion of effects specific to the remaining roads follows.
9.5.2    EN 1
There are large wetland areas along the EN 1, particularly near Macia and towards Vilanculos.
These areas may have also experienced a change in habitat regime due to prolonged inundation
from last years floods. In these areas, the road may form a barrier dividing wetland areas into
two separate hydrologic bodies. The barrier may cause alterations to the wetland ecology, at
least on one side of a road.
The mitigation measure for this impact will be an inspection of the EN 1 by a wetland
ecologist to determine the need for and location of additional culverts. The new culverts may
not be required for drainage purposes but are proposed to ensure connection between wetland
areas on either side of the road. This work should be undertaken at the project design stage.
9.5.3    ER 405: Ch6kwe to the border with Maputo Province
This road is similar to sections of the EN 1 as it also crosses extensive wetland areas although
these have not been identified to have conservation values. Improvements to the road may
form a barrier dividing and potentially changing the wetland ecology.
The mitigation measure proposed for wetlands along the EN I would also apply to this road.
9.5.4    EN 224: Quelimane to Chinde
Indirect impacts may result from changes to hydrological regimes associated with the
mangrove communities and the clearing of mangroves to extend agricultural and plantation
land use. The existing road near Quelimane has been designed to restrict water flow by either
constructing culverts above the high tide water level or by constructing gated culverts that
allow one way flow only. This has enabled the conversion of wetland areas on the "upstream"
side of the road to be converted to agriculture.
There are no conservation areas in the vicinity of the project road but the adjoining vegetation
communities are part of the Zambezi Delta, which supports the most extensive and diverse

mangrove forests in Mozambique. The mangrove forests are important for protecting the coast
from erosion, support a high diversity of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The construction of
culverts to maintain natural flow regimes across the road will be an important component of
the works.
The mitigation measure proposed for wetlands along the EN 1 would also apply to this road
9.5.5    EN 221: Bene - Fingoe
The soils and topography along this road result in a potential for erosion and sedimentation
from the improvement works. No road designs are available and it is not possible to say
whether significant cut and fill is required or whether retaining walls will be required. There
may be a need for earthworks and specific stabilisation works. These will need to be identified
during the project design phase. Specific stabilisation measures that may be incorporated into
the project design include:
u  identification of geotechnically unstable areas.  Engineering designs would need to
consider road stability in these areas;
o  design of cut and fill batter slopes for long-term stability;
o  incorporation of retaining walls (dry rock and/or gabions) into the project; and
Li hydrologic designs to specifically consider channel stability and identify the need for
linings such as rip-rap rock.

10 OUTLINE MITIGATION MEASURES
10.1 GENERAL MITIGATION MEASURES
This section presents an outline of environmental impact mitigation measures proposed for
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation projects. The measures consider both construction and
operational works. Design, construction and maintenance mitigation recommendations for the
roads were formulated to avoid or mitigate potential impacts. These recommendations were
formulated from both the environmental analysis and also from observations made during the
field surveys. Mitigation measures were also discussed in the individual IEE contained in
Annexures E and F. The measures outlined in this chapter and Chapter 1 1 consolidate and
enhance measures from the individual studies and effectively supersede those sections of the
IEE.
The outline plan is presented in tabular form listing the:
o  the construction activity;
o  the potential impact;
o  the mitigation measure or action;
o  the responsible organisation; and
o  when the measure is to be implemented.
An outline of the proposed environmental management methods is provided in Table 0 .1 for
the construction stage and Table 10.2 for the operation stage.
Socio-economic impact mitigation measures are discussed further in the following section.
These mitigation measures were designed to be generally applicable to periodic maintenance
or rehabilitation projects. Individual projects may require additional measures that can only be
determined as part of a project's environmental assessment. Specific mitigation measures for
each of the roads proposed for World Bank funding were discussed at the end of Chapter 9.

10.2 SOCIO-ECONOMIC MITIGATION MEASURES
These measures were not included in Table 10.1 as they do not necessarily fit into the
construction contract. These measures may be better taken as part of design work or a part of
broader measures.
i   Loss of Land
The environmental investigations found that there were no people living or subsisting within
the road corridors of the sub-projects.  All sub-projects investigated involve periodic
maintenance or rehabilitation work and ANE advised that all roadworks would be confined to
the existing road corridors. In towns or villages the normal road corridor width is reduced
where necessary to suit the existing street and building layout. There will therefore be no need
to resettle people as a result of the works.
There will be ancillary facilities for construction located outside the road corridor. These
include borrow pits, workforce camps and works compounds. The location of these facilities
is not known and is left to the construction contractor to select but is subject to the formal
approval of both ANE and provincial authorities. Basic location requirements for camps and
compounds are:
o they must preferably be located in already disturbed areas. This would reduce the potential
for loss of productive land and the need for compensation;
u their location must not affect people living in their vicinity; and
o they must not require significant alterations to natural drainage patterns.
All sites must be rehabilitated after use to at least their original condition.
Where an area of land has to be resumed (temporarily) for road construction, a landholder
should be compensated for loss of production. The following process will be applied:
u  Where possible the farmer should be notified of the loss of land one season in advance.
This is to avoid unnecessary loss of effort and seed.
c  The value of the compensation should be determined by a committee consisting of:
-  an agricultural economist experienced in the relevant Province and the crops affected;
-  a member of the ANE Social/Environmental Unit or their representative; and
-  the landholder and their adviser (legal representative or Chefe do Posto)
All costs of the committee will be borne by the road contractor, including the costs of the
landholder's adviser.
o As a minimum a landholder will be compensated for the value of lost production plus the
loss of any seed stock.
Loss of indigenous vegetation should also be considered for compensation as people harvest
various products from that type of vegetation. These products include fruits, firewood,
construction materials and medicines.
In summary the basic value of the compensation would be determined from the:
58602rptO1                         February 2001                            10-10



IMPAU'O
o annual productive capability lost. This would be based on either units of kilograms/hectare
(for field crops such as maize) or per tree (for crops such as mangos and cashews); and
o any other expenses incurred such as purchase of new seed or tree seedlings.
It would be preferable that ANE develop a standard policy or procedure to determine the
method for determining compensation. The policy and procedure should be based on the
principles outlined in this section.
There will be only small areas of land required for the periodic maintenance and rehabilitation
projects.  Determination of the need for compensation and all negotiations should be
undertaken and finalised prior to the affected land being occupied by a contractor.
ii   In-migration of people
Improvement of roads in other rural areas within Mozambique often leads to increases in in-
migration as advantage is taken of the improved access.  Under existing Mozambican
legislation all land belongs to the State. However, private sector farmers may acquire long-
term rights over land by obtaining a Title of Use and Exploitation. Individuals may also seek
concession rights over tracts of land to harvest timber.
Requests for "concessions" are lodged with an area's Provincial Agricultural Services. If
access to an area is improved following rehabilitation of a road it could be expected that
concession seekers will attempt to access these lands. This would only occur where access is
improved to areas with resources such as woodlands or good soils that would attract others.
Although, at present, all land in Mozambique belongs to the State the de facto situation is that
land is being managed and allocated according to traditional customary land rights. The
potential for conflict over land between local communities and "concession seekers" is high.
Very few traditional farmers have formalized their rights to the land under existing legislation.
Where it is expected that demand for concessions will increase as a result of improved access
the existing traditional land "ownership" should be mapped within the road's region of
influence (normally five kilometres either side of a road). This should be undertaken at the
road design phase to reduce the later potential for conflict between traditional landowners and
concession seekers. Based on the investigations undertaken for the roads proposed for World
Bank funding this mapping will generally only be required for secondary or tertiary roads.
Primary roads already provide a reasonable standard of access.
iii   Health issues
It is likely that the road projects will necessitate the inflow of a number of construction
workers. A number of studies have found that the inflow of road gangs, particularly into
remote areas can have adverse impacts. The most often cited problem is HIV/AIDs and
sexually transmitted diseases.  Mitigation measures against these likely impacts require
working closely with respective government departments, local NGOs and/or church based
organisations, local communities and road gangs.  Education programs for the local
populations are extremely important in trying to reduce the likelihood of HIV/AIDs infection.
The construction contractor should:

o liase with the ANE Social Unit to coordinate its road worker HIV/AIDS education with
any local programs;
o undertake education programs about STDs and HIV/AIDS in all communities adjoining
the road. The program shall include details of the means of transmission of the diseases
and their prevention. The programs shall be conducted once every two months for the
duration of the contract;
o  educate all workers (including all contractor's employees, all sub-contractors and all
consultants employees) about STDs and HIV/AIDS. Education shall include details of
means of transmission and their prevention. The education program shall be implemented
as part of a workers induction to a project. Follow-up education programs aimed at all
workers will be conducted once every two months for the duration of the contract;
o  display STD and HIV/AIDS education materials in all buildings frequented by workers
(canteens, workshops etc.);
o  provide at least 1 00 condoms a year to all workers; and
o  establish, staff and maintain a STDs and HIV/AIDS clinic at the worker camps. The clinic
shall be staffed and equipped to enable the screening, diagnosis and counselling of STDs
and HIV/AIDS cases within all workers. Each clinic shall provide free treatment for
general STD cases. HIV/AIDS cases shall be referred to a Province's general HIV/AIDS
program.
Worker and community health programs shall be provided free of charge by the contractor.
iv    Construction Worker Camps
The health issues related. to construction worker camps particularly in terms of the spread of
HIIV-AIDs and other sexually transmitted disease have been mentioned above.
A concentration of workers also attracts other inward migrants who attempt to exploit new
market opportunities. In other parts of Mozambique this has often resulted in the creation of
small-unplanned roadside shops. Such informal sites are often poorly managed in terms of
adherence to health regulations and waste disposal. Mitigation measures should include the
identification of suitable sites for the establishment of small shops and other facilities servicing
road-gangs.

11 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
11.1 MITIGATION MEASURES
The main ANE Contract or guideline document relevant to environmental work is the
document "Environmental Guidelines for Roadworks in Mozambique". This document was
used in the further development of environmental management measures for the World Bank
sub-projects.
Detailed environmental management guidelines (EMG) were produced as a separate document.
These develop the environmental management measures outlined in Chapter 10 into a
handbook format designed to be of direct application in the field. ANE staff advised that a
problem with the current guidelines is that while they identify broad areas of impact and
mitigation measures field staff have found it difficult to translate these into practical activities.
The approach taken was to describe an activity, identify potential impacts and to describe
specific measures (in the format of work instructions) to be implemented by a contractor.
Table I 1.1 presents an example of this approach.

The EMG have two functions:
o to provide a resource base for ANE to use in the environmental management of projects;
and
o to provide clear, enforceable instructions to contractors regarding their responsibility for
environmental issues.
The EMG describes practical means to ensure effective implementation of mitigation
measures. It is intended that the EMG be a live document with impacts or mitigation measures
updated to suit field experience. The adoption of an approach based on activity and work
instruction rather than area of the environment will facilitate the ease of updating.
A training manual was also produced. This is discussed in Part E. It includes training for
implementing the revised EMG.

11.2 CONTRACT CONDITIONS
Based on the EMG requirements recommendations will be provided to ANE for amendments
to their Conditions of Contract. These will be modified to provide contractual, and hence
enforceable, environmental management requirements. The aim is to use the EMG as the
environmental management component of a contract. A clause in the contract will reference
the EMG as the conditions to be implemented. In this way the EMG can be updated without
having to vary subsequent road contract conditions.
Payment for implementation of the EMG could be based on effective implementation of the
environmental management controls for each listed activity. Certification of environmental
management actions or works is a key requirement, with payments withheld until the EMG
instructions are satisfactorily completed.
A basic contract condition for any road project will be the requirement that a contractor
prepare an environmental management plan (EMP) specific to the road project. The EMP will
indicate how ANE's environmental management guidelines and any specific project
requirements will be incorporated into the project. The EMP will also include:
o  details of the how the environmental instructions specified in the EMG will be
implemented. In particular the contractor will need to indicate if there is any variation to
the EMG proposed and the reasons for the variation;
o  locations and types of specific control elements (sediment traps, sewerage facilities, etc);
o  the assignment of specific responsibility within the contractor's management structure for
implementing, maintaining and monitoring environmental controls;
o  emergency response procedures for response to incidents such as fuel spills; and
o  environmental inspection checklists.
11.3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS
There were several areas of potential environmental improvement noted during the
investigations undertaken for this study. These include:
o  documentation  improvements  (environmental  management  guidelines,  contract
conditions). These are outlined in this report and presented in other documentation;
o  institutional strengthening requirements focussing on ANE. Proposals for strengthening
are presented in this report; and
o  training requirements. These are outlined in this report and presented in more detail in
other documentation.
In addition several areas where immediate improvement in work practises is possible were
noted during field investigations. These related to the methods of working or management of
activities. The comments are not intended to reflect on the management of the projects visited
as the study team did not have any knowledge of the project requirements nor their contractual
specifications. Improvement measures are outlined in the mitigation measures of this report
and amplified in the EMG. Specific areas were the potential for improvement was noted
included:

o  the development and management of borrow pits. Many existing pits were observed
during field inspections, some operating and some not operating. Poor practises observed
included:
- leaving steep batters. These were observed to be unstable leading to continuing
erosion of side walls. The steep batters also present a safety hazard for people living
near the pits;
- little effective rehabilitation of worked out borrow pits. At many of the borrow pits
visited there appeared to have been little or no effective rehabilitation; and
- pits with standing water in their bases. While this may be inevitable, it is possible to
reshape the floor of the pit to drain towards sumps or just to one area of the base.
O  general erosion and sediment controls. On the road projects visited (including works on
the EN 1 and EN 8) there appeared to be few measures in place to minimise erosion or
sediment movement; and
o  worker construction camps. At the project visited there was little if any attempt to provide
basic amenities for the local workforce. These basic requirements include facilities such as
toilets and water supply.

12 NATIONAL ROADS ADMINISTRATION (ANE)
12.1 INTRODUCTION
Prior to reforms in 1999, the National Directorate for Roads and Bridges (DNEP) was
responsible for the construction and maintenance of Mozambique's roads. It was part of the
Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPOH). The National Roads Administration (ANE),
an autonomous entity separate to MOPH, is the body responsible for the administration,
maintenance and development of the entire Mozambican road network.
ANE is still in the process of developing its administrative and technical organizational
structures. There is currently no formal organogram (a chart showing an organisation's
structure) indicating the relationship between the various directorates and departments. At
present there are four national directorates, each headed by a Director:
Ei Directorate of National Roads/Direccao de Estradas Nacionais (DEN), Director: Eng°
Tiago Massingue
u  Directorate of Rural Roads/Direccao das Estradas Rurais (DER), Director Eng° Atanasio
Mugunhe
Li Directorate for the Road Fund/Direccao de Fundos das estradas (DF), Director Eng°
Perreira
Q  Directorate for Administration/Direccao de Administracao (DA), Director Sr. Daniel
Clemente
Each Director is in the process of developing a formal structure that will enable the directorate
to carry out its mandate. Currently, the directorates are operating on a structure based mainly
on the now defunct National Directorate of Roads and Bridges (DNEP). This is illustrated in
the structure of Directorate of National Roads as shown below.

(Eng° Tiago Massingue)
Training Unit    Dept of Supervision  Dept of Studies  Dept of        Dept of
(Fiscalizacao)      & Projects      Investment     Planning
It is incumbent upon each Director to submit the revised structure to the Board of ANE for
approval. As of November 2000 the Board had not received the revised proposal for the
organization of the directorates.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                             12-1



IMPA L'W
Decentralisation is being promoted in Mozambique in all sectors. Under its restructuring
program, ANE will place a Delegate in each province. Delegates report to the ANE Board and
act as ANE representatives at a provincial level to ensure ANE's policies and programs are
correctly implemented. The provincial Department of Roads and Bridges (DEP), under the
Ministry of Public Works and Housing, has responsibility for overseeing tertiary road contracts
in the provinces. District authorities have the responsibility for non-classified roads.
Before decentralisation, ANE's Training Department had a responsibility for training DEP
staff. With decentralisation, DEP and ANE staff no longer belong to the one organisation.
ANE's responsibility will be to ensure that the DEP has appropriate environmental training
programs in place. Some training of DEP staff by ANE is still taking place during the
transition phase.
12.2 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CAPACITY
12.2.1   Introduction
ANE has little capacity to incorporate environmental considerations into all phases of road
construction and rehabilitation projects. This section discusses where the responsibility for
environmental issues lies within ANE as well as the organisation's current capacity to manage
the EIA process or to review completed EIAs.
12.2.2    The Gender, AIDS, Poverty Alleviation and Environment Unit
The responsibility to deal with issues related to the environment is in the process of being
transferred to the existing Gender, Poverty Alleviation, and AIDS Unit, with the new name of
the Gender, AIDS, Poverty Alleviation and Environment Unit (the "Unit"). Prior to this
reorganisation, issues related to the environment were dealt with by the Department of
Supervision (Departamento de Fiscalizacao) within ANE.
The function, personnel and resources of the Unit are discussed below.
i   Terms of Reference
The Unit was initially created in 1997 as a Gender Unit. In 1998, the World Bank
recommended the inclusion of Poverty Alleviation and AIDS as additional areas to be covered.
In March 2000 the Terms of Reference for the Gender, Poverty Alleviation and AIDS Unit as
it was then known was sent to, and approved by, the Board of ANE. The Terms of Reference
were also sent to the World Bank in May 2000. There was no mention of responsibilities
related to the environment in the document.
The Unit currently operates within ANE with a responsibility for the environment, though this
responsibility is not included in its "official" Terms of Reference. The Unit's place in the
organisational structure of ANE is also not yet defined and its precise mandate is also still to be
clarified. This situation needs to be rectified by updating the Unit's Terms of Reference to
include its responsibilities with respect to the environment.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                            12-2



IMPALW'U
ii   Current role
The Unit's current roles include:
o ensuring more equitable recruiting and staffing of women in road programs;
o AIDS awareness campaigns in relation to road rehabilitation and construction; and
o promoting training of ANE staff in aspects related to socio-economic and natural
environmental impact assessment, and the institutional and legal framework for
environmental management in Mozambique. The aim of the training is to enable
environmental factors to be better incorporated into planning, tendering and contract
procedures and supervision. Training courses are developed in co-ordination with the
Training Department.
iii Personnel
The Unit currently comprises a core of six staff members, all with higher degrees or
completing higher degrees of five years duration. The core staff members are:
Li Angelica Aguilera, Sociologist (Head of Unit, Consultant);
o Emilia Tembe, Agronmist;
It Belmira Sarmento, Lawyer for ANE organisation-wide (participates as required);
o3 Angelina Balate, Anthropologist (about to complete her Licenciatura);
Li Felipa Gouveia, Anthropologist; and
u Elisara Marole, Currently studying for degree in Anthropology.
Dra. Aguilera is in a post supported by the Swedish Agency for International Development. It
is expected that, eventually, the post will be filled by a full-time Mozambican ANE employee.
Emilia Tembe also provides inputs into the Department of Studies and Projects (Directorate of
National Roads).
Other ANE staff members who contribute to the activities of the Unit are:
o Teresa Lopes, Engineer (Advisor Consultant who also provides services to the Department
of Studies and Projects);
o Rui Serra, Civil Engineer (Head of Department of Supervision, participates as required);
and
o Anastasia Mauricio, Civil Engineer (Department of Supervision, participates as required).
Of those mentioned, Emilia Tembe, Anastasia Mauricio and Teresa Lopes are mainly
responsible for environmental issues. These staff have not received any formal training in
socio-economic and environmental impact assessments studies and do not currently have the
capability to effectively review EIAs completed on subprojects for ANE.
iv    Training to date
The main environmental training received by the Unit has been a one-day training workshop in
October 2000 facilitated by a local consulting company (Impacto). The workshop was also
attended by 14 mid-level technicians from the Departments of Planning and Projects and
Studies. Themes covered in the workshop included:
58602rptO1                         February 2001                            12-3



IMPA' LW
o the natural and socio-economic environment of Mozambique;
o specific environmental and socio-economic impacts arising from road rehabilitation
(case study Gorongosa-Caia road); and
o the institutional and legal framework for environmental management in Mozambique.
Two members of the Unit (Dra. Aguilera and Enga. Tembe) received "on-the-job" training on
the Gorongosa-Caia road. This was in the form of a three-day field visit in September 2000
conducted by a local environmental consultant.
While the Unit is responsible for organizing environmental training courses for technical staff
from other department, it does not have the capacity to develop and deliver the courses itself.
There is a heavy dependence on external providers to deliver the environmental training
required to lift the level of environmental awareness of ANE staff in general and to develop
skills in EIAs in particular.
v    Resources
The Unit has few physical resources:
a    Transport
The Unit does not have its own vehicle to travel to the Provinces nor does it have its own
transport budget. Travel to the provinces to investigate or monitor areas of the Unit's
responsibility is not always possible due to the unavailability of transport.
b    Computingfacilities
Not all members of the Unit have basic desktop computing facilities.
c    Colour printing
The Unit cannot genera te printed material in colour. A large amount of environmental
mapping material is best produced in colour to facilitate ease of use. Such materials may also
be useful for education and training purposes.
12.2.3    Other ANE Departments
Most of the staff in the other ANE Departments are senior level civil engineers (Licenciatura
level) or mid-level technicians (certificate from technical school). Few of these staff have
formal training in the environment. Short three day training courses conducted by SWECO
were held in October 1997 and May 1999 for the then DNEP technical staff in the northern,
central and southern regions of the country.
58602rptOl                         February 2001                            12-4



IMPAC lJ
12.3 REQUIRED CAPACITY
12.3.1    Resources
Resources are needed within ANE that ensure:
o environmental studies of road projects are undertaken and assessed. These studies may be
formal investigations required under Mozambican legislation, or other studies required by
funding agencies or ANE policy;
o contract documentation is in place that adequately safeguards the environment by clearly
setting out the roles and responsibilities of all parties with respect to implementing,
monitoring and enforcing environmental controls;
o an audit role is undertaken to ensure environmental contractual conditions are adequately
enforced; and
o all parties have the skills and knowledge to effectively carry out their respective roles.
12.3.2    The Unit
The role of the Unit within ANE should be clearly enunciated and formally documented. The
main functions of the Unit should be:
o ensuring the appropriate level of environmental assessment is undertaken;
o ensuring the correct procedures are followed where an environmental assessment is
required under the Regulations. This would involve tasks such as the development of
terms of reference for EIAs and the review of EIA reports before submission to MICOA;
o providing advice and training to ANE staff who are involved in the development of
contract documentation;
o providing field advice and training for ANE's supervision engineers and other relevant
staff;
o periodically monitoring and auditing field activities to ensure proper management is being
undertaken, to assess the effectiveness of controls and to provide baseline data on the
actual impacts of road works;
o preparing and updating management and technical guidelines (e.g. roadside revegetation,
waste disposal, workers health and safety); and
o tracking and keeping the organisation's environmental regulations/guidelines/standards up-
to-date and disseminating updates as required.
12.3.3    Other Departments
The Department of Projects and Studies is responsible for pre-feasibility and feasibility studies
of proposed projects and drawing up tender documents and contracts. The Department of
Supervision is responsible for contract supervision during road construction and rehabilitation.
At this stage, both Departments are focusing on engineering aspects of projects with little or no
emphasis on environmental issues. The Unit needs to coordinate with both Departments to
58602rptO1                        February 2001                           12-5



IMPAL'i (
ensure that environmental considerations are incorporated into all stages of the project cycle
including project design, preparation of tender documents, preparation of contracts and
construction/rehabilitation of roads.
The responsibility for monitoring Supervision Consultants and the work of Contractors must
remain with ANE's Supervision Department. It would be expected that, as it evolves, the Unit
will provide a gradually increasing level of assistance and expertise.
There is some interaction between the Unit and the Training Department There needs to be
closer liaison between the two to ensure that, apart from specific courses in environmental
topics, an environmental component is, where relevant, included in all training activities within
ANE. Such training should have a place in initial induction training given to staff, as well as
the more engineering-specific training courses presented by the Training Department.
12.4 BUILDING CAPACITY
A capacity needs to be established within ANE to effectively assess and manage environmental
aspects of road construction and rehabilitation projects. This will require strengthening not
only in the area of human resources but also the level of physical resources that are required to
support staff activity in the environmental area.
12.4.1    Human resources
As stated earlier, ANE has limited in-house environmental expertise. Activities to develop a
capacity within ANE are described below with reference to two groups, the Unit and staff of
other ANE Departments
i   The Unit
The establishment of the Unit and some early capacity building activities will not give ANE an
immediate environmental capacity. Due to the unresolved charter of the Unit and the relative
inexperience of its members, the Unit will take time to develop a capacity to operate as
envisaged. It will also take some time for the rest of ANE to accept the Unit as a valuable
resource staffed by technical experts.
Core technical environmental skills required for the Unit to be fully effective fall into the areas
of bio-physical environment, socio-economics and road engineering. A desirable structure of
the Unit, once fully established, is shown below.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                              12-6



IMPAL' 7
Social and      Ecology      Environmental      Physical Science     Training
Health                      Engineering       (soils, agronomy)
The manager of a Unit as outlined above ideally requires broad knowledge and experience
across all issues associated with the management of environmental impacts of roads. Whilst
technical expertise in all areas is not an essential requirement for the Manager, broad
knowledge and experience would enable efficient allocation and effective assessment of the
work done by the Unit. Capacity building activities should include the early identification of,
and development activities for, staff who may possibly fill this role in the future.
With EIAs currently awaiting review and other environmental tasks to be done, there is an
immediate need for environmental expertise within the Unit. It is recommended that a position
of Senior Environmental Specialist is established within the Unit as soon as possible, filled by
external recruitment and supported initially for a period of two years and to be reviewed after
that time.
The position would serve two purposes. Firstly, it would serve to meet the immediate
requirement of reviewing EIAs currently awaiting review and, secondly, it would assist in the
training and development of other environmental members of the Unit. A position description
for the Senior Environmental Specialist is included as Annexure H. Essential selection criteria
for the position are:
c] appropriate tertiary qualifications. These can be in any area of environmental work,
ecology, sociology, physical science or environmental engineering;
Li at least 10 years experience in environmental impact assessment and environmental
management. This is a crucial skill requirement;
o  well-developed Portuguese and English language skills; and
o  demonstrated experience in the training.
It is recognized that it may be difficult to find a Mozambican-trained environmentalist with the
appropriate training and work experience. It is more likely that this expertise would be
provided by an expatriate environmental specialist. There is a small number of expatriate
consultants currently working within ANE and there is general satisfaction within ANE with
this means of skills transfer.
Apart from the position of Senior Environmental Specialist, all other capacity building
initiatives outlined in this section are associated with developing current ANE staff. Skill
development will predominantly be by short-term training courses and workshops on a variety
of environmental topics. Some longer-term options are also recommended.
58602rptO1                           February 2001                              12-7



IMPA' 1O
a    Short-term training
This will be the major vehicle for capacity building. The Training Program that will be
developed for the Project will employ a modular approach to all training activities. All courses
will initially be delivered by external training providers with assistance from ANE. It is the
intention that, as training capacity is developed within ANE, the reliance on external providers
will diminish.
The Unit currently promotes and co-ordinates training for ANE in aspects related to the socio-
economic and natural environment assessments and impacts with training delivery by outside
providers. It is the intention that the Unit, as it gains experience in the assessment and
management of environmental impacts, assumes a greater role in actual delivery of
environmental training in cooperation with the Training Department. Such training may be in
the form of stand-alone environmental training courses or as environmental components of
other, usually engineering-related, topics.
For this to happen, Unit members will need to be proficient in the design, development and
delivery of training. It is essential that members of the Unit undergo a Train-the-Trainer
course which will include modern adult learning principles and techniques.
To understand the range of issues associated with effective environmental management within
the roads sector of Mozambique, all Unit members should also participate in all of the capacity
building activities outlined below for other ANE Departments.
b    Masters-level study
It is desirable that staff members who will have a major role in the coordination and
management of the Unit have a deeper knowledge and understanding of Environmental Impact
Assessment. To achieve this two staff members should receive training in EIA at post-
graduate level, one focusing on the socio-economic environment and the other on the
biological environment.
There are several appropriate Masters courses available in South Africa but the number of
eligible participants may be limited due to language difficulties. By identifying appropriate
courses in Portuguese-speaking countries, the objectives of the training program would be
fulfilled while at the same time not limiting possible participants due to their inability to speak
English.
There are also correspondence courses offered by tertiary institutions which make use of
internet technology. Such a course may be more appropriate to the personal circumstances of
an applicant. In these cases, ANE support in the form of fee payment and release time for
study would be essential.
ii   Other ANE Departments
Outputs from this consultancy include the development of environmental management
guidelines as well as modifications to existing Conditions of Contract and works specifications
58602rptO1                         Febrvary 2001                              12-8



IMPAU'O
to incorporate environmental requirements.  The Department of Studies and Projects
(Directorate of National Roads) is involved in the classification of projects and the compilation
of contract documentation and the tendering process. It will therefore need the capacity to
include environmental considerations in all contract documentation where required.
The Supervision Department within ANE is also closely involved in the contract
administration process particularly contract supervision. Its capacity to supervise consultants
and contractors is critical in ensuring that construction contractors adhere to the requirements
of their contracts. Field supervisors need to know their responsibilities for environmental
monitoring and enforcement.
Both the Department of Studies and Projects as well as the Department of Supervision need to
develop skills and knowledge not only in general environmental issues and the EIA process,
but also in the area of contract administration with respect to the environment. Training
activities identified for both of these departments are outlined in Table 12.1.
ANE is in the process of establishing Delegates in each of the Provinces who will represent
ANE at the Provincial level. Their final role with respect to the DEP is unclear. It is essential
that Delegates have an understanding of environmental issues and it is recommended that they
also participate in the capacity building activities outlined in Table 12.1.
The role of the Training Department is one of training management and coordination. Only
one member of the Department delivers training in topics related to the construction,
rehabilitation, maintenance of roads and contract management. ANE is aware of the need to
place more emphasis on the environmental aspects of road construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance. The Training Department will eventually be expected to deliver such training.
To effectively perform the training management role, it is essential that all staff of the Training
Department have an understanding of all facets of the training process and appreciate what
constitutes good training practice. All members of the Department should undergo a Train-
the-Trainer course which will include modem adult learning principles and techniques. The
training delivery specialist within the Department, should participate in, and possibly assist in
the delivery of, all other short-term training activities.
Further details of the capacity building and training activities including course objectives,
training content and training budget will be included in the Project's Training Program.
12.4.2    Budget
The cost estimates included in Table 12.1 are based on each short-term training module being
delivered once. It is expected that the training program would be presented three times over
the life of the ROADS3 Program making a total training cost of $US203,600.

13 MICOA
13.1 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CAPACITY
13.1.1    National
A major role of the Ministry for the Coordination of Environmental Affairs (MICOA) is the
regulation of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). This means both approving the
Terms of Reference for the undertaking of EIAs, reviewing completed EIAs and implementing
an audit process.
During its first mandate the EIA Department within MICOA was small, comprising a
Department Head plus four to five technical staff. This period was also characterised by high
staff turnover including several changes of Head. Due to the lack of human resources and
operational support, the EIA Department was generally unable to efficiently implement EIA
procedures and regulations although this in no way reflects on the capacity of the staff. The
staff in place attempted to carry out their tasks under difficult circumstances.
In December 1999, an independent consultancy mission performed functional analysis and
capacity needs assessment on the EIA Department. Based on the recommendations arising
from the mission, the EIA Department was upgraded to a National Directorate. The
institutional and political importance of EIA is increasingly recognised both within, and
outside of, MICOA.
The National Directorate for Environmental Impact currently comprises eight staff members
including the National Director and has applied to recruit another nine staff with licenciatura-
level qualifications. This request will be dependent upon total budget available for recruitment
but it is anticipated that a majority of these positions will be approved.
The Directorate currently comprises two Departments namely, the EIA Department and the
Environmental Audit Department. Two staff members are assigned to the Audit Department
whilst the remainder of the staff are assigned to the EIA Department. The organisational
structure of the Directorate is somewhat flexible and staff may carry out assignments in either
of the Departments.  Table 13.1 gives an indication of the relative experience of the
Department.

MICOA is required to co-ordinate with other government sectors involved in development and
investment projects. Agreements of understanding have been informally negotiated with and
accepted by the National Directors in charge of tourism, industry and forestry and wildlife.
The EIA Directorate is currently working with ANE to develop EIA Directives for the roads
sector.
i 3.1.2    Provincial Capacity
MICOA has been establishing Provincial Directorates in the Provincial capitals since 1995 but
is not represented at lower levels of government in any province. The role of the Provincial
Directorates, once fully established and operational, will be to implement the policies and EIA
guidelines developed at Central level.
The level of organisation and capacity varies from Province to Province. Capacity determines
the level of devolution which takes place. The Provincial structure usually follows, but not
strictly adheres to, the structure at Central level. A basic organogram indicates the structure.

IMPA LW'
In some Provinces (Nampula and Cabo Delgado), a Department of Environmental Impact
Assessment has been established separate to the Department of Environmental Management.
In some Provinces (Gaza and Inhambane) there is a Human Resource Sector separate to the
Department of Administration and Finance. There is a Provincial Inspectorate in Sofala
Province responsible for monitoring and enforcement but no EIA Department.
The following brief descriptions of the organisation and resources of Provincial Directorates of
the Provinces in which Phase 1 road sub-projects are located, gives an indication of the
weaknesses that exist within those organisations.
i   Maputo
The Provincial Directorate for Environmental Coordination Affairs in Maputo Province is
located in Matola. This Directorate is divided into three technical departments:
o Department of Environmental Education;
o Department for Environmental Management; and
o Department for Land Planning.
Only the Department for Land Planning has one technician with a university degree, an
architect, who works with nine medium-level technical staff.   The Department of
Environmental Education has three medium-level technical staff and the Department for
Environmental Management has four medium-level technical staff.
This Provincial Directorate is relatively new, and to date all intervention of the Directorate has
centred on Matola City.
ii   Sofala Province (Beira)
This Provincial Directorate comprises four Departments plus one Inspectorate under the
Directorship of a senior level technician (Bachelor's degree in Forestry). The Departments are:
o Department of Environmental Management, headed by a senior level technician
(Bachelors' degree in Chemistry);
o  Department of Territorial Planning, headed by a senior level technician (Bachelor's degree
in Geography);
o Department for the Promotion of Environmental Awareness, headed by a mid-level
technician; and
o Department of Administration and Finance, headed by a mid-level technician.
The Provincial Inspectorate, comprising two mid-level technical staff, is responsible for
environmental monitoring and enforcement. There is currently no EIA Department. The
Provincial Director oversees the implementation of EIA regulations and procedures.
iii   Zambezia Province (Quelimane)
This Provincial Directorate comprises four departments:
58602rptO1                         February 2001                            13-3



IMPAf'(U
o Department of Environmental Management and EIA, headed by senior level technician (a
forest engineer) plus two mid-level technical staff;
o Department of Territorial Planning, headed by one mid-level technician (ex Provincial
Institute for Physical Planning) plus five mid-level technical staff;
o Department for the Promotion of Environmental Awareness, headed by a senior-level
technician (a forestry engineer) plus one mid-level technician; and
o Department of Administration and Finance, headed by a basic level technician.
The staff comprises three senior-level technicians (including the Director) and eight mid-level
technicians (two of whom recently received training in environmental management in
Portugal) and eight basic level staff.
iv   Nampula Province (Nampula)
This Provincial Directorate is similar to Central level, comprising five Departments:
o  Department for EIA, comprising one mid-level technician;
o Department of Territorial Planning, headed by one senior level staff (an architect) plus
three mid-level technicians;
c Department for the Promotion of Environmental Education, comprising one mid-level staff
member;
L Department for Environmental Management, headed by one mid-level technician who is
currently completing his Licenciatura degree in Nampula; and
u Department of Administration and Finance, comprising one mid-level technician.
The Director is a senior level technician with a degree in mechanical engineering and a
certificate in aircraft engineering.
v    Cabo Delgado Province (Pemba)
This Provincial Directorate is currently being established with a proposed structure that reflects
the structure at Central level. It will comprise five Departments. Only the Department of EIA
is currently staffed, with a town planner, a sanitary engineer, a land use planner and a
geographer. The background of the four is in urban planning as they were all incorporated into
the Provincial Directorate from the now-defunct, Provincial Institute for Physical Planning.
The Provincial Director has a Licenciatura degree in Geography and is the only senior-level
staff member.
vi   Gaza Province (Xai-Xai)
This Provincial Directorate comprises four Departments and one Human Resource Sector
under the Directorship of a senior level technician with a Bachelors degree in Chemistry from
the UK. The Departments are the:
o Department of Environmental Management. The Head is still to be nominated. Staff are
two mid-level technicians plus one basic-level technician;

o Department of Gender and Environmental Education. The Head is still to be nominated.
Staff are one senior level technician (a Licenciatura in Chemistry and Biology), two mid-
level technicians and one a basic level technician;
o Department of Territorial Planning. The Head still to be nominated. Staff are seven mid-
level technicians plus one basic level technician;
• Department of Administration and Finance, headed by a mid-level technician with three
basic level technicians; and
• Human Resource Sector, headed by a basic level technician.
vii  Inhambane Province
This Provincial Directorate is similar to Gaza Province with five Departments:
o Department of Environmental Management, headed by a senior level technician
(Licenciatura degree in Geography), plus two mid-level technician staff;
o Department of Environmental Education, headed by a mid-level technician plus one senior
level technician (Licenciatura degree in Agronomy) and three elementary level technician
staff;
o Department of Territorial Planning, headed by a basic level technician plus five mid-level
technicians and four elementary level technical staff;
o Department of Administration and Finance, headed by basic level technician and seven
elementary level technicians; and
o Department of Human Resources, headed by a basic level technician.
13.2 TRAINING
A lack of staff with practical experience remains a problem as MICOA cannot afford to pay
salaries that will attract experienced practitioners. Recruits for the most part are young and
well qualified but relatively inexperienced. MICOA is well aware of this situation and realises
the importance of training these people to enable them to carry out their duties within MICOA.
The organisation runs a variety of short courses of up to seven days duration for internal,
graduate-level staff both at the Central and Provincial levels. The courses, which are usually
delivered by technical experts from throughout the organisation, include:
o Environmental Regulations
• Environmental Education
o EIA
o Environmental Management
Consistent with its charter, MICOA occasionally runs courses and workshops for
representatives from other agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture. It acknowledges that
there is currently no formal process to assess the training needs in organisations external to
MICOA. If a course is run, notices are sent out to organisations advertising the courses and
offering places. MICOA acknowledges the haphazard nature of this arrangement. This process
is under review and a more formal process of needs assessment will be included in a strategy
being developed.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                            13-5



IMPAL'lO
MICOA's education strategy is not to focus on large organisations such as ANE but rather to
target groups or individuals who have influence in society such as teachers and journalists as
well as policy-makers and decision-makers in a variety of public agencies and institutions.
13.3 BUILDING CAPACITY
MICOA at the Central level is gradually addressing the issue of staff numbers which hinder its
capacity to fulfil its charter.
Capacity in the Provinces is impeded by lack of human resources with the result that Central
level is often involved in monitoring and enforcement issues at the Provincial level.
Devolution of implementation responsibilities will be facilitated if there were a capacity in the
Provincial Directorate to manage the responsibility. For example, in Nampula Province the
EIA Department comprises only one mid-level technician in spite of the large number of
development projects proposed for the Province. In Cabo Delgado, the EIA Department has
four staff with little or no background in environmental monitoring and assessment.
Reinforcing the environmental capacity of the staff currently, or soon to be employed, at both
the Central and Provincial levels, starts with development of an effective training capacity
within the organisation. For training to be effective it must be well planned, be interactive in
nature and employ a variety of training methods.
It is important that both the Training Department along with technical specialists identified as
being most likely to be called upon to deliver training both within and outside the organisation
are proficient in the design, development and delivery of training. For this reason it is
considered essential that these individuals undergo a Train-the-Trainer course which includes
modem adult learning principles and techniques.
Through this activity not only will MICOA be more able to effectively build capacity within its
own staff but it will also have greater capacity to fulfil another of its responsibilities namely
environmental education and training of other organisations.

14 OTHER AGENCIES AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY
14.1 PROVINCIAL DIRECTORATES OF ROADS AND BRIDGES
14.1.1   Introduction
At the provincial level, the Directorate of Roads and Bridges (DEP) remains an integral part of
the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MOPH).  Hence road construction and
maintenance, for the main part, remains with MOPH. The link to ANE will be through the
Delegates to be situated in each Province. Currently, provincial DEP and ANE collaborate
through funding provided for the annual maintenance of regional roads (liaison through
Directorate of Rural Roads, DER) and some national roads (liaison via Directorate of National
Roads, DEN).
The exact roles and responsibilities of each body, ANE and DEP, are to be finalised. By
definition, decentralisation means increasingly larger responsibilities being vested with
provincial bodies.
A key feature of decentralisation will also mean that an increasing part of the work of the
DEPs will be contracted out to consultants in the private sector. Hence, there will be a
requirement for an increase in the levels of skills of the DEP staff to manage these consultants.
DEP supervision staff will require skills in all aspects of contract management from the
tendering process through to supervision.
It also follows that DEP will be vested with an ever-increasing responsibility for environmental
management of the projects within their provinces, a responsibility for which they are not
accustomed, or equipped.
14.1.2    Capacity
The two provinces below are indicative of the structure and size of DEPs throughout
Mozambique as well as the varied exposure of DEP staff to environmental training.

IMPAC'lO
The total number of staff in Zambezia Province is 26 comprising three higher level staff (a
civil engineer, mechanical engineer and a geologist), three medium level staff and 20 basic
level staff. All higher level technical staff have received environmental training in the form of
environmental components that were included in short and medium term training courses held
in DNEP or overseas.
All medium level and basic level staff have received some exposure to environmental aspects
in short term (two week) training courses held at the Chimoio Training Center and at a short
seminar held in Quelimane.
ii   Department of Roads and Bridges - Sofala
DEP, Sofala Province, is divided into three sectors each responsible for a part of the province.
Each part is headed by an engineer and has a complement of supervisors. There is also a
supervisory sector, a laboratory and a traffic control sector.
A simplified organogram of DEP, Sofala, Province, is shown below:

Region      Region      Region        Sector    llControl
The total number of staff in Sofala Province is 29 comprising three higher level staff, four
medium level staff and 22 basic level staff. Of these staff members, only one medium level
technician has participated in a one-week course on EIA.
14.1.3    Building Capacity within DEP
DEP staff have had variable exposure to environmental training. This ranges from a few
individuals who have had a considerable amount of training to others who have had none. A
planned approach to environmental training for all DEP staff will be required to ensure that all
are equipped for their changing roles under decentralisation.
Training and capacity building activities should be centred around the Road Training Centre in
Chimoio. The Centre, responsible for the training of DEP staff in recent years was previously
managed by ANE's Training Division but is now under the control of MOPH.  Current
training courses offered for DEP staff and others are in a variety of areas which include road
and vehicle maintenance and plant operation.
58602rptO1                         February 2001                            14-2



IMPA LW'
While the staff of the Centre are now employed by MPOH, the Centre from time to time
invites guest lecturers to the Centre. In its capacity as provider of guest lecturers ANE
maintains informal links with the Centre and the training of DEP staff.
If DEP is to develop a capacity for environmental management, it is desirable that, apart from
stand-alone environmental courses, the Training Centre integrates an environmental
component, where relevant, into the other engineering-related courses it presents to DEP staff.
Capacity building within DEP could be achieved by the presentation of the courses to be
developed for ANE through the ROADS3 Program at the Chimoio Training Centre. These
courses were discussed in Chapter 12.
14.2 NATIONAL DIRECTORATE OF FORESTRY AND WILDLIFE
An increase in the harvesting of natural resources (both legally and illegally) invariably
accompanies the opening up of new roads in Mozambique. The National Directorate of
Forestry and Wildlife, within the Ministry for Agriculture and Rural Development, has the
responsibility for the management of the forest and wildlife estate of Mozambique, both inside
and outside of protected areas. According to forestry regulations, permission to harvest
hardwoods may be acquired through acquiring either a simple licence (licen,a simples) or a
forestry concession. Simple licences may be issued by the Provincial Services of Forestry and
Wildlife (SPFFB) whereas concessions are authorised at the central level (National Directorate
of Forestry and Wildlife - DNFFB).
Most legal harvesting of hardwoods is carried out through the acquisition of a simple licence
which permits the harvesting of a quota of specified tree species within a particular area over a
limited period of time, usually six months. A concession licence authorises a concessionaire to
acquire exclusive rights to harvest hardwoods within a particular area over a period of up to 50
years according to a prescribed Forest Management Plan.
There are only a few areas in Mozambique where forestry concessions have been granted. For
example, the company MADAL has a 10,000 hectare concession in Zambezia Province. The
new forestry and wildlife policy is to promote longer-term forestry concessions based on
Forestry Management Plans as it is believed that this will lead to exploitation on a more
sustainable basis.
Under the simple license system, the licensee receives a written authorisation(or "croquet")
issued by the Provincial Services of Forestry and Wildlife in the provincial capital. The
croquet indicates the species, volume and area that may be harvested. The licensee is required
to present the croquet to the District Director for Agriculture and Rural Development
(Direccao Distrital de Agricultura e Desenvolvimento Rural (DDADER). The District
Director confirms that the authorisation issued in the provincial capital will not result in
conflict with local communities and that the harvesting is sustainable. In principle the
DDADER may annul an authorisation but this rarely happens.
The operators and/or drivers are supposed to carry, at all times, the croquets. This should be
presented on request to the following enforcement authorities:
58602rptO1                         February 2001                            14-3



IMPA LTO
Li provincial Forestry and Wildlife guards stationed at control posts located at strategic points
along most main and some secondary roads;
o traffic police; and
o civilian police.
It is difficult to monitor the quotas of legal hardwood harvesting of hardwoods and difficult to
control illegal harvesting. The Directorate has a lack of human resources and lack of logistical
support such as transport and radio communication. This lack of capacity throughout the
country is the major constraint to the enforcement of forestry and wildlife regulations.
14.3 PRIVATE INDUSTRY
14.3.1    Background
Many donors see the development of the private sector as essential for sustainable
development of environmental management capacity within Mozambique.
The incorporation of environmental dimensions into development planning and programs is
relatively new in Mozambique. Ministerial responsibility for the environment was established
in 1994 (through the creation of the Ministry for the Co-ordination of Environmental Affairs).
In 1995 the National Environmental Management Program was formulated. The latter
document identifies and prioritizes areas of action to ensure environmentally sustainable
development. In 1996 and 1997 respectively the Framework Environment Law and EIA
Regulations were passed by the Government of Mozambique.
Concomitant with these developments there has been an increasing demand for the provision
of environmental services to meet the needs of Government agencies, non-governmental
organisations, donor agencies and the private sector.  The main environmental services
required in Mozambique include:
o  environmental base-line surveys (covering the biological, physical and socio-economic
environments);
o  Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and preparation of EIA Reports in compliance
with the 1997 EIA regulations;
o  preparation of "environmental" project proposals;
o  review and revision of environmental projects, programs and polices; and
u  preparation of environmental reports and documents (e.g. biodiversity strategies,
environmental diagnostics, etc.).
14.3.2    Companies Providing Environmental Services in Mozambique
The number of companies/organizations providing environmental services in Mozambique has
progressively increased in parallel with demand though the demand for environmental
expertise still exceeds supply.
In 1994, the first company to provide services exclusively related to the environment was
established as part of Mozambique's largest consulting companies (namely the Impacto
58602rptO1                        February 2001                           14-4

"division" under Austral).  In 1996, Impacto became an independent fully-registered
Mozambican company dedicated exclusively to the provision of environmental services.
Austral continues to provide environmental services mainly by contracting outside specialist
consultants as the need arises. Austral often contracts the services of the Natural Resources
and Biodiversity Group of the Faculty of Agronomy, Eduardo Mondlane University (see
below).
Several other companies/organizations have subsequently established in Mozambique. At
December 2000 these were:
o3 Azul-Verde established in 1998. The company provides consulting services mainly related
to water and water supply. The environmental studies focus mainly on socio-economic
issues.
L  Bergman-Ingerop (BI) is a French company that established offices in Maputo in 1996. BI
mainly provides services in engineering design and civil works. BI offers environmental
services by contracting outside consultants or recruiting BI staff from South Africa.
L  The Natural Resources and Biodiversity Group, Faculty of Agronomy, Eduardo Mondlane
University, established in 1996. Lecturing staff provide services in natural resources
surveys (mainly forest inventories), EIAs, land use surveys and agricultural projects.
Li SEED (Sociedade de Engenharia e Desenvolvimento). The company, a subsidiary of a
large Dutch consulting company (DHV), was established in 1997 and provides consulting
services in engineering and civil works. A Water and Environmental Department has been
established within the company. The Department comprises two civil engineers, two
hydrologists, a veterinary scientist, a biologist and an agronomist. The latter three persons
comprise the core "environmental" staff.
[u SGA (Sociedade de Gestao Ambiental). SGA is a new company established in 2000 by
two ex-ministers from the Ministries for the Coordination of Environmental Affairs and
Agriculture respectively. SGA is currently developing its capacities and activities.
A list of domestic environmental consultancies in Mozambique is provided in Table 14.1.

14.3.3     Mozambican Company Capacity
Although the number of companies/groups providing environmental services has grown since
1994 the number of in-house staff is relatively small. All Mozambican companies are
dependent on contracting sub-consultants from Mozambique, the region or from overseas, to
provide a full range of services especially in highly specialised fields.  Alternatively,
Mozambican companies may form associations or joint ventures with non-Mozambican
companies.
Specialist areas that are not easily covered in Mozambique include:
o air pollution modelling;
o water pollution modelling (including sedimentation rates) and treatment;

IMPACTO
o natural resource economics;
o specialist environmental risk analysis (including toxicology);
o noise pollution and abatement
The strength of the Mozambican consultants lies with:
o environmental monitoring (biological, physical and socio-economic environments);
o natural resources surveys;
o biophysical inventories and baseline surveys;
o socio-economic surveys (including community participatory methodology);
o land use mapping; and
o institutional/legal/political framework for environmental management in Mozambique.
Two of the Mozambican companies, Austral and Impacto, have in-house experience and
expertise related to environmental assessments of roads. Both companies have carried out
EIAs for roads in Mozambique.
Austral is currently carrying out socio-economic surveys and monitoring related to road
construction/rehabilitation for road projects funded by USAID. Impacto is currently carrying
environmental surveys and monitoring (mainly the biophysical environment) of selected roads
funded by USAID. The latter contract includes basic environmental training for ANE staff.
Occasionally, independent Mozambican consultants carry out periodic environmental audits of
selected road projects.  This is necessary as the engineering consultants supervising
construction contractors are sometimes preoccupied with the engineering considerations of the
project. The supervising consultants should be responsible for ensuring the implementation of
environmental mitigation measures during the road construction phase. A part of the problem
is that contracts either lack specific requirements for environmental compliance or are too
general in nature. The use of environmental consultants to carry out environmental audits
provides a "distance" between the consultant and contractor with respect to environmental
monitoring and enforcement.
In summary, the private sector collectively has a broad range of skills and experience. Its
capacity is limited by several factors:
o the number of in-house staff is still relatively small;
o a large majority of the "in-house" staff of the companies are Mozambicans trained in
Mozambique with limited experience in EIAs;
o local companies are usually limited to a particular specialisations either the biological and
physical areas or the socio-economic area; and
o only two companies have in-house experience skills and experience with respect to
environmental assessments related to roads.
14.3.4    Building Capacity
With greater decentralisation, the private sector will assume an ever-increasing role in
environmental monitoring and enforcement in Mozambique. Capacity building of skills and
experience is essential to ensure that the private sector keeps pace with the demands placed on
it.

Private sector capacity building can be achieved through short and longer-term training
courses.
i   Short term training courses
There are many courses offered both within Africa and overseas which are appropriate to the
needs of staff working in private environmental consulting companies. Below are just some
examples of short courses run in South Africa, all of which would be of value to selected
environmental staff in the private sector in Mozambique:
University of Capetown
Principles of Environmental Management: Theory & Practice (two weeks)
University of Pretoria
Social Impact Assessment (three days)
University of Pietermaritzburg (All five days)
Project Planning and Evaluation
Integrated Environmental Management
Environmental Law
Environmental Policy Analysis
Environmental Ethics
Problem Structuring Techniques and Systems Thinking for Complex Environmental Problems
Resource and Environmental Economics
ii   Medium to long-term courses
Generally speaking Masters-level courses usually take two years to complete though there are
some accelerated courses which only require one year of intensive study. There are no post-
graduate environmental courses, or any other courses at post-graduate level, available within
Mozambique and it is necessary to register with an outside university to gain such
qualifications. Such a course would require at least the theoretical component to be completed
outside Mozambique. It is often possible that the practical component can be completed within
Mozambique.
Scholarships to attend both short and longer-term training courses are currently offered in
Mozambique though on an ad-hoc basis. In most cases it is up to the company concerned to
make approaches to particular donors for support.
In summary, there is a need for capacity building within the private sector in Mozambique.
The process would be hastened by a formal scholarship scheme that involves the widespread
advertising and award of a specified number of scholarships to staff of local Mozambican-
registered environmental companies, for both short and long-term training. The actual form of
the training approved should be based on the actual needs of the applicants.

15 CONCLUSIONS
15.1 SUMMARY OF THE TOR
This project had broad terms of reference (ToR). A summary of the ToR was presented in Part
A, Section 1.3 of this document. This summary was used to present the report's conclusions.
Each of the key requirements of the ToR is presented below in italics followed by the
conclusions reached from the investigations and analyses completed for this study.
i   identify environmental (biological, physical, and social) characteristics relevant for
road maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading projects within Mozambique. Where
possible the country is to be subdivided into zones of similar ecological or social
characteristics
This was a major output for the project. A description of the environment of Mozambique was
developed in three parts, socio-economic, physical and biological. Detailed descriptions were
provided in Annexures B, C and D to this report while these were presented in summary form
in Part C.
Mozambique contains a varied physical and biological environment from mountain areas in the
west and north of the country to mangrove forests and coral reefs along the coast. Eight
regions were identified as "areas of special concern" for physical or environmental reasons.
There is some uniformity in socio-economic characteristics across the country. A majority of
the population is categorised as poor with a significant minority classed as very poor. Some
variation exists across the Country.  Three provinces, Tete, Sofala and Inhambane are
significantly poorer than the rest of the country.
The variation in environmental conditions is not correlated between issues. It was not possible
to subdivide or characterise the Country into zones or regions with similar characteristics.
ii   provide comprehensive environmental assessments for the Phase I roads proposed for
funding by the World Bank. Principal environmental issues associated with other Phase I
sub-projects are to be identified
Initial Environmental Evaluations were completed for 15 sub-projects of Phase I. Seven of
these sub-projects were for the EN 1, the main north-south road link. The other sub-projects
involve primary, secondary and tertiary roads. One of the secondary roads serves what is
probably the most isolated District capital in Mozambique, the town of Chinde.
A range of environmental issues was identified and used for the evaluation of sub-projects,
both the World Bank sub-projects and the other Phase I sub-projects. The environmental
issues used to evaluate each road sub-project were:
u Biological and Physical Impacts
- Ecology
- Land Use Change

- Erosion and Sedimentation
- Water Quality
- Hydrology
- Noise and Vibration
- Air Quality
- Aesthetics
o  Socio-economic Impacts
- Direct impacts
- Access to Services (health, education)
- Improved Access to Markets
- In-migration of People or Induced Settlement
-  Health, in particular HIV/AIDS
- Archaeology and Cultural
Investigations for the World Bank sub-projects found some potential for environmental impact
for each issue. The degree of this potential varied among the projects. To mitigate these
effects a range of environmental management measures were developed and environmental
management guidelines presented. There were no environmental impacts identified that could
not be effectively managed. The sub-projects are located within existing road corridors and
there was no necessity identified for resettlement along any road. The overall conclusion was
that these sub-projects could proceed with no resultant significant adverse effects.
Screening guidelines were developed for other periodic maintenance and rehabilitation
projects. These considered the range of environmental assessment issues developed for the
World Bank sub-projects and identified five primary issues against which other road projects
could be screened.
The application of the screening methodology to a sample of 24 projects identified the
necessity for a hierarchy of environmental assessment. The screening analysis used the
information compiled for the description of environmental characteristics (discussed in the
next ToR point). Four of the projects were considered to have a potential for significant
adverse effects and were categorised as being of special concern. Ten roads were considered
to have a potential for some adverse effects while no significant effects were noted for the
remainder.
The screening methodology was considered a reasonable method of broad scale comparative
evaluation of road projects. Categorisation of a road as "of special concern" does not mean it
should not be built. It is more an alert to a decision maker that there are potentially significant
environmental issues that would need resolution. The screening process is further discusses
under ToR requirement (v), later in this Chapter.
iii   develop guidelines for the environmental management of individual projects. These
guidelines are to be relevant for all phases of the Roads Program
Environmental management guidelines (EMG) for road periodic maintenance or rehabilitation
projects were developed principally from the investigations undertaken for the World Bank
sub-projects. The guidelines are applicable to any periodic maintenance or rehabilitation

project and are intended for use throughout the ROADS3 Program. An outline of the EMG
was presented in Part D of this report.
The aim of the EMG section of study was to produce guidelines that have a practical field
application. An approach was adopted that considered road maintenance or rehabilitation
projects as a series of defined activities. Possible environmental impacts for each activity were
identified together with mitigation measures and responsibility for implementation. A more
detailed EMG document was prepared as a separate output from this study. The EMG have
two functions:
o to provide a resource base for ANE to use in the environmental management of projects;
and
o to provide clear, enforceable instructions to contractors regarding their responsibility for
environmental issues.
The EMG describes practical means to ensure effective implementation of mitigation
measures. It is intended that the EMG be a live document with management instructions
updated to suit field experience. The adoption of an approach based on activity and work
instruction rather than area of the environment will facilitate the ease of updating.
A basic contract condition for any road project will be the requirement that a contractor
prepare an environmental management plan (EMP) specific to the road project. The EMP will
indicate how the environmental management guidelines and any specific project requirements
will be incorporated into the project.
iv   propose monitoring procedures, mechanisms, staff, training, equipment and resources
to ensure that the environmental factors relevant for works undertaken under the Roads
Program are implemented
An assessment of the capacity of ANE to implement and monitor environmental requirements
for road projects was undertaken. ANE has a fledgling social and environmental unit under the
title of "Gender, Poverty Alleviation, and Environment Unit". The general area of the
environment was recently added to the unit's responsibility. The unit is stronger in the area of
social studies a fact which reflects its origins.
The development of the unit into a section with a broader environmental capability is
proposed. The unit would have the responsibility for determining the level of environmental
assessment required for all of ANE's work and also ensuring the work is completed to an
appropriate standard. This does not mean that the unit undertakes all the work but that it has
responsibility for ensuring its quality. This can be achieved by adopting an audit and review
role for the environmental assessment or management of a project.
The broader environmental needs of ANE were also assessed as ANE's environmental
capability will need to extend beyond the unit. This requires personnel such as Delegates and
field engineers or technicians to have, as a minimum, some understanding of environmental
issues.
Resourcing, training and budget needs were identified and described.

v    ensure that proper guidelines, procedures, information flows and capacities related to
environmental matters are put in place at the project development stage.
This area of the ToR is covered in part by the conclusions presented under areas (iii) and (iv)
discussed above. A methodology was also proposed for the initial review and guidance of a
project through the environmental assessment process. This consisted of:
o an overview of the legislative requirements for environmental impact assessment in
Mozambique (EIA);
o  a screening method, similar to that used for the non World Bank projects in Phase I;
o  an initial assessment pro-forma to assist in determining the necessary level of
environmental impact assessment for a project;
o where an EIA is required under Mozambique legislation an outline of the process; and
o where no EIA is required under Mozambique legislation recommendations for the
procedures that ANE should follow.
A three stage process was proposed to determine the level of environmental assessment
necessary for road projects:
1. The first stage was a screening level analysis of proposed projects as part of the selection
process to identify roads that should be considered for funding. This level of analysis
could be similar to the analysis completed in the evaluation of the ROADS3 Program. The
function of that analysis was to identify any significant environmental issues associated
with a project. If the potential for significant impacts is identified it does not mean that the
project should not be considered. It is more an alert to the decision maker that significant
issues may be associated with the road.
2. After roads have been selected for further design and environmental investigations there
are two possibilities, either the road clearly falls within the definition of works requiring an
EIA under Mozambican legislation or it does not. Under the first situation an EIA must be
prepared in accordance with the legislation.
3. Under the second situation it must be determined if a project has a potential to cause
significant environmental harm. To enable this determination a pre-assessment procedure
was developed for use by ANE. The procedure allows ANE to make a decision about the
potential for a project to cause environmental harm. This then enables the required level of
environmental assessment to be determined.
15.2 BENEFITS AND COSTS
The benefits of the completion of sub-projects under the ROADS3 Program are the
achievement of the Government's objectives for the roads sector. These were summarised in
Chapter 1 as to:
o complete the restoration of traffic on the classified roads network;
o continue to expand the rehabilitation of high volume roads and ensure their maintenance;
and
o prioritise the use of local resources and the employment of modern and efficient planning
and control systems.

For people living in proximity to the project roads the program also has benefits of improving
access to both services and markets. This is particularly important for sub-projects undertaken
on tertiary and secondary roads.
The costs of the program are:
u the actual construction costs;
u environmental costs. There were no significant impacts identified for the project provided
the environmental management guidelines were implemented; and
o costs of development and training for ANE personnel. These were discussed in Chapter
12.
The actual costs of implementing the environmental guidelines for a road project were not
estimated. Provided these were incorporated into the project design and tender contract then
these costs would not significantly vary tendered prices. The real additional cost arises from
the monitoring and enforcement of these conditions.  These costs are reflected in the
development and training costs for ANE.
